0,MartinHafer,It's more the cinematography than the plot that make this film stand out from most others,9,11 December 2006,"This might just be John Ford's most famous Western film, though right off the top of my head, I actually liked all of his so-called ""cavalry trilogy"" films even more. It's still an excellent film and is well worth your time.The single best aspect of this film is the cinematography. In this respect, it is exquisite--a true work of art with color film. While more modern films do have color that is a bit more realistic, no film (other than Ford's SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON) can come close to equaling the gorgeous and ""better than life"" landscapes. Through the use of filters and choosing the best times to film, there are several amazing scenes that just can't be equaled--such as the opening scene where the lady opens the door and looks out at an oncoming John Wayne. The shot is framed beautifully and evokes a gasp at the colors and perfection of the shot. Also, throughout the film, there are so many different camera shots in wide variety of conditions--from dry and dusty to rainy to showy--like a wonderful tapestry of the West.Now as for the rest of the film, the plot is amazingly simple, but still manages to engage the viewer. While this film doesn't have the very best John Wayne performance, it is among his better ones and is, in my opinion, better than his much acclaimed role in RED RIVER. Wayne is tough and mean and pretty unlikable throughout the film, but he also shows some change and growth as a character. In a way, I actually would have liked it if Wayne HADN'T changed--this would have made a very, very powerful ending--leaving a couple interesting possibilities (such as his killing his niece or being killed by Jeffrey Hunter's character to stop him). The other characters are fine in the film and it's nice to see that most of the Indians in the film really are Indians (a trademark of most Ford Westerns).An excellent film, but there are still other Ford Westerns and a few non-Ford Westerns that surpass it (such as THE BIG COUNTRY). Well worth a look.",The Searchers
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Rich, complex and massive, yet somewhat misunderstood",10,12 July 2010,"While I am not the biggest fan of the Western genre, I appreciate a great deal of films from the genre. The Searchers is one of them. It is complex, it is rich and it is quite massive. Yet I think it is somewhat misunderstood too. Why do I say that? Well just reading some of the comments on here pretty much says it all. Comments accusing the film of being racist, of the main character being unlikeable, of the film being dated, John Wayne being too old and being slow and confusing.First of all, I don't think the film is racist at all. I see I am not the first person to write this, but The Searchers is more ABOUT racism if anything. And most of this comes from the protagonist Ethan Edwards, who is completely different to not only to what the audience expects but to any other character John Wayne has ever played. There are several actions that Edwards commits throughout the film that do shock us and something that we don't expect a main character or any character to do.But that is the thing. There have been complaints of Ethan Edwards being unlikeable, unorthodox and such. My impression was that he was MEANT to be. Ethan Edwards above all else is an anti-hero, a rootless pioneer and forever framed in the doorways of family homesteads of which he can never become part. John Wayne admittedly has been in a few clunkers in his career, as has every actor and actress in existence, but he has also done some good ones, such as Fort Apache, The Shootist and of course this film. While he pulled off great performances in those movies, being delicate in Fort Apache and poignant in The Shootist, he plays his grittiest, most complex and richest character I think in The Searchers. And his performance is absolutely brilliant, arguably his best, and no I don't think he was too old for the role, there have been actors who have pulled off great performances regardless of their age.I don't think this film is dated either. The cinematography is beautiful and inventive, and the scenery is well and truly spectacular. Monument Valley especially looks simply magnificent, I have read that like the film it is massive and unmissable, and whoever said that are right I think.Whether it is slow and confusing is open to interpretation and dependent on whether this is your thing, which I imagine is the case with some people. First with the slow complaint, admittedly it isn't the fastest moving movie in the world, yet it maintained my attention. I'll list two or so movies that were more pedestrian than this one- The Green Berets and Torn Curtain, though the latter was decent actually. The plot isn't confusing for me, it is rich and complex like the characters, but it was interesting with themes of revenge and reconciliation. It may ramble a bit in the middle half I agree, but I accepted that was how it was meant to be.That's not the whole story though. The score is majestic and haunting, giving real weight to the film, and the writing is very strong. John Ford's direction is masterful, immediately taking grasp of the story, its themes and the characters and merging them into one adeptly. The characters are rich, complex and developed well, while the other acting is very good. Jeffrey Hunter gives a solid performance as Edwards's conscience, and Vera Miles is pretty good too. As is Natalie Wood, the same Natalie Wood who played an adorable little girl in Miracle on 34th Street and a beautiful woman in West Side Story and Splendour in the Grass, while Ward Bond is intriguing and Hank Worden brings a more light-hearted touch to the proceedings. And the ending? Brilliant!Overall, a brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Searchers
2,bkoganbing,"""We Be Texicans""",10,11 January 2006,"If John Wayne was ever cornered about what his favorite movie role was he'd be answering Ethan Edwards in The Searchers. Proof of that is obvious, he named his son by his third marriage John Ethan Wayne. Ethan Edwards takes his time in returning home to Texas from the Civil War to the home of his brother and his family. But soon after he does the family is massacred in an Indian raid. The two young daughters are taken prisoner and Wayne with Jeffrey Hunter and Harry Carey, Jr. go off in search of them. Carey is killed early on, but Wayne and Hunter go on for years, both driven men for different reasons.Ethan Edwards is probably the most racist man Wayne ever portrayed on the screen, yet we feel sympathy for him at the same time. It's been a hard and bitter life on the frontier for him. Just as it's been for the Indians as well. Chief Scar, played by Henry Brandon, is Wayne's opposite number and he makes clear what he thinks of whites. Two of his sons were killed and he's going to take many white scalps in reprisal. My guess is that Ethan Edwards war service involved him seeing the war of desolation waged by William T. Sherman in the deep South. Small wonder he goes out and starts killing buffalo with a maniacal intensity that Wayne never showed before or since in film. Not an aspect that is normally brought out by reviewers.Wayne's relationship with Jeffrey Hunter is a strange one. He found Hunter as a toddler during a raid on a wagon train. Hunter is a distant cousin of the Edwards family and one eighth Cherokee. But to Wayne he's an Indian. He gains a grudging respect for him on the trail though. But Hunter's there to stop him. The oldest Edwards daughter is discovered dead early on. That by the way is an intense scene where Wayne's facial expressions register more than pages of dialog. Wayne had one of the great faces for close-ups and John Ford well knew it.The younger daughter has grown up and is played grown up by Natalie Wood. Wayne feels he has to avenge some family code of honor because Wood's been taken as a bride by Henry Brandon. Hunter just wants his cousin back on any terms. John Ford as he always does, gets some good comedy relief of the broad kind in the film. Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles who is Harry Carey's sister have a thing going, but when she doesn't hear from him she almost ups and marries Ken Curtis. Hunter and Curtis's confrontation is pretty funny.Ford also probably made his best use of Monument Valley in this film. Though Stagecoach and Fort Apache are also among his best photographed films, The Searchers being in color is in a class by itself. Proof of that is the scene at the Edwards home at twilight just before the Indian raid. Beautiful and terrifying at the same time.Ward Bond has a great role as Reverend/Captain Samuel Clayton, parson and Texas Ranger at the same time. A difficult job for some to reconcile, but I'm sure Bond believes that conversion of the Indians is not uppermost on his mind. Bond also has some great blustering comic moments with Patrick Wayne who plays an earnest young army lieutenant.The Searchers is usually found on just about every top ten list of best westerns ever made and it surely belongs there.",The Searchers
3,Leofwine_draca,Well-regarded western classic,8,28 December 2016,"John Ford's well-regarded western is a classic for a reason: it's very well made indeed. Finely shot, finely acted, and with a plot that keeps on giving, THE SEARCHERS is perhaps the pinnacle of the director's career and certainly one of John Wayne's best films as well as acting performances. Here, he tones down the swagger a little, delivering a finely-turned turn as the former Confederate soldier who gets embroiled in a hunt for a missing girl.THE SEARCHERS is difficult to fault as a film. The running time is lengthy but you end up savouring every moment. The bright photography brings Monument Valley to life in a special way. The supporting cast is exemplary, from old-timers like Ward Bond to newcomers like Natalie Wood. There isn't a great deal of stock action here, but nonetheless the film has a sense of drive and urgency to it, a momentum that keeps it carrying on and on. I dare anyone to find fault with it.",The Searchers
4,SnoopyStyle,Best Western of All Times,10,20 September 2013,"This is the greatest western of all times. It opens as Martha opens the door to reveal the grand majesty of Monument Valley. And the movie ends with John Wayne in the frame as the door closes on him. It is both beautiful and symbolic.Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returns from the Civil War to the Texas ranch of his brother. When the Comanche attacked his brother, his nieces Debbie (Natalie/Lana Wood) and Lucy are taken prisoners. Ethan then leads a posse to rescue his nieces. But as the years pass and his hatred for the Indians grows, Ethan and Martin are on an extended odyssey to chase down the Comanche responsible. It's questionable whether Ethan's going to rescue Debbie or kill her.This is an iconic John Ford vision. John Wayne has the power to create a callous hate-filled man. He calls his nephew who's 1/4 Cherokee 'Blankethead'. He shots a dead Indian in his eyes so he must wander the earth blind forever. He is truly a harden man. As with most westerns of the day, there is some overacting and melodrama. The comedy is broad. But all that is to be expected. What makes this great is John Ford's directions, and John Wayne's performance.",The Searchers
5,Hitchcoc,"It's John Ford, Man",10,19 February 2019,"Western's aren't always my cup of tea. But this is John Ford and it wouldn't matter if he were filming baking shows, there are few who can manipulate a camera or a closeup like he cold. Add to that, all time Western heroic actor, John Wayne, in perhaps his finest role. and you have a masterpiece. First of all, the plot is much more sophisticated than most of their generation. It is a rescue mission, but it has as its center a character that may not wish to be rescued. Wayne has a hard edge and he knows what he wants and he goes for it. For me, this is the best John Ford Western.",The Searchers
6,Prismark10,The Searchers,7,7 June 2015,"The Searchers has been lauded by critics and filmmakers. Martin Scorsese has championed this film for years. A film that should be watched at different stages of your life. So I took his counsel and watched it again some decades after I first viewed it.John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards returning home to Texas after the civil war to his brother's house. He has newly minted money and maybe some dark secrets which is never explored.In these opening scenes he gazes lovingly at his brother's wife and she also sees him as a lost love. Is this the reason why he has returned? Is this the reason for his hatred of the Comanches who massacred the family after a raid and take two of his nieces as prisoners. Could one of the niece be his actual daughter?Initially Ethan, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) the part Indian who grew up with the Edwards family; and Brad Jorgensen (Harry Carey Jr) from the neighbouring family. All go off in search of two girls. Brad dies early on and Ethan finds the body of the eldest daughter Debbie. Ethan and Martin go on searching for years for the younger daughter. Martin fearing that once Ethan finds her he will kill her for becoming a Comanche.The man they want is Scar another driven man who lost two of his sons and will take scalps of the white man as revenge. Yet Scar also has a code of honour. Ethan and Martin when they find the now grown up Debbie discover that she has been well cared for although taken as a bride by Scar.Legendary director John Ford shoots the film in Monument Valley but the film is set in Texas. It has some great framing of shots which has been instrumental to other filmmakers, it is wonderfully lit and some good use of music.There is also some sporadic comic relief. This has been done through some side characters which pop up in the film. Martin accidentally marries an Indian woman.Martin's girlfriend Laurie Jorgensen (Vera Miles) who after some years decides to marry another hick Charlie McCorry which leads to a punch up as Martin coincidentally returns home on her wedding day.The film is not without criticism. It is too long. The Laurie/Charlie romance side plot should had been excised. It is hard to take seriously.Although it is hinted that Ethan may had done some bad deeds before he returned home, it is never explored. Ethan wants to kill his niece for going native but again it is not explained why he changed his mind.We are left with that iconic final frame. Once the niece returns home in the arms of the Jorgensens, Martin reuniting with Laurie, there is no space for Ethan in the household. He is back to being a loner, an outsider.",The Searchers
7,kosmasp,Found,9,22 July 2007,"What John Wayne delivers here, is incredible. I think people who'd still criticize him, after seeing this movie, can't be serious. Or have a strong hatred/antipathy against John Wayne! Because as far as the story goes, it does rely almost completely on Waynes shoulders! Of course there are other actors here too, but all gravitate around Waynes performance! As this is a Ford movie, there are of course beautiful shots to be found here too. Especially the beginning of the movie, has been copied quite a few times, because it's so great! The monument valley shots again, the sky/clouds, just about everything, is great! Although more of a Drama than an action movie, it still is one of the best westerns ever made!",The Searchers
8,classicsoncall,"""Yes sir, he'll be right in your lap in a minute, Sonny.""",8,24 August 2005,"I'm having a bit of trouble here, perhaps it comes from reading other viewers' posts of ""The Searchers"" before adding my own. For those who categorically claim this film to be the best Western of all time, I need point to such efforts as ""High Noon"", ""Shane"", ""Unforgiven"", ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"", ""The Wild Bunch"", and even ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". That's not to say that ""The Searchers"" is not right up there among them, but among them is as far as I will go, and that doesn't mean the ""best"".Though I have been educated by some of the reviews as well, and will have to view the film again to pick up the nuances director John Ford spiced this movie with. Subtle is the relationship between Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and his sister in law Martha (Dorothy Jordan). But right from the beginning, Ethan's hatred of Indians is palpable, as he virtually ignores his ""nephew"" Martin (Jeffrey Hunter), taken in by Ethan's brother Aaron (Walter Coy) and Martha after his parents were massacred. After all, Martin is one eighth Cherokee, and that condemns him to being less of a man, if at all.Admittedly, I was stunned to view John Wayne's portrayal of Ethan as a hothead, virtually out of control at times and most evident as he wildly fires away at a herd of buffalo if it means depriving some Indians of food and clothing. So when Ethan first encounters his niece Debbie, captured by a Comanche raiding party, it's a shock to realize that he's not out to save her, but to kill her for becoming contaminated by heathens. At this point, your standard movie conventions fall away, and you're left asking yourself what sort of warped reasoning leads you to betray your own flesh and blood for an event in their life that was beyond their control.Martin Pawley has a tough time balancing the dichotomy in ""Uncle"" Ethan's character, and is at his finest when risking his own neck to protect his ""sister"" Debbie, and knowing Ethan's mastery of guns and his fists, that's no mean feat. Martin has a balancing act of his own though, as he tries to prepare his sweetheart Laurie (Vera Miles) for a bump in their relationship, namely his unwitting purchase of an Indian squaw for a wife. Laurie in turn, aiming to avoid spinsterhood, agrees to marry Charlie McCorry (Ken Curtis, I swear he's unrecognizable in his early roles). The fisticuffs between Charlie and Martin are presented for both comic relief and a serious settlement for Laurie's hand, and on each count it scores well.Impressive is Ward Bond's supporting effort here as both a reverend and a military captain played in turn as the situation warrants. It's his most colorful role that I've witnessed, far outpacing the generally one dimensional characters he's usually called upon to portray. It's also a role that helps lend counterpoint to Wayne's bloodthirsty hatred that gives the film it's dramatic tension. The pairing of the two in a non buddy buddy relationship is refreshing and dramatic at the same time.Set amid the towering spires of Monument Valley, a favored locale for John Ford's Westerns, ""The Searchers"" is rich in vivid color and gorgeous cinematography. John Wayne admits to his favorite role status for character Ethan Edwards, so from that perspective, the film deserves it's reputation as one of his best. Still, I'll have to withhold judgment on ""The Searchers"" as the best Western ever made; for me it ranks behind the ones mentioned earlier. As for John Wayne's own filmography, I'd have to go with ""The Shootist"" as my own personal favorite.",The Searchers
9,gavin6942,"John Ford and John Wayne, Together",7,23 December 2010,"As a Civil War veteran (John Wayne) spends years searching for a young niece (Natalie Wood) captured by Indians, his motivation becomes increasingly questionable.I hate to say it, but I just was not thrilled by this picture. I like John Ford, and thought John Wayne was great in ""Stagecoach"", but here I was more ambivalent. Wayne just seems to me to be a one note actor... he is the rugged man with the distinct voice. I find his range very disappointing. I am excited that Natalie Wood was here, though, as she always lights up a picture.I would like to see the film again, though not very soon... I want to look for the innuendo and such, to see if i can find the deeper subtext of the story... that might give it the depth I felt it was lacking.",The Searchers
10,jboothmillard,The Searchers,8,8 January 2011,"From director John Ford (My Darling Clementine, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance), this is probably the most well known of his westerns, and being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I wasn't going to miss it. Basically ex-Confederate soldier Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) has returned to his home in Texas from the Civil War to reunite with brother Aaron (Walter Coy), his young Debbie Edwards (Lana Wood) and his nephew Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter). Soon the reunion is interrupted by the raid of the Comanche Indians led by Chief Cicatriz - Scar (Henry Brandon), they start a fire in the shack house, killing Aaron, his wife Martha (Dorothy Jordan), and their son Ben (Robert Lyden), while Debbie and her older sister Lucy (Pippa Scott) are abducted. With nephew Martin, who has Indian heritage, they set out on long journey lasting a year, going across desert land, through chasms, and surrounded by cactus and rocks, to find the two girls. As time goes by however Martin realises that Ethan's hatred for the Indians is much stronger than he first thought, so much so that he almost doesn't care what happens to anyone else in the search. Grown up a little more, adolescent Debbie (Natalie Wood) is living as one of Scar's wives, and when Ethan finds this out, he would rather see her dead than part of the Indian culture. Ethan tries to kill her, but Martin stops him and Ethan gets hit with a poison arrow, before they escape and return home, and after a final attack on the Indians, and saving Debbie, Ethan closes the cabin door walking away. Also starring Vera Miles as Laurie Jorgensen, Ward Bond as Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnston Clayton, John Qualen as Lars Jorgensen, Olive Carey as Mrs. Jorgensen, Ken Curtis as Charlie McCorry and Harry Carey Jr. as Brad Jorgensen. Wayne is fantastic as the strained cowboy with a very harsh attitude, he played it so well because it meant so much to him, so much so that he named his son after his character. The story is reasonable to understand most of, action sequences are very watchable, the music by Max Steiner is really good, and the landscapes are very effective, it is certainly a must see classic western. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 69 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 37 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies. Very good!",The Searchers
11,ccthemovieman-1,An Involving Western Tale,9,17 February 2008,"Okay, I was wrong about this film. I saw it once, thought it was ""fair"" at best, and then dismissed it for a number of years. One thing I did remember: the great color scenery featuring Monument Valley, so when this DVD became available for a free look, I took it home and looked at it again. I was so impressed, I bought the disc.It's not only the Monument Valley scenery that is so pretty, but other scenes as well. Director John Ford did a nice job with this; a very nice job. Better, the story is very good.The story is an involving one that's tough to put down once you've started. It's the simple story of crabby old man (John Wayne) and his nephew (Jeffrey Hunter) and a few others (for awhile) going the distance to track down a little girl who was kidnapped by Indians. By the time she is discovered, she's a young woman (Natalie Wood). My favorite character in the movie is ""Mose,"" played wonderfully by Hank Worden. Now, when I reflect on this film, I think of good 'ole ""Mose."" I think he gives some uniqueness to the film.",The Searchers
12,rmax304823,Thirtieth Thoughts,8,17 April 2001,"Just finished seeing this (in letterbox) for about the thirtieth time and some observations raise themselves. First, that it must have been Ford's most impressive use of Monument Valley. The photography itself is superb. Second, the performances are decidedly mixed. Vera Miles was out of her league. So is Natalie Wood. ""Unt-meah,"" indeed. And what is Henry Brandon doing as a blue-eyed Indian? Qualen adopts the Scandinavian accent that he is familiar with but which is uncalled for. Wayne, with one or two exceptions, has never been better. Third, the plot, brimming with potential, isn't what it should be. The transition of Ethan Edwards from rescuer to murderer is pretty well done; but his conversion at the end is a cop out. Nothing that has come before his sweeping Deborah up in his arms has even hinted that he would do anything other than kill her. Fourth, the scene in the cantina, from the time the searchers see Ol' Moses' mule until they leave, is an unimpeachable gem. Not a second is wasted. It combines almost miraculously the comedic with the practical. It should be shown over and over in film schools. In essence, what happens is that Hunter is at a table eating. Wayne walks in, tells him that he has a lead on Scar, and they leave the room together. But Ford breathes life into the simple scene. Hunter is not only eating; he's eating tortillas and calls for ""mas frijoles"" from ""Mamacita."" Meanwhile, a girl in Spanish dress is swirling around him, clacking a pair of castanets. Hunter ignores here. Wayne comes in to deliver his message, sniffs the cup Hunter has been drinking from, and splashes the contents into a fire, which blazes up with a whoosh. A dull scene rendered full of life. The last shot, of Wayne framed in a darkened doorway, is justifiably famous, although it would have been not much more than an artsy effect if the door had not swung -- so quickly, so irredeemably -- closed on him. Finally, the film is definitely a transition piece. Ford's last film that could be called great. Not that later works of his didn't have their touches, especially The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. This movie is outstanding, by any measure, yet one can see the beginnings of Ford's decline in particular scenes. A kind of creeping childishness that recalls Jacque's speech about a second infancy in WS's Twelfth Night, or was it another? I don't want to take the time to look it up. What got into Ford to have Vera Miles egging on Charlie and Martin while they are having a fist fight over her? Why does Wayne seem sorrowful when he announces ""Look""'s death, when he's been a racist all along and she has been no more to him than an excuse to twit Martin? And here we have the appearance of ""Bad Chuck"" Roberson. And another dance, with Olive Carey overacting. And yet -- Moments are unforgettable. No one but Ford would have thought of them. The shadow of Wayne's hat brim falling over his darkened eyes as he glares at the ""white"" recently liberated captives. His anguished look as he wipes the sweat from his horse's back and the others ride off to save his family. And the unforgettable first and last shots of Wayne. Ford has complained that the music sounds like the background for a movie about cossaks. Yes, but brass tinkles aside, the theme is Lorene, a song popular on both sides during the Civil War, and it belongs. As The Searchers does to Ford's ouvre. He should have quit at that point. Or relaxed and not tried so hard to deal with difficult issues. He could have made and remade Donovan's Reef and we all might have enjoyed it.",The Searchers
13,Tweekums,One of the greatest westerns,10,7 September 2017,"Ethan Edwards returns to his brother's home in Texas some years after leaving to fight for the Confederacy. Shortly afterwards there is a report that Comanches have stolen the cattle from a neighbouring farm. Ethan, along with his step nephew Martin Pawley, join the posse leaving Ethan's brother, his wife, son and two daughters behind. It becomes apparent that the theft was a distraction. By the time they get back it is too late; Ethan's nieces. Lucy and Debbie, have been kidnapped and the rest of the family massacred. Ethan, Martin, Lucy's fiancé Brad, and a posse of rangers set off after them but opinions on what how to proceed soon differ. Eventually the posse turns back leaving Ethan, Martin and Brad following on their own. After Lucy's body is found Brad charges headlong into the Comanche camp and is killed. Years pass but Ethan and Martin refuse to give up and Martin starts to worry about what Ethan plans to do when he finds Debbie.This is rightly considered one of the greatest examples of the Western genre. The story is relatively simple but that is not a problem. It is very much about the characters, particularly that of Ethan Edwards. As the film progresses his resolve to find Debbie never diminishes but as time passes it becomes apparent that he would rather see her dead than living with the Comanche and ultimately believes that she will have become a Comanche herself. The story is presented in a very effective way; the two most disturbing moments occur off screen, these are the aftermath of the massacre at the family home and the details of Lucy's death. The latter is particularly effective; as at first we just know that Ethan has seen something that shocked him to the core as he travelled alone through a canyon; it is only later that we learn that he discovered Lucy's body and then it is strongly implied that she was also raped. While there are quite a few dark moments there are also plenty of moments of good unforced humour. John Wayne is on top form as Ethan Edwards; the character is in many ways unsympathetic, he certainly has racist attitudes towards the native population even before the events at the start of the film, but Wayne's performance stops him being unlikable. Jeffrey Hunter also impresses as Martin Pawley, a far less cynical character. Director John Ford does a brilliant job capturing the vast almost uninhabited American West with much of the action shot in the spectacular Monument Valley. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; if you are a fan of westerns or classic cinema then it is a must see.",The Searchers

15,moonspinner55,"Vast, expansive western without enough feeling for the intricate details",7,18 March 2007,"Angry loner John Wayne, a veteran of the Civil War, leads embittered search for his young niece, kidnapped by Indians after her family was slaughtered. Influential John Ford-directed western features meticulously designed production and vivid cinematography (copied for years), but is weighed down by a stilted screenplay, occasionally wooden acting, and disappointing or slackly-handled passages. Ford pays far more attention to the grand scheme of the picture's design than he does to the smaller details, which may be a reason why the performances are so uneven. As for the Duke, he pretty much plays himself--not a John Wayne caricature, but close--though his reassuring presence is enough to elevate this scenario. Ford seems to have desired an inherent savagery in his narrative, and indeed the threat of the early Indian attack is harrowing, but Wayne's vengeance doesn't feel so much rage-induced or reckless as it does standard. Despite salty asides and cockeyed characters, ""The Searchers"" rides a well-trodden path. *** from ****",The Searchers
16,Quinoa1984,One of the best Westerns ever filmed is also my favorite of Ford's and Wayne's careers,10,15 July 2000,"Although not as much of an expert on the careers of John Ford and John Wayne (while wanting to see more of Ford's work, not very enthusiastic about Wayne despite being the star that he was), Ford's film The Searchers is an exceptional piece of cinema that even as appeal past being just a western with the typical 'cowboys and Indians' riding around. There's a real crisis of the conscience and the spirit that Wayne's character has to face as he goes on his search for the girl he once knew taken away from him. If Westerns can- and do- take any story with its dramatic and moral implications and put them in another light, the Searchers is one of the best examples of that. It almost becomes an Odyssey for Wayne here, despite a word of protest from his fellow travelers. It's also fantastic entertainment and drama, with Ford creating a great atmosphere in another of his many Monument Valley pictures. The final five minutes are also some of the most memorable in any film, with that final shot analyzed by many critics and viewers over the years. Many homagers and imitators since, few equaled.

17,wes-connors,Dark Reflections on the Golden West,8,14 July 2010,"After serving in the US Civil War, Confederate soldier John Wayne (as Ethan Edwards) arrives at the Texas home of his only living relatives. Unfortunately for the family of his brother, Mr. Wayne brings monumental trouble. He mysteriously produces newly-minted coins and clashes with adopted nephew Jeffrey Hunter (as Martin ""Marty"" Pawley). Wayne considers the handsome youth a ""half-breed"" due to Mr. Hunter being one-eighth Cherokee. Still, he takes Hunter out to investigate a Comanche rustling incident. This turns out to be a wild goose chase... Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the Native American Indians slaughter, scalp, and likely rape the absent men's family. Apparently, only the ten-year ""Debbie"" survives, to be raised as a Comanche squaw...A good impression is made by chief Henry Brandon (as Scar) and Antonio Moreno (a star from the 1920s) has his final featured role.Wayne, with Hunter close at hand, spends the rest of the film seeking revenge, and Wayne wants the return of his little niece before her virtue is compromised. Watching ""The Searchers"" look for the Comanche Indians is an ordinary, but well-photographed, story - but watching John Ford and John Wayne search for the American West through their racist hero's eyes is something else entirely. The comic ""touches"" are a little too much to take - possibly, ""blanket head"" Hunter and Vera Miles are supposed to be young teenagers. But, when you look at the film as Americana, and in context with Ford's work, you have something exemplary. Ford and Wayne don't find ""Debbie"" or Mr. Brandon's ""Scar"" as much as they find a lens, and we see their reflections.******** The Searchers (3/13/56) John Ford ~ John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Henry Brandon",The Searchers

19,sunwarrior13,John Wayne's Best Performance,10,27 October 2012,"If John Ford is the greatest Western director, The Searchers is arguably his greatest film, at once a grand outdoor spectacle like such Ford classics as She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande and a film about one man's troubling moral codes, a big-screen adventure of the 1950s that anticipated the complex themes and characters that would dominate the 1970's.A favorite film of some of the world's greatest filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, it has earned its place in the legacy of great American films for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most notably, it's the definitive role for John Wayne as an icon of the classic Western as the hero or antihero who must stand alone according to the unwritten code of the West. It was based on the 1954 novel by Alan Le May, and set during the Texas–Indian Wars. Jeffrey Hunter,Vera Miles,Ward Bond and Natalie Wood co-star to play key supporting roles.Ethan Edwards is a former Confederate soldier who returns to his brother Aaron's frontier cabin three years after the end of the Civil War. Ethan still has his rebel uniform and weapons, a large stash of Yankee gold, and no explanations as to where he's been since Lee's surrender. A loner not comfortable in the bosom of his family, Ethan also harbors a bitter hatred of Indians and trusts no one but himself. Ethan and Martin Pawley ,Aaron's adopted son, join a makeshift band of Texas Rangers fending off an assault by renegade Comanches. Before they can run off the Indians, several homes are attacked, and Ethan returns to discover his brother and sister-in-law dead and their two daughters kidnapped. While they soon learn that one of the girls is dead, the other, Debbie, is still alive, and with obsessive determination, Ethan and Martin spend the next five years in a relentless search for Debbie and for Scar, the fearsome Comanche chief who abducted her. But while Martin wants to save his sister and bring her home, Ethan seems primarily motivated by his hatred of the Comanches; it's hard to say if he wants to rescue Debbie or murder the girl who has lived with Indians too long to be considered ""white."" This film is a mature, dark, ambivalent piece that helped pave the way for the modern western.John Wayne gives perhaps his finest performance in a role that predated screen antiheroes of the 1970's by the film's conclusion, his single-minded obsession seems less like heroism and more like madness.He bravely refuses to soft-pedal Ethan's ugly side, and the result is a remarkable portrait of a man incapable of answering to anyone but himself, who ultimately has more in common with his despised Indians than with his more ""civilized"" brethren. In addition to that,through the central image of the frontier, the meeting point of wilderness and civilization, Ford explores the divisions of our national character, with its search for order and its need for violence, its spirit of community and its quest for independence. This is undeniably one of the greatest Westerns ever made.",The Searchers

21,hitchcockthelegend,What makes a man to wander?,10,4 February 2009,"Upon returning from a trip out to find cattle thieves, Ethan Edwards finds his brother and sister-in-law murdered by Comanches and their two daughters missing. Driven by a hatred of Indians, and a motive of some determination, Edwards and his part Indian companion set off to find the missing girls - it's a perilous journey that will span many years.The Searchers is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, in fact it's one of the finest pictures all told ever made. Its reputation as such is most definitely warranted, directed and photographed with almost peerless precision, The Searchers stands tall as a triumph of cinematic achievement. Plot wise the piece is really very basic, based on a novel by Alan LeMay, its revenge/hatred driven pursuit theme is one that will forever be trundled out to gather easy Hollywood coin, but with director John Ford pulling the strings on this picture, this is cloaked with a beauty that belies the bleakness of the main protagonist's driving force. As a character driven picture it's something of a flag bearing lesson for all other directors to make note of, for the thematic heart of it lays with Ethan Edwards (superbly played by John Wayne), an embittered man that incredibly, in spite of his evident bile, manages to keep the viewer from hating him due to the complexities of his make up and the surrounding sprawl of the American West.The film is bookended by brilliant shots from open doorways, with both sequences impacting to almost steal the breath away, yet these are merely the crusts of an incredibly delicious sandwich. Many scenes here could be framed as pictures to define the classic Western, with Ford making the Monument Valley location one of the best Western characters to have ever graced the screen. Rolling hills and dusty odd shaped rocks are given impetus by scorching reds and oranges that themselves are aided by the everlasting fold of a vividly potent blue sky, all of it dwarfing the characters as Ford adroitly weaves the Civilization versus Wilderness thread. This is a film that positively begs repeat viewings, where each subsequent viewing brings further insights into character dissections and a lyrical lesson in racial indifference, all played out with almost hauntingly poignancy by Max Steiner's memorable score.Back in the day the film never won any awards, presumably because the racist core of the film had many twitching in their beds, or maybe because the film doesn't rely on dialogue to make its points? (the body language and facial acting here is quite brilliant). Perhaps some just wanted a basic Western of shoot outs and shallow characters that barely have time to show some heart? Either way, what we do now know is that The Searchers is revered across the globe and often hits the best of lists formed by those with a very keen interest in cinema. Maybe it's only one for those willing to invest and observe it on numerous occasions? I am of course but a mere mortal film fan for sure, but really I feel this film is as good an experience as a film fan could have, technically and thematically the piece has few peers, it's a true American masterpiece. 10/10",The Searchers
22,Theo Robertson,I Kinda Figured This Film Ain`t That Good,5,19 June 2003,"I know John Ford is one of the highly regarded directors in Hollywood history and that the western is one of the most popular and enduring genres but I`ve always found Ford an overrated director and the fact that westerns owe a huge debt to him and his "" A man`s gotta do what a man`s gotta do "" ethos is one of the reasons why I hate the whole concept of Hollywood westerns , they`re ridiculously romanticised and mythical and have no real bearing on reality .THE SEARCHERS is regarded as Ford`s best film but unless you`re a fan of Ford`s work or of the western genre you won`t be very impressed . The colour cinematography is good ( Check out the twilight scene of the homestead ) but the incidental music hits you over the head with its intrusiveness . The story is character driven and since it deals with an obsessed racist it might have been good in theory but as soon as Ford cast John Wayne as anti-hero Ethan Edwards it dealt the film a fatal blow , it`s impossible to think of John Wayne as anyone other than John Wayne . If Ford had cast Robert Mitchum in the role or even better James Stewart this could have been a very good film indeed . Alas it`s a tedious one due to Wayne`s bad performance , especially when Ethan tells his nephew and Brad the fate of Lucy : "" What`d you want me to do ? Draw you a picture . Don`t ever ask me . As long as you live don`t ever ask me more "" . And doesn`t that dialogue sound bad . Did people in mid 19th century America say "" What`s so mighty fishy about this trail "" ? or "" Ain`t figured you for a half breed "" ? I don`t think they did",The Searchers

When Ethan says ""Put and Amen to it."" at the Funeral that's a Heavy Antithesis to those that are ""Gathering at the river"", and in the First Half of the Search He does seem truly Obsessed with Committing a ""Mercy Killing"".

John Wayne leads in this classic story of a man whose family are murdered/kidnapped by Comanches and of his subsequent search for his family and for vengeance. Jeffery Hunter plays his nephew ""Martin"" with considerable skill and emotion and Ward Bond is another who knows how to get the best from Frank Nugent's screenplay. The plaudits that have since been paid to Wayne and to John Ford are well deserved.

It's another of those films which one has heard about for years, its title often used in the same sentence as 'masterpiece' which means it has a lot to live up to. Interestingly it has also been compared to another alleged masterpiece Vertigo and I have trouble substantiating the claim in either case.

29,Boba_Fett1138,Mostly great but I still have some big problems with it.,8,25 July 2010,"This movie is widely being regarded as a classic within its genre and while it is mostly great, it's certainly not a movie that is without its flaws.What makes this movie special above all things is that it's not really being a typical western. It has a quite great simple, effective main premise, that provide the movie with some original and awesome moments. It's strange but the movie at times doesn't even feel like a western, since it often takes a different, more realistic approach and is not being set in a town, with a couple of gunslingers taking on the local sheriff, or anything of that sort. It's a good old Indian versus cowboy story, that often more has the typical elements of a revenge flick than a western. All that it's missing is Charlie Bronson in it.Perhaps then the acting of the movie would had also been more acceptable. Because now, I'm sorry to say, the acting is mostly being horrible. It really took me out of the movie at times. In some movies John Wayne is simply good and in his element, while in others he often showed that he wasn't the most capable actor around. He was never really known for his acting skills but he was and still is an western icon nevertheless. And I can honestly say that I actually like him in most of his movies but in this one his performance was just not acceptable. The rest of the cast also acts in a very old fashioned way, you would perhaps normally expect to see in a '30's picture. Needless to say that the acting was one of the biggest problems I had with this movie.But also its story doesn't always flow to well. It actually is only a below 2 hours short movie but it all feels much longer, perhaps because there is so much happening in the movie and characters keep popping up in it. There are still also really some slower moments in the story but above all things I also felt that the story didn't got told too well. The movie never ever gives you the sense and feeling that they have been riding around for years, trying to find the Indian tribe, who captured the young niece of the John Wayne character and killed the rest of her family. It more feels like days, perhaps even only hours at times. The movie also doesn't really capture any emotions, other than that of being a tough and fearless guy, who can stand up for himself and can handle a problem or two. The movie is perhaps too heroic, which goes at the expense of basically every other credible emotion of the story.It's such a shame, since everything else about the story was simply just great. I wish I could say that this was a perfect genre classic but to me it simply wasn't. The movie had too many inconsistencies and flaws in it for that.An element that the movie benefits greatly from is its look. It's a full color western and they really used it to the max. The movie is beautiful looking with its environments and great camera-work, that has an eye for everything surrounding the story and characters. Cinematographer Winton C. Hoch was one of the best, early people in the industry that worked with full color technology. He won 3 Oscar's in his career for it, plus a special technical achievement award, earlier in his career. He did not won one for this movie though.Overall a real great and also original movie but its flaws really prevent it from being a classic in my book.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Searchers
30,oscaralbert,This over-rated flick is more racist than BIRTH OF A NATION . . .,7,4 February 2016,". . . or GONE WITH THE WIND (with which it shares score composer Max Steiner). John Wayne's son Patrick (Lt. Greenhill) claims in an introduction that some White Geezer Group once listed THE SEARCHERS among the Top 100 Movies of All Time. Yeah, Patrick, and Time Magazine once selected Adolph Hitler as its ""Man of the Year"" (True Fact--Wiki it for yourself). Notable Real Life Bigot Pops Wayne is perfectly cast as a hateful gunman who shifts from murdering Abe Lincoln's Angels-of-Freedom-for-Black-Slaves in the early 1860s to being a self-appointed Genocidal Maniac against Native Americans by the end of that decade. He's also Hell-bent upon slaughtering America's National Mammal--the buffalo--in a spiteful effort to force U.S. citizens onto a debilitating diet of his Texas ranch's fatty McCattle. When an esteemed Comanche War Chief (who's lost all his sons to White Predators, such as Wayne's character) elevates Wayne's niece to a position of Native American Royalty as his fourth wife, Wayne scalps Debbie's husband of five years, waving the barbaric bloody souvenir before the dethroned Indian Princess's face (foreshadowing what his Texas descendants made Mrs. Kennedy do with President JFK's skull parts nearly 100 years later; I'm not aware that it's been proved whether Mr. Wayne was shooting over the Grassy Knoll). Wayne's character is so loathsome that he performs this mutilation while awaiting extradition to his state capital for shooting three White small businessmen in the back and then robbing their corpses! Probably the only part of this flick that Wayne enjoyed more than that was shooting dead Comanche Warriors multiple times in their faces (this was another of ""Il Duce's"" ideas of a ""fair fight!"").",The Searchers

However, I do understand the film's importance and see why it's revered as a major (maybe THE major) contribution to its genre.John Ford was the Douglas Sirk of westerns. He made films that on a casual glance were straightforward and stayed within the confines of their generic conventions. But on closer reading, it's clear that Ford was calling into question many of those established conventions and criticizing the attitudes of the very people he made movies for. ""The Searchers"" called into question the bad guys vs. good guys dichotomy so taken for granted in most westerns. Who are the good and bad guys when everyone shares the same blood and culture? Those who cling to their prejudices and old ways become obsolete; civilization adapts to changing times and moves forward, while those who can't or won't keep up are left behind. Nothing conveys that theme better than the film's famous final image, John Wayne's character framed against the doorway of a home that has no place for him, until the door closes, leaving him alone with his wilderness.The film's a little long, and the screenplay rambles a bit, but there's a good reason this film appears on the syllabi of film classes everywhere.Grade: A",The Searchers

The photography is excellent and adds greatly to this John Ford masterpiece with many old time veteran actors like Ward Bond, Vera Miles and many more great supporting actors.

38,JamesHitchcock,Unsparing look at the Old West,8,15 January 2011,"Ethan Edwards, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, returns to the home of his brother Aaron in a remote part of northern Texas. Shortly afterwards the homestead is raided by Comanche Indians and Aaron, his wife and his son are killed. His two daughters Lucy and Debbie are abducted, but Lucy is murdered shortly afterwards. The rest of the film deals with Ethan's obsessive search, together with his adoptive nephew Martin, for Debbie, his last surviving blood relative.A common theme in Westerns was the fraught relationship between Native Americans and white settlers. Many of the earlier examples had presented this relationship in a biased, one-sided and sometimes frankly racist manner (""Whites good, Indians bad""), and indeed John Ford himself had sometimes been guilty of such stereotyping, as in ""Rio Grande"", the last instalment in his ""cavalry trilogy"". By the mid-1950s, however, things were starting to change. ""Broken Arrow"" from 1950 had been a seminal Western which gave equal prominence to white and Indian characters and showed that there were men of goodwill, as well as men of violence, on both sides of the racial divide. Robert Aldrich's ""Apache"" from four years later went even further, by replacing the old racial certainties with new ones in which the Indians are the innocent victims and whites the villains.In ""The Searchers"" Ford takes a deeper look at racial issues. It is unsparing in its analysis of the nature of white racism, but it does not idealise the Native Americans in the way in which they were idealised in ""Apache"", or the ""good Indians"" were idealised in ""Broken Arrow"". Ethan has a deep loathing for all Native Americans, especially the Comanche, which is only partially explained by the massacre of his family. Yet he also has no love for the US Government; having given his allegiance to the Confederacy he refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of US rule over Texas. Living in an arid area of west Texas, many hundreds of miles from the nearest plantation, it is unlikely that he ever had any real interest in the slavery question, but his loyalty to the Confederate cause doubtless arose out of his deep-seated contempt for all non-white races.Ethan's original aim is to rescue Debbie from captivity, but over the years that aim changes. His search lasts several years and he eventually learns that Debbie, now a teenager, has been adopted into the tribe and has become the wife of a Comanche warrior named Scar. To Ethan any white woman who has sexual relations with an Indian man is irredeemably tainted, and the idea that his own niece is in this position is an insupportable stain on what he sees as his honour. He therefore decides to kill her in order to redeem his honour, Unlike Aldrich's, however, Ford's vision is not simply ""Indians good, Whites bad"". Even Ethan can be shocked by the behaviour of his own people, as when he and Martin come across the Indian victims of a massacre perpetrated by American soldiers, and as we have seen the Indians are also capable of acts of brutality. Martin, who is horrified by the idea of killing Debbie, whom he regards as a sister, is more liberal than Ethan, although there are limits to his liberalism. His idea is that Debbie must be returned to what he sees as ""civilisation"", even when she has made it clear that she would much rather remain with the Comanche. (""The Unforgiven"" from five years later dealt with the opposite situation, in which an Indian girl would rather stay with the white family who have adopted her than return to her own people; both films were adapted from books by the same novelist, Alan Le May).Part of the myth which has grown up around John Wayne is the idea that he only ever played clean-cut, morally upright, all-American heroes. In fact, his range as an actor was rather wider than that, and the obsessively racist Ethan is in many ways deeply unsympathetic, although some of his qualities, such as his physical courage and his dogged determination, command our respect. This is one of the most complex roles Wayne played, and he gives one of his best performances, to rank alongside the likes of ""Stagecoach"" and ""The Shootist"". He later named one of his sons Ethan after the character he plays here.When ""The Searchers"" came out in 1956, although it was a commercial success, it did not receive a single Academy Award nomination- an example of the Academy's notorious prejudice against the Western genre at this time. Today, however, it is frequently cited not only as one of the greatest Westerns of all time but also as one of the greatest movies of all time. Martin Scorsese is one of a number of directors who holds it in particularly high esteem.Personally, I would not rate it as my all-time favourite film, or even my favourite Western. As in other films, like ""Cheyenne Autumn"", Ford allows his main serious theme to be slowed down by unnecessary subplots and misguided attempts at humour. I am thinking in particular of the romantic subplot about Martin's love for Laurie, the daughter of a neighbouring rancher, and the rather patronising treatment of the simpleton ""Old Mose"" and Martin's Indian wife ""Look"". (He calls her that as he is unable to pronounce her real name).Nevertheless, ""The Searchers"" is still in many ways a fine movie, partly for Wayne's acting, partly for the striking photography of the Western landscapes and powerful way in which Ford treats his main theme when he does not allow himself to be sidetracked. He always had the ability to compose a memorable image, and this talent is well demonstrated in this film, the final shot of Wayne framed in a doorway being perhaps the most famous example. If this is not my all-time favourite Western, it would nevertheless come somewhere in my top twenty. 8/10",The Searchers
39,blanbrn,A classic. Your typical cowboys- chiefs flick. Maybe Wayne's best film ever.,9,25 June 2007,"Big John always delivers especially in his most famous genre the western. This 1956 film ""The Searchers"" is indeed a classic with all the fine elements of the old west like cowboys fighting chiefs, love, the desert, betrayal, shootouts, and humor along with tolerance from Big John himself. Wayne works here again with director John Ford and both capture the frontier of the old west. Wayne is stubborn, tough and a loner as after his Confederate solider days, he has to set out to rescue his niece after his brother and entire family are massacred by Comanches. The story then is blended in with typical western elements of shootouts, chases, and searches for love and endurance and patience is tested. The scenes shown are beautiful and gorgeous especially of the old west and the one very memorable scene of Wayne on horseback during the snowstorm. In then end as always big John stands proud and completes his mission and journey. As often said by John's character in this film ""that will be the day"" that's right today and forever on this film is a classic it's watchable anytime.

40,MovieAddict2016,"Not really a western, just a character examination masked as one",9,27 May 2005,"""The Searchers"" from 1956 has inspired a legacy of motion pictures (namely ""Taxi Driver,"" which screenwriter Paul Schrader admittedly ""borrowed"" material for) and continues to be discussed today. In '56 its ending was somewhat clear, but subtle enough that naive viewers didn't really give it much thought; now, in an era where most motion pictures link to deeper subtext, viewers and especially critics see other things in this film.John Wayne stars as a Civil War veteran whose niece is kidnapped by Indians. He begins a long and arduous search for the girl that completely controls his life.The tagline is pretty eerie: ""he had to find her...he had to find her."" It really touches on the absolute obsession of Wayne's character -- he doesn't just want to find her, he MUST! The ending implies a great many things. Much has been written about it, and I'd put my own comments here but it would no doubt ruin the film for readers who haven't seen it.Suffice to say, this is one of Ford's very best and I don't think I've seen a more caustic and gritty performance from Wayne before.",The Searchers

This is one of those films.It is one of Waynes best, but no wonder. With excellent direction by John Ford & yet another trip to the Monument Valley (he had been there before in She Wore A Yellow Ribbon among others), this trip is the most remembered one. There is an excellent cast of co-stars to back him up too.It is interesting how Wayne is a hero here, yet how his character makes major decisions about what to do without emotion. That is what makes this performance stand out for him. His character does the same thing later when he decides to shoot Liberty Valence for John Ford, but in that one his emotions boil over. In this film, when he makes a seemingly cruel decision, the emotions stay in check.When you watch this film for the first time, it does give you a sense of awe & surprise. That is what makes this a great film.",The Searchers
42,lasttimeisaw,Ford and Wayne's masterpiece at their peak!,8,17 November 2014,"Viably the most well-known Ford-Wayne vehicle to contemporary audiences and my second entry into Ford's prolific canon, after the lukewarm African sappy adventure MOGAMBO (1953, 6/10), THE SEARCHERS gradually acquires the prestigious status to be a paragon in the American Western genre while being critically misconstrued by most critics as another routine Ford-Wayne collaboration at the time of its release, and time does its justice in its own manner. It is magnificently shot in VistaVision's widescreen and the topography of Monument Valley is faithfully captured by Ford's acute intuition of visual compositions and DP Winton C. Hoch's coherent expertise to reconstruct an awe-inspiring wild old west with expansive scale. Nevertheless, it is a vehemently racist story to be invented on the screen, Wayne is Ethan Edwards, a Civil War veteran, engages a years-long search for his abducted niece Debbie (played by Lana and Natalie Wood sisters in different ages), whose family has been murdered and torched while herself has been taken by a Comanche group lead by a man named Scar (Brandon). Together alongside him, is Martin Pawley (Hunter), the half-breed orphan first rescued by Ethan and reared by Debbie's family. Their odyssey is rife with collisions between these two, Ethan's hatred and anger towards the Comanche tribe is abominably brunt, so the duelling conflict is not only to rescue Debbie, but they are also running against time, since Ethan clearly expresses his resolution to kill her if she has been assimilated and become one of them. The slaughtering and killing scenes are all off-screen, and it is Ford's sleight-of-hand to elevate the ominous atmosphere of something bad is going to happen with a helping hand from Max Steiner's abounding but emotive score, no blood is shed on the screen, but you will anticipate the emotional upheaval with perfect tempo. Back at the homestead, the five-year-span spoils the patience of Martin's longtime sweetheart Laurie (Miles), who decides to marry herself off to Charlie McCorry (a drolly and heavily accented Ken Curtis), on the wedding night, return Ethan and Martin, a light farce ensues with fist fights and strife, it is the episodic scattering of Americana comedy which Ford adeptly infuses between the taut tension. So is the comical running gag when Martin unwittingly buys himself a squaw bride ""Look"" (Archuletta) in exchange of a hat, it is equally ridiculous and provocative, the race gap is so appalling that it is beyond any reconciliation under any circumstance, which may dissuade many viewers of young generations. Frankly speaking, as an oriental myself, I find it difficult to identify with the moral yardstick of white people at that time, it is a common defect deeply rooted in the American Western soils, its outrageous racist overtone is too glaring to discard. That's why Spaghetti western is much closer to my appetite. As intolerable as usual, Wayne's Ethan is a pain in the neck, racist temperament aside, he is a vain loner, a headstrong killer with a poisoned mind, one might feel ambivalent toward him, but overtly it is Wayne's most dexterous performance, and the most archetypal one of his entire career. Jeffrey Hunter, as the co-leader hogging almost the same screen-time as Wayne, brings about a more approachable presence in the quasi-father-son relationship, he is the one we can easily connect with, although with a less stimulating thrust. Miles is the girl with a strong will, who is never too shy to manifest her affection, Bond's Rev. Capt. Clayton, embodies both the larger-than-life foolhardiness and the rustic swagger which is an usual staple among side characters. Finally a young Natalie Wood barely has time to tell us what has happened to her character other than a delicate trophy to arouse the final suspense. One cannot deny what a masterpiece the film is for the sake of its sublime craftsmanship, however, is it a timeless classic? The question mark is hanging there, at least for the new waves of audience who is oblivious of that begone epoch, the genre itself becomes irrelevant and unfamiliar in our universe, let alone its passé prejudice and willful obduracy. It becomes a legacy to preserve but hard to find the resonance now.",The Searchers
43,Red-Barracuda,There are good things here but it pulls it's punches too much,6,4 December 2013,"This John Ford western is about an ex Confederate called Ethan Edwards who has a hatred of Indians. One day he goes out with a posse to ward off a tribe of Comanches. It's a trap though, as while they are away their homestead is attacked by the Indians and everyone is killed but for the two daughters who are abducted. The older one is soon left dead, clearly after being sexually assaulted, leaving the younger one Debbie in the hands of the Comanches. Edwards heads off with his nephew - who is of Indian descent - to search for the surviving girl.This is a western that has a huge reputation behind it. It is regarded as one of the all-time classics of the genre. And while I can see good things in it, I personally don't consider it one of my favourites. The main aspect about The Searchers that is cited as influential is the central character. The fact that he is so bitter and twisted, with such questionable morals meant that he qualified as an anti-hero. Westerns hadn't really had characters like this in the central roles before. His overt racism meant that The Searchers was able to explore darker territory surrounding the culture clash of the Old West and for this reason is regarded as one of the first revisionist westerns. John Wayne gives maybe his best performance here as Edwards, a man almost insane with bitterness; he seems more driven by his hatred of the Comanches than for Debbie's welfare, even to the extent that he is willing to kill her rather than leave her in her new home.All of this is well and good but I think the problem I have with it all is that the Searchers ultimately pulls its punches and lessens its impact with out-of-place comedy and romance. An example of the former is the ending, where everything is resolved in a Hollywood fashion despite the fact that the build-up indicates that Debbie is unwilling to return to 'civilisation' and risks being killed by Edwards as a result of it. The resolution doesn't feel true to the material and undermines what has gone before somewhat. The romantic sub-plot involving Edwards nephew and the several other comedy side characters also give the film a more traditional feel, which goes against the material. These issues I mention are probably due to Hollywood expectations of the time but they do effect the film overall and it would have been good if they had at least been toned down a bit.One thing about The Searchers that cannot be denied though is its great cinematography. Monument Valley in particular is captured in all its glory. So it is a pretty handsome looking picture that's for sure. It's also of note for the memorable appearance of a very young Natalie Wood as Debbie the girl the searchers look for.",The Searchers

45,Lejink,"Big, good John...",7,16 April 2009,"Hailed by many as the best Western ever to come out of Hollywood, my recent re-viewing of it doesn't quite accord with that but still comes up with appreciation and admiration. (Anyway, my vote for best Western goes to another Ford classic ""My Darling Clementine"").I'm no fan of John Wayne, although a lot of that has to do with my perception of the man behind the actor, but he's unquestionably superb here and while he doesn't seem to do anything too differently to what he always did, namely be sincere and ornery by turns, somehow there's an extra conviction that director Ford seems to extract from him on this occasion which carries the whole film.His grudge against the Commanche Indians is realistically conveyed, so well in fact that you wonder just for a second what he's going to do when he at last corners the escaping captive Debbie, played by a bright-eyed but accent-confused young Natalie Wood before he humanely caves in, at the film's climactic moment. The rest of the acting is patchier - I'd give kudos to Jeffrey Hunter in the ever-changing role of Wayne's young sidekick (c.f. Montgomery Clift, Ricky Nelson, Glen Campbell and even on-board here Harry Carey Jr amongst others) who grows into his part convincingly, Ward Bond as the crusty preacher/marshal, Hank Worden as the eccentric loon-cum-oracle Mose and Henry Brandon as the nemesis Indian Chief Scar who effectively conveys menace in near-silence. On the debit side, I found the young Vera Miles too shrill in her gee-shucks role as the lovelorn older daughter and let me say that Ken Curtis as the guitar-wielding hayseed country bumpkin Charlie has the slowest, most aggravating drawl of a voice I've ever heard.Director Ford was near his peak here, as ever making great use of his familiar and oft-used locations, with some wonderful lighting effects and occasional massive close-ups which seem to pre-date Leone's work in the 60's. Best of all are the wonderful framing shots he employs from interior to exterior, which not only start and of course famously finish the movie but also are regularly inserted throughout the piece. It hardly needs saying that the door-closing epilogue as Wayne the outsider turns away from the family gathering inside back to his solitary life on the road is as beautiful and poetic as any film could hope to deliver, never mind the respectful Harry Carey overtones.What didn't work for me though were the supposed humorous interludes, which for me detract overmuch from the tension of the chase, but maybe I just don't get Southern humour.Nevertheless, it's hard to complain too much about such a grand film. Was Big John ever better in any other film? That'll be the day!",The Searchers
46,ElMaruecan82,Getting the whole character's 'moral ambiguity' point is not the key to appreciate the film ...,7,17 December 2011,"After so many years I spent puzzling myself about my appreciation of John Ford's ""The Searchers"", a sort of psychological introspective search mirroring Ethan Edwards' quest, I think I can finally say 'Eureka'. This film that has been voted #1 on the American Film Institute's Top 10 Westerns is the quintessential Western on the surface, and I don't mean that negatively. But ""The Searchers"" works on so many levels of thrills and escapism that I'm surprised by the amounts of people who praise it for its so-called psychological dimension and ambiguity of its central character, Ethan Edwards, played by the iconic John Wayne.I think I should get to the point quickly before someone guns me without summation: as a Western, ""The Searchers"" provides all the elements expected, the beautiful and vast landscapes, Monument Valley transcended by a dazzling cinematography never looked so photogenic, the battles, the chases, the lonely hero, a climactic shootout, everything to spend a great moment in the theater after having watched the last 'Tom and Jerry' Cartoon and one ad or two about the tasty flavor of a cigarette as quick on the draw as Wayne's trigger. In other words, ""The Searchers"" is as great an entertainment as ""Star Wars"" for the Sci-Fi genre, and I accept that as an objective fact, and since John Ford is among the film-makers that I most respect, I won't object that the success and popularity of the film is not deserved.However, I believe the film has been somewhat taken as an intellectual hostage to those who only praise the portrayal of Ethan Edwards, the first anti-heroic character played by John Wayne. The limits of this assumption is the way it indirectly takes out of consideration all the previous films made by Ford, and insists that this is the first one to feature characters with ambiguous moralities, when ironically, ""The Searchers"" is one Ford's less subtle film when it comes to depict the antagonism between Whites and Indians. The movie did so much to show the Comanches as bloodthirsty warriors that it's not Edwards shooting on a dead Indian's eyes that will make him less sympathetic than his fellow searchers. Edwards may have a personal business with the Indians but after what they did to his family, it's hard not to share his grief, regardless of what he does.So, if Ford really tried to go against the grain, the Indians should have been portrayed in a more sympathetic way and not acted as alibis for Edwards' cruelty. But I'm not blaming the movie for that, I mentioned the ambiance of the movie theaters in the 50's to better point out how this movie belongs to an era where everything was shown in a simplistic way, Whites were the respectable pioneers and Indians the natural antagonists to the Conquest of the West. ""The Searchers"" goes as far as showing the Indians as an invisible villain, whose cruelty is highlighted by the psychological effect on the kidnapped white women, and a sense of family made of borrowing or buying women. I hate political correctness but the other extreme is no better.The plot of ""The Searchers"" is also one of the most memorable, Edwards and Pawley, Jeffrey Hunter as Wayne's disciple, search the little Debbie, the only surviving member of their family after a savage farm attack, and the whole interrogation is on one motivation. While Pawley obviously wants his sister back, we're never sure about Edwards, because all his acts and words foreshadows the killing of Debbie because she became a squaw. Are we really to believe that the big Wayne will harm such a pretty little girl like Debbie, even if she's disguised as an Indian? Well, that'll be the day. I'm not even saying that the climax wasn't powerful, when he grabs, lifts and carries her before delivering the unforgettable ""Let's go home, Debbie"" isn't one of the most-defining moments of the Western genre, but did this really surprise anyone? ""The Searchers"" is probably the most blatant cases of over-analyzing, when the greatness seems to rely on John Wayne's character, while the film clearly established who the villains were, and who the hero was, and a flawed hero doesn't automatically make an antihero. On that level, I don't see the appeal of the film, and how it's this one that remained an inspiration for Martin Scorsese, and how Roger Ebert could have praised the guts of John Ford for ""The Searchers"" but wasn't sensitive for the much more controversial and thought-provoking ""High Noon"". ""The Searchers"" is a 'great' film but in the same league of greatness than ""Star Wars"", which doesn't hold a candle to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in terms of symbolism and meaningfulness. But I don't think John Ford tried to make something 'special' with ""The Searchers"", it's only of these westerns with a mission, a bad-ass hero, savage villains, and its share of romance and comedy.And this last point speaks for the traditional aspect of ""The Searchers"", a film which features all the archetypal characters of a good western film, the comic relief old-timer, the reverend, the cavalry, the idealistic young woman who waits for charming prince, a campy fight, that was as cringe-worthy as the phantom punch in ""The Godfather"", except that this one wasn't intentional. The director of ""Rio Bravo"", Howard Hawks, said that a good film consisted on three great scenes and no bad scene, well despite some obviously bad scenes notably with the character of the fat Indian wife and the part when Pawley violently kicks her off his place, right on the butt, ""The Searchers"" is still a good film, because on the surface, it's exactly what we would expect from a Western, but the whole 'psychological' dimension is something that even Ford would have dismissed.And unfortunately, after ""The Wild Bunch"", made only 13 years after, ""The Searchers"" looks, feels and sounds incredibly dated.",The Searchers
47,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Home on the range.,6,18 January 2021,"John Ford's classic western focuses on a bitter ex-confederate who embarks on a years long journey to find his niece after she's kidnapped by Comanches. Wayne's no-frills gunman already has a strong disliking for Native Americans (in fact, he's straight-up racist towards them), so his journey is motivated more by hatred and a desire for vengeance than it is by any real hope of rescue. However, this element of 'The Searchers (1956)' isn't included as a way to challenge the protagonist's closed-minded beliefs, it's just another one of his traits. Though he is sometimes challenged on his dangerous attitudes, he's ultimately presented as a bit of an unsung hero whose prejudice doesn't compromise his mission. The film at large portrays Native Americans in a pretty dodgy light. However, most Native American characters are portrayed by Native American actors and, aside from the views of its central character, the piece doesn't feel as though it's actively trying to be harmful. It's ignorant, but it isn't necessarily any more ignorant than many of the American westerns it follows. The picture, in general, is a bit slow. Though it has several fairly exciting action and suspense sequences, much of it is dedicated to a long-haul search that relies on the chemistry (or lack thereof) between its two most major characters. The flick is also fairly inconsistent when it comes to tone. It generally comes across as quite serious and, even, dark at times, but it also descends into bizarre comedy as it nears its third act. Having said all that, the affair is typically enjoyable. It's a solid, if somewhat old-fashioned, western. 6/10",The Searchers
48,gbill-74877,Horrible,3,29 November 2016,"This is an extraordinarily over-rated movie. The acting is uniformly terrible, and John Wayne is absolutely insufferable. The treatment of Native Americans is stereotypical, and they're shown to be inept, silly, and savage. Actions are routinely illogical and the attempts at comedy tossed in are poor. The story of Wayne's search for his kidnapped niece is straightforward, but the film gets painfully side-tracked with a love story and other goofiness.The only reason to watch this film is the cinematography. Director John Ford captures several absolutely gorgeous and iconic shots in Monument Valley, though he too often relies on the same rock formations in the background, stunning as they are. The scenes in deep snow and crossing an icy river are also fantastic, though it's odd how quickly we see shifts from arid desert to winter. Regardless, these are the ONLY good things about this movie.There are so many other things to hate. Wayne's mispronunciation of Comanche as ""Commanch"", his disparaging half-breeds, and his disdain for clearly traumatized women who were forced to live with Native Americans for years (Texas Ranger: ""It's hard to believe they're white"". Wayne: ""They're not white anymore.""). A blue-eyed Indian chief. The ridiculously accurate shooting. Wayne inexplicably thinking of shooting his niece when he finds her, since she doesn't want to return with him, despite years of searching for her. (Oh wait, that is explainable; he's racist and she's now ""one of them""). Lastly, I almost threw up in my mouth when Wayne sauntered off at the end. Perhaps that was triggered while also thinking of his real-life comments in a 1971 interview with Playboy Magazine:PLAYBOY: For years American Indians have played an important — if subordinate — role in your Westerns. Do you feel any empathy with them?WAYNE: I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them, if that's what you're asking.

51,secondtake,"Classic stuff, a gritty Wayne, a few little quirks...",8,25 February 2013,"The Searchers (1956)A reliable classic that is basically a hunt for some Indians who have kidnapped a white pioneer girl (after killing her family). Of course, that doesn't tell you about John Wayne's impeccable performance as the tough and angry ex-con out to settle the score. Or the stunning landscape of Monument Valley (John Ford's favorite, and practically his own, cinematically). Or the interwoven love stories (leaving the loner Wayne out completely). Or the sharp script, filled with witty and profound (at times) comebacks, but also with a believability. As extreme as some of the plot events are, this is all made plausible.In John Ford movies the protagonists are always good people. They might have flaws, or a past to consider, but they are deeply good to each other and to society as a whole. This is where John Wayne always fits in, because he's a tough moral voice. Here he is respected by everyone even as he suggests unconventional approaches to the problem. He also is relentless--one memorable line reveals this. He says that Indians chase or get chased for along time but they always reach a point where they believe it's enough and they stop. They don't (he says) have the concept of someone who never stops.Whether there's any truth to that doesn't matter. What Ford and Wayne establish is that this is a case of never giving up. And so the searching of the title goes on for many years, and Wayne will not stop. He seems to have acquired some money before arriving on the scene, so he can afford to just be on the chase all that time. It's kind of remarkable.It's also weirdly corny every now and then, on purpose. One of the younger characters might have a silly line, or the music once or twice even does a comic series of notes, almost as if from a bad television comedy. It's slightly disconcerting, but maybe Ford, like his opposite Alfred Hitchcock, wants everyone to know it's a constructed entertainment. It reminds you to not get too fully absorbed. I'm not sure this is the best thing in this case, but it's a small point overall.Is this the towering classic people say (or people who are inclined toward Westerns say)? In ways it is. I found the plot interesting and warm and impressive, but also a little the same from start to finish. After all, the whole movie is this ongoing search, with back and forth to the family left behind and the unrequited love. Still, it's well acted and you don't mind watching it all just happen. Wayne in particular is downright furious at times, and you wonder if he had some anger in life that was channeling.The big themes here for our times revolve around loyalty and racism. Much has been made of this, and Ford has been given more credit here than I might go along with--it's the original novel, based on true-life facts from before the Civil War--but it is the crux of this. That is, there is a point when Wayne's character turns against the white woman he's been trying to rescue because he feels she's gone commanche. There are some holes even in this simplest approach--for example, why does he not realize until he sees her that she's been raised in a Native American culture for four years? Did it never occur to him otherwise? And then there is the sudden and completely unexplained final turn, again, the other way. It's dramatic stuff, for sure, but as the basis of a serious movie about a social theme it's unsupported.No, it's better to see this movie as a bit of masterful shooting and editing, of storytelling with a camera, of acting for a 1950s widescreen style that's becoming something even removed, because of higher polish, from classic Hollywood. Wayne is in a role similar to what made him famous in the 1939 John Ford uber-Western, ""Stagecoach,"" where he is likewise a minor fugitive with a good heart that the local sheriff likes personally and has to depend on for the safety of ordinary folk. This isn't time-worn stuff if you can look for differences and subtlety, but I'm sure some people see this Western--or others like it--and think they's seen it before. For really broader ideas of the genre you have to go to ""High Noon"" and ""Johnny Guitar"" and ""Destry Rides Again,"" keeping in a roughly 17 year period. This is at its core a John Wayne/John Ford Western with some gritty stuff going on, and as such it doesn't let you down.",The Searchers
52,Bored_Dragon,Overrated,6,22 July 2018,"Just after watching this movie I run onto the newest list of Top 50 Movies of All Times. This one takes 7th place and Wild Bunch is not on the list at all. Screw that list. The movie is not bad, but it has a tendency to bore a bit. Nice story, solidly made and that's it.6/10",The Searchers
53,ironhorse_iv,The ultimate western,9,5 March 2013,"John Ford's The Searchers is my favorite all-time western. To even further appreciate this masterpiece one must read Alan Le May's novel by the same name on which this movie is based. If you do, you will appreciate certain details which John Ford made sure to recreate on the screen, and most importantly you will get a better understanding of the time line. It is truly amazing how Ford managed to fit so many years into two hours without losing too much. John Ford use of scenery and character development was unsurpassed. It just has everything. The movie opens with a door framing shot on the Edwards homestead. The shot shows the loneliness and isolation of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returning home from the civil war. Over dinner, we learn that he'd always been a ""loner"" since his brother was married to the woman he loved, and the ""cause"" he fought for in the Civil War lost, but he refused to surrender. While out on patrol, the Edwards homestead was attack by Native Americans. The scene with Ethan Edward coming home to see the death and the burn ruins of the home is sheer brilliance and was the last straw he had with the Comanche tribe. He notice that his niece Debbie was capture by them, and force to be a wife to its leader, Scar. He wasn't going to allow that. He goes to rescue the girl, spending years searching for her, his motivation becomes increasingly questionable and dark. John Wayne as Ethan Edwards was the subtle darkest character he ever played. He had a serious hated for Indians, which the book made clear and the movie less so. If you pay very close attention when Debbie (Natalie Wood) is hiding out by the Tombstone, you can just make out the writing. It shows why Ethan is borderline racist. A lot of people might point that that the movie might be a bit racist due to Ethan's hatred of anything Native American. This is not a racist movie. In fact, Ford examines the extremity of racism by the whites against the Native Americans during this period. In fact, there was a lot of interracial hatred in Texas and the West. Still, nearly all of the violence and hatred in the film is by the whites. The film questions the racist attitude they had at the time towards the American natives, epitomized by Wayne's character, but still Ford had attempted to justify mass murder for revenge in the film. Hence the dry run at the Academy Awards. John Ford's purpose in making The Searchers wasn't to make a statement about the horrible treatment and oppression of Native Americans. It was to tell a good story. The Searchers, is in fact one of the biggest complex, multi-layered films to come out of the Hollywood studio system. The photography and film subtext is legendary. The Searchers was filmed in VistaVision, and movies made in VistaVision look so much better today when restored than other forms of film-making at the time. Watch it on Blu-ray which has breathtaking cinematography of Monument Valley in its best. The setting in Monument Valley was made for westerns. The ending of The Searchers is great, without a doubt. Arguably one of the greatest scenes in the history of movies. Ford says everything without words. This scene is simply perfect show and tell. There are so many analysis of what happen to Ethan Edward in the final minutes that raise questions. When Duke John Wayne holds his arm, it was tribute to his hero, Harry Carey, who was a star of silent western films. Harry Carey often did what Duke did in the last scene of The Searchers. Still there are a bit of silly, such in the case in the letters being read by Vera Miles in the cabin on the large wooden bench. Those parts dragged a little. I thought the fight scene at the end was a little hokey. The editing isn't that great and some of the props were obviously 70 years ahead of their time. The movie didn't get the critical acclaim when it came out. It wasn't until the 1970s that The Searchers came to serious critical acclaim, too late for Ford but not Wayne. Taxi Driver, Star Wars, and Godfather was inspired by the technique of this film. That's saying something.",The Searchers
54,kenjha,Simply Spectacular,10,29 December 2010,"After the Civil War, a man searches for his niece, kidnapped by Indians. Wayne gives the performance of his career as a loner driven by his intense hatred of Indians. He is well supported by Hunter, Miles, and Bond. The vivid Technicolor cinematography is simply spectacular, with Monument Valley looking more beautiful than in any other Ford film. While the stereotypical characterization of the Indians as savages is regrettable, the other characters are well drawn, conveying information through small gestures. This is a highly engrossing adventure yarn, with a good bit of comedy sprinkled in. The director once said, ""My name is John Ford and I make Westerns."" He certainly did.",The Searchers
55,sol-,My brief review of the film,9,30 October 2005,"A well directed western with a number of spectacular sequences and strong ideas at hand, it is often regarded as John Ford's best western. As good as it is, I am not sure though if I can agree with such a charge myself. There are too many awkward bits of comic relief and it is severely lacking in a sense of time. The plot is also lacking in certain areas, such as the motivations of the Amerindians. It is a great film though, even if not perfect, with excellent locations, superb lighting choices and many well-composed shots against the western backdrop. The music is fitting and the theme song is a perfect choice for the themes of the film. It has some interesting ideas about vengeance, morality and loyalty in the times of the Old West. Some of these issues are better developed than others, but it is all there, reflected in the characters' emotions. If I was to analyse the film deeper, I am sure that I would find some scenes that would have been better left deleted, but also, I am sure I would find some depth where I may have not looked before. This is a solid piece of work, and very admirable, even if its fervent acclaim is a bit baffling.",The Searchers
56,tomgillespie2002,Entertaining western in the classic Hollywood mode,10,24 June 2011,"Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) is an outsider; a wanderer after the Confederate wars were lost by the south. Arriving back at his brothers ranch in Texas , three years after the end of the civil, Ethan is later dismayed by the systematic killing of his brothers family and the kidnapping of his young niece, Debbie, by the Comanche. Ethan enters a 5 year odyssey to find his niece. He later discovers that she has become ""one of them"". Ethan hates them ""Injuns"". His plan now is to find Debbie and kill her; It's better that she dies than to live as a Comanche. His total, racist hatred towards the Indians is palpable throughout the film.There's no disputing John Ford's film making virtuosity in this 'classic' Hollywood western. The outsider nature of Wayne's character is highlighted in the mise-en-scene and positioning of the shots. Ethan is nearly always framed in shots through windows, doorways and rock. We as the spectator are looking out at his character. Wayne is always outside looking in. He is alienated in-frame; his racism detached from the audience. This framing device also provides from this film, one of the most iconic images from the history of cinema. At the close of the film, as the family is reunited with Debbie, Ethan dithers at the doorway before turning to walk away. We are not supposed to like this bigoted character, yet we are to follow his ""heroic"" quest. Wayne sits uncomfortably throughout the film, seemingly looking awkward with the dimensions of Ethan.This segues into John Wayne himself. I have only seem a small handful of Wayne's films. Two (now three) I have thoroughly enjoyed - Stagecoach (1939) and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). However, these are more to do with the pleasure of the films themselves and not the Wayne performances. I really have a lot of difficulty liking him. Like his performance in The Searchers, I was agitated and uncomfortable. Wayne walks through his performances like a man with severe hemorrhoids. He stands, walks, shoots awkwardly. His diction sounds like a frustrated sex-pest drawling, and spurting out lines as if he had recently had a throat-stroke.Aside from my passionate hatred of John Wayne, I can state that whilst he is clearly out of place with a compromised character - and not the clear-cut hero characters he was used to playing - it is quite refreshing to see him play something a little left-field (or right- field, if you like!), this is thoroughly entertaining western film making, in the classic Hollywood mode. The sumptuous cinematography capturing the true beauty of Monument Valley - it's location - is stunning. No one shots that landscape quite like Ford. It's no wonder that this was nominated in 2008 as the greatest American western, and number 12 on the AFI's top 100 American films of all time. I have to state though, that the western genre only really delights me when made outside of America.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Searchers
57,didi-5,John Wayne's best role?,10,17 June 2003,"Quite often 'the Duke' has irritated me as he lumbers his way through westerns, war movies, and comedies.  In 'The Searchers', though, the character of Ethan really does suit him.  In fact I haven't seen him better ('Stagecoach' comes close, but not quite).  The main support comes from Jeffrey Hunter, never that great an actor but ok in this, and, as the girl who gets snatched by the Indians, sisters Lana (as a child) and Natalie (as a teenager) are both excellent.  John Ford's real forte in this, however, is the scope and the colour of the settings themselves.  The sky burns a beautiful blue, the Indians' face paints crackle with life.  A fantastic example of what Technicolor could achieve, and a majestic sweep across the old West.",The Searchers
58,Dr_Coulardeau,No one wants to understand this film.,8,10 February 2010,"This film is slightly better than most films with John Wayne, but in retrospective. A farm is attacked by some Indians. Everyone is killed except a very young girl who is taken along by the Indian chief. The film is the story of the tracking of this chief and the salvaging, retrieval and liberation of the girl who was made the chief's wife, one of them. It shows how the girl will, when found, ask for her fellow whites to consider her life is set and settled now and that she must be left to her lot. They will fail this first time but they will go on searching for her and they will finally trap the Indian community and they will demonstrate their great generosity by killing all the Indians and only recuperating the white girl by force. At the time when the film came out it was vindicating that genocidal treatment of Indians based on the myth that the whites had the right to take Indian land without even paying for it. Today it is a perfect demonstration how deep that genocidal spirit is ingrained in the American consciousness of history. We have to celebrate the very recent decision of Congress to provide some Indians with reparations for the way they were treated, even after having been parked in reservations, as a miracle of faithfulness to the principles of the Declaration of Independence, for whose Founding Fathers there was no doubt that Indians and enslaved or indentured people, mostly Black, were not born equal, because they were not born human. The film shows how the dominant culture in the USA and in Hollywood used the genocide of the Indians as a good conscience builder among the whites who were engaged in so many wars all around the world against ""minority races"".Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",The Searchers
59,johnnyboyz,"Decent western romp, making good use of its premise; a pent up and often quite agonising thriller which works.",7,21 September 2011,"The Searchers is a solid, entertaining western taking us through the beyonds of hostile nowhere covering those titular searchers desperately looking for something lost under tragic circumstances. It is a solid, dogged film; the sort of picture reigned in to a tee, the sort of picture in which untimely and somewhat disturbing Native American induced slaughters can unfold alongside some fairly humorous moments dotted later on around the fall out. The film is driven by its screenplay and the internal dynamics of a less than sturdy relationship at the core of it, less so its eagerness to drop a handful of characters out there on the vast, open ranges of 1868 Texas so as to look for an item-come-object-come-person whose shrouded disappearance, or mystery, is the reason anything happens at all. We credit John Ford, working from a Frank Nugent screenplay, and of which was a partnership responsible for the equally good Fort Apache, for keeping things broiling and bubbling – there is much anger and disagreement in The Searchers; much energy is used up by two leads clashing and arguing with one another. So much so, that there is this residing tragic envelopment of despair and unmitigated anguish that they ought to be saving themselves for harsher fights which are sure to arrive out of the trek they're undertaking.John Wayne's Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards is the man at the core of the film, his arriving home to a ranch run by that of his brother housing the in-laws as well as young nieces and nephews warmly welcomed by most of those within, and while he cannot tell which kid relative is especially which, he's happy to see them. Edwards' insignia on his arm gives away a fair amount as to the man's stature within the army; his dismissing of certain rumours of a positive or heroic sort has him come across as somewhat humble, since there was an opportunity to confirm hearsay and take credit for something which was false. Edwards isn't afraid of letting go of his experiences in The War; he hands over his scabbard to his nephew and the more prized possession of a significant medal to his niece, the film later bringing that carefree attitude of giving such things away back to the forefront when such items, the medal at least, rear up in a locale he didn't expect to see it on a person he didn't expect to ever see wear it. It is additionally apparent that, following earlier confusion over what the names are of specific relatives, a quest will be undertaken during which Edwards will come to be able to permanently recall the names of those he's related to.As a man, Edwards' superiority over most others of his age or background is established when a raggedy bunch of elderly men show up to the ranch led by a Reverend, a rag-tag bunch of hicks and dysfunctional folk incompetent in their interrupting of others as they outline important information or just plain odd on account of the gentleman whom enjoys rocking in chairs. Their strife lies with the fact some nearby cattle has been stolen, and they thought Edwards would be the sort of guy whom might be useful in getting it back; alas, the plight rings false and upon returning to the ranch, destruction has reigned upon both it and those within at the hands of Comanche Native Americans. They have burnt the place down and additionally taken Edward's nieces, Debbie (Wood) and Lucy (Scott), in the process. A measure of their brutality is put across when Edwards points out how grotesque their carcasses look upon being left, off screen, in a nearby parlour and behind a closed door at the discretions of Edwards' censorship: it is something you don't want to see.A revenge mission of sorts is induced; Edwards, as well as his predominant travel partner in Debbie's adopted brother Martin (Hunter), in firm belief that the girls are still alive and merely being kept prisoner by the Comanche. What builds is a neat-at-best adventure film, feeding off a sense of these people acting as one another's foils, before the chief antagonism in all its ugliness really rears up. It has already been established that Martin is unafraid to challenge Edwards, whereas he puts women out there in the wilds at great risk before that of his ranch-set sweetheart, with whom Edwards wishes he would stay. The two have a good rapport, their binary oppositions striking us and going on to clash out in the wilds; Edwards' age, rugged look and unforgiving attitude clashing with Martin's more youthful, less exposed disposition; Edwards' slow, lumbering, world weary war veteran demeanour in sharp distinction to that of Marty's sprightly, twitchy and energetic nature. They keep to a trail and we keep to the simplistic rhythm of the film, often their leads will run cold and not everyone out there in the wilds is necessarily sympathetic of their plight, but we stick to the piece like they do to their task. Driven by a fine screenplay in which the politics of several parties persistently clash, and a fair amount of characterisation more broadly linked to the rugged and disdainful lead plus his attitudes to failing to identify what he had before and what he had achieved, The Searchers makes for a rather good causality led western running on spectacle; that notion of a woman in peril requiring rescuing and a lead whom cannot be harmed doing the business that works.",The Searchers

63,SAMTHEBESTEST,One of the finest Western drama of it's time but couple of contractions lowered the high status it deserved,7,6 June 2020,"TheSearchers (1956) :
Brief Review -One of the finest Western drama of it's time but couple of contractions lowered the high status it deserved. The Searchers is set in later 19th century where a Civil War veteran Ethan returns home but after a few days his family members are massacred except for 2 girls Debbie and Lucy who have been abducted by Indians. He marches on a long journey to find them accompanied by Debbie's brother Martin and Lucy's lover Brad. Brad is killed after Ethan finds Lucy's dead body but Ethan and Martin continue their search. The plot is interesting and keeps the screenplay engaging for 2 hours. The characters in the film are very well drew but couple of scenes towards end are not sensible. After spending several years in search when finally Ethan and Martin find Debbie (who is living as Indian's Leader Scar's wife), she just doesn't care about them and ask them to return saying 'these are my people'. Ethan couldn't bear her being one of Indians who killed her and his beloved people so he wants to kill her but Martin somehow abandones it. Later, all of sudden Debbie changes her mind and is ready to return home and Ethan too changes his mind and drops the idea of killing her. This isn't a character study, this is pure contradiction. They could have easily take her home before when they found her first time but she denied then how all of sudden she changed her mind? Another scene is fistfight between Martin and Charlie when Martin arrives just before Laurie (Martin's lover since childhood) and Charlie's wedding. They start fighting immaturely like kids when Laurie could have easily stopped it by accepting her Love towards Martin. I couldn't neglect these scenes and so the final rating would be less than what it would have been without these blunders. This film was a sure shot Classic if John Ford would have continued that richness of characters as he did since the beginning but spoiled in those couple of scenes. Coming to the positives of the film, John Wayne and the cast ia outstanding. Dialogues are crunchy, cinematography is fantastic. John Ford created eccentric world in this western drama by doing perfect study of locations, costumes, dialogues accent, period of it and overall scenerio. It is just that most of the films blended around family's emotions are supposed to lose sense at some occasions. The Searchers failed only there otherwise full marks to the rest of the show. Watch this film for it's presentation and structure, just endure couple of blunders and you will enjoy it.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest",The Searchers

66,jzappa,Objectivity Helps,8,28 October 2011,"The Searchers is majestic filmmaking and poignant storytelling. It's one of the most influential of all American movies. Regardless, at its heart are thorny misgivings, as John Wayne's character is unabashedly bigoted and so, in a less forthright manner, are the other white characters. Is the film meant to sanction their outlook, or to sensationalize and bemoan them? Today we view it with open minds, but in 1956 several audiences believed its inconsiderate view of Natives.The film is about a fanatical pursuit. The niece of Ethan Edwards is abducted by Comanches who slaughter their family and destroy their homestead. Ethan spends five years on a lonesome mission to find the clan with niece Debbie, not to retrieve her, but to save her in a much bleaker sense, as she's now ""the leavin's of a Comanche buck."" Ford knew that his hero's loathing of Natives was unacceptable, but his exaltation of Ethan's hunt encourages approval of a warped man. Cinephiles point to a famous later scene of redemptive embrace. Can one shot redress a film? I don't know that answer.Ethan's expedition inspired a narrative lead in Star Wars. It's at the core of Paul Schrader's Taxi Driver and Hardcore. The hero in both Schrader screenplays is an outsider propelled to mad carnage by his calling to save a young woman who's become the sexual victim of those he sees as ungodly. The Searchers was made in the last days of the vintage Western, which waned when Indians stopped being pigeonholed as savages. Revisionist Westerns like the great Little Big Man found a more educated portrayal of Native Americans, but the Western audience didn't want moral intricacy. Like the audience for today's violent actioners and battle films, they desired action with unambiguous heroes and villains.Ethan's a Confederate soldier who brags that he never surrenders, who after war becomes a drifter, who returns to the ranch of his brother Aaron and his wife Martha with unease: He has golden coins of suspicious acquisition, and Sheriff Sam Clayton, played by always hilarious Ward Bond, says he ""fits a lot of descriptions."" His hate of Injuns flickers once he sees Martin Pawley, overacted by Jeffrey Hunter: ""I could mistake you for a half-breed."" Martin's ""one-eighth Comanche,"" but it's unmistakable he thinks one-eighth too much. When Martin demands joining Ethan's hunt for Debbie, Ethan treats him with disdain. In a saloon, Ethan pours tequilas but takes Martin's glass. Martin has by now been a ranch hand, engaged to Vera Miles and on the trail with Ethan for years. Does Ethan implicitly believe it's dodgy for a ""half-breed"" to drink? One of the obscurities of The Searchers includes the rapport between these two throughout the quest. Living unaided with one another for so very long, how could they not at some point realize mutual cause as people? Martin's purpose throughout the quest is to defend Debbie's life, knowing Ethan means to ultimately end it. Martin also figures in a romantic subplot unexpectedly paved onto the focal plot. He's engaged to Laurie, the daughter of welcoming Swedish neighbors. Ford settles on broad humor, which I have to admit was highly effective on me, in scenes where Martin writes to Miles just once in five years, reporting to have misguidedly procured a ""squaw"" bride. What's more, he returns on the exact day when she's to marry a hayseed and the men fight over her.But Ethan's story is bleak and barren, a picture of mania, the muse for Travis Bickle. Comanche chief Scar is counterpointed by Harvey Keitel's pimp Sport, whose Western hat and long hair inspire Travis to call him ""chief."" Ethan hates Indians, and says so bluntly. He heatedly shoots at buffalo, saying, ""At least they won't feed any Comanche this winter."" The story within this story includes the romantic subplot and characters towed in for comic relief, counting the Swedish neighbor Mr. Jorgensen, who has a burlesque accent, and Mose, a dope depicted like a pet. There are even musical intervals. Those who cherish The Searchers sift it out, awaiting return to what it's really about.Did they understand how depraved Ethan Edwards' stances are? Innumerable Westerns have been grounded implicitly in bigotry. This one deliberately concentrates on it. It must've taken nerve to cast the Duke as a character whose gallantry was contaminated. Ethan's redemption is meant to be shown in that dramatic famous shot of reunion and rescue, renowned and much-loved, but trivial offset to his white supremacist attitudes.Ford had an incomparable eye for scenery, and his use of Monument Valley was legendary. Ford's gift for composition was brash and constant. There's the funeral early on, a wagon, a cluster of mourners and a diagonal up the hill to the grave all so carefully arranged as everyone sings a hymn. There's one of the most well-known of all Ford shots, the search posse in a valley as ""Injuns"" portentously ride parallel to them, shadow-profiled against the sky. And the vivid first sight of grown-up Debbie, running down the slope of a sandbank behind Ethan, who doesn't see her. My favorite, the movie's bookending shots, of Ethan arriving and parting, framed in a homestead doorway. The poignancy with which he stands in solitude at the door. These images are movie gold.In The Searchers, I imagine Ford was attempting, faultily, even apprehensively, to illustrate intolerance that validated genocide. The comic relief may be a defense mechanism to mitigate the implications. Many among the original audience surely neglected his intention. Ethan's prejudice was unseen to them, because they accepted his attitudes towards ""Injuns."" But in the blemished vision of The Searchers, we can see Ford, Wayne and the Western itself uneasily learning that a man who hates can no longer be a clear-cut hero.",The Searchers
67,weezeralfalfa,"Quite entertaining, if somewhat flawed, reluctant buddy, Indian captive rescue drama",8,4 October 2013,"Rich in stark spectacular wilderness scenery, multiple character portrayals, and sprinkled with humor. I think Ford's intension was to provide Martin and repatriated Debbie, being genetic or cultural hybrids of Europeans and Native Americans(NA), as models for the future relations between these cultures, contrasting with the prevailing genocidal and prejudicial relations that dominate most of the story.When the posse is looking for the culprits who stole the cattle, they eventually find some dead cows with Comanche lances sticking in them. Ethan(Wayne) immediately concludes that the Comanches stole the cattle to draw most of the men away from their homesteads to make their families and property easy targets for murder and burning. Clearly, he has had previous experience or has heard about this tactic , in contrast to the other men with him. Later, when he is looking over the back of his horse, facing us, he is looking into space, as if reviewing a past destruction of a family(his?) from this tactic, and fears an imminent repetition with his brother's family. We get a further clue when Debbie hides near her grandmother's tombstone, which reads(in very slow motion) that she was killed by Comanches. Thus, I strongly suspect that, like Randolph Scott's character in the subsequent ""Comanche Station"", Ethan has a reason buried in the past, as well as another in the present, in his obsessive search for Debbie. Like Scott, he disappears into the vast desolate wilderness immediately after delivering his captive back to her family. Unlike some others, I failed to detect a hint that Ethan believed Debbie to be his own daughter, thus explaining his behavior.....Incidentally, a significant realism problem with substituting the barren, if visually spectacular, scenery of Monument Valley for the realistic Texas plains, is that this land doesn't appear to be capable of supporting any cattle: perhaps a few sheep or goats , at best! Also, the well furnished family home is an unrealistic representation of the typical minimal one room residence of such frontier settlers.In both this film and Ford's subsequent film dealing with the same subject: ""Two Rode Together"" , most of the older, as well as younger, captives are characterized as having been so permanently traumatized, Indianized, or aged by their experience that their relatives wouldn't want to welcome them back, even if the captives were agreeable, which most were not. Debbie and, in the latter film, Elena, are characterized as exceptions because of a combination of lucky good treatment and a more resilient personality. The non-Ford films I am familiar with that deal with this subject: the prior ""Northwest Passage"" and ""The Charge at Feather River"", and subsequent ""Comanche Station"" and ""Soldier Blue"", do not include women so traumatized or aged. From what I have read, most pre-marriageable females so captured were treated well, as potential permanent tribal members, while the fate of most older females, such as Lucy, was imminent death, often preceded by rape. Sometimes, they were spared to serve as slaves until bartered. Thus, there were very few badly treated frontier women captives for Europeans to encounter. When some family members sensed an imminent Comanche attack, Lucy alone responded with a blood-curdling scream, anticipating her probable fate.I have to question the sanity of two of the 3 original searchers. Why would Ethan spend years looking for Debbie, if he wanted to kill her if he found that she didn't want to return to her family and was, in fact, a wife of the chief? With his detailed knowledge of Comanches and frontier life, he should have been prepared for this likelihood. Also, his experience with recovered captives at the army fort should have additionally prepared him for a likely unrecognizable Debbie, initially resistant to being taken from her tribal village. Incidentally, captive children usually had forgotten their natal language after less than a year living with NAs. Thus, after 5 years, we wouldn't expect Debbie to be able to understand English. Also, if Brad was going to react to the death and implied rape of his fiancé by an impulsive suicidal one man charge at the Comanche encampment, he shouldn't have insisted on accompanying Ethan in his search for her. Perhaps this was just his way of committing suicide, but, logically, he should have waited to find a more effective way of extracting vengeance on the Comanches. Later, Ethan and Martin come upon a Comanche village recently massacred by cavalry. Ironically, Martin's accidental squaw wife was among the slain, and he was upset. This brings home the point that NAs and Europeans were equally culpable in engineering barbaric massacres of each other.If you basically liked this film, I would recommend trying to catch all of the other films mentioned dealing with this general subject, some of which admittedly currently are not readily available for viewing, except perhaps on Encore Westerns. Like the present film, all of these have their strong and weak points. Several are, like this film, largely specialized reluctant buddy dramas.",The Searchers

He also has a large number of gold coins in his possession, without explanation. The neighbors cattle are stolen and Ethan and a group of rangers go after them. It turns out to be a set up by the Comanche to find their houses burning. Ethan's brother's wife and son are dead, and his two daughters, Debbie and Lucy gone, captured by the Indians. They find their camp and lose men in a fight. They also find Lucy dead in a canyon. Thus begins an epic quest by Ethan to find Debbie. The search takes time, and when she is found, Debbie(Natalie Wood) is now a teen, and the wife of a chief; a man named Scar, who has many wives(he must be a Mormon). She has adapted to the native ways and tells Ethan to go away, which enraging her racist uncle no end, leading him to sat that he would prefer her dead to being an Indian. This is a familiar story of revenge.

69,jamesrupert2014,"Harsh, beautiful, and complex Western",8,11 September 2020,"Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), a retired Confederate officer spends years searching for his niece Debbie (Natalie Wood) who was taken by the Comanche when her family was massacred. Considered by many to be one of the greatest cinematic 'Westerns', John Ford's film is a complex tale of a tough, tenacious but deeply-flawed (especially by modern standards) man searching both to revenge his family and to 'free' his niece, even if that means murdering her. Wayne is excellent as the Indian-despising Edwards, whose hatred extends to mutilating corpses and to the firm belief that 15 year-old Debbie would be better off dead than living as a Comanche wife. The film has a brutal, gritty edge, with cold-blooded killings (by both sides) and rapes (off camera), and could be seen as one of the earliest Westerns featuring an 'anti-hero' (a change from Wayne's usual tough but righteous 'white-hat' characters and somewhat ironic, as the Duke apparently disliked the 1960's revisionist trend in the genre). The supporting cast is generally great, with future 'U.S.S Enterprise' captain Jeffery Hunter as Edward's part Cherokee sidekick and several of Ford's usual troupe playing 'colourful characters' such as Ward Bond's blustering Texas Ranger/padre Rev. Capt. Clayton, John Qualen's Scandinavian sod-buster (""Yimminy!""), and Hank Worden's addled but loyal Mose (""Thank you kindly.""). Future 'Gunsmoke' (1955) regular Ken Curtis (as Charlie McCorry) provides a bit of musical and comic relief (but IMO the part should have gone to the great Ben Johnson). The film is not without flaws: even by Hollywood standards, German-born Henry Brandon makes for a very unconvincing Comanche war-chief (especially noticeable as a number of local indigenous people had small parts or were extras) and the first time Natalie Wood appears, she looks more like a high-schooler playing Pocahontas than a captive-women leading a hard-scrabble Comanche lifestyle on the Texas llano. As usual, Ford makes the most of the stunning Monument Valley scenery (a long way from where the film purportedly takes place), but the beautiful location cinematography makes the studio-bound shots look more artificial than usual. Book-ended by beautiful opening and closing door shots, 'The Searchers' is a fascinating transition film from the genre's greatest director. Excellent (but personally, I don't think Ford ever topped 1939's 'Stagecoach', the film that established both the director and the Duke as Western icons).",The Searchers
70,thinker1691,""" I don't have any next of kin""",7,17 September 2008,"Unlike most of his other films, John Wyane plays a bigot against Indians in the ""Searchers."" However, if you're a fan of the 'Duke' it's hard for him to be seen as a heavy. In this story, Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returns from the Cival War and rejoins his brother's family. No sooner do they all settle down with their uncle, when waring Comanches begin raiding the territory, involving the settlers. Going out to investigate one raiding party, Ethan and his 'nephew' Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) learn that their own house is being attacked. They return home to discover that two family members have been abducted, the others killed. Under the leadership of Rev./Capt. Samuel Clayton (Ward Bond) who seems a bit out of place with his authority as a Texas Ranger, Ethan and others go looking for them. Wayne's character has a personal bias which emerges throughout the story with him continuously creating barriers between friends and family. The gigantic panorama of Momument Valley and other outdoors locations becomes integral to this western film. The three year journey becomes a test of sheer will. The only criticism of the film is one of audience bias, in that the sympathy for suffering family members is restricted to white settlers. Nevertheless, the story is dramatic and Wayne is at his heroic best with Jeffery Hunter holding his own throughout the movie. ****",The Searchers
71,freemantle_uk,An early revisionist Western,8,22 April 2020,"John Ford and John Wayne were considered a cinematic dream team during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Searchers is considered one of their best films and one of the best Westerns ever made.The Searchers was lavish-looking film: it was shot in Monument Valley in Technicolor glory. It told a classic Cowboys and Indians story where two men search for a tribe who took a young girl, yet the story was more than a rescue mission because John Wayne's character was an unlikeable racist. The focus was on relationship two different meant on the same rescue but have different viewpoints. There was an emotional charge when they seemingly reached the end of their mission. It was a film that had more of a revisionist take like Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.Certain aspects of the film were a product of its time. Some of the performances had that hokey quality and the comedy moments were amplified by the music. When two characters had a fight my first thought was 'in Texas we fight for our women.'",The Searchers
72,Polaris_DiB,"Classic, historical, epic Western",8,20 December 2007,"You know, many times Westerns get an ill-rap for being racist in their treatment of the frontier conflicts between the Cowboys and Indians, but this movie gets it pretty historically right. Ethan (John Wayne's character) is an ex-Confederate Civil War fighter who returns to his home, only to have his brother's family killed with the two daughters taken by Comanches. Ethan swears to single-purpose vengeance against the Comanches, which includes going as far as killing the surviving daughter because of her apparent racial uncleanness via contact with the Comanches, and the eponymous search begins.It's hard, seeing John Wayne, token hero of the American Western movie landscape, held up as the man who rights all wrongs in a dangerous company, being so racist and vehemently hate-filled, and to look past that and see that Ethan is an anti-hero and the point is the nature in which this close-minded determination causes damage. Whereas it's a little awkward to state, as the back of one DVD edition of this movie states, that Ethan eventually ""finds his humanity"" when such scene occurs literally five shots away from him scalping a Comanche himself, there is a huge role of racial politics in this film which the movie explores to many subtle ways.For one thing, the idea of a man killing his own niece because he considers her racially unclean because of ""contact"" (sexual, hegemonic, both mean the same thing in his mind) speaks volumes to the kind of tension frontier life contained, a theme often underplayed in Western films for a much weaker hero-vs-villain two-dimensionality. It also speaks to the patriarchal nature of the society Ford is here-in representing, thus making the sub-plot involving Laurie and Martin strike a meaningful contrast that lends even more weight to its sense of comedic relief.Also, a lot of the plot in this one is understated. Ethan's tension is there before the Comanches, in the hint that he may have had feelings for his brother's wife. The Comanche raid allows that tension to come out with a much more solid and material focus, an aspect that isn't fully resolved, but is compellingly placed. This is one of the many subtle asides Ford puts into the film that detail a character more compelling and three-dimensional than his dialog, one that affords this movie a reason to re-watch if you missed it the first time.Of course, all of this is set against the grand vistas of the Monument Valley. The setting practically overshadows the plot, which is one reason why a movie made of about 70% horse-back scenes and stretching over 5 years of plot time can maintain interest for two hours. Many critics speak of the visual use of the Monument Valley as ""making the characters seem that much more vulnerable,"" but there's also the thematic epic-ness of the process, putting these settlers into the lands of the Gods. To be perfectly honest, it's Monument Valley that stays with me much better than the rest of the movie.--PolarisDiB",The Searchers

75,ackstasis,"""That'll be the day.""",8,26 January 2008,"At first glance, I almost dismissed 'The Searchers (1956)' as being a standard-type ""cowboys and Indians"" adventure film, albeit a very good one. When Comanche Indians brutally murder his brother and sister-in-law, and kidnap their two daughters, heroic drifter Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) sets out in pursuit, not only to rescue his nieces but also to exact revenge on the American Indians responsible, namely a formidable leader named Scar. Shot in 35mm VistaVision, the film must surely have been a spectacle on the big screen, with cinematographer Winton C. Hoch perfectly capturing the vast expanse of the American desert, and the towering, dominant landscapes of Monument Valley, Utah {though the film is primarily set in the Llano Estacado region of Texas}. Many of the picture's most memorable moments arise from the confrontations between the two clashing American cultures  a vulnerable family, through various subtle hints and images, sense an unseen foe circling their home; a search-party of Texan settlers suddenly find themselves surrounded by dozens of Indians on horseback. Taken just on face-value, 'The Searchers' remains a highly-accomplished piece of film-making.However, with the legendary John Ford at the helm, it's apparent that there must be something more to the film. Indeed, I was astonished by the performance of John Wayne, who brings an incredible complexity and moral ambiguity to his character. Ethan Edwards boasts an overwhelming racial prejudice towards the Comanche Indians. Having lost his own mother to the native tribes {as can be briefly glimpsed from a seemingly-inconsequential tombstone prop}, and now the woman that he conceivably loved himself, Ethan's prejudice is undying, and his commitment to attaining retribution unflinching. Young Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), throughout the arduous adventure, proves his most loyal companion, though, being one-eighth Cherokee, it takes the best part of five years before Ethan treats him with the respect he deserves. Though it stops short of humanising the Comanche Indians, the film makes clear the startling parallels between Ethan and Scar; our hero's racist attitudes are not merely a product of their time, but rather Ford both acknowledges and condemns his prejudicial mind-set. Ethan remains the film's unrivalled hero, but the audience is nonetheless offered a conflicting perspective on his morals and motivations.Intertwined within this darkly-themed tale of obsession and prejudice is a somewhat awkwardly-placed romance between Martin and Laurie Jorgensen (Vera Miles), one that belongs in a lesser Western to this one. The selection of eccentric supporting characters, including those played by Ward Bond, Hank Worden and Ken Curtis, certainly provide some amusement for the audience, but ultimately detract from the murky themes that comprise the heart of the story, of Ethan's endless search to retrieve his niece from the Comanches; or, otherwise, to purge her ""pollution"" through murder. As far as Westerns go {and, I admit, I've never been an avid fan of the genre}, John Ford's 'The Searchers' is one of the finest that I've seen, despite a few uneven patches. The film works equally well as both a brooding character study and an entertaining adventure, and that's surely not a balance that could have been achieved easily. For now, I'll maintain that my favourite Western is 'Little Big Man (1970),' but I can't wait to discover what other treats John Ford has in store for me.",The Searchers
76,drqshadow-reviews,The Screen Comes Alive for Wayne and Ford,8,8 July 2014,"A John Ford masterwork that's rich and spacious, just like the gorgeous western countryside that splashes every backdrop. John Wayne plays a flawed centerpiece, a grizzled former soldier with a chip on his shoulder and a strange, conflicted relationship with his extended family. As usual, cool confidence and raw masculinity seep from his pores and he takes hold of each scene with a pair of strong, old cowherder's hands. This is a film that rewards an active imagination, as there's much going on between the lines that, without being spelled out, brands the cast with an unusual level of depth and detail. Unspoken histories flesh out most every character, allowing even generic walk-ons to mosey into the picture at most any moment and cast ripples throughout the entire tapestry. It can be slow at times, and the casting of a very obviously non-native actor to lead the stereotypical enemy Comanche tribe doesn't sit well, but both such faults can be generally chalked up to the dated eccentricities of that era. Take the time to soak it all in, to look deeper than the superficial story, and you'll find a wealth of spoils.",The Searchers

Thus begins a multi-layered journey to find them hopefully alive and bring them home.""The Searchers"" is always at or near the top of everyone's list for best western. Excellent cast, story and themes; those being love, persistence and faith. John Ford gives us outstanding panoramas of Monument Valley, Arizona.What sets it apart from many Westerns is there are themes presented here that are deeper than most Westerns. The struggles to define race, family, right and wrong. The struggle to find forgiveness and understanding.The War Chief Scar and John Wayne's character are damaged goods. Men who are not able to accept the changing times they live in. It is an action western, lots of great scenes; but when I think of this film it is the moving struggle of a tragic and flawed man to find some sense of peace within himself and his world that comes back to me. This is one of John Wayne's very best performances.An integral part of the combined elements that makes The Searchers great is Max Steiner's outstanding score. It is the picture's driving force - its backbone. Steiner's music propels the film forward, unifies the narrative and gives greater density to its key scenes. Without his music much of the picture's impact would be considerably diminished.This film is certainly not just for lovers of the western genre - it offers so much more and treats you to the wonders and treasures great film-making has to offer.

78,Chris_Docker,Worth much more than casual inspection,9,21 December 2006,"""What makes a man to wander?"" These words are echoed in the song at the beginning of The Searchers. They conjure up a basic male drive. The instinct to search, both on a physical level and within oneself is an enduring theme in films and human lives. An antithesis of the stay-at-home, husband-material persona, they also capture a wanderlust associated more with the anti-hero - the dangerously attractive independent man.Departing from the set formula of Westerns, The Searchers explores these themes - as well of those of other sexual stereotypes, racism, 'the all-American hero' and, most importantly, the dichotomy between civilisation and the great untamed wilderness. Its emotional richness is more that of a melodrama than a shoot-out between good guys and bad injuns - something that maybe contributed both to its lack of immediate recognition but also to its enduring influence over subsequent generations of movie-makers. The Searchers is revered for the complexity of its plot as well as its technical brilliance.John Wayne is Ethan, who comes back home after a long period away. He is someone who has seen life, fought in the war, knows more about Indians than most people, and hates Comanches with a vengeance. The emotional baggage he carries with him is hidden beneath a hard exterior and a big cowboy hat, but this is a film that is bursting with so many clues that it demands the attention normally reserved for recondite art-house movies rather than no-brainer Westerns.Shortly after his return, what family Ethan has left is brutally raped and murdered in an Indian raid, but his ten-year old niece Debbie is captured and raised wigwam style. Ethan sets off on an odyssey to find her that takes several years. Other family members, bandits and the cavalry hang on his shirt tails trying to keep up. If this brutally simplified synopsis makes it sound formulaic, be assured that the big scenes are not the gunfights or ambushes but the emotional tensions, as our hard-nosed characters take us through moral quagmires.The film is also intensely visual. Shot using the stunning scenery of Monument Valley, we pass from sun bleached desert to snows that come up past the stirrups. The cinematography is striking, particularly in its use of framing shots (such as looking out into the sunshine from dark interiors through a doorframe or cave entrance) and deep focus shots (where our attention is drawn simultaneously to both the foreground and the background).Ethan has a certain chemistry with his brother's wife which complicates things, but one of the most emotional moments is when Marty, his saddle-companion, leaves his childhood sweetheart Laurie to follow his conscience. Laurie provides some excellent comic moments later on when we witness her barely concealed delight as two men fight over her.As a European watching The Searchers, your reviewer was struck by the 'Americanness' of the film, which seemed to give realistic historical background explaining everything from the rather barbaric attachment to a right to bear arms, unenergetic barn dances that could practically be done sitting down, simplistic religion, and the tendency to talk rather louder than is necessary. But they are hardly faults in the film; and on the plus side if we are talking about American-ness, John Wayne's obsessive desire not only to see things through against all odds but eventually to be willing to reconsider his values is a testament to the qualities of that country.One of the most influential films in cinema history, the Searchers is a film that handsomely rewards careful inspection.",The Searchers

I found it to be another candidate for ""most overrated classic"".John Wayne is indeed strong and brazen as a tough-guy on a mission to look for his young niece after she's been kidnapped by a group of savage Indians. However, I never got the feeling that he gave a darn about his flesh and blood little girl on a personal level and was mostly just in it for the hatred he harbors for all red men. Jeffrey Hunter makes a good young sidekick for Wayne, who cares more about the child than the old man does.And this ""search"" is anything but thrilling or exciting. It's mostly like a little scavenger hunt with a lot of comedy thrown around instead of the suspense and action. Some of it's funny (Wayne constantly drones ""that'll be the day""), but some of it is distracting from what should have been a more intense and passionate experience. The movie didn't allow me to believe for one second that this search spanned a number of ""years"" either.When the niece (now older and played by Natalie Wood) is located without any major obstacles or excitement, she doesn't want to go back with her own kind (""these are my people now"", she says).

83,drystyx,little things make a big movie,10,21 February 2008,"It's the attention to the little details that make a big movie. That's the case here. ""The Searchers"" is John Wayne, that's true. But it is just as much the reverend-ranger leader, old Mose, the adopted nephew, the nephew's guitar playing yokel of a rival. It is about all these and more. It is about characters. The Duke returns from the Civil War, an evil, bitter, vicious man, to see his brother, who has a farming family in the savage West. The family is wiped out by a native tribe, except for two members. One is Jeff Hunter, the adopted nephew, whom the Duke has something against for a long time, probably because the boy is 1/8 Commanche. The other is a little girl, whom they chase down, and later find in a grown up Natalie Wood. The Duke is evil throughout the movie. He even means to kill the girl because of his insane prejudices, and Hunter must stop him. But there is a depth and feeling to the Duke's evil that we are interested in. Mostly because he is not perfect. Later movies would have evil lead men who could hit a bullseye every time from two furlongs away, and who could outslug and outfight any man. Add that perfection to complete evil and total abandon of rules, and there is no challenge, and no one cares what happens. However, in this movie, the Duke is quite imperfect. He faces the challenge, and he really thinks he needs his dirty tactics to survive. What makes this movie big is the attention to all the little details. To the characters. At the time the film was made, directors were still learning. So that makes the famous scenes even more remarkable. The scene with Ward Bond watching the woman folding a uniform, and the unspoken expressions. The landmark scenes, such as when Wayne and Hunter see Natalie Wood for the first time, the arguments among the posse, and other great scenes, not the least of which is the famous climax which I will not spoil. There is much action and much drama. Had Ethan (The Duke's role) been less evil throughout, I would have rated it higher, but the end is quite satisfying for cynics, realists, and romantics alike.",The Searchers

85,slokes,VistaVision Indeed!,10,24 February 2006,"Hyperbole comes easy dealing with John Ford movies, but never so naturally as here. ""The Searchers"" is a pluperfect mix of character, story, setting, text, and subtext that advanced the art of motion pictures by influencing generations of filmmakers, and remains a singularly entertaining experience for the first-time viewer.John Wayne plays one of the titular characters, a hard-bitten Confederate named Ethan Edwards who rides after a pair of kidnapped girls, the only surviving members of his brother's immediate family after a Comanche raid. With him is Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a one-eighth Cherokee Ethan's brother adopted for whom Ethan bears little affection, given his distrust of Indians. Pawley enjoys Ethan's company as much as any part-Indian would, but he is worried about how the girls will fare, both at the Comanches' hands and, if it comes to that, at Ethan's.Wayne's performance is a marvel of acting economy. At one point, Ethan, Martin, and the fiancé of one of the girls come across a split in the trail of the Comanches they are following. Martin and the other man try to figure out why four braves broke off. Ethan knows, and as you read Wayne's face, and hear the dryness in his voice, you do, too. It's a small moment, in a performance containing many larger ones, but gives reason to single out Ethan for your attention, and even affection, despite the many ways the character resists such identification.Ford's direction is the perfect complement to Wayne's performance, teasing out the cruel nature of the Old West by subtle, inexorable degrees. Seeing a house under siege at the film's beginning is to understand the terror that was everyday reality for America's pioneer stock. Yet the raw beauty of the landscape is with us in every frame, to an almost supernatural degree.I think some people misunderstand this as a film about racism. There is racism, though it cuts both ways and Ethan is not always the worst exemplar of it. Rather, it's a film about society and the individual, long a Ford concern. I would argue that Edwards is not an anti-hero (Certainly Wayne played harder characters, like in ""Red River"" and ""Sands Of Iwo Jima,"" where he actually engages the viewer's dislike more than here. He even played Genghis Khan once.) but more a complicated protagonist because he won't accept the civilizing influence of society.An unreconstructed Johnny Reb (the only reason Ford had for setting the film in Texas when it so clearly was made farther north), Edwards dismisses oath-taking to the U.S. and tells Ward Bond's parson character to quit yammering his funeral oration when there's Injun killing to be done. Yet such rejected pieties, both for America and a Christian ideal, are at the heart of what ""The Searchers"" is about, the former evidenced in the words of Olive Carey's Mrs. Jorgensen about being a ""Texican"" (""Some day, this country's gonna be a fine, good place to be. Maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come."") and the latter most visible at the end of the picture, which is more about saving Ethan than anyone else.At the same time, there is action and humor to keep things hopping. Vera Miles does great work playing Martin's sometime lover, the object of one of Ford's grandest, goofiest fight scenes, and Hank Worden thanks you kindly as a bald Indian fighter with a love for rocking chairs and a mindset crazy enough to ride with Ethan stride for stride.Is this Wayne's best film? Is it Ford's? I don't rightly know, not having seen all of them yet, but they sure set themselves one hell of a hurdle to jump here. Ford makes his direction a marvel of scene-setting from beginning to end (starting things off with a door opening, and ending with a door closing), while Wayne just grabs you by the throat with his passion and anger and doesn't let you go until you know, like Martin (Hunter's performance is the most criminally under-appreciated thing about this film, he's literally the backbeat of the whole film), that he is going to be okay.It's not the finding out that's the trick, but the getting there, and in large ways as in small, ""The Searchers"" makes for a trip worth taking.",The Searchers
86,EUyeshima,Definitive Ford-Wayne Classic Still Mesmerizes Despite Its Somewhat Dated Blemishes,9,1 August 2006,"There is so much that is impressive in director John Ford's masterful 1956 classic that it is easy to get preoccupied with its glaring flaws. However, it's most important to recognize this film as a cinematic elegy of the old-fashioned western, a last-stand monument to Ford's unique oeuvre in movies before the revisionist filmmakers reshaped this type of film to meet contemporary tastes. Yet for its patently old-fashioned premise, the film contains unexpected darker tones which make the film fascinating. First, it depicts the unapologetic racism prevalent out in the frontier, and second, it has Ethan Edwards, a protagonist who not only shares these feelings but somehow redeems himself through his fortitude and often violent acts of self-defense. Through a vivid use of darkened doorways as a framing device, Ford and star John Wayne dexterously manage to elicit sympathy for the unsympathetic Edwards while maintaining his dying-breed status as a renegade outsider.Set in Texas a few years after the Civil War, the story focuses on Edwards' five-year long search for what remains of his family after a massacre by a band of Comanches headed by a chief named Scar. It becomes clear that youngest daughter Debbie may be alive, so Edwards and young tag-along, Martin Pawley, set off to find her. The motivations of the two couldn't be more different - Edwards was in love with Debbie's now-dead mother and seeks vengeance, which includes killing Debbie for being a converted Comanche; while Pawley wants to save Debbie and bring her back home. Frank S. Nugent's screenplay masterfully peels the layers off their journey with a series of revelations that lead to the dramatic final act. This is likely Wayne's finest two hours on film not because he plays his archetypal cowboy hero but because he shows a surprising audacity in exposing the dark soul of his character while slowly recognizing a begrudging humanism through his discoveries in the film.Everybody else is merely serviceable in comparison, including Jeffrey Hunter, who darts unsteadily between youthful arrogance and childish petulance as Pawley; Ward Bond as a bellowing reverend and Texas ranger; and a teenaged Natalie Wood, who has scant screen time late in the film as the grown Debbie. Vera Miles fares somewhat better as the headstrong Laurie, the girl Pawley leaves behind, though I find their romantic subplot rather distracting, especially toward the end with a lighthearted but lengthy wedding sequence. In fact, comic relief is used a little too liberally throughout the film with irritating performances from Hank Worden as the mentally defective Mose Harper and Ken Curtis as Laurie's anxious suitor Charlie. However, these are minor blemishes in the scheme of things, especially in light of Winton C. Hoch's magnificent cinematography. Never has the camera captured the beauty and drama of Monument Valley with more emotional fervor, even if it is masquerading as Texas. Special mention should also be given to Max Steiner's powerful musical score.Above all else, the film reflects the pinnacle of both Ford's and Wayne's careers, a point not lost on the elaborate two-disc 2006 DVD set. The first disc has a pristine print of the film along with a brief introduction by Wayne's son Patrick (who plays a small role in the film as a baby-faced Union soldier) and a terrifically insightful commentary track by director Peter Bogdanovich. He is not the only master director who reveres the film, as Curtis Hanson, Martin Scorsese, and John Milius offer their own praise on a new half-hour documentary on the second disc, ""The Searchers: A New Appreciation"". There are two other excellent featurettes included - a 1998 behind-the-scenes documentary, ""A Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers,"" and a vintage piece hosted by Gig Young called ""Behind the Cameras"", which has interviews with Hunter and Wood and an overview of Monument Valley. Don't expect a politically correct film, but it is difficult not to be mesmerized by the work of such masters.",The Searchers
87,dworldeater,Much respect for this western classic,9,25 June 2015,"I must admit until more recent years, I really have not been much of a fan of The Duke. This film, The Searchers is one of his movies that changed my mind about that. John Wayne and John Ford collaborate for the 12th time here for this great western. This epic western is a truly magnificent and beautiful picture under the backdrop of The Great North American Landscape, captured in a way only John Ford could do. John Wayne gives arguably his best performance as Ethan Edwards, a man as rugged as the land he inhabits. He gives his meanest and coldest performance here and really nails this complex character. His screen presence is commanding and is no surprise why he was on top in his day. Some people think of Wayne as not very good as an actor. I say to those people to watch this film and see that he was actually a very good actor. This film is darker in tone than John Wayne's other film work. The Searchers was way ahead of its time with some of the themes and subtext displayed here. Even nearly 70 years later this film plays well and looks amazing. Direction and performances are exceptional and this film made a huge impact and is championed by some of the next generation's finest film makers such as John Milius, Martin Scorcese and John Carpenter. This film is highly acclaimed and very deserving of its status. Its continues to influence film makers to this very day and is a very good film.",The Searchers

It feels like I spent 9 hours watching this remarkably racists thing centering around an absolute jerk of a person. I'm going to keep trying but I'm losing hope that I'll ever enjoy the classic westerns.,The Searchers
89,Steffi_P,"""As sure as the earth turns""",10,10 December 2009,"1950s cinema is often characterised as being darker and more pessimistic than that of previous decades, not only in the obvious instances of what is now called Film Noir, but as a general mood which could seep into any and every genre. However it wasn't so much pessimism, more a new willingness to face up to harsh reality, and pull fewer punches. The Searchers is by no means a ""noir"" Western, but it is grimly unflinching, and spares the audience only what was demanded by the censors and sensibilities of the day.The screenplay is without a doubt the greatest of the dozen or so written by Frank S. Nugent. It seems like the distillation of everything he had been trying to say since his earliest effort, Fort Apache. Ethan Edwards is the archetypal Nugent hero; a world-weary middle-aged man of the West, struggling to reconcile his differences with the younger generation and society in general. But what is very unique and special about Nugent's Westerns is their treatment of native Americans. Most classic Westerns that dealt with native peoples were either outright racist, or patronising in their sympathy. Nugent still keeps the Indians as the bad guys, with unfavourable but historically accurate descriptions of their atrocities, but makes them intelligent and capable foes, rather than animalistic savages to be massacred. And while he never directly condemns the racist attitudes of white westerners, he presents them in all their irrationality and hypocrisy, gently leading the audience to reach their own anti-racist interpretations. This is far more effective than a heavy-handed open attack on racism. The Searchers is the most profound of these Nugent Westerns because it lays bare such issues as the difference between biological race and cultural upbringing, and shows how blind hatred can turn into obsessive interest, and it does this without ever once making us feel we are being told what to think.Director John Ford always played down his own high-mindedness, and certainly was not the originator of these themes as the auteurists would have us believe. But he dealt especially well with such screenplays because of how sensitive he was in responding visually to what the writer was saying. He was an expert in giving a certain character to the West, just through choice of landscape, angle, wind and so forth. Often the overriding sense was of inviting openness, or perilous foreboding. In the Searchers the West mostly appears lonely and hollow. As always he uses a very enclosed feel for interiors, with visible ceilings and dark tones, but often with the plains visible through windows and doors, to show a tenuous barrier between indoors, home, safety, and the wilderness outside. This was normally used to regulate feelings of excitement and danger, but in the Searchers it becomes a bittersweet comment on the life of the drifter. Think of the shot where John Wayne first appears, emerging from an indistinct and empty corner of the landscape, framed in the black of the doorway and that iconic final shot.This is quite an unusual outing for John Ford's stock company of actors. Most of the usual faces are there – the Duke, Ward Bond, John Qualen, Hank Warden, but the Searchers pushes them further dramatically than they would normally go. John Wayne was one of those performers in the tradition of Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart. They only ever really played one type, but within that type they had the necessary full range of humanity, sincerity and emotional intensity. Here he is at his very best, once in a while turning his scowl into a look of genuine heartache, or adding a note of weariness to his trademark broken vocal delivery. In a similar vein, the familiar cast members play their familiar and slightly comical types – Qualen is still the ""By Golly"" Swede, Harry Carey Jr. the fresh-faced lad – but each getting their moments to break through into serious realism. And Ford, not really known as a great director of actors, gives them benefit of ""private space"" where a character emotes towards the audience but with their back to the other players, or encourages them to punctuate a line with an attention-grabbing action, such as the Duke throwing tequila on the fire when he mentions Scar.With its study of a man unable to ever truly come home or become part of a family, The Searchers reminds of several other pictures from this period, for example the 1953 noir The Big Heat, in which the hero's home life seems the only perfect and beautiful thing in his world, but is violently snatched away from him, making the rest of the picture a quest to come to terms with this loss as well as seek revenge. Again, this trend is not so much a product of post-war pessimism, but the post-war need to face up to our worst fears. Family and home had become exceedingly precious, and the idea that they could be fragile and transient was an issue that writers and filmmakers wanted to deal with. And the immediacy and universality of the issue makes pictures like the Searchers endure to this day.",The Searchers
90,ShootingShark,That'll Be The Day,6,1 December 2011,"In 1880's Texas, Ethan Edwards returns from the Civil War to his brother's ranch just as Comanches abduct Ethan's nieces and kill the rest of the family. Ethan and family friend Martin Pawley set off in pursuit, resolved to find those responsible and exact vengeance.The Searchers is one of the greatest westerns ever made, and certainly one of the most thought-provoking. It's a film filled with extraordinarily beautiful images - the exquisite opening, the snow scenes, the iconographic buttes of Ford's beloved Monument Valley, the unforgettable final image of the door closing on Wayne, many others. It's also a film full of subtle allusions. Where has Ethan been since the war ended, and where did his money come from ? Were he and his brother's wife past lovers ? There are so many intriguing scenes and nuances (the older daughter's moment of realisation when the lamp is blown out, the big closeup of Ethan as the mad woman sits playing with the doll, the unseen horrors of the murdered victims, Laurie's face as the young men fight over her) that it asks many more questions than it answers, demanding multiple viewings. The biggest question of all for me is who is Ethan ? Is he the hero ? If so, at best he's a bigot and at worst a killer and thief. Here's a man who hates Indians (though he conspicuously knows their habits, customs and language and takes great delight in scalping a Chief), who refuses to accept that the Confederates lost the war, who kills both Indians and whites (he shoots Futterman in the back) and seems prepared to murder his own niece just because he thinks it's for the best. He's also bad-tempered, judgemental, egotistical and selfish, just for added value. I'm fascinated by the idea of the flawed hero, and by to what extent in this film Ford and Wayne deliberately intended Ethan to be perceived this way. I mean, he was the Duke after all. He's supposed to be the good guy. In the end though, I can't understand Ethan and I especially can't understand the ending; it's clear throughout the whole odyssey that he intends to kill Debbie, yet when it comes down to it he doesn't. I just don't get this. I appreciate that stories can end with a character having a life-changing epiphany (Nicholson in The Bridge On The River Kwai, Roy Batty in Blade Runner), but it makes no sense here. Ethan is too macho to ever vocalise his feelings, but his final protective heroism towards Debbie contradicts all his previous actions. My wife thinks that's it's the physical act of touching her (his own flesh and blood, and arguably perhaps his own daughter) which makes him realise what he's become, but I just don't buy that. It remains an enigma for me. It's not the only thing that grates in the movie - some of the acting is far too broad (the whole Hunter-Miles-Curtis love triangle subplot could be dumped) with too much shouting and rubbernecking, but Worden is great fun as the loopy half-breed Mose Harper and Wayne's son Patrick is a good sport as the nervous Yankee soldier. Trivia - Natalie Wood's younger sister Lana plays her as a child in the early scenes, and Buddy Holly got the title of his hit song That'll Be The Day from this movie. Scripted by Frank S. Nugent, based on a novel by Alan LeMay, this is a moving, evocative, brilliant, frustrating, exceptional American classic.",The Searchers

96,Movie-ManDan,America's Greatest Western.,10,11 January 2015,"The American Film Institute ranked The Searchers Number 1 on their list of Top 10 American Westerns. It had already garnered the reputation as America's best western before hand. The keyword in that list is ""American."" If it was greatest westerns in general, it would be beaten out by Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. Although this list is just American westerns, I still don't think it deserves number 1. My favourite western is Unforgiven for a number of reasons. The Searchers is right behind it.This has got to be John Wayne's best performance. He may have won the Oscar for ""True Grit"" another dynamic performance, but this is John Wayne at his very best. Even if you aren't a fan of the film, you will be very impressed with how Wayne conducts himself.The Duke plays former Civil War soldier, Ethan Edwards, who returns to his brother's ranch seeking peace. When a group of Natives destroy their home and kidnap his nieces, Ethan and his adopted nephew, Martin (Hunter), embark on a five-year-mission to find her. Ethan hates Indigenous more than anything and even has some resentment toward Martin, who is part Native. When Ethan and Martin finally find her as a teenager (Wood), they see that she has turned into one of them.John Ford is one of the most influential directors ever. By watching The Searchers, ties can be made to later movies that have drawn influence upon this. The biggest influence I found was on Lawrence of Arabia. One of the things that makes Lawrence of Arabia so good is its filming and shots in the desert. This greatly resembles Lawrence of Arabia's shots and filming. But that's not the only one. Dances With Wolves, The English Patient and The Last Samurai are other examples of movies that had inspiration drawn from this. ""The Searchers,"" is plagued with gorgeous landscapes that could be placed in art museums.The Searchers is not just a nice movie to look at. The general premise of cowboys and Indians has been done and searching for somebody who has been kidnapped has been done to death. It deals with racism and how hatred consumes one's life. Ethan Edwards is almost a villain, a Captain Ahab in America. He hates natives and will stop at nothing to find his niece and destroy her kidnappers. His racism is augmented by the murder of his family. Nothing will change his mind.There is even a scene where he shoots a dead Native's eyes so that ""he doesn't Rest In Peace."" He is seeking his niece with his part-native nephew lasts five years and Ethan never grows to love him-all because of his blood. It is pretty hard to like Ethan, especially when they find the now-teenage niece (played by Natalie Wood) seemingly assimilated and Ethan wants to kill her. Of course as a Hollywood movie, it must have a happy ending, but it is not entirely redeemed. Sure Ethan learns to accept Wood, but it seems that he will always be a racist. Racism today is still very much alive with groups of all races hating on one another. At the time of its release, it was a fun cowboy & Indians film. Now, it seems like so much more.I have always been a fan of this film with the only drawback being the way that natives are depicted. John Ford almost makes them out to be savages; a black and white picture-whites are good and non-whites are bad. It may seem like that on the surface, but this film is made to be studied. With constant battling between the races happening, Comanches make a surprising attack. Fact: they were on this land first! When the antagonist explains his motivations, we are not surprised that they destroyed Mr. Edwards' ranch. We don't actually see any of the brutality, but are explained enough. They even hint to the older niece being raped before getting killed. Okay that's bad. But it sounds like something that one of Ethan's friends would do too. And the antagonist justifies destroying the ranch, so I'm sure he has a ritualistic reason for destroying Ethan's older niece. Luckily, not all natives are antagonists. They meet several peaceful ones that are not bad at all. The villainous Comanches get beaten down by the whites and enact revenge. Pretty sympathetic when you see it from the other side. If the film was TRULY racist like ""The Birth of a Nation,"" then ALL natives would be savages and without any justification. And they would not have treated the younger niece with such care.4/4",The Searchers
97,screenman,The Big Man In The Big Country,8,1 January 2011,"Ford takes the classic western of the 1950's mythical frame and peels back the veneer. What we have are popular elements of the genre, but each comes reworked with an edge of brutal cynicism and bigotry not seen before.Big John Wayne plays the role of Ethan, a disillusioned anti-hero. He's embittered by the lost cause of the civil war and soon has no difficulty hanging his bitterness on the Indians, after a small raiding party commits an atrocity and kidnaps his niece. He means to get her back, still 'doing what a man's got to do' but with poisonous zeal.The movie covers a time-frame of some 5 years. (It's passing is not presented particularly well). Throughout that period we are confronted with incident after incident to demonstrate how mutual prejudice of the white and red tribes is racked-up. Little things like shooting the eyes out of Indian corpses (because in life they believed that without them they could never pass into the spirit world); the accidental purchase of an Indian bride, who is then treated with contempt and brutality; deliberate slaughtering of buffalo in order to starve the tribes; these are offset against a US cavalry attack on a defenceless Indian village, killing women, children and elderly alike, (including the accidental bride who has naturally run away). The deliberate obliteration of the plains herds and Indians alike is only touched upon here, though it was as planned, deliberate and systematic a genocide as was ever conducted. If the US Cavalry had had access to Zyklon-B, you suspect they would've used it.The leader of the Indian raiding party has lost his sons as well as his hunting-grounds in conflict with whites, so has ample reason to feel as aggrieved as Wayne's character. In a way, both Ethan and 'Scar' (the Indian leader, played by Henry Brandon) represent their nations in microcosm. Only one can survive. Later, there's a glimpse of the 'civilised' white man preparing to take the scalp of his dead 'savage' enemy.At the conclusion, his niece is safely recovered. We see Wayne's character framed in a doorway of the family home against the back-drop of rugged wilderness. He turns and walks away, doomed forever to be the outsider, it seems.The movie is beautifully filmed in America's spectacular national parks. The sweeping vistas of landscape and sky have never been seen to better advantage, and emphasise like no other movie how immense the west must have seemed to its settlers even in the 19th century. Script is intelligent. The cast each give excellent performances. There's not much to fault in any technical aspect. I've docked a couple of stars because although it was bold in concept for its day, and tried to bring some balance to the myth of 'how the west was won', for me it doesn't go far enough. Ultimately, the myth is left intact; Wayne walks away as if carrying the burden of white guilt with him into the past, leaving decent folk to re-assert their presumption of innocence and superiority, sound-tracked to harmonious singing. The chorus seems cheesy after such radical work.Otherwise this is a very highly regarded movie, and rightly so.",The Searchers
98,denis888,Ultimate Failure of Ford and Wayne,3,1 April 2014,"I love John Wayne's movies. He was truly great in The Horse Soldiers, or The Longest Day. He was tolerable in Alamo. Here, he is very predictable. Someone said that was his best part. I didn't see much of that. Typical assortment of good ol' John's tricks - his looks, his gait, his voice. Nothing new. I read much about this work of Mr. Ford. I say, this one is The ultimate cliché. All these modern-painting-painted Indians are just a bunch of laughs. They way the battles are shot are shoddy. And then, the dialogs. Man, who wrote them? You can almost supernaturally say what he or she will utter in a millisecond. And this is not good, when you can easily spell the nest move they take. Two hours are another bad thing. Or, is. It must be cut almost by a third, and then maybe it would set off. All in all, this is dead slow and often very silly. The good thing? The nature. Awesome views. This is all, in general. The film Is very racist, too. Great, it'd never be OK now, in 1956 this could work. Times change. Well, after all, even great filmmakers make louse films. Good actors play badly. This is what we have here.",The Searchers
99,bandw,A great entertainment with ambiguities to ponder,2,26 February 2007,"The thing that pretty much everyone agrees on is that this is an enormously captivating and enjoyable movie. John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a loner and wanderer who has returned to his brother's ranch in Texas in 1868, three years after the Civil War has ended. His loyalties still lie with the Conferderacy. Shortly after his reunion with his brother and family, he is lured away and Comanches attack and burn his brother's house, killing all but the two young daughters who are taken captive. Ethan pursues the daughters and their captors over a period of five years. In addition to having John Wayne at the top of his form and an excellent supporting cast, we are treated to some of the most beautiful cinematography ever, though some may find the over-saturated colors in excessive contrast to the storyline. Some of the scenes are just stunning, like when Wayne and friends are slowly tracked and encircled by Indians coming down from surrounding hills. The slowly moving procession of horses silhouetted against the horizon is extremely affecting. The landscapes of Monument Valley in vivid Technicolor have never been more beautifully filmed.But, what made this film interesting for me was what was not said and what was not shown. I felt that Ethan Edwards remained a mystery - we only get hints. When he arrives on the scene we know little about his past, particularly about the three years between the end of the Civil War and his arrival at the ranch. It is hinted that maybe he has not always been on the right side of the law. Some clues about Ethan are subtle, like his relationship with his brother's wife Martha. When Ethan is getting ready to leave to pursue purported cattle rustlers Martha lovingly strokes his coat before giving it to him and, when they part, the reverend (who is the only other person in the room) turns away with a look that says, ""I know the history here, and I don't want to interfere with any intimacies.""What manner of man is Ethan? He is not all that pleasant a person - blunt, independent, inconsiderate. His obsession with his pursuit takes on a life of its own. We are led to believe that when he finally finds his niece he will kill her, since she has taken to the Indian life. ""Bein' with the Coamnches ain't bein' alive,"" as he says. But when he does finally catch up with her, his behavior is unexpected - have his experiences changed him? He initially has trouble with Martin, his companion in the pursuit, simply because Martin is one-eighth Indian. But when in a tight spot where death is a distinct possibility, Ethan writes a will leaving everything to Martin. Ethan has no use for Indians, even before the massacre. His hatred for Indians is palpable. But is it pure racism? We don't know what has happened to him in his past and the massacre of his family is certainly enough to provoke even an even tempered person to revenge. On the other hand, who can blame the Indians for being just a bit upset with the white man for invading their territory and staking out claims - a violent reaction is not surprising is it now? When Ethan finally meets Scar, the chief he has been pursuing, Scar tells him that two of his sons have been killed by white men. Scar has his reasons for hating the whites and Ethan has his reasons for hating the Indians and so we are into a clash of cultures that resulted in one of the ugliest chapters of American history. I just don't see that this movie is taking sides on this. Maybe I would feel differently if Ethan were presented as an unimpeachable bearer of peace and justice, but he is flawed and untrustworthy. He is a searcher in broader sense than in his searching for Scar. The ending has some unexpected twists. One imagines that there will be an ultimate confrontation between Scar and Ethan, but not so. In thinking about how much graphic violence this movie would have if filmed now, you realize that there is almost no violence on screen - the murder of the elder daughter, the massacre of the family, and Ethan's taking Scar's scalp, all occur off screen.This is not a perfect movie, but it is a mighty interesting one. The final scenes are unforgettable.",The Searchers
100,jacobs-greenwood,"Amazing cinematography by 3-time Oscar winner Winton Hoch, Ford's best Western?",8,17 October 2016,"Despite being perhaps director John Ford's best Western, this film did not receive any Oscar nominations; it features a compelling story (Frank Nugent's screenplay from Alan Le May's novel) and beautiful Technicolor vistas of Monument Valley.John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a man who returns to the unsettled territory west of Texas two years after fighting for the south during the Civil War. His former Captain Samuel Clayton (Ward Bond) is in charge of the Rangers, the law in this part of the country, where Edwards' family is trying to scratch out an existence among hostile Indians. Ethan doesn't try to hide his racism for his brother Aaron's adoptive son Martin (Jeffrey Hunter), who's one- eighth Cherokee, even though Ethan had saved the boy's life in the distant past. The Edwards and Jorgensens are about the only two families left who haven't given up trying to settle in the valley given its challenging conditions.When Lars Jorgensen (John Qualen) needs help retrieving some cattle after a Comanche Indian raid, Clayton and men from both families head out to find them. After a forty mile horseback ride from home, they discover that the raid was a ruse to separate the men from their homes and women. Because the Jorgensen ranch is closer, Clayton and most of the men head there while, to Martin's frustration, Ethan and Mose Harper bed down to rest their horses for the trip back to the Edwards' place.Later, Ethan and Mose catch up with Martin, who'd killed his horse by trying to ride back without resting it, just before discovering the worst: the Edwards' homestead is burning, its occupants killed, horrifying evidence that Aaron's wife Martha was raped before death, and the Edwards' daughters Lucy and Debbie missing, presumably taken by the Comanche.Clayton and the men search unsuccessfully for the girls, then hold off a Comanche onslaught – led by Chief Cicatriz aka Scar (Henry Brandon) – meant to eliminate them, but Ethan's surly nature and a subsequent disagreement cause most of the party to return home. Ethan, Martin, and Lars's son Brad (Harry Carey Jr.) soldier on. After coming upon the Indian's camp one night, and learning that Ethan had discovered that Lucy – Brad's fiancée – had met with a similar fate as her mother, Brad makes a suicidal raid of his own.Ethan and Martin continue on for almost a year without success before returning to the Jorgensen ranch. Mrs. Jorgensen greets Ethan, while her daughter Laurie (Vera Miles) rushes Martin. Though Martin is clueless and curiously uninterested in Laurie, she informs him they've been going steady since they were 3 years old! But just as he's come around to that fact, and his feelings for her, Ethan says that he's off to find Debbie again. Martin insists he has to go too since he believes Ethan's bigotry is his driving force, which will lead Ethan to kill Debbie when he finds her.The search takes several more years, some of which is related in a letter that Martin writes to Laurie, which she reluctantly reads aloud to her family and letter carrier Charlie (Ken Curtis), who's her unwanted suitor that later becomes her fiancé. Meanwhile Martin, while trading with a friendlier tribe of Indians, inadvertently became betrothed to a squaw. But, he writes, she was later killed, perhaps by the same Comanches that may still have Debbie.Eventually, through a prominent Mexican named Emilio, Ethan and Martin find – and have a peaceful if contentious meeting with – Scar, who speaks the English language fairly well and recognizes Ethan, who he's dubbed ""Big Shoulders"". They discover that Debbie (Natalie Wood), now 15 years old, is alive and is one of Scar's squaws. After the meeting, Emilio returns Ethan's money (paid to set up the meeting) and departs quickly, sensing bad blood.While Ethan and Martin set up camp down the river from the Comanche and discuss their pending fate, Debbie runs to warn them to leave as soon as possible. After hearing Debbie refuse Martin's plea that she escape with them, Ethan tells Martin to step aside as he draws his sidearm. Martin protects Debbie as an arrow from afar strikes Ethan in the shoulder. The two men scramble to escape a Comanche raid. After successfully defending their position, Martin helps Ethan to mend. But the two return 'home' at odds after Martin refuses to accept Ethan's last will and testament, which would have left the remaining Edwards' assets to him; unlike Ethan, Martin doesn't consider Debbie to be dead.At the Jorgensens', the men discover they've arrived just in time to interrupt Laurie's betrothal to Charlie. In a relatively civilized manner, Martin and Charlie fight it out, much to Laurie's and her mother's delight. Though neither man wins or loses the fight, Charlie realizes that he'd never had Laurie's heart, so he calls off the wedding and leaves. Martin and Laurie reconcile. Just then, a Union Cavalry Lieutenant (Wayne's son Patrick) arrives to announce to the Reverend – former Confederate Captain Clayton – that Scar and his Comanche are camped nearby. Clayton states that he and his rangers can handle the situation, but he allows the lieutenant to tag along. Martin sneaks into the camp to rescue Debbie, and ends up killing Scar, before Clayton, Ethan, and the rangers charge in cavalry-style, and finish things off. After visiting the Chief's tent to remove Scar's scalp, Ethan chases after and catches Debbie, successfully eluding Martin. He lifts her into the air and, instead of killing her, cradles her to his chest saying ""let's go home Debbie"".The iconic last scene of the film features Ethan returning home on horseback, dismounting and carrying Debbie to the porch where she is greeted and embraced by Mr. & Mrs. Jorgensen. Everyone else enters the homestead, leaving Ethan standing alone. He turns, takes the step down and walks away as the door closes.",The Searchers
101,sme_no_densetsu,A fine Western but far from flawless,7,2 August 2008,"John Ford's ""The Searchers"" regularly ranks among the greatest films of all time and is generally considered the best Western ever. Personally, I think that there are parts of the film that live up to this reputation but, as a whole, the film is not completely successful.For one thing, the acting is nothing to write home about. Sure, we've got a definitive performance from 'The Duke' but other than that the acting is almost entirely second-rate. Thankfully, the same can't be said about Ford's direction. There are some excellent shots sprinkled throughout and the outdoor scenes are routinely breathtaking. The Max Steiner score is also an essential ingredient in the film's technical prowess.My main problem with the film relates to the story. Granted, I've only seen it once but I must have missed quite a bit of the depth that others see in this film. Even so, for me the crippling plot point was Ethan's choice in the end, which struck me as utterly unbelievable in light of everything that had occurred up to that point. I recognize the significance of the scene but to me it comes completely out of left field, thus nullifying the impact.Perhaps I'll gain a greater appreciation of the film when I watch it again sometime. For the time being, I consider it a fine effort with some unavoidable flaws. Considering this, I recommend it although I don't agree with its exalted status.",The Searchers
102,punishmentpark,"""That which we are about to receive, we thank thee, O Lord.""",8,24 February 2015,"A western classic I was even more anxious to check out because of Alex Cox' film 'The searchers 2.0'. Not that that was a gréat film, but I much respect his (Cox) style, sense of humour and some his films are just terrific - 'Repo man' 1984 is a classic!.But this western kept me entertained from the beginning to almost the end. When Ethan and Martin returned home once again, just when Laurie was about to get married, I would have liked it better if there hadn't been another rescue mission; the journey was over, in my opinion. Maybe Debbie could have been brought back anyway, but for Ethan and Martin to go again was a poor choice, especially with Ethan's sudden change of heart (not surprising, but still).Other than that it is an adventurous film with raw parts, but also very humorous parts, and a straightforward, but still surprising storyline. This combination worked for me, especially with the fine acting of John Wayne, Ward Bond, Vera Miles and Hank Worden (his Mose is an instant character classic for me). The smaller role of Ken Curtis was quite funny, too. Nor would I complain about any of the other cast members, even if it is just too weird seeing Henry Brandon playing a blue eyed Indian.'The searchers' furthermore offers fantastic shots of various sceneries (sand, snow or otherwise), has some great action in it and presents a soundtrack that really works to enhance the atmosphere instead of dominating it. The film has convinced me to try more westerns in the (near) future, for sure!A big 8 out of 10.",The Searchers
103,KUAlum26,Appearances can be deceiving,9,20 October 2007,"On first glance,and to the un-refined film viewer,one might think this film to be just another run-of-the-mill John Wayne Western. But one would be served(whether they have that misguided notion or not)best to see this film and find out how unique and interesting this film really is.Ethan Edwards(Wayne,in probably one of if not THE emblematic role of his long and storied career),a returning Confederate Army vet of the U.S> Civil War,returns to his closest kin in rural,pioneer Texas. Hostile Commanches attack said family while he and a a party of Rangers are away,killing everyone except the youngest. He and his nephew Martin(Jeffrey Hunter) go about searching all over the central part of North America,looking for a ruthless chief called Scar(Henry Brandon),in a quest that lasts over five years and ends up testing the morals,stamina,courage and compassion of both men.Inspired performances by Ward Bond(as the Preacher and Ranger chief),Vera Miles(as Martin's frustrated intended),Ken Curtis(as the intended's speech-impediment-inflicted suitor),Hank Worden(as the simple family kin who is also abducted)and Natalie Wood(as the older niece Debbie)enhance this film,loaded with fantastic cinematography. Director John Ford is able to personnel this movie with deft skill and his familiarity with the principals involved make for a seamless story told in bold Technicolor. A Western where the ""Good Guys"" aren't always so good and the ""Bad guys"" may not be so bad,it is quite a gem of unconventional(for it's period,the mid-1950s)filmmaking,and definitely more than a standard ""Oater"".",The Searchers
104,Xstal,The Demeaners...,1,19 November 2020,"As prejudiced, biased and ignorant a film of the Native American people that you'll encounter and quite probably more so. Portraying people and cultures in a wholly unrealistic way, that is excepting the actor playing Ethan Edwards who we know in real life held values inconsistent with most decent folk and had to be physically restrained at the 1973 Oscar ceremony when Sacheen Littlefeather declined to accept the award on behalf of Marlon Brando, misogyny was another one of his characteristics. Fictitious and fraudulent, is there any wonder discrimination and bigotry thrive today when generations are fed such hate and hostility to cultures different from their own.",The Searchers
105,Cosmoeticadotcom,Mediocre,6,20 September 2008,"Films, like artists or authors, tend to have their critical reputations wax and wane through a few cycles until a consensus is finally reached. Of course, consensus has little to do with real world excellence or failure, but as good an example of this trend as can be shown certainly is John Ford's famed 1956 John Wayne Western, The Searchers. Upon its initial release, the film made a solid profit, and was considered a good film. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, film school graduates started championing both it and Ford as more than good, but great. By the 1980s, with the rise of PC, the film's political content and its portrayal of Manifest Destiny came under attack as 'racist,' and the film was not held in as high regard for some years. With the advent of DVD technology, in the late 1990s, the film was re-released, and its current status as a 'masterpiece' has been little challenged since. Indeed, in watching the special features on the two disk Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD of the film, one might believe that the film is Shakespearean. Assorted talking heads and film buffs gush over the film; even people like director Martin Scorsese. Another great director, Akira Kurosawa, is cited as declaring he learned film technique from watching John Ford Westerns.Of course, I do not doubt all of these people's love for the film, but love (or like/hate) is a wholly different paradigm from artistic excellence. And while there is no doubt that, technically, John Ford was a superb craftsman- in the framing of shots, in the use of silences that he carried over from his silent film days, in the judicious use of close-ups, and the brilliant use of color in this VistaVision film, it is nowhere near a great work of art. Technique and technical excellence do not equate with greatness. Were that true a poet with a merely flawless ear, like Walter de la Mare, would be ranked along with the Whitmans and Baudelaires. No, there needs to be characterization and great acting. This is where screen writing and casting come in. The film's actual screenplay is simplistic, larded with stereotypes, and the acting- save for a few scenes where Jeffrey Hunter (as mixed breed Martin Pawley) shines, is self-conscious, poseur, and given that the film is as triumphalist as can be, it makes such preening seem hedonistic.Naturally, the worst sinner, on this accord, is John Wayne, as the film's putative hero/anti-hero, Ethan Edwards. There is no doubt Wayne had a great on screen presence- both physically and in his idiosyncratic emoting and speaking styles; but while watching the film, and seeing him strut and spit out trite lines while dickwaving through every second he's on camera, I fully understand why someone like my dad- a left of center trade unionist, found both the man and the characters he played (which were really minor variations on his own faux persona, admixed with testosterone) to be symbols of everything that's wrong with America, past and present.At first, The Searchers was an undervalued film; now it's a grossly overrated one. The truth lies somewhere between the extremes- something men like John Wayne nor Ethan Edwards ever seemed to learn, no matter how many things critics want to read into a shrug, an akimbo stance, nor an oddly breathily paused cliché uttered. If John Ford ever did, it was not evident in this film, neither in wax nor Wayne.",The Searchers
106,mossgrymk,the searchers,10,31 January 2021,"When this movie first came out it was regarded as a solid Western, somewhat below ""Shane"" and ""High Noon"" but, thanks to the French and a few American auteurists like Andy Sarris, is now regarded as the finest Western ever made, as well as one of the top 100 American films. Why the re-evaluation? Certainly any answer to that question would have to center on the character of Ethan Edwards, who, as presented in Frank Nugent's fine screenplay and embodied by John Wayne, is one of Hollywood's most complex and dark anti heroes, right up there in my opinion with Scotty Ferguson, to take just one other prominent 1950s example that comes readily to mind. The film opens and closes with Ethan. Literally. The first shot is of a farmhouse door opening and Ethan riding up while the last shot is the portal of civilization firmly shutting against him. As it must. For this true savage, unlike the Comanche who are given that faux designation by a prejudiced white culture, with his embrace of rage, racial conflict, eternal chaos, and vengeance is the kind of figure that makes civilizations crumble and no one is more aware of this fact than Ethan himself who, at the end, wearily but with docility, accepts, perhaps even welcomes, his outcast status. A fascinating character and you miss none of the shadings as well as the points of admiration...his refusal to give up in the eponymous search for Debby, his ability to temper his race hatred at a crucial moment, above all his sensitivity toward those he loves...in John Wayne's performance, without a doubt the best of his long career and a ready refutation for those legions of idiots who pop off about what a bad actor he was, perhaps confusing the good actor with the very flawed human being. So, while director John Ford skillfully integrates this intimate character study within the form of an epic, much as David Lean managed to do in ""Lawrence Of Arabia"", and Winton Hoch's brilliant cinematography makes every shot a Frederic Remington or Maynard Dixon painting, and Ward Bond's Texas Ranger parson is a fascinating contrast to Ethan's lawlessness, and Max Steiner's score is perhaps the best of his distinguished career, the main reason this film towers above other Westerns, before or since, can be chalked up to Wayne since this is, when all is said and done, The Ethan Edwards Story and no one, in my opinion, could have played him as well as The Duke. Give it an A.",The Searchers
107,bobsgrock,Wayne's finest hour in perhaps Ford's finest masterpiece.,10,27 August 2009,"The Searchers is one of the finest examples of American storytelling, that much is certain. As for the other elements of it, this is far too small a forum to discuss them. Even after only one viewing, it is obvious that this story runs much deeper than simply being about a man searching for his niece. The most obvious trait is that John Wayne's character Ethan Edwards, is a severe racist, this being perhaps the only motivation to keep him on the trail.The opening shot is quite stunning as we see a black silhouette of a woman against the backdrop of a wide panoramic view of the American West. It is in this shot that John Ford relates to the audience the scope and magnitude of this movie. As the story progresses, we follow Ethan,a loner and former Civil War soldier who seems to have a chip on his shoulder due perhaps to his mysterious past. There are a lot of mysteries in this movie, such as the relationship between Ethan and his brother's wife, Martha. Or, the relationship Ethan has with his riding partner, Martin Pawley. This is maybe the key element as we find it interesting how Ethan can stand a young man he rescued as a boy and later finds out is 1/8 Cherokee, something Ethan later regrets. So much more is going on here and it will certainly take multiple viewings to get it all.From this first viewing, I can say with confidence that this is John Wayne's finest hour as one of the biggest American movie stars. He is angry, sullen, alone, self-loathing, everything John Wayne usually is not. He holds this story together and there is something in him we admire, despite his racist outlook on life. Ford once again captures the Old West beautifully, but never before has it looked so good, so full, so real. Someone once asked me if it was a background. All I could do was point to any shot and ask, ""does that look fake to you?"" Undoubtedly one John Ford's greatest achievements, The Searchers captures the saga of the American West as no other film ever has, proving again its immortal status in our memories and its influence on countless movies after it. Some think it will soon be forgotten. That'll be the day.",The Searchers
108,FightingWesterner,Believe The Hype. This Is A Great Movie!,10,20 December 2009,"This is probably the most heart-wrenching western ever made, showing what a hard place the old west really was and how nearly impossible it was to find real justice in a lawless frontier.John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter should have won Academy Awards for their portrayals of the title characters of Ethan and Marty. The now nearly forgotten Hunter should have been a big star!Wayne perfectly captures the seething, silent rage and helplessness felt by hard, otherwise able-bodied men capable of doing anything, unable to find the inner peace and justice denied by a cruel world. He searches for revenge against the Comanche, for the current situation and for past outrages, that one assumes his stint in the losing side of The Civil War seems to have aggravated.Hunter's search is purely out of unconditional love and an obsessive determination to do right by his adoptive family, even at great personal cost.In my opinion, the most powerful scene occurs when Ethan is forced to tell of his horrifying discovery in the mountains to Marty and his eldest niece's fiancé. With hardly a descriptive word uttered or a single frame shown, the script and Wayne's delivery allow the audience's imagination to run wild. The results are quite unsettling.Another is when Ethan and Marty's finally come face to face with Scar, the renegade Comanche war-chief and seeing Ethan's response when he finds out that his niece Debbie has been turned into what he most despises by the very people who destroyed his family. I don't think I could ever comprehend his hatred.One thing though that I personally found disappointing was Ethan and Marty's inability to bond during their five-year search. The closest thing Wayne ever came to trying to reach out to his uneasy partner was having Hunter read his will out loud. However, it did seem that Ethan gained a grudging respect for Marty, though the acknowledgment was very subtle.The long search ends with a satisfying, though very much typical Hollywood conclusion.",The Searchers
109,hall895,The not so heroic John Wayne,6,4 July 2010,"The Searchers is certainly not your typical Western. And in the film John Wayne has what is for him definitely not a typical role. Here Wayne is no hero. He plays Ethan Edwards, a man who it is hinted has some rather shady incidents in his past. And he is also a rather repugnant Indian-hating bigot. You can make the argument that there are some good reasons for the hatred which consumes Ethan. But it's all a bit much. Ethan is very much an anti-hero, maybe even a villain. So this is not the stereotypical ""cowboys good, Indians evil"" Western. Not everything is so cut and dry. But Ethan Edwards can't, or won't, see it that way. He is a man with a one-track mind and a man with a mission. That mission is quite simple. Hunt down and kill Indians. And find his young niece Debbie who the Comanche Indians have abducted. But after all the time Debbie has spent living amongst the Comanche she is, in Ethan's eyes, irrevocably tainted. So this may not be a rescue mission. Maybe Debbie needs to be killed too. Oh dear.So the film's central character is exceedingly unlikeable. But that certainly doesn't doom the movie to failure. A villain can be just as compelling as a hero and Ethan Edwards is surely a compelling character. However there are enough things working against the film which make it less than the all-time classic it is often remembered to be. For starters Wayne just doesn't have enough support from the rest of the cast. Jeffrey Hunter has the other big role as Debbie's one-eighth Indian adopted brother Martin Pawley, the one man who accompanies Ethan for the entirety of his long quest. And much too often the powerful Wayne leaves Hunter looking like a lost puppy dog. It's a case of a young actor being no match for a Hollywood legend. With so much of the movie being about the interactions between these two characters that is a problem. Ward Bond makes a decent impression in playing a Texas Rangers captain who also happens to be a reverend. But this character is absent for too much of the picture to have any great impact on the proceedings. A few more characters turn up as part of a romantic subplot but that storyline falls rather flat. The only thing that really is memorable about that whole section of the film is how incredibly annoying one character is. Ken Curtis plays the part, that of hopeless hayseed Charlie McCorry, and as he vies for the affection of Laurie Jorgensen you can't help but cringe. It's that bad. Laurie, played by Vera Miles, is much more interested in Martin anyway. Miles gives a pretty good performance but all this little love triangle serves to do is detract from the main storyline.And that main storyline has its own issues as well. Ethan Edwards is such a hateful man and that makes it often hard to embrace the story. Often there really is not much of a story anyway. Once the story has been set up it's a long, arduous hunt for Ethan and Martin. Lots of time passes but very often there does not seem to be much of anything significant actually happening. Director John Ford provides us with some dazzling visuals. The scenery is spectacular. But even that doesn't quite ring true with the Monument Valley filming locations bearing little to no resemblance to the plains of Texas in which the story takes place. Artistic license I suppose. It's a film which has some good pieces but it never quite all comes together. The main storyline doesn't always engage. The subplots and attempts at comic relief don't work well at all. A few of the performances leave much to be desired. It is a unique opportunity to see Wayne in such an atypical role. But that only takes you so far. All in all it's a reasonably interesting film. But an all-time classic? That'll be the day.",The Searchers
110,sharky_55,He can't enter the spirit land. Has to wander forever between the winds.,10,8 November 2015,"It is 1868. A weary and battle-hardened Ethan has spend years at war. He has becomes jaded because of the things he has seen and done, and the atrocities he has suffered. These are never openly talked about, but John Wayne's tremendous performance creates subtext. Though rough around the edges, he harbours a great love for his brother's family. In one brief shot, the Reverend Clayton glances over at Martha, who is lovingly caressing and folding Ethan's coat, as if it were Ethan himself, and this adds an extra layer to the grief upon stumbling onto the burning home (a scene later mirrored in Star Wars) and prompts us to wonder of their history. The ending is etched within; the first and last shots echo each other, of that American homestead where some do not belong. Ethan's next step is to gently hoist up the young Debbie, and this brief memory, full to the brim with love and humanity, is exactly what is running through his mind in the climax. After all the settling in and the non-explanations of his long absence, upon finding a home for the first time in years, he goes outside and broods on the porch, and we again get a doorway shot, but this time from Ethan's POV from outside. This one is framed doubly, and we see how Aaron walks into the other room and closes its door, barring us entry. And so the beginning foreshadows the end. He is joined by the adopted Martin, who is 1/8 Native American, but it becomes ironic how the two roles reverse. Ethan has over the years harboured a great hatred for the Comanche, so much so that he has bothered to learn their customs and beliefs in order to commit sacrilege and violate a corpse. A cruel and unnecessary act that his own companions do not understand, because they have not experienced what he has experienced. You may catch a glimpse of a gravestone which further adds to his tragedy. Meanwhile Martin, who by his blood is predisposed and labelled with Ethan's own eyes, risks his life to potentially stray onto the same wandering and loveless life that his companion walks, but is able to recognise the humanity within Debbie much sooner than Ethan. And so Ethan comes to understanding and respect, and makes out his will to Martin. There is further irony where Scar and Ethan stare down each other, full of loathing, yet not so different from each other. Both have had loved ones snatched away in the endless violence, and both have become deeply and viciously prejudiced because of it. Many have noted of the film's age, of its outdated racial presentation of the Native Americans. But it is more complex than that (Henry Brandon in redface aside); we see the various atrocities of the Comanche that lead to the ambush (even hint at the demise of Lucy), but we also do not endorse them, and know of similar atrocities that are committed back in turn, and how lovingly and easily Martin has been accepted into the family. Still, it is problematic in other areas. Martin is a courageous and passionate character, but at times Hunter's portrayal can seem nonchalant, bored, slack-jawed in the heavy accent. The tone veers when we switch back to the Jorgensen ranch, where Ford opts to use countless dissolves and Laurie's voice-over and statements of time passing that don't particularly convey time that well. Comedy is inserted here, but perhaps it works, given how hilariously Miles delivers the line about her age, but it is less effective when Martin and Charlie fight in a rather slapstick manner. Another character that is treated with less dignity is Look, who could've been an enormous opportunity to subvert the Comanche persona. Martin however wraps her up and kicks her downhill, an unusually cruel and bizarre act that is played for laughs, as the sound effect of her crashing down is exaggerated cartoonishly for comedic effect, and Ethan lets out a cackle.Ford shoots in Monument Valley, and it was here first in Stagecoach he forged a lasting and enduring image of the American West that remains iconic in the Mittens and the Totem Pole. The landscape is dusty, brown and weary in VistaVision, and the buttes jut out of the parched dirt like aged monumental relics, without care in the harsh raw sunset as a homestead burns to the ground. As the Edwards residence comes under attack, the screen is bathed in this ominous reddish glow, and the score becomes sinister. The compositions are marvellous. The first signs of a Comanche ambush are visualised by having two groups ride abreast at a distance from one another, the Comanche in single file and silhouetted menacingly against the blue sky. Musical cues chime in to indicate little movements in the distance; a Comanche rider signalling the attack from afar, and later Debbie frantically rushing over the sand dunes. As Ethan brazenly proposes a nighttime raid for maximum casualties, a single rider perches atop the hill in the background, peering and keeping watch on the endless plains. And finally the iconic through the doorway shot, sharply contrasting the dark interior with the segment of intense exterior light. This visual motif is paraded throughout; in the opening where Martha has been waiting for years, later as Ethan peers into that same doorway, now destroyed in flames, as Mrs. Jorgensen greets the two weary travellers, and the final moment. We observe, this time not from behind a character, but omnisciently, as others enter; the happily reunited couple, the rescued girl, the relieved Jorgensens, but not Ethan. The door-frame and the intense lighting contrast highlights the stark features of a man redeemed, yet whose sins have ensured that he does not belong under that civilised roof. He is fated to wander the plains in solitude and in time, become one of the weathered rocky relics himself.",The Searchers
111,KnightsofNi11,"A film that I don't love, but respect",7,6 July 2011,"Few westerns have achieved the legendary status that John Wayne's The Searchers holds today. It is the story of a man named Ethan Edwards whose niece is captured by Indians and he spends years looking for her. As the search grows more and more desperate Ethan's motives become increasingly questionable. His own personal hatred for the Indians begins to engulf his heartbroken quest to save his niece creating what is a surprisingly dark tale for its time.The Searchers influence has reached far and wide since its release in 1956. It is credited with influencing countless westerns after it and even many popular non westerns. For me it is one of those movies where I recognize the influence and respect that, but it isn't a movie that I personally love. The Searchers is a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it isn't completely my cup of tea. I love a good western but this movie is a little too innocent. It is dark but not dark enough. This is one of the few, if not the only time, John Wayne played a bad guy of sorts. He is a bitter and disgruntled man whose character is easily the most fascinating thing about the movie, but so much of his character is left to assume or figure out on your own that I didn't feel anything from this movie. I recognize everything this film puts across and respect that, but as a matter of personal taste I was left feeling a little empty.However, one thing is for sure. John Ford knows how to make a movie. The Searchers is an excellent story and Ford tells it very well. The film has a consistent pacing and never gets truly boring. I found myself a little bored at times but only because of personal distaste for this style of film. The film is shot in vivid Technicolor and there are plenty of fantastic on location shots that capture a brilliant old west setting. The film has a strange sense of time and we are left with just the weather to determine how much time has passed. Characters will mention the passage of time but I always found it odd when a character would all of the sudden mention that five years had passed. But with limited technology and a story that must span many years I figure The Searchers does the best that it can.The one place I really do have a problem with this film is the acting. John Wayne is fantastic. This might be one of his absolute greatest performances, but everyone else is awful. The acting is over the top and the dialogue is silly. The film feels like a melodrama at times, helped along by the score. This poor acting could easily have been a distraction to a deeper appreciation of this film, so this could be the ultimate reason I didn't love this film. Either way John Wayne outshines all of his co-actors, once again making him the most enticing and intriguing part of the film.The Searchers isn't a movie that I am in love with but one that I do have undying respect towards. The films influence on the genre and film in general is something that can't go unnoticed. I'm sure I owe a lot more to The Searchers than what I give it credit for, but some things just keep me from loving this film. Whether you love it or hate it The Searchers is practically a required watch for anyone who respects film, even past the western genre.

113,The_Movie_Cat,The Right To Review?,5,6 March 2004,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
I saw a critics' survey once where a collection of professional film academics had rated this the seventeenth greatest film of all time. That, and the fact that I HAD to watch it, for a film course, are what caused me to sit through this terminal bore.To be honest, I'm not a great Western fan anyway, the sublime High Noon notwithstanding. The genre in itself isn't so bad, it's just that 99% of its product seems to be aimed solely at the lowest common denominator. This is especially true of The Searchers, a generic film with terrible performances, awfully dated incidental music and a bog-standard ""killer Injuns"" plot. One small innovation is that there are no close-ups in Huston's direction, though this is more of an irritation than a genuine masterstroke. The infrequent use of sets for outdoor scenes is also an annoyance. Some of the scenes with would-be Trek Captain Jeffrey Hunter have a little more life and ambiguity than others, though Wayne's huge fanbase is condemned when faced with ""acting"" like this.All of which begs the question not of the qualitative worth of The Searchers, but who should be allowed to post comments on the IMDb? I fairly frequently receive mails from visitors to the site, largely hate mail from Breakfast Club fans, but occasionally I get pulled up for not having an educational understanding of films. I have studied movies a little  I could tell you what mise-en-scene means, if that's any help  but generally I consider myself a layman. As the IMDb is a public forum, then does that mean that the ""public"" in the widest sense should be allowed to critique movies without true artistic reference? For an example, The Searchers features prominently in many auteur debates. Yet should I have watched Ford's 143 other directing jobs on movies in order to judge this one? (A similar argument can be made for those who love this film by showing Wayne so out of character  if you'd never seen a John Wayne film before then this would be lost on you, so this appeal isn't one that's self-contained). As this is a populist work, then should it not be judged as such? Is the use of country and home scenes really a semiotic juxtaposition or just a mind numbingly obvious convention?Andrew Sarris suggests that Ford is an artist (the use of painted backdrops a statement rather than budgetary necessity) and that the use of jarringly obvious humour is there because the characters would be ""otherwise too excruciating to watch in their more serious pursuit."" It seems that Ford is there as protector, wrapping the sensitive viewers in a ball of gung-ho cotton wool. Maybe it's arrogance for me to dare knock an established film critic, but when I read Sarris claiming, in all seriousness, that The Searchers is Ford's ""greatest symphony"" I have to raise an eyebrow.Even the staunchest professional critic of this picture, Lindsay Anderson, praises it as ""an impressive work, the work of a great director"". His detraction of the film is not all-out condemnation, but just the opposing stance that it isn't a masterpiece. Anderson's main critique relies on the contrived resolution, which sees an astonishing about-turn in Ethan's motivation. That The Searchers has an artificial ""happily ever after"" ending (save for Ethan still shrouded in isolation) cannot be denied. What does trouble me is that Anderson seems to hold nearly everything preceding this event as a first-rate work. Actually, that's not quite true: Anderson also cites the inconsistencies in characterisation and performance, but it's staggering that while being regarded as the most vociferous critic of the work, Anderson spends most of his time praising it.So what to conclude? Personally I'd argue that every opinion is valid. Maybe not as informed or as educated, but how differing cross-sections of society regard a film goes to build up a greater whole. Besides, it's every man (and woman)'s right to hold an opinion. But in conclusion, The Searchers is a movie that, as a layman, I just cannot understand. Its limitations are elevated to be genius signature strokes and its rigid narrative parameters are held up to be keen subtexts. Call me ignorant if you will, but when I saw The Searchers I saw a deeply average film, and cannot comprehend why the film studies fraternity deem it worthy of such academic concern.

114,SmileysWorld,"The Duke,Ford tough!",8,15 September 2006,"What strikes me most about The Searchers is the racial intolerance of John Wayne's character,Ethan Edwards.It is absolutely frightening at times,as you will witness when he blatantly shoots out the eyes of an already dead Indian.John Wayne was always at his absolute best while working with John Ford,whether his characters were likable or not likable at all.Duke does an incredible job here making the audience question his motivation as he sets out to recover his niece,played by a young Natalie Wood.Politically correct viewers of today may be offended by the film's message,but there is no denying that this film is among the best work John Wayne ever did on the big screen.",The Searchers
115,tonypeacock-1,The ultimate John Wayne film (after Stagecoach)?,9,30 April 2020,"Another 5* western. I admit it is the film genre that I seem to award the best ratings but The Searchers truly is a great.Made back in 1956 in glorious Technicolor, directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne as the lead actor in his best performance I have seen (he made so many films, many I have still to watch). I was memorised by the Spaghetti Westerns brought to mainstream attention with the Dollars trilogy starring Clint Eastwood so this is one of the final 'old school' western films.John Ford films feature some great location scenery. The Searchers follows the pattern with spectacular Monument Valley photography. Monument Valley is an arrid environment between Utah and Arizona.John Wayne commented that his collaborations with Ford were quite literally like living in the western era. It must have been a logistical nightmare shooting big budget productions in such locations!For years I assumed that the premise of the film was John Wayne's character (Ethan Edwards) 'searching' for a close relative Debbie (Natalie Wood). That is partly true but on watching the film has other elements such as the old fashioned (inertly racist) attitudes of Ethan. Ethan wants to murder Debbie it transpires not simply rescue her as he believes she has some kind of Stockholm syndrome brainwashing from her Comanche Indian captors. The search does take place over five years.The film has gone on to influence so many other great filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese. The character of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) in Taxi Driver perhaps? The film also employs some comedic moments to lower the tone of the serious racist messages explored. The supporting cast are great in some of these sequences. I can now understand why this film is rated so highly after all these years as perhaps the ultimate John Wayne film after Stagecoach.",The Searchers
116,RonellSowes,A Critter That'll Just Keep Comin' On,10,22 March 2021,"Ethan Edawards is a Civil War veteran from Texas and he's tougher than granite. Its unknown what he's done in the three years since the war before he comes to visit his brother and his family. And its subtlety implied-as many aspects of this film are-that some of his actions might have been criminal. But Ethan is not your typical cowboy hero; he's rough, ruthless and his motives are questionable, yet he commands respect and is easy to admire. Without question, I find this to be the best performance of John Wayne's career. He keeps you transfixed on him for every moment he's on the screen and is able to convey so much by doing so little. And his performance is so good that it's worth all the silly surrounding ones. Ken Curtis', Hank Worden's and John Qualen's characters are some of the silliest you'll ever see and definetly detract from the film. These types of characters are common in Ford's pictures(in fact Qualen plays nearly the exact same character in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance) as some comedical relief but are more of a false note in a beautiful composition. Throughout the film lighter, comedic moments are thrown in to break up the drama but they just aren't neccessary. This is a pretty serious picture and it simply doesn't need a laugh every ten minutes. And while these sillier scenes might disrupt the drama they don't destroy the intensity of the film-it is one of the most gripping movies ever made. It's also one of the most magnificent visually. I don't know if any film before it had such breathtaking landscape shots, but of those that followed I couldn't say any surpassed John Ford's awesome, panoramic shots in this film. However, Ford also proves he can handle the micro just as well as the macro. His camerawork in the more contained shots might not have the inspiring nature of the other but they're rich in their own way. The way he shows and conveys in these is some of the most deft directing you'll ever see.The Searchers is a film that seems to show others how to do things the right way. In both overall construction and singular moments it simply knows the best way to do it.",The Searchers
117,RanchoTuVu,Jeffrey Hunter holds his own with John Wayne,10,22 March 2007,"This is a great movie in spite of all the ups and downs and the search for Natalie Wood which goes around in circles. Jeffrey Hunter grows into his part and there is a real search that occurs inside of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) for his humanity which he lost when he got caught up in the Civil War. His hatred of the Indians uneasily combines with his knowledge and even grudging appreciation of their title to the land as well as their cultural beliefs. It could be considered doubtful if Ford wanted to portray him as a racist. Wayne would never have conceded to play one in the first place. Very bitter and resentful and a definite loner, but not anything as odious as a racist, especially in a film with such beauty and rich characters. Of course Ford, who seemed to have done his utmost in his films to bring out the best and most interesting qualities in all the characters, shows both sides of the equation with the Commanches in their ruthless and brilliantly filmed dusk raid on the ranch and later their extermination in two attacks, the last one happily led by Ward Bond in his capacity as the reverend captain of the Texas Rangers. In the end, this film wanders a lot, but it's beauty grips the viewer throughout.",The Searchers
118,elvircorhodzic,"""I hope you die! That'll be the day.""",10,23 December 2016,"THE SEARCHERS is a complex and atypical western, which can be described as a realistic and raw adventure in the Wild West. One war veteran from the Civil War returns to the ranch of his brother in his native Texas. He plans to lead a calm and quiet life with people he loves. However, one evening, while he was investigating a case of stolen cattle, the Comanche attack the ranch of his brother, set fire to the house, kidnap his two nieces and And kill the rest of the family mercilessly. The main protagonist is organizing the search for the kidnapped girls, but his motives are quite complicated ....Mr. Ford has again made sure that we all enjoy the beauty of open scenes of the Wild West. The setting is, with some still obvious studio segments, almost flawless. Plots are perfect in the first part of the film, while in the second part of the film is a little exaggerated, because the final climax of the story is repeatedly postponed. Some plots in the latter part of the film are unnecessary. These complications do not contribute to the overall tension in the film. I have, at one point, thought that the movie will never end.This movie has a very dark tone compared to westerns before it. This is a western adventure that is filled with hatred, desire for revenge, racial animus and wrapped with a romantic frame. The main character is a bitter and lonely man who has a problem with all people, he hates Indians and wants his revenge at any cost. Ethan Edwards is perhaps the most complicated character in one Western. Despite this, he is extremely compelling character.The focus of the story is on the psychological development of the main protagonists. Each of them, regardless of their motives, bring something cruel and tragic.John Wayne as Ethan Edwards in a stunning performance. This is probably the best role in his career. In addition to what I have already stated, his character expresses strong passion and dominance. He is not looking for love or respect, he just wants his revenge. A hero, who brought himself to the limit of madness. Henry Brandon as Chief Cicatriz (Scar) expresses almost the same hatred and need for revenge to the ""white man"". White people have killed his two sons. He takes scalps in order to avenge the murder of his sons.The difference between the hero and the villain is practically nonexistent. At the beginning and the end of the film Ethan is looking through the open door of the house. There is no place for him in the house. He belongs to his own world. The Scar belongs to the same world.Jeffrey Hunter as Martin Pawley is one immature boy, who suddenly has to grow up. He is one-eighth Indian and feels all the hatred of his ""uncle"". Strong characterization comes to the fore when he starts questioning Ethan's motives. Vera Miles as Laurie Jorgensen is a desperate and romantic housewife at the same time. Ward Bond as Rev. Capt. Samuel Johnson Clayton tries to be a priest and a captain at the same time. One charismatic character through which runs an unnecessary dose of humor.The Comanche are represented as extremely cruel people. However, their motives are skilfully explained.This is, without a doubt, one of the best westerns of all time.",The Searchers

Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) is a mentally unstable American Civil War veteran who goes on a mission with his sort of nephew Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) to save Ethan's niece Debbie Edwards (Natalie Wood) from an Indian tribe. What follows is an epic adventure and character study of Ethan Edwards. Ethan comes home from the Civil War as a Sergeant in the Confederate Army. He still believes in his cause even though the war ended. He lives happily until Debbie and his other niece Lucy Edwards (Pippa Scott) are taken away by a ruthless Comanche war chief Scar (Henry Brandon). When this happens Ethan flips out. He hates the Comanche nation, and anyone who gets in his way. He is more violent than he needs to be. He is especially upset when he learns that Debbie has become a Comanche herself. He really isn't a hero. Martin Scorsese once said that Ethan is the most frightening character in the movie. When he catches Debbie, we don't know if he's going to ""save"" her or kill her. And that's why it's so great. It makes you think about the character you're watching. Ford changes the complexity of the hero throughout his films. This is where he does it best.",The Searchers
120,jayraskin1,Racist Nonsense Set Against a Beautiful Monument Valley,1,21 November 2009,"There are more racist movies than ""The Searchers."" There is ""Birth of a Nation"" and there is the original ""Rocky"". So this is only the third most racist film in Hollywood movie history. John Wayne looks constipated and angry in most of the scenes. Ford mixes in bad comedy and undercuts whatever dramatic tension he establishes. The movie is only two hours but seems like three. One gets excited because it seems to be approaching a climax, but it just keeps going and going, a baroque Western. Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles are fine, but Natalie Wood is completely wasted in a bit part. If you want to see a true classic Hollywood Western that is well acted, far more exciting, with better cinematography, see William Wellman's 1944 masterpiece ""Buffalo Bill."" It is also wonderfully anti-racist, portraying Native Americans with sensitivity and intelligence.This 1956 Western ""The Searchers"" can be seen as a reaction to the Supreme Court's 1954 decision in favor of school integration ( Brown Vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas) and the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955 started by Rosa Parks. Obviously Hollywood could not make a contemporary film attacking integration, but by setting their film in Western times and showing the unprovoked savagery of the Native Americans, the staunch message against contemporary race integration was clearly made.",The Searchers
121,silverscreen888,Artistic Masterpiece by John Ford; Well-Acted but Weakened Plot Line,6,19 February 2007,"""The Searchers"", for no reason I can fathom other than John Ford's brilliant artistry and several very good performances has become one of the best-liked westerns of all time. This is a mature project by Ford, I assert, one into which he threw every imaginable effort, cheap or subtle, to increase its size and stature. However, the story line I find to be almost completely unbelievable from one end to the other for two reasons; I claim these are 1. the length of time the search is conducted being seven years, and 2. the second reason, that the so-called hero tells us that as a bigot against Amerinds that he is planning to kill the missing girl child and relative he is tracking once he finds her. Minus these two elements, the fault of the story's non-western author, the film would undoubtedly have worked beautifully; with them it cannot fail to disappoint at a number of places. New Jersey writer Alan Le May contributed little more than a melodramatic idea to this film in my view, therefore. Veteran Frank S. Nugent then expanded this thin idea into a much more spacious narrative. Merian C. Cooper, executive producer of ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949) produced this film with Patrick Wayne and C.V. Whitney. He and Wayne hired the great Max Steiner to do the very fine music, cinematographer Winton C. Hoch as in ""Ribbon"" and James Basevi of the former work, along with Frank Hotaling, to provide the splendid art direction. The set decorations provided by Victor Gangel I judge to be complex and excellent throughout; the male costumes done by Charles Arrico and the female dress aided by wardrobe mistress Ann Peck of ""Ribbon"" are simple but very effective throughout. Again in this film, as in ""Ribbon"", there are many small speaking parts, mostly uncredited; but here, unlike as in ""Ribbon"", Ford avoids having non-actors or natural types reading dialogue. Also the names here of persons are much more successfully chosen than those used in the earlier work where poor ones worked against believability. Among those populating the large cast, John Wayne is quite powerful and skilled as Ethan Edwards, with Jeffrey Hunter having a fine youthful outing as the boy who accompanies him on his long and implausible search. Vera Miles is excellent as the girl who waits for Hunter; John Qualen, Ward Bond, Henry Brandon, Peter Mamakos, Olive Carey and Hank Worden have fine shorter roles. Ken Curtis makes a bizarre but interesting rival to Hunter for Miles's hand in marriage later on; and Patrick Wayne is a given a noticeable comedic role as a green lieutenant. All the minor roles in ""The Searchers"", including those played by family members Walter Coy, Pippa Scott, Dorothy Jordan, Lana Wood and Natalie Wood I suggest are perfectly done; and the cast lists sixteen other major parts, credited or not. So it is probably fair to say this is a film which balances equally beautiful outdoor scenery and telling dramatic and comedic scenes skillfully enacted. What keeps this from being a great film, therefore, is only what I noted earlier: that we are asked to believe in a seven-year odyssey by a crazed and murderous bigot being accepted as perfectly normal when these things are morally and ethically impossible to accept: instead of attacking during the entire Civil War when soldiers had been withdrawn for years, the Indians here attack the day Ethan returns home after the War's end. Also, he had pulled a robbery, and apparently lives on the money for seven years, but the Ranger-Reverend played by Bond who knows what he's done doesn't hold him. And finally, the ranch owned by Ethan's brother and those of his neighbors are located in Monument Valley--except that we see nothing of them whatever, and the country is too arid to permit ranching. The film is filled otherwise with powerful and and interesting scenes, those which are not defeated by the seven-year-long presumption of the search. The film was in fact, I argue, the first western revenge story, despite its preferable copout/happy ending; many films copying this theme have been produced since, all of them owing something to Ford's vision here. I believe the film could and should be successfully remade, this time avoiding its few but central flaws. It is a very powerful film as it stands; it could have been much more so I assert.",The Searchers

What The Searchers does especially well is give the audience a believable reason for revenge. It's been said a lot that revenge doesn't solve anything because it will just go back and forth endlessly, but John Wayne always seems to get what he wants in the end. The movie has him playing Ethan Edwards, a former confederate soldier during the civil war who has been absent from his home for many years. He returns, and shortly afterwards, some cattle that belong to his neighbor are stolen. When Edwards goes to look for them, he discovers it's a native american trap to lure him away from his relatives, but it's already too late. He returns to his now incinerated house and discovers that two of his female relatives, Debby and Lucy, have been kidnapped and the rest of the people in the house are dead. The rest of the movie has Edwards leading a band of men on a quest across Texas and eventually New Mexico in order to retrieve what remains of his family. When Edwards eventually does find Debbie (Lucy being killed by natives earlier in the movie), he makes a sickening discovery. She has been accustomed to their way of life and wants to stay with them. Determined to see her dead instead of an indian, Edwards tries shooting her, but a native archer hits him with an arrow. As he returns home, they plan another attack on the native camp, and the chief, Scar, is killed. Debbie is rescued by Edwards and the avengement is finally complete. Overall, this movie is a must see for anyone who is a fan of westerns and John Wayne, since it is one of his most well known works, and the dry, desert landscapes of the American southwest are nice to look at.",The Searchers
125,MattBrady099,The Searchers - Movie Review,10,22 August 2016,"Wow.The Searchers is a timeless western classic that completely hooked me from the minute it starts. John Ford shows us how Western is done by it's breathtaking landscapes, haunting scenes and the best ending to a film I've ever seen.John Wayne gives the performance of his career as Ethan and I don't think his other performances can top that, but then again, my mind might change. John Wayne is the soul of Western and I don't care what anyone says to change that. He's so iconic that even people who haven't seen his movies still know the famous cow boy image of John Wayne.But I've heard a lot of issues from people with the character of Ethan. People thought the character was racist, unlikable or just a prick. Well his mother was killed by comanches, he lost the woman he loved to his brother, he fought in a war where he would have seen many people, including his friends killed, and then he returns home to his family who are massacred, including the woman he loves who was also raped. He also finds his niece's raped corpse that he buries.I don't think Ethan was suppose to win your heart. He's a deeply troubled and sometimes bordering on psychotic, person. He's an anti- hero that I couldn't bring myself to hate but root for. He's a racist and I'm okay with that, because it gives the character Ethan an interesting conflict with Martin (played by Jeffrey Hunter), for being quarter Cherokee which Ethan hates. It's never clear if Ethan views change at the end, but it sure makes one hell of a partnership between the two.This movie dose not mess around when it comes to it's violence. And no, I don't mean it's gory or bloody, but the movie gets quite dark at times. I only say ""at times"" because there is a fair share of humor in this that I did laugh at, as it fitted perfectly with the story and wasn't force. That's what I love about this movie. It manages to balance humor and dark scenes so brilliantly that's it's really difficult to pull off in movies. For a Western that's aged approved, it sure has some balls of what it presents you.I gotta be honest here. This is the first John Wayne movie I've ever watched and I can't believe it took me this long to get around to this one. First it was Marilyn, then Dean and now Wayne.

With the help of his nephew Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) and some other characters here and there, over the course of a five year chase, the search for Debbie is one that is hard on all of them, especially Ethan.Wayne is one of the greatest actor's of all time. With a wide variety of movies, The Searchers stands out as one of his best. When Brad Jorgensen (Harry Carey Jr.) wants to know about what happened to Ethan when he found Lucy, another niece who was abducted, Wayne delivers a line that is so powerful. ""What do you want me to do? Draw you a picture? Spell it out? Don't ever ask me! Long as you live, don't ever ask me more,"" His character Ethan is one you can look up to, one you can fear, and one you can hate. He is an all around tough guy who will do anything for family...anything.Ford's interpretation of Alan Le May's novel The Searchers, is one of his best as well. His previous films with Wayne, The Quiet Man, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and Rio Grande are all fantastic (Especially The Quiet Man), but none of them compare to the raw emotion of The Searchers.

The movie's high was John Wayne himself, his anti-hero character and his tough man carriage was very convincing; there was a point when I wish he got shot, then he did and I was happy.The movie's low to me is the King of Kings 1961 actor Jeffrey Hunter. The movie is filled with pranks that will make you giggle. The movie was shot majorly outside in a desert terrain, which after a while I got tired of seeing.The Movie plot was set in 1868 and it features Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) who is just returning from the American Civil War, in which he fought for the Confederacy.He decided to move in with his brother, but things changed when Ethan's brother was raided by Comanches and the whole family was killed and the little girl Debbie was kidnapped. Now enraged Ethan decides to hunt down the Comanche that took his niece and with him was his 1/8 Indian nephew whom he dislikes.The search for Debbie went on for 5 years, till one day Ethan and Martin found her, but she had grown and Scar the Comanche chief who took her was also not ready to let go of his prize.John Wayne is typecast to Western films which led him to wining an Academy Award for the movie True Grit 1969.The Searches received critical acclaim and was a box office success but it got no Academy award nomination. The movie is ranked 12th in the American Film Institute 100 movies.100 years and the British Film Institute ranks it 7th in their sight and sound survey of best movies of all times.The fun I had watching The Searchers was trying to figure out the loss ends, the way Ethan looked at his brother's wife suggested that there might be something going on.

129,manuel-pestalozzi,Beautiful American movie with tons of interesting stuff,9,2 February 2007,"First it must be said that The Searchers is hauntingly beautiful. Plotwise John Ford turns out to be something like the American equivalent of Greek author Homer. Somehow he packed elements of the Ilyad and the Odyssey into this grand, epic tale which seems to reflect the American psyche.I would like to call The Searchers an American home movie. Basically it is about men searching for home, home meaning the USA, in a vague kind of way, without a clear idea about what home really is. Their attitude is surprisingly fatalistic and weirdly abstract. Take the scene when the posse finds the slaughtered cattle. The main character immediately declares this a trap of the Indians, that the Indians will raid one farm and that they are too far away to do anything about it, and acting accordingly (almost as if he wishes the raid to happen). Take Mr. Jorgensen's reaction (or rather non-reaction) when he is told about the death of his son.The movie is stripped of almost everything that might resemble uplifting pioneer folklore. The choice of Monument Valley, probably the most uninhabitable place in the country, for the home of the settlers is in every sense of the word outlandish. The natural beauty of the location is used as a huge stage set which heightens the dramatic content of the story and the unnaturalistic over all atmosphere. The key visual motive, the view from a dark, enclosed space into the sun drenched open space, is repeated over and over again. It is open to multiple interpretations and unforgettable.This movie must have had a massive influence on many artists, I particularly think of Paul Schrader's movie Hardcore (almost a modern remake) and of the French comic strip series Lieutenant Blueberry by master draftsman Thierry Girod. And, if you allow me to say this, the movie also makes me think of the current situation in Mesopotamia, where searchers (for freedom and world peace?) are confronted with the irate parts of an indigenous population. It all seems to simmer down to a question of honor and badly defined principles, doesn't it?",The Searchers
130,alicecbr,Every Time I see something different,10,17 June 2006,"Pat Ford is one of the producers? of a movie by John Ford? And Pat Wayne is the Union Army rookie? Who plays the son of the Union Army commandant on his first patrol, with all the attending jokes on nepotism? Hilarious.And talk about white supremacy@!!!! You should prefer death to defamation by the Red Man!!! Whoah. And I, a Mayflower descendant, have a grandson who is part Mexican Indian. And one of my brightest of the 10. Course, there's some German in there, as well....speaking of immigrants and what they contribute to the melting pot.Actually, though our forefathers were a pretty gutsy lot, heading out there despite the horrors we had visited upon the indigents of this beautiful country. Don't know if there's a director that can beat John Ford on showing the beauty of our wonderful country. Too bad we're screwing it up, both morally and environmentally.Do you know how strange it feels to be seeing a show filled with dead people? dead people playing dead people of another era? Whoah. Even the short describing the film was peopled by dead people. The wonders of technology: outlasting us all. I watched it again to see the wonderful shots from the interior looking out on the exterior. Wayne, the stranger.......who became increasingly estranged from John Ford as their politics diverged.And yes, another theme: the clown, as played by the insane guy who helps them to bring closure to the whole sad episode. I'm sure the insane children/women who had been captured by the Indians, then re-captured by the Union guys were based on reality. Think about it: if we weren't taught to feel superior to other races, the treatment (they were physically healthy) wouldn't be so traumatic.Then, there's the Southern/Yankee thing. I'm a Southerner who had ancestors dying on each side of that most insane, most disastrous war of our nation's history. My 4th great uncle died at the Battle of Shiloh, and my kin are STILL reliving that defeat. Just as the Country will never recover from the shame of Vietnam, from the shame of Iraq, so my kin in the South will never recover from the shame of the Confederacy losing the war. So John Wayne found an echo in this liberal's heart, of all things. His old captain had capitulated to the Yankees, but he never would.Error: the Gig Young show said the film portrayed events starting in 1863. Not so: the war was over in 1865, and the title clearly states: 1868. see it.

131,rgcustomer,Highly overrated waste,5,15 June 2010,"Wow, was this bad. I acknowledge that westerns are not my favourite film genre, but I did enjoy the Dollars trilogy, among others. But this is just awful.Where should I begin? Texas? That looks an awful lot like Arizona or Utah to me. Texas is also a beautiful and varied geography, and they didn't even try to get any of it on film.Then consider the random horror-film screaming near the beginning when one female character lights a lamp, and another douses it. Just ridiculous. This is just one example of absurdly extreme over-acting throughout the film, particularly by female characters. It's as if they were acting on a stage, for spectators a mile away.We're never shown who took the livestock or who burned down the house and killed the inhabitants. Yet based on a single horn call that even the characters don't see, everyone just assumes it was the natives, and in particular they even know which ethnic group.Consider a force of natives, twice the size of the immigrant whites, somehow doesn't know their own territory as well, and falls into the mud. I'm supposed to buy that? The same force of natives, armed primarily with spears and the like (only a few guns) crosses a river directly into the firing guns of the whites. Really? It just wouldn't happen. They might be brave, but I doubt any small ethnic group is that suicidal.The colours never looked right. I think they relied on too many ""day for night"" effects instead of just shooting actual night scenes.Most of the audio sounded like it was taking place on a stage with bad acoustics, not in the scene.Martin was portrayed as a buffoon. And the victorious ""yankee"" soldiers in the form of Lt Greenhill were portrayed as incompetent boys (what's that say about the defeated confederates, eh?). Not to mention Charlie and Mose seemed to be actually retarded. What's the point of having all these morons in the same film? Is that what it takes to make John Wayne look intelligent? Apparently just living among the ""Comanch"" is supposed to devolve a person into screaming, raving, beast fit only to be killed. It boggles the mind that this film is regarded by some as anti-racist. The only question in the film is whether a man will kill his own niece for living with ""Comanch"". The slaughter of natives, collective punishment for a crime never proved, is never questioned at all. I don't feel that the villains in this film were given even the same respect that the Joker receives in Batman films.In summary, I was never drawn into the film, and never felt anything for any of the characters. That's a major failure for one of the supposedly greatest films of all time. Someone needs to re-evaluate that.",The Searchers

133,bix171,Facinating But Not Always Satisfying,7,13 July 2002,"John Wayne plays a Confederate soldier with a shady past who returns home to see his brother's family massacred by Comanches with the exception of his kidnapped niece; his years-long obsession with her safe return (and his personal revenge) forms the basis of John Ford's stylized anti-Western which has its own peculiar rhythms, not all of them very comfortable. Wayne is convincing as the surly, embittered Ethan Edwards and his rages and racism have their shocking moments; but there are times where it seems his grasp of the character eludes him, as if he doesn't fully comprehend what he's playing and his momentary lapses bring the film to a halt. Naturally, there's a lot to enjoy in Ford's breathtaking Monument Valley vistas (presented here in almost three-dimensional relief by longtime Ford cinematographer Winton C. Hoch) but Max Steiner's intrusive score hurts the narrative and seems as oblivious as Wayne. The supporting cast includes Ward Bond, Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles and a young Natalie Wood; but it's Olive Carey, as a persevering yet vulnerable pioneer wife, who turns in perhaps the film's most natural and meaningful performance.",The Searchers
134,disinterested_spectator,On Things Not Seen,10,25 November 2014,"In most movies, what you see is what you get. Everything of significance is either depicted visually or is revealed to us through dialogue or narration. This is especially so in Westerns, which tend to have simpler plots and less complicated characters. But ""The Searchers"" is an exception, for there seems to be much in this movie of significance that is concealed from us. And just as the idea of searching consists of looking for something, of wanting to see what cannot presently be seen, so too is wanting to see and not being able to see a recurring theme of this movie. Ethan will not let Martin see the results of the massacre; Ethan shoots two bullets into the eyes of a dead Comanche so he will wander forever without being able to find his happy hunting ground; when Brad wants to know if Lucy, with whom he was in love, had been raped, Ethan yells, ""Do I have to draw you a picture?""; and Martin accidentally gets himself a squaw, whom he inadvertently nicknames ""Look.""But there are things we do not get to see in a more figurative sense, as when we use the word ""see"" to mean ""understand."" We keep getting the sense that there is more to this story than the movie is telling us, at least explicitly, for it does leave us some tantalizing clues. For example, it is peculiar that an Indian hater like Ethan would be able to speak ""Comanch,"" as he puts it. It is not as though when he was in high school, he might have opted to take a course in Comanch instead of Latin. This has caused some to speculate that he might once have been married to a Comanche squaw, from whom he learned the language, before the murder (and presumed rape) of his mother turned him into an Indian hater.The first time I saw this movie, I figured that Martha and Ethan had once been in love, but that Ethan was not ready to get married and settle down, and so she married Aaron on the rebound, which she soon came to regret. In most movies, there would eventually have been a scene in which their past relationship would have been made explicit, but we never get such a scene in this movie, because Aaron and Martha are massacred by the Comanches early on, and the relationship between Ethan and Martha is never even alluded to after that.The second time I watched this movie, I noticed that Aaron is hostile to Ethan. When Ethan asks about a deserted ranch that he saw on his way back, Aaron says that they decided to clear out and went back to chopping cotton. Then Aaron says that before the war, when Ethan had his own ranch, he could see that Ethan wanted to clear out too, and he asks him why he didn't (implying that Ethan should clear out right now). Martha expresses dismay and Ethan takes offense.Now, if we assume that Ethan had once been in love with Martha, who then married Aaron, it would be strange that he would stick around if he also was tired of trying to make a living on his ranch. He would then have had two reasons for clearing out, for it can be downright unpleasant to see the woman you love married to another man, especially your own brother. But if, on the other hand, Ethan and Martha fell in love after she married Aaron, and they started having an affair, then his sticking around would make perfectly good sense. And Aaron, suspecting as much, would naturally feel animosity toward Ethan.And once we accept the idea that Ethan and Martha had an affair, the next thing that occurs to us is that Debbie might be his daughter and not just his niece, for she is just the right age to have been conceived before he left for the war. The idea that Ethan wanted to kill Debbie because she had been defiled by the Indians was already bad enough when we thought she was his niece. Once we accept the idea that Debbie is his daughter, the tone of the movie really becomes dark and disturbing.When Ethan, Martin, and Brad come across some tracks going off into a canyon, Ethan says he will check it out. This is followed by what seems to be an unnecessary conversation about firing a shot as a signal as to where Brad and Martin will be, wherein Ethan responds that they have to be quiet, and he will meet them on the other side. When Ethan catches up with them, he sits on the ground and digs his knife into the dirt. Later, we learn that he found Lucy in the canyon, and that she had been raped. Now, if Ethan is determined to kill Debbie because she has been defiled, then we have to acknowledge the possibility that Ethan found Lucy alive and killed her for the same reason. If we grant that interpretation, then that explains the conversation about not making noise. Because he could not risk firing a shot, Ethan would have had to kill Lucy with his knife. And his digging the knife into the dirt could be explained as an obsessive desire to clean the blood off it.In other words, it is possible to interpret this movie in a way that makes it darker and more disturbing than it already is, but such an interpretation could not be made explicit, owing to the Production Code in force at that time. But then, this movie could not be made at all today, because Indians have been replaced by Native Americans, who have not raped or scalped anyone for a long time.",The Searchers
135,bluesman-20,That'll be the day.,10,18 June 2009,The Searchers is one of the westerns held in high regard as one of the greatest movies ever made. And with good reason. The direction is solid and sharp Ford gives us a story that on the surface is simple but underneath it all nothing is simple You have to Watch the movie closely to understand all that is going on. You might have to watch it more then once to capture the true essence of the story and that is not a bad thing. The searchers Grows on you more and more with each repeated viewing. John Wayne has his most challenging role ever that actually pulled him out of the cookie cutter good guy roles he did in the forties and fifties. His Ethan Edwards is a man on the edge of losing his humanity and Wayne delivers the role effortlessly and with all the subtle of an Atom bomb. Wayne never ever did a role like this one the closest he ever did was Rooster Cogburn in True Grit or Wil Anderson in the Cowboys. The Searchers was the top of the mountain for Ford and Wayne after that nothing else could equal the greatness or the grandness of the Searchers.,The Searchers

It is set in Texas but filmed in monument valley and Canada. Why, because the West is America, white people pushing out indigenous people. Texans are portrayed as only being white and New Mexico only has Spanish speakers. Once again this turns one of the great struggles of the Americas into simple geography.The Indian people are portrayed as violent sometimes but also human and the relationship between the Texans and the Indians develop throughout the movie from hatred through to understanding.It is a movie worth seeing despite the portrayals of Indian Americans being outdated and the story being over long.

Having first seen it fifty years ago, I was made nostalgic.Regrettably, nostalgia fails to add much substance to an objective comment. It merely makes the negative parts read a little less bitter than might otherwise be the case.This vastly overrated film (both in its own time and even today) feels as though it were made not by a celebrated director, but rather by a committee taking its own sweet time in crafting a story that, one suspects, may have been made up as it went along.The musical score is as incoherent as is the narrative. Comedic elements drop in and out of an otherwise serious story line like a Supreme Court judge with a case of the giggles. Bizarrely wrong historical, geographical, and cultural parts are apparent in nearly every frame.Still, it was fun watching it again, if only to laugh at its pretensions and prejudices. And because I spent my childhood near Monument Valley and have visited it often, I cannot say enough about the beautiful photography. Perhaps I will tune it in again in another fifty years to see if it has still not aged well.",The Searchers
138,renegadeviking-271-528568,The Searchers review,8,12 January 2020,"I love a good western. It is the quintessential American genre. A portrait of ourselves at both our most noble and most despicable. A genre of selfless heroes and terrible villains. A showcase of the American landscape, as seen by the men and women who first braved to cross it - full of wonder and awe.There is no better western than The Searchers.Sixty years ago this year, The Searchers made its debut and forever changed the western - even though it was tepidly received upon its initial release. Today it is revered by casual filmgoers, critics, and filmmakers alike as one of the most important films of all time. It is one of director John Ford's best films and arguably star John Wayne's best performance of his career.The film follows a former Confederate soldier, Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), and his kinsman, Martin Pauley (Jeffrey Hunter), as they brave obstacles (natural and unnatural) and the slow passage of time to attempt to find a member of their family kidnapped by the Comanche Indians. The journey becomes an unhealthy obsession, as Ethan's quest to find his niece, Debbie, slowly devolves into vengeance-fueled madness.The Searchers has influenced many filmmakers in the six decades since its debut. Legendary director Martin Scorsese has often cited The Searchers as one of his favorites and has talked extensively about the film. Its staying power is derived from its themes and characterizations. The film has a lot to say about thematic concepts that are just as relevant to today's world.The Picturesque West of John FordWith each of his films I see, John Ford becomes, more and more, one of my favorite directors. His instincts on camera placement, movement, and focus are amazing. Ford really cemented his place in cinema history as being the vision of the west that most movie audiences picture in their minds.The Searchers was filmed almost entirely in Monument Valley, located in both Arizona and Utah. It was a favorite filming location of Ford's, as it became a background to many of his films. When modern moviegoers think of the west, it is most likely via Monument Valley and Ford's lens. In fact, the most modern western film (that I've seen) to utilize Monument Valley was the most recent version of The Lone Ranger in 2013.Women-in-The-SearchersThere is really no bad shot in The Searchers. Each frame could be hung up as a painting. The stoic buttes, the sandy monoliths of Monument Valley, stand as a constant in the backgrounds, displaying God's awesome artistry of the land. The greenery of the valley floor gives those wide shots splotches of mixed colors that are appealing. And that sky - most of the shots are almost two-thirds deep blue with wispy clouds. Simply beautiful.But the scenery does more than look pretty. Through the eyes of Ford, the land evokes emotion that transfers to the audience. Both the Edwards and Jorgensen homesteads are solitary, almost enveloped by the valley. There are no towns visited as part of the story, just lonely outposts of civilization. Not only does this invoke feelings of the hard-scrabble life of the frontier and the rugged individualism of the American West; there is also a loneliness to it that carries itself through the entire picture, creating a visual theme.The visuals of The Searchers also offer a sort of poetry, the most famous being the first and last shots of the film. The movie opens and closes, literally, with a door. This provides the audience with a window into the expansive wilderness and a way back into the sanctity of the home.The Western Grows Upjohn-fordBeing a ""pioneer"" of the western film genre, John Ford was there at its very beginning. His early films reflected a more simple, romantic look at the wild west. In movies like Ford's Stagecoach (1939), the heroes were gruff but had hearts of gold and the villainous Native Americans were one-dimensional. The world was very black and white.By the time The Searchers came along, Ford was venturing into new territory. The western was now turning shades of grey. There was more honesty to the stories and more layers to the characters. It was a gradual turn, though. Part of Ford's brilliance with this film is his use of common western tropes of the time and giving them a new twist to ease into the darker nature of the story.The music, written by celebrated composer Max Steiner, is a classic example of a typical western trope. Steiner was known for his sweeping, epic scores to films like King Kong, Casablanca, and Gone with the Wind. The score of The Searchers is no different - using epic phrasing and leitmotifs to make the viewer feel at home in a western. It was an aural framework into which Ford could weave his story.Steiner's score is also littered with popular tunes of the Civil War era (the film takes place three years after the war's end) like ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" and ""Lorena."" ""Lorena"" is especially poignant, as it was very popular on both sides of the conflict, reminding the men of loved ones and home.roy-rogers-e-sons-of-the-pioneers-otimaThe presence of The Sons of the Pioneers to the musical makeup of The Searchers is not to be taken lightly. The Sons of the Pioneers were very popular for their cheery, harmonious country singing, and are most famous as a supporting group for Roy Rogers - probably one of the most famous romanticized, ""old school"" cowboys ever. To include them was also a nod to what had come before, creating a melodic irony in the title song.But Ford's biggest trope turnaround was that of the western leading man. With Ethan Edwards, Ford gave star John Wayne one of his most complex characters, and probably his best performance. Ford knew how to use the Duke better than any other director. Just as James Cameron did with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ford utilized Wayne's strengths as an actor to maximum effect. Anyone who believes John Wayne was not much of an actor has clearly never really studied The Searchers.Ford actually made John Wayne a star back in 1939 with Stagecoach. There the Duke was the prototypical western hero - an outlaw, but an honorable one. It was a reflection of the simpler times mentioned above. Wayne's swagger and charisma soon catapulted him into iconic status. Now people around the world would think of the Duke when they pictured the rugged American cowboy.
In The Searchers, Ford uses Wayne's heroic persona to catch the audience off guard - making the emotional impact of events taking place much more resonant. The normally fearless Duke is brought to his knees many times at the off-screen sight and recollection of his raped and murdered kin.Martin Scorsese recalled that seeing Wayne visibly distraught made him imagine what was offscreen had to be absolutely horrible, more so than anything that could have actually been shown onscreen. Indeed the imagination can be much more terrifying.Relating the notion of changing tropes to Ethan, it's interesting that the dynamic between Ethan and Martin is a role reversal - the older, wiser man usually imparts good judgement and humility on to the brash and haughty younger man in the typical western. In The Searchers, however, the younger Martin is the one with common sense and reminds Ethan of his humanity.Searching for Vengeance""What makes a man wander? What makes a man roam? What makes a man leave his bed and board, and turn his back on home?""The Ethan Edwards character himself is a personification of John Ford's ""new old west."" He is a deeply flawed man consumed by vengeance and hatred - the center of the film's moral questions.At the beginning of the film's search, Ethan's motives for finding Debbie are harder to decipher. We assume that his intentions are noble as a bi-product of seeing the form of John Wayne. But as the search goes on, it becomes clearer that he is on a quest to wreak vengeance on the Comanche, simply for being Comanche. In Ethan's mind, being Comanche is not being human.Ethan's hatred of the Comanche extends even beyond death. Early in the film, Ethan and his posse stumble upon a dead Comanche from the raid that killed his brother Aaron and his family.As Scorsese has pointed out, Ethan is not content to let the dead Comanche rest in peace. He must make sure this dead Indian wanders and suffers forever. The satisfaction in his face as he shoots out the dead man's eyes is disturbing, and Ethan's comrades, particularly Reverend Clayton, don't take too kindly to it.The name he gives Martin at the end of that scene (""blankethead"") is also a manifestation of his racism. Martin is part Native American, and Ethan spends most of the film denying Martin as his kin - despite being raised by Ethan's brother as a son.With Ethan's demeanor, Ford wrestles with the truth that both the settlers and Native Americans could be both noble and cruel - a fact of our own sin nature. There is no ""noble savage"" here, nor is there a wholesome settler, either. Even the settler women like Laurie Jorgensen (Vera Miles) exhibit racist tendencies, like when she told Martin that Debbie's mother would have wanted Ethan to kill Debbie after she had been with the Comanche for so long.Granted that the Comanche, particularly the chief Scar, are indeed awful in their treatment of the settlers, and there is no justification for the violence against the women and children. However, both Scar and Ethan share their penchant for revenge. Scar's entire reason for raiding the Edwards homestead and murdering Ethan's kin was vengeance for the deaths of his sons. It's a terrible cycle of violence that will not end until one or both of them are dead.John-Wayne-in-The-Searchers""A man will search his heart and soul, go searchin' way out there. His peace of mind he know's he'll find. But where, of Lord, Lord where?""Ethan's quest for hate and revenge is one of the finest cinematic examples of what such feelings to do one's soul, as well as the physical consequences.",The Searchers
139,williampsamuel,"A Darker, Deeper John Wayne",9,15 January 2015,"This is not your typical western, especially for the period in which it was made. It may have John Ford at the helm and John Wayne in the lead, but hardly standard fare for either of them. There may still be hard working settlers, cowboys, Indians, a somewhat kooky supporting character for comic relief, and yes, a happy ending. But The Searchers is harder edged movie than either man usually made, with darker themes and a blurrier line between the good guys and the bad guys.The clearest indication that this is no Stagecoach or My Darling Clementine is Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards. He's ill tempered, quarrelsome , lacks any form of manners or tact, and harbors a very checkered past. The latter point is not unusual for a western, or a John Wayne character. From Ringo Kid to Rooster Cogburn, he's played plenty of men with skeletons in their closets. What is different here is that there's no attempt to distance Ethan from the more distasteful aspects of his past, or to explain or justify them. Nor is it ever stated exactly what misdeeds he's committed. Instead his past sort of hangs in the background, casting an aura of disrepute over him.And that's only the first impression. After the unseen Comanche raid that is the key to the entire story, we see more of who he really is. When he commits himself to a cause, he is all but unstoppable. He will do whatever he has to, for as long as he has to in order to bring back his niece, no matter how small his chances of success, and no matter what the cost to him or those with him. And though his cause is a righteous one, the same perhaps cannot be said for his reasons. For him his hatred of the Comanches and his all consuming thirst for revenge are motivations every bit as strong as his desire to rescue his niece.And as the film goes on, it becomes less clear whether rescue is really his goal. He keeps searching long past the point where even he expects Debbie to be alive, leading one to ask if his search has any real purpose or if he continues only because he is obsessed and can think of nothing else. And when it's learned that she is alive and well, this brings another question: What exactly does 'saving' her mean to him? Because all this time there's been the unspoken fear that Debbie may not be the same person who was taken away. Ethan knows well that many captives who have remained long with the Indians have themselves become Indians; what settlers called ""the fate worse than death."" With his burning hatred of all things Comanche, this possibility is entirely unthinkable and unacceptable. So the question on everyone's mind is this: Would he rather see her dead than be one of them? The first time I saw this movie, I couldn't believe that he would ever consider that. I mean come on, it's John Wayne we're talking about. But this time, even knowing the end, I had no trouble believing that he was capable of this. You can almost feel his hatred for all things Indian, and his disgust towards a group of 'white Indian' captives seen earlier is unsettling in its intensity. Ethan Edwards is exactly the kind of bitter, obsessed, habitually violent man who would shoot down his own blood for becoming one of 'them.' He would hate himself for it forever after, but he absolutely would be capable of doing it.Jeffrey Hunter delivers another standout performance as Ethan's adoptive nephew Martin. In the course of the film he goes from an excitable, woefully naive adolescent to a grizzled veteran of the trail. Throughout it all he holds a desire to rescue his sister every bit as strong as Ethan's, refusing every plea to go home and make a life for himself. But although he may be every bit as obsessed and stubborn as his uncle, his motives are much purer. Everything he does is for the purpose of bringing his little sister home safe. He does his best to be Ethan's conscience, and he will do whatever he must to protect Debbie- even from his uncle.Beyond the acting and the themes explored, The Searchers is highly impressive visually. The color is lavish by fifties standards, the scenery is breathtaking (even if it has little resemblance to central Texas) and the Indian battles are both excellently staged and historically accurate to a great degree. In fact for a film of the period, The Searchers is remarkably true to history, doing very well in portraying the plight of captives and their families, and the herculean efforts required to recover them. Plus its frank treatment of white attitudes towards Indians at the time, and its mere acknowledgment that white people- especially women- could become Indianized was groundbreaking, even scandalous at the time.I won't say this is a perfect movie. I felt that the comic relief, although effectively done, was more than the story called for. I liked old Mose, but I'm not sure that such a lovably eccentric character really had a place in this movie. Nor did I think the wedding scene really fit, especially the over the top hickishness of the groom. And seeing that most of the Comanche braves were played by actual Indians, I have to wonder why they chose a German born actor to play chief scar. Every time he was on screen I couldn't get past the fact that he was obviously white.These are relatively minor caveats however. The Searchers is a landmark of the western genre, and much deeper than its contemporaries. Although I still wouldn't consider it Ford's best work, it ranks high on any list of westerns, and I highly recommend it to all audiences.",The Searchers

Just the mere fact that it could be filmed was a masterpiece. I love the scenery of the movie. It is desert surrounded by chimney rocks and other rock formations. Still, in the 1860s, pioneers struggled to make a living like they were in the Midwest.The plot of the movie is a bit simple, but there are some great moments in the movie. Firstly, the idea of race. The co-star (Jeffrey Hunter) is only 1/8th Indian, but that some how clouds his character in the mind of his tough uncle (John Wayne). Secondly, Wayne does not play a completely heroic or sensible character. He is so bent upon revenge that he alienates everyone around him. Thirdly, there is a basic understanding of Commanche culture and that whites who are captured by them become ""brainwashed"" into their way of life. In fact, at the fort scene Hunter's character says ""It's hard to believe they are white"". Wayne's character says ""They are not"". Lastly, there is redemption.

I think the film is too long with expendable sequences and situations -seen often in Ford's movies- such as the sort of humorous romance triangle between Jefferey Hunter, Vera Miles and Ken Curtis that doesn't add much to the story . Hank Worden's comic relief would have been enough if that was the idea. In my opinion, Ford was too enthusiastic about this project and lost the sense of simplicity that many times make great movies.A good western anyway and worth seen no doubt, but no more than that in my opinion.",The Searchers
144,dimplet,Keep searching for a better John Wayne movie,6,3 July 2011,"Even more than 30 years after his death, John Wayne has such loyal fans that it seems they still don't realize that he couldn't act. But I guess that doesn't have much to do with their devotion. It is what he represented.This is a good movie, and don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with John Wayne's performance. After 30 years in the business, Wayne had obviously learned a thing or two, and was no longer the tall, stiff youngster with the deer in the headlight look of his early 1930s work. By 1956 he was famous, and comfortable on the screen and in his own skin. But he wasn't playing Ethan Edwards, he was playing John Wayne, just like he did in most movies. This isn't Wayne's best work, and it certainly isn't director John Ford's. There is a too obvious attempt at making a sweeping epic based on a plot that is too thin and characterizations that are too weak. The only parts with any depth are Wayne's and Jeffrey Hunter's. And, frankly, the time line doesn't make any sense to me. How did they manage to spend so many years searching for this little girl who was a grown woman when they found her? Yet he only wrote one letter in five years, apparently the length of the search. Even five years doesn't make sense. And where the heck were they? It doesn't snow in Texas. And where did the deserts come from?OK, so Wayne's character doesn't like Indians, and the movie hints that he is a racist. But we don't see him act out this racism overtly, mainly just subtle looks of disgust. And we don't encounter enough good Indians to make his racist attitudes seem foolish, although there is Look, whom he treated with respect. If you had family killed by Indians, not liking Indians seems fairly reasonable, rather than racist, at least by 19th century standards. If he had been an overt racist who changed his attitude in the course of the search due to encounters with good Indians, this movie would have had some depth. But I don't see the characters evolving much, aside from his gaining respect for Martin Pawley, who is 1/8th (or 1/4th?) Indian. Some people talk about the great directing here, and in the commentary track I heard some interesting points about technique. But you shouldn't need someone to explain to you why you should like a movie, especially a Western. The cinematography was excellent, but how many times have we seen pretty much the same buttes and plains in countless other Westerns? For those who didn't grow up on Westerns and TV dinners I suppose it would have greater impact. I remember seeing ""The Searchers"" years ago, and thinking, it's OK, and my opinion has not improved with age. It's just a Western, and a fairly average one.If you want to see a far more creative Western with Wayne and John Ford directing, try ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (which also features Vera Miles). And they did ""The Quiet Man."" ""Stagecoach"" was a classic, but Wayne was a young and weaker actor. My favorite Wayne movie is ""The Shootist."" His worst is probably ""Rooster Cogburn.""The John Ford movie I have enjoyed watching more than any other is ""Mr. Roberts,"" which also has Ward Bond and Ken Curtis in quite different roles. It was also swan song for the great William Powell. Hank Worden's performance here as a genial idiot is interesting in light of his studying engineering at Stanford. It is a reminder that real actors are not always what they appear to be on screen. And John Wayne was, perhaps, a different person in private. But I cannot think of any other famous actor who got so much mileage out of playing one screen persona for so long, although Hugh ""One Grin"" Grant is in the running, if he lives long enough. John Wayne was famous for playing John Wayne.",The Searchers

146,alfiefamily,Really a wonderful movie!,9,8 August 2003,"A little hokey in spots, but a really beautiful movie to watch. Landscapes and sky of Monument Valley never looked better.  John Wayne is terrific throughout, while Jeffrey Hunter is almost unwatchable at times (especially in scene where he ""loses it"" and goes after the Duke with a knife).  Ward Bond has never had a better part, and Vera Miles is very good. I also can't imagine what made Natalie Wood take the part she has in this film. But the star of this picture is John Ford. His opening and closing shots are two that I will never forget.  Overall, I rate this a 8 out of 10.",The Searchers
147,willrams,Interesting,7,22 June 2003,"I had never seen this film before in its enirety, but now that I have, I found it interesting.  The plot concerns a Civil War veteran who spends many years searching for his young niece and companion who were abducted by Apache Indians..  His name is Ethan played by John Wayne, and he is joined by his nephew, Martin Pawley played by Jeffrey Hunter.  Other actors are Vera Miles, Ward Bond, Natalie Wood, Harry Carey, Jr.  All fine actors!  I felt the film was too long, but it is beautifully directed by John Ford at his best!  This is truly the best film that John Wayne made just before his death in 1959!  7/10",The Searchers
148,son_of_cheese_messiah,Odd inconsistency of tone,5,2 January 2011,"For all this film's reputation, what is apt to strike a modern viewer for the first time is the strange disconnect between the truly horrific subject matter and its sometimes light-hearted even jokey tone. No doubt this was an attempt to make its grim subject matter more accessible to the audience of the time, but IMO it is borderline bad taste. For example the massacre of an Indian village near the end is rather undermined by the following comical scene of some old guy having shot extracted from his behind. This is inappropriate in my opinion, and similar examples abound throughout the film.I suppose this must be judged within its time and its subject matter: brutal murder, abduction, gang rape and a man consumed with vengeance would have been considered too shocking to be shown without lightening the mood. Some of the problem is down to the stereotypes who, apart from the main few characters, seem to lack any depth of feeling in the face of this horror. A Swedish farmer who seems unmoved by the death of his son; a 'comedy' madman; a plain Indian squaw who is accidentally bought by Jeffrey Hunter and her subsequent convenient death; a naive young cavalry man who arrives near the end. That's to say nothing of the motiveless malice of the Comanche.This is not to make the dreary charge of 'racism' for anything which does not conform to the dogmas of political correctness, but merely to say the film does succeed in its own terms.Despite having no time to explore the deeper side of racial tension or families afflicted with horrific suffering, there is plenty of time for embarrassing slap-stick, not helped by the overly homespun stock characters and the wooden performances. Jeffrey Hunter acts like a child at some points, and one can only imagine that in the book he was considerably younger.He's not the only one. There is a long sequence involving a letter written to his beau by Hunter. Despite being the only one in five years, this grown woman stamps her foot and throws the letter on the fire unconvincingly at one point. And again, a long comedy fist fight occurs between the returning Hunter and the man that his girl is to marry.It is through dated and inappropriate sequences like this rather than good characterisation that the film is developed. The cinematic artistry is second to none with the motif of the open door being used to magnificent effect through out.Worth watching as an historical curio, but the 12th greatest film ever made? There are many more less dated films to watch from this period and earlier.",The Searchers
149,Ric-7,New Discoveries,10,12 December 2000,"About ten minutes into the film, there is a shot which begins with Captain Clayton (Ward Bond) slamming a door behind two children who were teasing two young lovers, Lucy and Brad. There follows a wordless interior shot, lasting maybe a minute, wherein Aunt Martha takes out Ethan's Confederate overcoat, tenderly caressing it before she hands it to Ethan. I noticed the sequence when I recently watched the film again, and I had to rewind and play it once more because I found it so stunning--all of the information and emotions conveyed without a word. I'd watched the film previously maybe a dozen times and had never noticed the power of this sequence.Don't for a second tell me that Ethan is a stereotype, because there is so much more at work here. Obviously we are not supposed to sympathize with Ethan's prejudices, but notice that Ethan is not the only one who feels that way. Laurie (not at all disapprovingly) tells Martin that Aunt Martha would have preferred her daughter to be killed after being defiled. Interestingly, Martin is one-eighth Cherokee, which under the old racial percentages of the Confederacy would make him the equivalent of an octoroon, and therefore non-white. Martin's intended marriage to Laurie, on racial terms, would have been as taboo as Debbie marrying Scar: Laurie believes that death is preferable for Debbie, but she intends to do likewise with Martin. The contrast is that Debbie was abducted, whereas Laurie would willingly go. And note at the end that Laurie walks right by Debbie, as she heads for Martin.The final shot is famous, but I noted the doorway theme throughout the film: the message of an open or closed door, whether the character enters the door or just looks in, at other times, the character is inside looking out. And all of this in a 50's western.The movie is not perfect: I could have done without some of the comic relief. However, this is John Wayne's best work (The Shootist is a close second). Those who think this is the best film of all time have good reason to support their belief.",The Searchers
150,NewEnglandPat,John Wayne in a great American film,8,22 April 2007,"This great slice of Americana is the tale of revenge of a Texan on a mission to find a white girl taken by Indians. John Wayne is at his taciturn best as the bigoted Texan who embarks on a five year search for the Comanche band and the girl. Jeffrey Hunter is Wayne's companion is this grim odyssey that has fine scenes of battle with the Indians, tireless searches and touches of comedy that seem out of place in this dark western. Natalie Wood is the girl snatched by the Indians and Vera Miles is Hunter's romantic interest, which has little to do with the main plot. John Ford directed this picture and many consider this film his best work while others have called it an American classic. The movie was filmed in Monument Valley, one of Ford's favorite locations, and Ford's stock regulars are cast in the picture, including Ward Bond, Harry Carey, Jr., Patrick Wayne and Hank Worden. Maxs Steiner's music is one of his best and is a great accompaniment to an excellent film.",The Searchers
151,JohnWelles,Overblown.,6,2 April 2009,"John Ford's so called ""classic"" western ""The Searchers"" (1956) is in reality, nothing more than your average western, that is also (clumsily) trying to say something about racism. Don't get me wrong, I like good westerns. Sit me down in front of one and I'm happy. Some of my favourite movies include such films as ""High Noon"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"". The problem with ""The Searchers"" is that everything it dose, has been done much better. People claim that when Ethan Edwards (John Wayne, a poor performance from an overrated actor) sees his brothers homestead burnt down, it insipid George Lucas in the similar scene in ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". But it was done much better there, and what is more remembered? Also, David Lean apparently watched it many times while making (the brilliant) ""Lawrence of Arabia"" to get an idea on how to film vast empty desert landscapes. But, as I have said before, he surpassed his inspiration. The acting is also indifferent, with Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond, and Natalie Wood giving mundane performances. Some critics say that this film has John Wayne's best role in it, but with a film career that basically involved playing himself anything different has surly got to be a ""career best"". Don't listen to all the undeserved praise, and watch something decent, like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".",The Searchers
152,malvernp,"Interesting Items You May Not Know About ""The Searchers""",9,25 July 2006,"""The Searchers"" has been critiqued by so many people that there is little of significance to add to what has been said already. However, I'd like to offer some further information that you may find useful.The new 50th Anniversary DVD has many good things about it-----but Peter Bogdanovich's rambling and anecdotal commentary is not one of them. While he may be a great admirer of John Ford's work and also produced a documentary about the great director, he is no film historian. Bogdanovich's meandering praise of the film and Ford is certainly well deserved. But the average viewer would have benefited from a more insightful and better organized analysis of ""The Searchers"" than the one he presented. I found it frustrating to listen to his disjointed personal recollections of conversations he had with Ford. While they may have had some limited entertainment value, these musings shed little light on the film itself.The principal villain is Chief Scar---played with stoic detachment by veteran Caucasian character actor Henry Brandon. While there may not have been any Native American actors available in 1956 to do justice to this role, it was somewhat jarring to see Brandon's darkly tinted white face looking out at us under that war bonnet. For fans of movie serials, Brandon appeared 16 years earlier in a different racial disguise-----as the titled evil Yellow Peril menace in ""Drums of Fu Manchu.""The ""adult"" Debbie was played by the appropriately Caucasian Natalie Wood-----heavily and distractingly made up for Technicolor to simulate some sort of Comanche-like maiden, but with a lipstick-enhanced face. She was about as convincing in this role as Debra Paget was as James Stewart's nubile Indian love interest in ""Broken Arrow"" (1950)-----which is no compliment to either actress.This film contains the finest role of Jeffrey Hunter's abbreviated movie career. It shows us what a handsome and talented actor he was---and what a tragedy it turned out to be that he never got another opportunity to do something equally good. Most of his fans know that he was the original Captain of the Enterprise in the ""Star Trek"" television series. His failure to pursue the potential of this role did two significant things (other than exhibit poor judgment); (1) it denied us the chance to see how he would have built, shaped and sustained that character as the series developed; and (2) it opened the door for a major television career for William Shatner that might not have been.As for ""the Searchers""---its greatness endures undiminished and continues to grow after 50 years and numerous mediocre and inconsequential imitations (see e.g. ""Grayeagle"" (1978)).",The Searchers

154,jay4stein79-1,Ineluctable Modality of the Visual,9,8 December 2005,"John Ford's The Searchers that I did not love the first time I saw it, but it is a movie that I can plainly now say I love. Perhaps I was too young. Perhaps I had heard too much about this film and its place at the head of the Western table. When you've heard something described as the greatest _______ ever, you're bound to be let down. I pity anyone who's ever watched the Rules of the Game after I've described it, with complete seriousness, as ""probably the greatest thing ever committed to celluloid."" Why do I think that? Because I didn't know a thing about Renoir's film--because I was able to be blown away. If you're told you'll be blown away, you rarely are. Such is the case, likely, in my initial viewing of The Searchers. Yet this parasite of a film nested near my hippocampus and I've not been able to shake it for four years. I'd never describe it as the greatest western, but it's certainly a great western. It's a gorgeous film to simply watch with the sound off and it has an edge to it most of its contemporaries sorely lack. Yes, the Indians are not sympathetically portrayed, but Ford at least acknowledges that his ""hero"" is anything but. It's the only time a director has placed John Wayne in the position of being a man with dubious morals. That's part of the film's brilliance. Casting against type is common practice today, but in the 1950s? In a studio picture? I'm no expert, but I hazard to guess it was a rare occurrence. Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo and Rear Window comes to mind, but that's about it. It's especially impressive in The Searchers inasmuch as no one had ever even come close to turning the concept of John Wayne as hero on its ear (take a look at Red River, another great western, and you'll see what I mean--Wayne's character is certainly questionable, in that he puts aside all in the hopes of making it as a cattleman, but Hawks never questions the choices of his character. He steals cattle, lets his former wagon train go to the Indians without so much as batting an eye--but those are the right choices according to the film). And John Wayne was certainly game. He makes Ethan an unrepentant racist. He makes us not like him. Aside from the portrayal of cowboy as antihero and John Wayne's performance, The Searchers also contains the best western cinematography I've ever seen. Ford was always excellent shooting along the Frontier, but he tops himself here. The sky is amazing and the rocks too. It's simply a joy to watch and utterly breathtaking. But now you're being set up the way I was. You'll expect greatness and possibly be disappointed. But also, if you're like me, this movie will never leave you alone once you've seen it. It's like Don't Look Now, Chinatown, or Geed. You may appreciate it the first time out without fully enjoying it, but it will get into your brain and not let go. Three years later, you'll find yourself watching it three times in a year and wondering if they look at you funny at the library, seeing as how you take it out so often. You'll put it on the TV just to watch a scene or two, just to absorb a little bit of its magic. You'll understand why everyone calls it the greatest ______ film of all time.",The Searchers

Of course it is of it's time and all of us of a certain age played cowboys and Indians with only one winner, this film plays by those same rules.The parallels between Grits Glen Campbell and The Searchers Jeffery Hunter are quite telling too with both playing young man finding themselves in their respective quests along side the veteran Wayne.That said the film looks great thanks to John Ford's big expansive shots. Nevada looks beautiful harsh and unforgiving.

157,twanurit,Still Disappointing,6,22 June 2006,"I first saw it years ago on a retroactive theatrical double bill with ""Red River"" (1948). I thought the latter was brilliant (still do!), but a recent viewing on DVD of this film has not changed my view...the film doesn't resonate. John Wayne plays one of the most hateful characters ever, a true Indian-hater and monstrous personality. The Indians portrayed here are once again vicious brutes, an unfair and unjust stereotype. Co-star Jeffrey Hunter isn't up to the role, over-playing in a bug-eyed manner, hurting the film, while Vera Miles (slightly resembling the quiet beauty of Cathy Downs as ""My Darling Clementine"" - 1946, a true classic by Ford), usually very capable, over-acts as his girlfriend. Other John Ford regulars are competent, as is the stunning color photography. Henry Brandon glowers as the lead Comanche, yet his Caucasian features and blue eyes belie this. He could be half-breed, but this is never explained. Other Indians are played by authentic Navajoes, which is more authentic. Lana Wood plays Debbie as a kid with blue eyes, yet she grows up as the brown-eyed Natalie Wood. A later wedding scene is played for laughs, but should have been cut. Wayne's character even despises white people who have been abducted by Indian tribes (as if its their fault in this circumstance). The movie just wanders (covering about ten years), be-fitting its title but not moving its audience. As other reviewers have noted,Wayne really was a limited actor, occasionally good within his range, but the excessive swaggering and ""That'll Be the Day"" line (in this film) have become silly. The picture was ignored in 1956, and I'm in agreement 50 years later.",The Searchers

For sure, it is one of the best Westerns ever made, and also a very important film.Like today's television show Breaking Bad, the harsh American west is an important part of the experience. There are plenty of long shots, showing just how empty and desolate the world can be; like the personality of the 'hero', Ethan Edwards. John Wayne impresses more than ever as his conflicted, layered character, a large part of the film's success. The tone of The Searchers shifts throughout the film: through most of the first 70 percent, it is a dark story with little hope. This is also beneficial to the film, as several other westerns I've seen are too lighthearted to be taken seriously. The Searchers has a cloud over its head, so it stands out... until the tone lifts, and it becomes less interesting because of that. After the wedding scene, the overarching sense of dread disappeared.*Spoilers* this cumulated in an ending where everything turns out well: the good guys survive, the girl is rescued, Ethan has a change in heart, the bad guy is killed, and the boy gets the girl. Considering that early, I thought there would be no happy endings at all, this was disappointing that there was no tragedy at the end. *end spoilers*Completed with strong messages about racism and personal transformation, it is clear why The Searchers is so fondly remembered even 50 years later. 8/10",The Searchers
161,joelgodinho,The Greatest Western?,10,4 June 2020,"The Searchers is a wonderful 1956 Western directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles. When I first watched the film I just wasn't expecting it to be so great and after a second watch I think that, despite the fact that I still personnaly prefer Rio Bravo a little bit more, this is the greatest Western of all time (and obviously one of the best films of all time aswell). The performances are all great, except for Wayne's wich is legendary, without a doubt one of the best in history, playing a cold hearted and hateful character that despises the Comanches so much that won't even let them rest in peace in the afterlife as we see when he shoots the dead Comanche eyes, however he isn't completely heartless, we can see trough his look that he is genuinely sad when discovering the brother's burning house (or maybe I just interpreted his look wrongly but I don't think so).
The story is also one of the greatest of the genre resembling a lot Homer's Odissey, and the ending is fantastic.
The cinematography is also really good and there are some shots (I'm obviously talking about the dorway shots in the beginning and espeacily in the ending) that I'd put in a list of top 50 of all time.

164,FilmSnobby,A classic by John Ford; would've been a masterpiece if directed by Sam Peckinpah.,7,9 January 2006,". . . but then, didn't Peckinpah more or less ""re-direct"" *The Searchers*, over and over and over again? Most of the elements of the ""revisionist Western"" are already here, in 1956: a true anti-hero as portrayed by John Wayne; the taste for mindless violence exhibited by most of the characters; the bald-faced presentation of racism in the Old West, and how the historical representation of this fact serves as an indictment on American society as a whole. This movie influenced nearly everyone in its wake: Peckinpah, obviously, but also Coppola (cf. *Patton*), Scorsese (cf. almost his entire oeuvre), Paul Schrader, Sergio Leone (no duh), Tarantino, etc. etc. *The Searchers* still holds up today, but it has a few faults -- not niggling ones, either -- that prevent it, in my view, from being a thoroughly satisfying masterpiece.Ford's style is bolder here than usual. The film announces itself as a determinedly make-believe affair right after the opening credits, when a huge title-card informs us that the setting is ""TEXAS, 1868"", and the first shot we see is of Monument Valley, Arizona, through an opened door of a homesteader's cabin. Ford plays around with locales, weather, and even day and night: one moment Wayne and sidekick Jeffrey Hunter trod listlessly through the Arizona desert, and in the next cut they're bundled up in winter furs amidst the snow of Montana or who-knows-where. Sunlight and moonlight seem to be interchangeable, even within the context of one sequence. Ford had apparently grown weary of natural realism, perhaps even of the business of making movies (or simple ones, at least). The film is self-consciously epic, almost to a self-parodying degree. The usual elements of a Ford film -- the tough guy, the tenderfoot who worships the tough guy, the heehawing comic relief, white actors pretending to be Indians, the wearying vistas of Monument Valley itself, are all bombastically exaggerated in *The Searchers*. Even the plot, which is nothing more or less than a man's years-long search, up and down the entire North American continent, for his niece after she has been kidnapped by the Comanches, is indicative of overstatement.What prevents the film from becoming a baroque failure or an accidental art-house oddity is the presence of John Wayne as the racist ex-Confederate soldier Ethan Edwards. This is Wayne's best role, and he gives it the best performance of his career. In fact, I used to like this film somewhat less than I do now, but several viewings of Wayne's work here have won me over to the film as a whole. Perhaps my own increasing age has helped me to empathize with the crusty old reactionary ""Uncle Ethan"", a man who has lived long enough to allow life's bitter disappointments to calcify his soul. In any event, it's a magnetic, compelling performance. Wayne is never scarier here than when he laughs at something: even his mirth is aggressive and hateful. Frankly, there is nothing -- not even in *Straw Dogs* -- that compares to the joyous and evil glint in Wayne's eyes when, after a member of the rescue party desecrates the grave of a dead brave, Wayne says, ""Why stop there?"" and commences to fire bullets into the dead Indian's eyes. Or when Wayne says he'll keep going after the Comanches ""just as sure as the turning of the Earth."" Or when Wayne commences slaughtering buffalo so that the Comanches will have little to eat in winter. I'm rather shocked that Ford convinced Wayne to take this role on: it's a near-repudiation of everything Wayne believed in. By which I mean, Wayne was always the GOOD guy. In a typical Wayne movie, his character would say to a guy planning to shatter a dead Indian's skull, ""Hey, never mind that -- we got work to do."" Not Ethan. He LIKES that sort of thing.Thank God for Wayne, because the rest of the cast -- with the exception of a spirited Vera Miles as Hunter's long-suffering fiancée -- is well-nigh atrocious. Jeffrey Hunter does not cut the mustard as Martin. (Too bad James Dean was already dead.) In fact, he's so bad here that he drags my rating down 2 stars by himself. Natalie Wood as the kidnapped niece, dressed in face-paint and fringed Comanche gear, is no paean to credibility, either. But the guy playing ""Mose"" is so annoying as to encourage one to hit the fast-forward button. I'm glad Ford found this sort of retarded, heehawing hayseed bit funny, but that's no solace for the rest of us. I put up with Andy Devine in *Stagecoach* mostly because the rest of the cast wouldn't let him finish a sentence, thereby minimizing the damage. No such luck with ""Mose"".7 stars out of 10.",The Searchers
165,StevenKeys,The Searchers,8,13 April 2021,"Based on LeMay's captivity novel by the same title, director Ford's The-Man-Who-Shot-Liberty-Valance (62), How-Green-Was-My-Valley (41) and The-Grapes-of-Wrath (40) are all more nuanced and sentimental, so his Searchers is best known for its Monument Valley panorama (Hoch), iconic story scenes (Edwards massacre, war-painted Scar, Look's face of fear, Marty shields L'il Debbie), one of film's greatest exits (no one steps onto the Plain like John Wayne) and a reciprocating, viewer palpable hatred between Comanche Indians and Texican Settlers. But I favor Ford's harken back to the days of serenade as Charlie McCorry (Curtis), written a dullard when he comes a-courtin (""Haw haw haw!""),' once John puts a guitar into the Ranger's hands you'll see the rival suitor turn virtuoso, filling the void in lonely Laurie's heart: ""Gone again, skip to my Lou, gone again, skip to my Lou, gone again, skip to my Lou, skip to my Lou my dar-ling (3.5/4).""",The Searchers
166,jpdoherty,Steiner's Ignored Contribution!,9,31 May 2011,"The best western ever made is how many regard this 1956 John Ford classic. Its star John Wayne gave his most winning performance and it is reputed to have been his favourite movie even to the extent of his naming his last born son Ethan after the character he played. Ford's beloved Monument Valley in Arizona never looked more spectacular in Vista Vision and colour and over the years the picture has gained cult status. An integral part of the combined elements that makes THE SEARCHERS great is Max Steiner's outstanding score. It is the picture's driving force - its backbone. Steiner's music propels the film forward, unifies the narrative and gives greater density to its key scenes. In fact without his music much of the picture's impact would be considerably diminished. Yet I am consistently amazed and at a total loss to see here on these pages - where the best part of 400 reviews appear - that Steiner's music is hardly referred to at all by any of the writers. Not only that but even on the extras of the last DVD release three well established film directors, Martin Scorsese, John Milius and Peter Bogdanovitch each speak glowingly of Ford's masterpiece but fail to mention Steiner's exceptional contribution. Bogdanovitch, at one stage, briefly mentions the music and how good it is but never puts a name on its composer. I find this not only doctrinaire but quite bizarre that these three men, who you would imagine should know better, would have such a detached attitude concerning one of the most perfectly conceived scores for a motion picture. Therefore I will attempt here to amend this anomaly and the afore mentioned omissions and give some deserving credence to Max Steiner's exceptional music for THE SEARCHERS which has well earned its place in the history of cinema.A veritable orchestral explosion opens the picture in the form of a fanfare over the Warner Bros. logo. As the credits roll we hear the haunting Stan Jones ballad ""Song Of The Searchers"" wonderfully rendered by Ford favourites The Sons Of the Pioneers. The composer later interpolates this song into his score as the theme for the racist protagonist Ethan Edwards (Wayne). Then a lovely version - scored for guitar, solo trumpet and strings - of the traditional ballad ""Lorena"" plays under Ford's evocative 'frame within a frame' opening scene as the door of a remote homestead opens to reveal an approaching rider. It then skillfully segues into ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" to point up the rider's confederate allegiance. The ""Lorena"" ballad later becomes the family theme and is especially effective on solo violin for the scene where Ethan gives the young Debbie his wartime medal as her ""gold locket"" (""Oh, let her have it - it doesn't amount to much"" declares Ethan somberly). And later it is arrestingly heard on spinet as Ethan bids farewell to the family and rides out with the posse to begin what effectively will be his great search. But where the score really shines is in the powerful music for the Indian sequences. Here there is a palpable authenticity in the scoring. Aided by the clever orchestrations of Murrey Cutter and some virtuoso playing by the Warner Bros. orchestra (particularly in the percussion section) Steiner fires on all cylinders adding realism, pathos and a sense of foreboding. There are echoes of the composer's ""King Kong"" (1933) in the cue for the scene where the Indians surround the posse and the music becomes rhythmically savage for the charge at the river and for the attack on the Indian camp near the finale. The composer's celebrated ""Indian Idyll"" (which he originally wrote five years earlier for the Burt Lancaster picture ""Jim Thorpe-All American"") comes into play and can be heard to splendid effect in the Indian camp sequences and as the motif for Look, Martin's (Jeffrey Hunter) new Indian ""wife"". Hearing these cues one can't help but wonder how remarkable it is that this most romantic of film composers - steeped in the musical tradition of late 19th century Vienna - his birthplace - should be so ethnically proficient at musically depicting the native American. More akin to what we have come to expect from this composer are lovely cues such as the sprightly theme for Martin and the lush and sweeping music for Martin and Laurie (Vere Miles). The score - and the movie - ends just like it began with ""The Song Of The Searchers"" playing as Ethan and Martin finally bring Debbie home and conclusively the door of a homestead closes on Ethan where a brief fortissimo quotation from that explosive fanfare closes the picture.Alongside the great film music works of Miklos Rozsa, Alfred Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin and others Max Steiner's music for THE SEARCHERS stands head high as one the finest scores ever written for one the finest films ever made and as such should, and must, be alluded to in any dissertation or essay on the film.",The Searchers
167,luisguillermoc3,Beyond the form shown overdue deep,5,16 March 2010,"With regard to form, this film by John Ford is impeccable: the staging, lighting, image composition... are of absolute prices and some plans are a pictorial beauty. With that, I think Ford has dazzled more than a critic and has gained favor, especially when it stops there capacity criterion. Some story elements are also noticed the skill of a master: for example, the subtlety with which he speaks of quiet love, respect for the brother, feel Martha and Ethan. She puts it all with a glance or caress their clothes when he is about to leave. He expressed avoiding looking at her or shouting first his name when the worst has happened. If this had been just a love story, I think Ford would have given us a lesson in cinema as they already gave us with ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or ""How Green Was My Valley."" Unfortunately, with the weight of John Wayne in tow, the shift was brutal and we soon passed to a history of hatred and vengeance of fascism ordinary. The Comanches, no explanation for his actions, springing up like butchers wild, kidnappers and abusers of women who traumatize even lead to insanity, then, is justified the action of Ethan dirt, in West Texas, to clean the world of junk India. The character of Wayne is shameful, vile, and placed face to face with beings whom he attacks, violating every rule and every protocol, as we did between their green berets. I do not know what he could influence the intentions of Ford or if he / she communed with the feelings of the Duke - so close link could not be free - but the film's narrative combines fully with the sentiments in private the famous cowboy: ""I do not think we have done wrong in taking away this great country - said Wayne, in 1971, Playboy magazine -. People needed to lands and Indians, in their selfishness, they wanted to preserve for them. "" The character of Ethan, biased and irrational, only sees the Indians as savages intruders because, like all fascist dazed, still dreaming of the white race is superior. So it is on the threshold of Jorgensen, after this act of condescension and vengeance fulfilled - not of comprehension. He feels that since the house is contaminated, opening the door to a Comanche... although that ""Indian"" is his own niece. The bond he had with Martin (smeared Cherokee) was also due more to pressure and brotherhood of it, than his own will. And Martin, therefore, is the most coherent and grounded character in this deplorable story. I'll take the Ford of social dramas and great adventures. The West Ford - with just one exception - it exudes a strong odor of racism, machismo kitsch, and a few other things, that impoverish and cloud our coexistence.",The Searchers

Any competent historian is struck with a 19th Century version of a Sonderkommando death squad in Podolia herding captured Jews.This film is briefly noted in the classic history ""Empire Of The Summer Moon"" by S.C. Gwynne - if you have never read the book you truly should to just get a true understanding of what makes Texas what it is.John Wayne-Ethan Edwards notes how he is different than the Indians by stating ""....never met someone who wouldn't quit"" This was true - until the Texicans, Rangers arrived the Comanche had successfully and completely defeated all the native-American tribes, Spaniards and Mexicans they'd encountered.I cannot recommend this film enough - it is the best performance in Wayne's career - he should have been nominated for the AA and given it hands down - his contempt for decorum, for niceties, for manners for respect and courtesy is throughout the film and his self-exclusion at the end of the movie is truly a self-assessment of where he belongs - anywhere but where reason and planning for the future is the expected norm.There is not one bad cast in the entire film -",The Searchers

But is Ethan in love too? When Ethan reaches his brother's wasted farm he screams just one name, and this name is (somewhat unexpectedly) ""Martha"": an unreasonable, desperate hope that she's still alive. One single cry shows us Ethan's love for Martha: a profound touch by the artist John Ford.
Lars Jorgensen says ""My wife reads very well: she was a school-teacher..."" A whole life of deep, proud love summarized in few words! And note how Ford reveals his own affection and esteem for simple folks, showing their shy admiration for learning. A great poet at work...The tough reverend Clayton says to a badly wounded mate that he has nothing to heal him, but can give him the Bible: it will be a consolation! This splendid humoristic touch gives a striking representation of the spirit of the 19th century.Powerful story, awesome beauty of sceneries, strong psychological design, the Duke's fantastic acting and monumental presence.

170,cutter-12,Aside from Shane the most complex western,9,4 March 2001,"Ford Films were all somewhat (on the surface anyway) marred by slapstick brawling and maybe too much sentiment, and yes even some actors embellishing their lines. Ford made movies everyone could relate to.If you weren't a person prone to profound thinking and just wanted to see an entertaining movie for two hours, Ford pictures spoke to you on that level. If you wanted something that went deeper, Ford provided it in the same film.A perfectionist like George Stevens could have never side-tracked a masterpiece like Shane with moments of comic relief like Ford does in a plethora of his more serious pictures. But like the lead character played by John Wayne, the Searchers is a schizophrenic story with schizophrenic moods and offers several theories as to what drives it psychologically. Those who dismiss this film because of the above mentioned flaws are really only scratching the surface. This is a very complex, introspective and ultimately moving film.Though not the perfect film Shane is as Shane presented the original lone drifter in love with a woman he can't have with the possibilities of even deeper implications and truths to the subtext only the audience can work out for themselves. The searchers gives us a similar man, no less complex, but troubled and driven by darker demons - racism, hatred and obsession. You could see this film a hundred more times and never be exactly sure what is going on in it, never quite being able to figure out the motives behind the lead character.My theory (as with my theory in Shane that Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur's characters knew each other long before she married Van Heflin) is that Martin Pawley is actually Ethan Edwards' Son. Some may scoff at this but if you delve into the character deep enough to read between the lines, things do start to come clear. There are more than enough moments in the film which hint at it, if not spell it right out:The scene early on at the dinner table where Aaron tells of Ethan rescueing Martin after a massacre and bringing him to Martha and Aaron to raise as their own. ""It just happened to be me, no need to make more of it"" Ethan morosely downplays as if he doesn't want any questions to be raised should the discussion continue. Could it be Ethan, for reasons known only to he and Martha that they could not be together, eventually married an Indian woman in her stead and had a child with her only to have her slaughtered by the same Comanche leader who would soon wipe out his brother's family and steal Debbie?Ethan has hatred for the Comanches but is tolerant with the other Indian tribe encountered in the story, leading one to believe his so-called racist attitudes have boundaries. If Martin were his son he might not be ashamed so much as sensitive as to what his kin folk might have thought of his interacial marriage. Or maybe he wrestled with it himself and never quite reconciled the feelings within himself.In any case, his jovial behavior in the scene where the Indian Girl joins them after ""marrying"" Martin bespeaks of a man who has been through it himself and is enjoying watching his son go through the same experience. Ethan is well versed in Indian Language and custom, something he would be incapable of if he were an outright racist bent on seeing them all destroyed. The scene where the Comanche Chief Scar tells him ""You speak good Comanche, somebody teach you?"" is an obvious clue as to Ethan being possibly married years before to an Indian woman. Later he tells Martin that one of the scalps hanging in Scar's Teepee belonged to Martin's mother.John Wayne's character could very well have had unfinished business with scar and the suspicion at the outset that Debbie was with him might have been the reason above all why he couldn't see past eventually killing the girl when he found her. If Martin weren't Ethan's son why would Ethan suddenly hand him an improvised will bequeathing him his worldly possessions after being wounded. The fact that he rejects Debbie as being his blood kin is neither here nor there as, given his state of mind and character, he can only bring himself in this moment of truth to just hint at the truth.Just like Ford does himself - only lays hints and clues to the truth and lets you figure it out for yourself. There are many more things going on this film to mention. Like a true piece of art, this film probes issues, poses challenging questions and let's you arrive at your own conclusions. A long way from being over-rated as some have said here.",The Searchers
171,walsh-22,The best John Wayne and John Ford picture,10,20 May 2007,"This is yet another film that portrays Indians in a negative way, I don't think Wayne was a racist like some have suggested but the Film Industry at the time was and I do get very angry at the negative side that is shown, the Indians are not shown in any positive light.It is a serious story about Indians killing John Wayne's family except his young niece who is kidnapped and raised by the Comanches. In the film much is made of how it is better to be killed instead of being captured by the Indians. I can well believe it was the same view of the people in those days.I don't think I have ever seen John Wayne play such a character like Ethan Edwards who is so bitter and prejudiced and rather see his niece dead than alive and living with Comanches. He makes his intentions clear that he won't hesitate to kill her himself. I don't understand why when he has the chance to kill Debbie he doesn't do it. Is it that seeing Scar dead, he sees something about how he died as an indication that Debbie warned Marty that Scar was sneaking up behind him? It is never clear why he has a change of heart.I do find the character Laurie Jorgensen played by Vera Miles to be irritating at times.It is a longer western than usual. Apart from the date at the start, there is no indication of how long the search has gone on for till the characters tell the audience.John Ford is very good at setting the mood of westerns and the use of the camera showing how big the frontier was in the 1800s and how far away families were from one another and that there was nothing around for miles and you had to be on your guard against the dangers of frontier life.It wasn't till I watched this film that I recognised Jeffrey Hunter as the first captain of Enterprise, Captain Christopher Pike in Star Trek.There are some very funny moments and lines delivered mostly by John Wayne and Ward Bond. The scenes I laugh the most at is when Marty and Charlie are fighting over Laurie and the interaction between Ward Bond and a young Lieutenant in the Army.I do like this film, I particular love Jeffrey Hunter and Natalie Wood. It is especially sad that Natalie Wood was cut down in the prime of her life as she was a very fine actress.",The Searchers
172,BoomerDT,Wayne and Ford's Greatest Collaboration,10,20 May 2014,"Not too much to add to what has been posted about one of the truly epic westerns of all time. I did get a chance to finally watch it on big screen hi-def, w/surround sound and was truly knocked out by the cinematography, the incredible locations and the great action scenes. But above all this is John Wayne's finest performance. I like it when Duke plays a darker character, such as Dunston in ""Red River"" or Ralls in ""Wake of the Red Witch"" or Striker in ""Sands of Iwo Jima."" Ethan Edwards is a man who is obsessed with revenge after virtually all of the only family he knows has been savagely killed by a Comanche attack, including the unrequited love of his life, his sister-in-law, Martha. The question becomes in his search for Debbie, the youngest daughter who was taken prisoner by the Comanche-will he kill her rather than see her living as a Comanche bride?Besides Wayne's brilliant performance, many other excellent performances from John Ford's stock western troupe of actors. Ward Bond, who quite simply was in more great movies than any other actor (check out his IMDb page) turns in another solid performance as Capt. and Reverend Clayton, doubling as the theological and military leader of the community of settlers in desolate W. Tx. Jeffrey Hunter has the 2nd biggest role as Martin Pauley, who was the adopted son of the Edwards family, pretty much scorned by Ethan because he has Indian blood. Martin grudgingly earns Ethan's respect, partially because of his courage and also because he provides a voice of conscience to Ethan. There is a romantic subplot involving Martin and Laurie, his childhood sweetheart played by Vera Miles who has become weary of waiting for Martin to return from his 5 year search for Debbie.As mentioned, if you love this movie check out Glen Frankel's book with the same title.

This movie has a wonderful cinematography, a great performance by John Wayne, impressive colors throughout the whole film and even funny moments that make you laugh. Of course, it has good things. But there are also things like these: The timing is wrong; 5 years pass as if they were 2 months. Natalie Wood looks everything but a captive girl of the indians. The dialogue is stupid at several times. The movie is too short for the story behind it, so short that we don't have time to react. There are no pauses to let us think about what we have seen so far.

User rcjteng did a nice job of defending the movie vis a vis the race issue. See link here:http://www.imdb.com/user/ur3345520/commentsI wanted to add a couple of things to rcjteng's excellent comments:1) The only racist in the movie is Ethan Edwards, but he's an extremely NEGATIVE character. He does all kinds of racist things, but we are not supposed to like him or approve of his actions.The movie generates much of its interest and tension by casting the ultimate white hat good guy, Duke, in such a negative role. Gary Cooper would have never taken that part. Stars in those days protected their good guy images.rcjteng mentions that Ethan shoots 3 white men in the back. I wanted to add that he proceeds to rob one of the dead bodies. Ethan is hardly a noble hero in the movie.2) When Ethan meets with Scar, Scar explains that he kills white people in retribution for the fact that white people killed his two sons.

We can only hope that we weak and frightened post-modern Americans never have to face the hardships, the rigors of the time Ethan lives through but in a larger sense we all live in a time that presents a challenge and hope to meet them with the grace and courage of Ethan. Forget the claims of racism. Forget the concerns with accuracy as to milieu. This is a great movie that portrays a great soul on a mission that was both difficult and yet could not be resisted by the characters or by those in the audience not warped by our current passion for anti-American criticism. Again this is a great movie and John Wayne brings it to life and to relevance. Now more than fifty years later I bless his memory for the gift he gave us with this film. No other actor could have given us this vision, this memorial to our past that allows a glimpse at greatness.

176,bob-790-196018,The Best Western of All Time,10,13 July 2010,"John Ford made many fine movies, but this one has more poetry than any other. The first 20 minutes or so are perfection. The cowboy song over the credits is instantly followed by Max Steiner's evocative score. Everyone recalls the opening scene as Ethan appears in the distance and rides toward the ranch house There is the look of amazement on the young boy's face--he can't even remember an Uncle Ethan. For me, the scene with Ward Bond eating his donuts, staring straight ahead while completely aware of what is going on with Ethan and his sister in law, is one of the high points of the movies--a silent scene that says volumes about all three characters.There's no question that the movie is flawed. The attempts at humor make me flinch. The portrayal of Martin Pauly's Indian ""wife"" is cruel. Ethan's change of heart in the end is hard to justify from all that has gone before.But it is a masterful movie nonetheless. Ford's understanding of community--with all the set pieces and folk music and traditions that bind people to one another and help to civilize a savage land--has never been more evident. The scene of the folks assembled at the gravesite, singing one of Ford's favorite songs, ""Shall We Gather at the River,"" is haunting and beautiful.There are those who would call this movie politically incorrect, and those who cannot forget John Wayne's jingoism during the Vietnam War, but they miss the point.

177,Mickey-2,A focus on one man's effort to find a missing family member which results in his finding humaneness instead,9,23 January 2000,"""The Searchers"", a 1956 western starring John Wayne and directed by John Ford, is today rated as a true cinematic treat for the viewer.  It's a great cast, Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond, and other members of the John Ford ensemble.  The setting is Ford's favorite area to shoot a film in, Monument Valley, and the photography is spectacular.  All in all, it rates a truly magnificent picture.John Wayne portrays a hard-boiled veteran of the Civil War, Ethan Edwards. Edwards returns from the losing effort of the War, and one instantly senses that the war had taken his inner nature and hardened it to stone, unwilling to accept anything that goes against his unbending principles of right and wrong.  There is a raid on his brother's farm by Comanche Indians, and Edwards finds all the family members, save the two girls, murdered.  He vows to search the ends of the earth to find them, and he is joined in this hunt by Hunter and Harry Carey, Jr.The search takes the group from one end of the plains to the northern borders of Canada, and covers a period of five years.  In that time, the viewer can sense that Wayne's character is becoming more bitter towards, not only the Indian tribe, but also towards Debbie, the one surviving niece. Several episodes bear this out, including a scene at a fort where some white captives are viewed by Wayne, who is disgruntled with what the captives have turned into.Ultimately, the search does come to an end, and Wayne's character has to come to grip with his inner feelings-how does he feel towards his niece; is it a sense of family that is going to win out, or is he going to kill Debbie, due to her being with the Indians for so long?A very deserving film of the notation ""A classic""  9 out of 10",The Searchers

Unlike the novel, which is deeply and unapologetically hateful to the Comanches, the movie presents a more even-handed view and shows that Comanche warriors and American soldiers were quite equal in their barbarous, murderous behavior toward the weak and defenseless.  The movie is also well sprinkled with comic relief. And the minimalist, suggestion-laden scene of the Comanche raid is chilling.The fundamental problem with THE SEARCHERS is its denouement.  Without giving too much away, the climax comes when two of the main characters abruptly change their minds about choices they've adhered to steadfastly through years and years - and the movie gives us not the slightest clue what motivated them to this change of heart!  It is essentially a deus ex machina ending, about as realistic as ending a movie with John Paul II converting to Buddhism.In addition, the movie is on the slow side, though the beautiful Monument Valley shots make up for it somewhat.  The supporting cast is weak, and Jeffrey Hunter overacts badly.  Scar and the other Comanches do not make very convincing Indians.You won't be wasting your time if you rent this movie.

Ethan Edwards is a really dark character full of hate for his niece's captors, and Wayne captures this feeling through his expressions and actions.The John Ford ""stock company"" performs their respective roles to their usual excellent level.

182,gentendo,Aesthetically speaking on Cinematography,7,13 November 2007,"The theme of this film is a complex one that is supported through its use of cinematography: When estranged family relations are reconciled after long and bitter wars, traces of angst, resentment, and fear continue to live within the family unit like a parasitemore particularly with certain veterans who have suffered more than most. The result of this suffering is one that makes the individuals more autonomous. Their actions not only affect themselves, but also those around them. However, the choices that a person makes after having suffered for so long are not always rational, but sometimes mingled with racial intolerance, revenge, and fear of otherness.The opening scene of the film depicts the estrangement that has existed within the Edwards family for quite some time. The camera trucks through an open door with a leading woman to direct the viewer's attention towards the beautiful outside world of Texas. Already this seemed to be making a commentary on the idea of reconciling the estrangedthat is, starting from black, and then opening to a door full of mesmerizing colors. The blackness produced a feeling of estrangement that was then reconciled into a world of colors (foreshadowing the family situation). After the woman stops on the porch to view the desert scenery, the shot persists for a moment or two while the viewer sees in the distance a man riding up on his horse. The use of deep space in this shot seems to suggest the lost hero of the story returning home with honor to his family that awaits him with welcoming hands. Appropriate use of distance and the rule of thirds are also implemented throughout this scene to help the viewer understand the estrangement.The angst of the recent Civil War consequently inflicts certain fears and prejudices upon the members of the Edwards family. A rather poignant moment that brilliantly captures this fear is shortly after the Ranger posse goes out to search the incident of the scattered cattle. Meanwhile at the Edwards home, the lighting becomes laced with dark reds and oranges and pours through the open doors and windows. The atmosphere is ominous and the anticipation seems deadly. A certain camera movement clinches the fear and terror of the Indian ambush that is about to unfold. As Lucy Edwards realizes the danger of her family's situation, the camera trucks forward to a close-up of her face as she screams in terror.When Ethan Edwards finds out that the Indians have burned and pillaged his brothers home, he is enraged with revenge and gathers a team of searchers to find the two lost daughters. A rather engaging cinematic sequence that helps convey the fear of otherness and revenge is during the searchers first encounter with the Indians. In this scene, the Indians clearly out number the searchers as they began to slowly move in on them from both sides of the desert mountains. The camera distance between both parties as they grow closer and closer to each other produces a sense of angst and expectation. Proper camera tracking and reverses are used to show both sides of the Indians breaking their own fear of othernessan action that implies that they have to destroy what they fear. A frontal long-shot is used to show both parties in frame as the call to retreat is sounded. Immediately, both sides race past the camera to begin the battle of racial intolerance that will be exploited throughout the rest of the film.",The Searchers
183,asenkron,A simple story about a little child,6,9 November 2007,"One more disappointment. In the way, that I started out to complete IMDb top 250, unfortunately one more film and one more disappointment. I suppose this one won't be the last one. I was hopeful about this while starting to watch. By the time, meaningless tags, absurd dialogs and of course a nonsense purpose that means reaching a little girl.According to the story, Ethan goes to his brother's house after years and he's intended to settle down yet but natives don't agree with them. Marty had lost his family by the attacks of natives and now he lives with Ethan's family. In one way, Marty carries his destiny with him to new family. In other words, the end of family of Ethan's brother is same as Marty's family. After that Ethan and Marty set out to find Ethan's little niece Debbie who was only survivor during the attack.The story is so simple like I said above. Ethan and Marty come across with natives so many times and you don't see any other thing. A letter that Marty wrote to his darling and shootings continue during the film. Not a skillful playing, not a spesific scenario, not a good direction. There is almost nothing I can assume positive. Search after search, Search after search and Search after search. Result : A boring story.I know lots of people will attack me because of my comments but I have a right to disapprove...",The Searchers

Negative Native American Stereotypes are at the maximum volume here but that works in the films favour. John Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards arrogance is infuriating but you still want him to succeed but you have no idea what exactly you want him to succeed at. I believe the film is trying to get you to understand the prejudice felt towards Native Americans at the time.",The Searchers
185,LBytes,More than just a Western,8,24 December 2004,"A story set in Texas, Monument Valley substitutes for the less dramatic Texan landscape. Only Hollywood would think that log cabins would make sense in a vast scrubby area with almost no trees, water or land you can actually make a living on. This is what popped into my mind when I saw the 1st scene. Its a fantastic photogenic country, but it ain't Texas. Fortunately you can learn to live with the substitution after a while.John Wayne made plenty of standard gung-ho movies and even a few comedies, The movie is full of stereotypes. Murdering savage Indians on the warpath, stealing women and generally being a pain in the ass. Brave frontiersmen charge into an Indian village and shoot at anyone, moving or not. Feuds that last a lifetime. Classic Western music marking it as a product of WWII era. Etc... You could sign it off as almost a caricature of a Western. Racism, senseless slaughter of man and beast, brutality, etc.. , but what they miss is John Ford knew it was there when he made the film. When Wayne's character starts firing madly at the buffalo herd, when he shoots people in the back or determines to kill the girl that ""The'Searchers' have been looking for because she's 'been living with a buck', you have to make the leap that he's playing an unlikeable bigoted murderous man by intent, and that this isn't a standard John Wayne role. His experience in the Civil War, warfare with Commanche and seeing his womenfolk raped and murdered has made its mark. John Ford telegraphs the message over and over again in dialog and scenes that a lot of bad things are happening, and even though some of the characters don't seem to know it and act like dumb bumpkins, the killing-that-begat-more-killing also gives the Commanche plenty of reasons to want to murder white settlers. Only near the end does Wayne soften a bit, apparently finally moved by the undying loyalty of the other 'Searcher' had for finding and protecting his 'sister', regardless of the life that was imposed on her or that she really wasn't his sister. This is difficult material in the PC days we now live in and except for some revisionist tripe it doesn't get touched with a 10 foot pole. Jeffrey Hunter plays the other Searcher. He was almost the Captain of the Enterprise in original Star Trek Series, playing it in the series pilot. There's several other notable actors.Even though it has a higher purpose than one might first think, I can't give this movie a top score as there's just too much hokey stuff in it. The music just isn't my type. There's also a disjointed staging of scenes sometimes; characters are here one moment, then without any segue or sense of continuity, a new scene just starts and they're somewhere else. John Ford's strength is in capturing stunning landscapes, camera placement and framing a shot. In that he's been much admired and imitated.The DVD looks good and with 1.85 anamorphic data gets about as much on a 16:9 screen as a DVD can. The sound is a bit simpler with just a 2.0 Mono. My subwoofer only thought it was getting something to do. A few extras amazingly include some location shots. 7/10",The Searchers

The film is only two hours long and considering how many times I have watched this film since that time I genuinely never realised until today what the running time was, maybe its not important, because I think it is a timeless classic. I have not made a comment before about any films position in the IMDb top 250 but I am surprised that this film does not even make the top 250. It is a visual treat from the first second to the last and in order to appreciate why this film is so good, when you do watch it I suggest you just lose yourself in it and try to observe everything that takes place.

They are so annoying, non-stopped playing by orchestra to either overly blasted or to sync every move of the characters, exactly like the soundtracks used in cartoon to match every move of Micky Mouse, Donald Duck, Road Runner....overly exaggerated, loud, and non-stop. And those songs specially written as title songs are also so annoying and most of the time, unnecessary.This ""Searcher"" is not as good as ""The Unforgiven"" written by the same author as novels, then adapted into movies by the same guy. John Wayne played a 100% certified racist, stubborn, self-righteous, cold-heart Confederacy veteran. There are so many comedian, clown-like characters in this movie that make this it sometimes more like a comedy. The seriousness of the heavy subject of searching his kidnapped niece mixed up with those comic characters and the exaggerated funny dialog, simply makes this movie lose its focus.I have watched this movie long time ago and considered it pretty good, but when I watched the second time, I just felt quite the whole movie simply quite unbearable, the soundtrack, the background music, the songs, the dialog, the acting and the directing, everything just felt overly staged, pretentious and dated. I didn't feel anything enough to move me or touch me. The acting and the storyline simply couldn't connect me with any emotion or empathy feelings. The day and night different feelings about this specific Western movie only proved that this movie's limits, otherwise I wouldn't have such totally different evaluation and judgement from the best to a lousy mix bag.

It has everything - really it's more mythology than a movie.  John Ford, the quintessential American director, really outdid himself here. It stands with ""The Grapes of Wrath"" as his very finest work in a legendary career.  This movie will make you laugh, get your blood racing with the adventure it relates, and break your heart on top of it.  It has an emotional pulse that always gets to me.  John Wayne may have given some bad performances in his career, but it's hard to see how any other actor you could name would have been as effective as he is here.  This was the performance he gave that was most deserving of an Oscar - and the film received big fat zero nominations.  Guess they couldn't appreciate an American Classic in 1956!",The Searchers

Here you have John Wayne battling a bunch of ""injuns"" which he holds in great disdain.  They go ""searching"" for a lost girl that goes on for 10 years.  Something that made no sense to me is why they sent her outside to sit next to the tombstone by herself during an emergency.  Wouldn't they have rather had her inside to protect her?  Perhaps I missed the point of that.For the same reason Gone with the Wind will soon be known as a folly of the past, The Searchers will be dethroned from its classic status as well.  This would have been a decent film if I weren't rooting for the Indians... the film just doesn't work in that way which is why I found it so intolerable. Now I haven't seen a lot of John Wayne, but I bet this is a classic because of the great cinematography and the epic nature of its story.

190,elcoat,Probably America's greatest film for which John Wayne was unjustly denied an Oscar.,10,12 July 2014,"John Wayne was a bigger than life American. (In looks and demeanor, he reminds me of my own late WW2-generation father who was only locally known.) And the film The Searchers is a - maybe *the* - classic American film, which deserved a dozen Oscars, including for Best Actor. That Wayne did not get that is one of the all-time historical Hollywood injustices and an enduring indicator of the shallowness of Oscar judging.I have read that Wayne was hard to live with during filming, he was so absorbed into the Ethan Edwards character, and from his intensity in the film I can believe that.The look of absolute hatred in his eyes in the fort, when he sees a white captive woman insanely mourning the death of her Indian baby who had been killed during her rescue by the U.S. cavalry, is one of the most unforgettable moments in film.As far as topic - the search for kidnapped family members and for murderers of family - the modern films Hardcore starring George C. Scott and Taken starring Liam Neeson are parallel. We have even more savages today, without any extenuating justification of ancient tribal ways of life and customs.Thus, the power of this film is its direct arousal of the male role and duty instinct to protect loved ones: rescue and also revenge against anyone who has hurt them. The sister of one of my own ancestor, Susannah Willard Johnson was, along with her husband and children, taken captive for ransom up to Canada by Indians allied to the French just before the French and Indian War (and Michael Mann's Last of the Mohicans with Daniel Day-Lewis is a masterpiece as well). Her Narrative is one of the classic pieces of American literature.It is incredible the film did not get Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and most of all Best Actor. I believe the reason is that it is so unsparing in its depiction of Indian raids and their grief and suffering ... and in showing that whites could be just as ruthless in revenge.But, eventually, even Ethan's hatred would be abated.",The Searchers
191,jcohen1,Worth the Search,10,7 December 2007,"While obviously no comedy, this classic's still has lots of humor in it yet doesn't gets enough credit for the sarcasm and smiles in it. From madrocker Mose Harper, likely muse for The Band's Robbie Roberston's Rockin Chair; to weird old Charlie McCrory, the precursor of Jim Nabor's weird/normal speech/song bit. There's a troupe of comic actors present but it's the serious actors having fun that is the real treat. Martin Pawley getting literally shoved around by Lori; later mocking the Duke. Pawley unwittingly trading goods for an Indian squaw. The Duke for needling him as a newlywed. Ward Bond as Reverend/Captain slurping down hot coffee and dunkin donuts, constantly challenged and called on it by Wayne. Near the denouement he gets a sabre in the rear. Even Scar shows he can duel verbally with the Duke. You speak good Commanche, take a Berlitz course?Aside from the comic relief there is of course a classic movie with incredible drama and fine acting by the Duke and Jeff Hunter. I've watched this film ten times and while I""m starting to believe Ethan and Martha may have begat the object of The Search, I'm not sure. If I ever figure it out- ""That'll be the day.""

He's accompanied by a half-breed young man that his brother's family took in as a child after -his- family was slaughtered by white men.Everyone plays their part adequately but I just couldn't get past my dislike for John Wayne. I've never cared for him much and thought this film -may- change that ... but it didn't. I just don't like anything about him.The best thing about the film was the cinematography.

John Wayne seems to be so comfortable playing a role that he liked most: a cowboy trying to be fair that almost convinced us - the spectators - that he was born 'rided horseback'. By the way, in the most genuine gender of American personage, Wayne is that actor who is unforgettable! And John Ford?

The Tragedy! The Wit!All the above are in fine form. Not that this movie is without flaws. But there are so many phenomenal set pieces and classic camera shots in this film that it defies the faults and lingers on everything that made this a great film. A memory that influenced many filmakers in the ensuing years.
When someone asked Orson Welles who he studied to influence his film work, his reply was 'The 3 Masters! John Ford! John Ford and John Ford. Although (I believe) this comment was made before 1956, this movie is a testament to that statement. The camera is normally pulled back because the characters and the landscape are one. Though it may prevent the viewer from becoming emotionally attached to the characters, this is a film that is simple storytelling with many underlines that is rewarded with repeat viewings (the rev'rend noticing Martha pay affectionate homage to Ethan's coat, then sipping his coffee pretending not to notice).And so many awesome shots! The look on Ethan's face as he realizes he's too far away to help his brother and family, Ethan's approach to the burning homestead (accompanied by a wonderful Max Steiner score), the ceiling beams, the majestic hunt, crossing the frozen wilderness, the river battle, the doorway shots...and the poor rev'rend's butt!John Wayne plays a character that is further removed from his other performances (Red River is a close kin) that dominates every scene he's in (like most of his other movies), but here he's stung with a dark side that is almost unsettling to his usual persona. It works very well.John Ford claims that movies are meant to be watched. This film proves it.

This couldn't feel any more stale if you attached mould to it.The story is straight forward at first, but soon becomes a wild goose hunt over many years, in which time we go through all the clichés of tradition that stifles this film to death. We have the ""You're not going"" argument, the ""You're too young to drink"", the kid who can't read very well lark, even the ""Careful it's loaded"" gun throw. Just terrible. It's little wonder why kids of today are getting their own back on their seniors after years of ridicule & obsessive discipline. This film reveals that back in these times, adults were taking their frustrations out on their youth. And being spiteful about it. It fills them with hatred.There are several loose ends that never end up being addressed. Like the marriage, whether scar was killed, why Wayne wanted to kill the girl in a fit of pique, why he bothered scalping 1 person whom we presume was scar (No dialogue or close up for identity) or who survived & who was killed etc. His royal highness carries the dame all the way to the porch in typical 'traditional' fashion. So many eye rolls. And no one ever reloads their guns either. Not cool enough for Wayne's image I guess! The film is so dragged out & tends to just meander most of the time. It should have been cut down by half, & they shouldn't have let John Wayne act like a gansta wannabe throughout. He is truly difficult to tolerate in this film because he clearly finds acting in this pugnacious way easier, & more satiating for his ego.Seriously, Avoid.

197,abum190,A classic Western that comes off a bit overrated,8,3 September 2006,"The Searchers is undoubtedly a classic, and it has beautiful cinematography (I love the opening and closing shots) and an intriguingly emotional story. And even so, it feels overrated to me.This is my first John Wayne movie, and it's easy to see why he was a star. His presence fills the movie, and when the unnecessary subplot about Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) and his paramour comes around now and again, I found myself longing for John Wayne's story to come back. Martin is a good character, but we don't need his girl, Laurie. Her scenes seem hokey and they don't add anything worth keeping to the movie. The dynamic between Martin and Ethan (John Wayne's character) is so good and engaging, the movie could have lived off of that alone.And even with that dynamic it feels like the movie doesn't take enough from that story. It feels like there's a lot more to be said about the relationship between Martin and Ethan and if Ford had said it, the movie would stand on a more solid foundation.As it is, The Searchers is still very good. The epic sweep of the whole thing is wonderful, and Ford finds ways to imply feelings between his characters without actually coming out and exposing them. I've read before that people condemn this movie for Ethan's racism. I don't think that's fair. The film itself is not racist, only Ethan, and his reasoning behind his racism is clear and not just plain bigotry.So while I consider it a little overrated, I still recommend it. Besides, it's a classic movie. Everyone should see it.",The Searchers
198,caseyt-48511,"There are issues, but it's a Powerful Experience",10,29 August 2019,"The Searchers has became often regarded as the best western ever made. Is it? I don't think so. To me it's Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. However, I can see why it is still highly praised to this day. John Ford was a master of his craft and he made a film filled with psychological depth, action, adventure and ambiguity. John Wayne plays Ethan, a former confederate soldier returning home. He's deeply prejudice about native Americans for undisclosed reasons. His young niece is kidnapped by Comanches and he and his nephew go out to find her.What follows is an epic journey where the two men constantly but heads with each other. But not in a funny sort of way. Ethan's hatred blinds him, while his nephew can't bring himself to hate the Indians. Ethan is presented to be just as ruthless and the natives he hates. I've never sympathized with Ethan. He's an unlikable character, but Jeffery Hunter, who plays his nephew, is a determined and much kinder soul, willing to challenge his uncle as the film goes on. To me, he's the real hero.The acting is pretty great. John Wayne gives one of his better performances here. Janet Leigh, Jeffery Hunter and Ward Bond all give enjoyable performances as well. Of course when discussing this film you must talk about the beautiful cinematography. Monument Valley should be remained to John Ford Valley considering how much he utilized it when filming. The beautiful landscape shots and editing keep this film looking tight and completed. Beautiful stuff.Then there's the classic final shot. The way I see it, it's symbolizing how the world is starting to pass Ethan by. He has no place in this world where the old prejudices are slowly starting to fade out. He's a dinosaur who can't escape extinction. I once heard a writer say that the future belongs to the kind hearted and loving Martin and Debbie, Ethan's attitude is going out of style. It was also a tribute to actor Harry Carey Sr., But the Shot is so full of different meaning that you could have an article solely dedicated to it.The Searchers has some problems that modern audiences will point out. Some of it is justified while some isn't. Despite its amazing highs, it's treatment of Natives as savages is outdated and can be perceived as offensive. But as a whole film, it's is a masterwork. Ford made many of those, this is one of his strongest.",The Searchers
199,madcardinal,"Passably Good, Although Offensive & Vastly Overrated",5,25 December 2009,"This film is an old-fashioned Western wherein the European Americans are the good guys and the Native Americans the bad guys. ""The Searchers"" will offend most Native Americans because of the simplistic, negative caricatures of the Comanches. The film's racism was downright embarrassing to me as a European American, as when an American military man shows Ethan three white women taken back from Comanche captivity - one a middle-aged woman screaming hysterically and two younger women smiling in a deranged manner unable to speak. The military man says, ""It's hard to believe they're white."" Ethan retorts, ""They're not anymore; they're Comanche."" The wrong-headed notion that transference from a European American lifestyle to a Native American lifestyle would crack the psyche and that some sort of ensuing derangement would be characteristically Comanche is bigoted and racist, as well as being untrue. There are many documented cases of European Americans actually preferring to live among the Native Americans going all the way back to the days of Christopher Columbus's campaign of exploitation. Check out the book ""Lies My Teacher Told Me"" for some instances of these.Regarding the recurring conflicts between European Americans and Native Americans, ""The Searchers"" also conveniently ignores the fact that those of European descent systematically cheated and robbed the natives of their land with sanction and encouragement from the U.S. government. One need only research the number of treaties the U.S. government authored and then violated to confirm this. Also, check out the repeated attempts at ethnic cleansing - for example Andrew Jackson's shameful and immoral persecution of the Cherokees. The truth matters and it is directly pertinent as to whether this film is or is not racist.The script is dated. For example, the roles of the young adults are written as if the characters are twelve years old. To see what I mean, watch the scene where the young kissing couple is surprised by some youngsters; also take a look at the scene where the young woman walks in on the young man while he's taking a bath in a steel tub.In general, this movie contains a lot of overacting. Ward Bond seems to think the louder he yells, the better his performance is.Whether you enjoy this movie probably depends on whether you buy into John Wayne's acting style. I found ""The Searchers"" to be fairly good, but deeply flawed, culturally dishonest and offensively racist. It is certainly not a great film in any sense. There are many superior Westerns. Try ""Tombstone,"" ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" for starters!",The Searchers

Some of the girls who were abducted by the Indians went nuts, others supposedly fit in so well they couldn't remember their lives otherwise. There just wasn't enough supporting material in the story to support why it would happen one way or the other.

Which was a film in which,like The Searchers,He played a anti-hero,unlikeable character.Though the Searchers is beautifully photographed, I have always been bothered by how John Ford stretched out the time line in the story just so the girl could grow old enough to have sex with her Comanche captors, setting up Waynes' dilemma of killing her or not,because she had been ruined by a fate worse than death,misogyny. Wouldn't it have made more sense to have the older niece kidnapped and searched for over a few years time instead.The whole contrivance of the younger man not marrying for over ten years,and the girl waiting on Him, is absurd.I also believe that Ford purposely told a story of extreme racism as a comment on the racist times that the civil rights movement would soon bring to the fore.Also,historically Comanches were a brutal warrior race. What white men did to them was no less brutal and atrocious,but they wouldn't give into the changing times without violent conflict.

202,Teyss,Thoughtful Western about identity and (inner) conflict,10,4 March 2016,"""The Searchers"" is more than a Western: it now is an essential classic. In the Sight & Sound poll 2012 (a reference worldwide survey issued every ten years), it is listed as #7 best movie ever and is the only Western in the top 50 (the following one is ""Rio Bravo"" as #68). For information the previous rankings are: #13 (2002), #5 (1992), #10 (1982), #18 (1972)... and 1962 was probably too early for the movie to gather sufficient recognition.IDENTITYThe movie revolves around identity and resulting conflicts. Apparently it is quite straightforward: Americans on one side, Indians on the other (note: I will use this term instead of ""Native American"" to align with the story and the genre). But is it? Martin is eighth Cherokee. Americans use Indian items: blankets, clothes, sheathes, etc. Scar speaks some English. Debbie becomes a Comanche.Even Ethan, who hates Indians from the start, uses Indian items and speaks some Comanche. In a revealing scene, when the posse discover a dead Comanche, Ethan shoots his eyes to have his blind soul wander forever: he hence believes in Indian faith. When Ethan and Scar meet for the first time, the images of their faces are strikingly similar: they are two sides of the same coin. Ultimately Ethan scalps Scar, another revealing act and an echo of Scar's scalp collection. Note he did not kill him (Martin did), because it would have been like killing the opposite part of him.This inner ambiguity is depicted in other ways. Samuel is at the same time captain and reverend: he shoots and shouts ""Hallelujah!"" The Jorgensens have a Scandinavian name; ""This country..."", cries Mr Jorgensen after his son died as if he regretted Scandinavia. Ethan served in the Confederate army but joins the Rangers. Moses is considered a fool but is always right:
He is the only one to guess who raided Mr Jorgensen's cattle.When the Rangers are chased by the Comanche across the river, he thanks the Lord, upon which Samuel scolds him because the situation seems hopeless... and the posse manage to escape. (Note the biblical reference: Moses splits the waters to have his companions cross safely and closes them on the pursuing army.)He introduces Ethan to Figueroa who will bring him to Debbie.Eventually he discovers where Debbie is when all hope is lost.INNER CONFLICTHence the conflicts that cross the movie are also internal. This is notably illustrated by two famous shots on Ethan and Martin: one in the snow, with branches in front of their bodies that seem to cut them into pieces; another in Scar's tepee with scalps across their faces. In this context, ""the search"" of the title is a personal one: characters are searching for their identity and inner peace. To the questions of the song during the opening credits (""What makes a man to wander? etc."") answers the closing song: ""A man will search for his heart and soul, etc.""Ultimately everyone finds their ""peace of mind"": Debbie goes back to her origins; Martin evolves from ""he-who-follows"" to an independent grown-up; Laurie finds her love; the Jorgensens have a son-in-law, partly replacing their late son; Moses swings in his rocking-chair. Ethan, who is destructive and does not fit in this scheme (see below), will wander in the desert, just like the Indian's soul (another similarity of destinies).To illustrate this inner search, the movie adopts a circular construction, partly abolishing space and time.
It starts with a dark screen on which a door opens and ends the reversed way. This key shot (a dark place with an opening on a bright outside) is repeated in different manners six other times.The side shot of the porch at the beginning (with the house on the right) is mirrored at the end (with the house on the left).Musical themes are replayed throughout the movie.We frequently turn around in circles in Monument Valley even though the action is supposed to take place across hundreds of miles. Eventually, we think Debbie is very far away but Moses reveals she is nearby.During the funeral, people sing ""We will gather at the river"": Ethan and Martin will meet Debbie near a stream.Ethan and Martin come back three times to the Jorgensens' during their search.Laurie reads Martin's letter again and again.Ethan says: ""It is as sure as the turning of the earth"".He physically describes the surrounding trick of Comanche by showing a circle: one thinks they are on one side while they are on the other.At the end, he lifts Debbie as he did seven years before. These years seem to fly.ETHAN: THE INCARNATION OF CONFLICTSEthan is a special character, one of the most prominent of Western genre. On the one hand he is direct and blunt, on the other there is a great deal of mystery around him. What did he do during the Civil War and the Mexican War? Is he a criminal as Samuel hints? Where did he get his newly minted money? What was his exact relationship with Martha (apparently they were in love)? Where will he go at the end? Like a supernatural being, he emerges from the desert at the very beginning and vanishes into it at the very end.He is on the dark side, he casts death throughout the movie. His long search just to kill his niece, the last member of his kin, is destructive, absurd and, according to our contemporary values, racist. His provocation leads to Brad's death. His belongings seem cursed:
He gives a medal to Debbie; she is kidnapped.He gives money to Aaron; he dies.He previously gave a necklace to Lucy; she dies.He gives money to Futterman and kills him.Conversely, he gives money to Figueroa, but afterwards the latter returns the well-named ""blood money"" and symbolically rides back unharmed to the friendly cantina.In this environment where most elements have an offsetting part, Ethan is no exception despite his strong presence: Martin is Ethan's balance, his bright side. He wants to save Debbie regardless. He increasingly confronts Ethan and prevents him from killing her. After Ethan is hit by a poisonous arrow, Martin extracts the venom from the wound and thus symbolically removes Ethan's rage to kill his niece.-----Two last notes. First regarding Indians: some critics have disapproved of their negative image in the movie. Granted, the Comanche are accused of atrocities and the way the final raid on their village is filmed is shocking: it looks like a lively, almost enjoyable event disregarding casualties. However, the movie also shows Indian civilians massacred by the cavalry (including the harmless Look, as Martin points out) and others held captive. Also, Ethan slaughters buffalos to starve them, a reference to the widespread destruction of buffalos in the 19th century.Second, ""The Searchers"" is based on a novel by Alan Le May. In my opinion the movie is very superior to the book although space lacks to demonstrate this.",The Searchers
203,filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin,EPIC AND BEAUTIFUL,9,28 December 2019,"The Searchers is one of John Ford's most epic and beautiful movies. Winton C. Hooch's magnificent cinematography is already present in the opening scene of the movie when, from inside Aaron Edwards (Walter Coy) ranch, we see his wife Martha (Dorothy Jordan) open the door to the sunny Texas landscape of the year 1868.Down the dusty road, we noticed, as if we were part of the scene, the arrival of Aaron's brother Ethan (John Wayne), a Confederate soldier who boasts of never being defeated and who for three years became a wanderer, raising suspicions about their activities.Analyzing the movie today requires a reflection on the culture of that time, which saw the Indians as savages to be exterminated. Ethan's stance is racist, even discriminating against young Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), whom he rescued from an Indian attack, but who, having an ""eighth Comanche blood,"" is not worth living with family, according to the war veteran. However, this stance will be reviewed by a few occurrences of the plot that will follow.The big issue in the movie is a relentless search for Ethan's niece Debbie (adolescent Natalie Wood), kidnapped by the Comanche Indians, after murdering the entire family and burning the ranch.
Five years later, only two men remain in search, but for different reasons: Ethan intends to kill the girl, who would have become the prey of a Comanche buck. At the same time, his unwanted traveling companion, young Pawley, wants to rescue his foster sister at all costs.Moreover, the coexistence of the two men of such different personalities serves to diminish the differences between them, and to add to the old cowboy some humanity, as well as to soften some aspects of his troubled mind.When the expected confrontation with Chief Scar's (Henry Brandon) tribe finally occurs, Debbie runs into the despair of Uncle Ethan, whose path is barred by Pawley. The ending, surprising by the standards of the time, heralded a new era for western films.",The Searchers
204,alexsnower,Anything lower than 10? That'll be the day,10,26 August 2021,"The perfect western. Ford did an amazing job of displaying how many white Americans used hate to essentially motivate western expansion. John Wayne's Ethan Edwards is a bad man. He had a relationship with his brothers wife (which fuels his hate for Comanche after her murder and Debbies capture). He shots a dead corpse and scalps scar after he dies. Edwards is however a necessary evil for finding Debbie. He also does the right thing in the end. However, he is subjected to live on his own in the end, because he is a loner. Travis Bickle is a spitting image of this. You can see this movies inspiration everywhere. Taxi Driver, Star Wars (Uncle Owen death being similar to the raid at the beginning of the searchers) and Lawrence of Arabia (cinematography). Perfect western.",The Searchers
205,richard-1967,What's all the fuss about? I don't get it!,3,1 February 2009,"This movie's been on my list to see for a LONG time. Spielberg says it's a brilliant character study. It's lauded for its depiction of the white man's racism. Others call it John Ford's masterpiece.I just don't get it.The trite script, poor acting, confused plot, and ambivalent perspective makes this a thoroughly crummy film. The movie also seems exceptionally dated.Let's assume Ford's motives were noble -- to show that the white guys could be the bad guys, hating those damn ""Commanch"". The script is so confused that this point gets lost in the morass of conflicting cues and plot inconsistencies.The acting? It's so poor that Pat Wayne outshines his dad. As the main character of questionable morals, John Wayne has virtually no ability to bring through any of the role's supposed complexity.The plot is confused and confusing. The first sudden shifts from Summer to deep snowy winter. The treks up and down the west coast with no regard to coordinating time and place. The magical mid-movie reappearance at the ol' ranchero. The 180 degree turn from Natalie Wood's character near the end. What's going on here? Ford's point, if any there was, gets totally lost for me.Nice settings in Monument Valley, though....",The Searchers
206,someokiedude,"Wow, John Wayne can act.",10,7 November 2019,"Many people often point to films like Unforgiven, The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford, and even Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy as the pinnacles of the 'dark' western or the 'revisionist' western genre. Though unfortunately many people forget that the more darker, deconstructive westerns started much earlier, and I, for one, would point to The Searchers as a beginning film that began to question the morality and ethics of the 'western hero' that was exemplified by The Duke himself, John Wayne.John Wayne probably gave his most nuanced and complex performance as Ethan Edwards. Ethan is a complicated man, he can pretty awful sometimes, even deplorable. But he also has the aspects of the 'western hero' that makes us want to root for him, even if he can be as heinous as he is throughout the movie. He's casually racist, he threatens to kill children, he relentlessly mocks and belittles his nephew for his 'one-eighth' Indian descent, and coldly murders people, rather if they deserve it or not, but as Clint Eastwood once said 'deserve ain't got nothin' to do with it.' The film itself is also a very dark and brooding film and is not one to be watched lightly. It deals with themes of death, hatred, obsession, vengeance, and eventually redemption. There's scenes in this movie that I'm actually surprised that my parents let me get away with watching because there are some disturbing scenes in this movie, such as Ethan's cold murders or the part where he's telling Martin, the afore mentioned nephew, and Brad, his other niece's fiance about finding her and having her die in his arms.As for the film itself, there's not much else to say that hasn't already been said. It is expertly made and has often been imitated by a diverse crew of filmmakers that range from Martin Scorsese, Stephen Spielberg, and even George Lucas. John Ford's direction, as well as the atmospheric cinematographic work from Winton C. Hoch makes the film look dirty and rough, just as the actual west truly was. Ford wanted this movie to be as realistic and un-romantic as he could, even the score, which was done brilliantly by Max Steiner, also has a melancholic edge to it that manages to slither into your soul, I don't think that the ending scene, which is still my favorite ending to a film ever, would be nearly as effective as it is with Steiner's wonderful score, even the back story to that infamous last shot is also deeply moving and one I would suggest for people to read about.There are problems I have with this movie, it can meander at times even though it's not really that long at barely stretching two hours and there's some parts in this movie that try and lighten the film's dark tone and themes with rather misplaced humor if you asked me, especially when Martin is trying to get with this girl whose dad is a bit of a buffoon and can sometimes take me out of the movie, but asides from that there's not much else to criticize. In our more enlightened age, some have taken to criticizing the movie for its racism, without seeming to understand that the film isn't endorsing racism, it's simply showing it as it was during the time. As students of such philosophers as Nietzsche or Macchiavelli know that the real world isn't the same thing as the ideal world and The Searchers shows that distinction as well, as most great films tend to do. But unfortunately the film has gotten some bad rep for the racism, even if they fail to understand that the film isn't in favor of racism.There are certain film aficionados, such as the afore mentioned Scorsese or critic Roger Ebert, who find this film to be a quintessential western, and I join them in holding this film in that respect.",The Searchers
207,loydmooney,very overrated,4,20 September 2005,"This film is easily the most overrated of all time. Talk about a bandwagon climbed on by the purely hypnotized. However to give the film its due, there are seven or eight moments and a few scenes that are some of the greatest in westerns. The first is when the searching party comes upon the buried dead Indian. Fabulous. Second is when Wayne rides out of the canyon. Blows you away. Wow. The third is when he yells at Harry Carry Jr. Whew. Then the fight on the river is great for four. Five his comment to Jeffrey Hunter about the turning of the earth. Six when they come upon the hostages. Breaks your heart. And seven, the entire scene with Scar, and the Comancheros. Very strong. But that's it. The rest of the thing is either pure hokum, boring stuff back at the ranch with the idiot in the rocking chair and or Ken Curtis.And as for Waynes' best performance, wrong. He was every bit as good in Red River, if not better. Just because he did less yelling there, he was fabulous. Hawks handled him every bit as well as Ford.Anyone who can sit through about 7/8s of this film with rapt attention is very forgiving indeed. I suspect it is the sheer power of its few astonishing scenes that brings on the rest of the nonsense about this movie. Man of the West, My Darling Clemintine, Winchester 73 and at least 20 other westerns are much much better than this baby. However not throw it out with the bathwater, when it is good, it is fabulous.",The Searchers

209,Board,I didn't find this particularly interesting + it also had some very uneven points!,4,16 February 2003,"First of all this was just another movie where I just said ""Nah, nothing special"" after it was over. It didn't really have any excitement or tension (and was a bit boring at times) and had a shiny happy people ending that you could figure out as you've seen it a thousand times before. Okay, maybe you couldn't exactly figure it 100% out, but it didn't come as a surprise or didn't lift the movie to another level either. On top of that it had some very uneven points as I said in the headline (this is for people who've seen it only): It seamed that this movie was a classic one with the ""Cowboys = good. Indians = bad"". The Indians chose to attack the farm and burn it down for no apparent reason. John Wayne & Debbie's mother was sure that Debbie was better off dead than living with the Indians. Apparently it isn't possible to enjoy your life outside the white civilisation!?! I think ""Dances with wolves"" gives a much better view of this. The Indians were portrayed as ruthless savages and the only way they were portrayed as a little bit civilized/pleasant was that they had riffles and that their chief spoke a little English. But as I said in the beginning all in all just another film where I said ""Nothing special"" unfortunately.",The Searchers
210,houndtang75,"So he married a Comanche squaw, haw haw haw!",10,26 November 2005,"Really, this film should be in the top five best of all time. A rare case of a classic that is genuinely great and one of those marvellous films that you can switch on halfway through and become instantly engrossed. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why 'The Searchers' is so good, but the film has an unusual 'feel' to it and in aspects of its subject matter, was well ahead of its time for 1956. John Wayne does remarkably well in embodying the surprisingly complex character of Ethan Edwards and the supporting actors all fit their parts to a tee. Hank Worden as the eccentric Mose and Ken Curtis as the ghastly Charlie McCrory are particularly memorable. 'The Searchers' is an endlessly rewatchable film, the details sometimes fade but new subtleties are revealed on each viewing.",The Searchers
211,jimmylee-1,In Search Of Excellence: Find It In John Ford,10,1 August 2006,"The Searchers is one of those movies that, no matter what I'm doing or what else might be on, I'll drop everything and watch it.Each time I see it, I find some character nuance I've missed before. Ford was a master of offering glimpses into a character's motivation - which, if you blink, you miss. And that moment is what makes you watch the movie for more. Once I saw Martha Edwards smoothing Ethan's coat with her hands and realized she was in love with Ethan instead of her own husband, I was looking for more...signs of Ethan's love for her. Had she married the safe one and regretted it?The emotion that you see is the blood from the stone. The characters in the Searchers (like most of the characters in Ford's films) break down only under overwhelming pressure... and but for a moment. Life is hard, they know it, they just keep putting one step in front of the other... they're Texicans. You see when Marty matures, because he stops talking so much, and tells Laury he didn't know he had to say he loved her - he thought she knew. In stark contrast to the at times wild and ungoverned emotion of the children and teenagers - emotion that has dangerous consequences.The actors don't miss a step. Ward Bond blusters his way through, offering local authority and comic relief; Patrick Wayne did perhaps the best acting of his career (if only he had started directing right after this movie), while Jeffrey Hunter shows what his career could have been if he had made better choices. Natalie Wood fills the screen when she appears (nice that the Comanche had lipstick), as does Vera Miles. Olive Carey is incredibly touching; a complete standout in her role.And John Wayne. The character he plays here, I believe, is one of the most complex and dark of his career - truly setting him apart as an actor. The family Edwards certainly likes him, in spite of the many questionable facets to his character. We follow him through the movie like Marty - on the one hand, hoping he'll find Debbie; on the other hand, hoping he won't. And if he does find her, how can Marty (immature in so many ways) stop Ethan from killing her? The fate of Ethan Edwards in Ford's movie strays from the novel on which the movie is based. I saw the movie first, and I find the novel suffers a great deal in comparison.Although Ethan compromises what we thought was his driving position in the film, he never opens his heart; he remains an enigma to the end. And we still want to know more about him.I have never seen, by the way, any non-fiction about native American white female captives that indicated the birth family didn't want them back due to ""defilement."" Even Cynthia Parker, the mother of raider Quannah Parker (pardon my spelling), was searched for by her family for over 15 years and taken back by them several times after her Comanche spouse died and while her son was actively raiding and killing Texas ranchers. It has been documented, however, that captives in Texas were sometimes abused and defaced rather than adopted; in a harsh land, equally harsh and poorly-educated parents might see death as a better ""option"" to lifelong loneliness and a half-Indian child.About Monument Valley not being in Texas: well, Lone Pine and the Missouri Flats are in California, but they've been used for almost every western movie and series ever made. They just look generic so apparently few movie watchers notice. John Ford used a spot with lovely scenery, for which I'm grateful. That land belonged to the Navajo nation, so a little cash went in their direction. It's unfortunate Texas lacks Monument Valley and we all know it, but I'm willing to suspend belief so that I can enjoy the movie. That sort of scenery helps me understand why someone would actually fight over living there rather than pick up and move to a better climate.I do have one issue with this film: the cavalry charge into the village. It is so much easier to be standing, and shoot someone running at a full gallop in a straight line on horseback, than it is to shoot from a galloping horse with a long gun at someone standing (and then hiding). If that was the sole strategy, the Rangers would have been wiped out and the Comanche would have won. Good thing the Rangers had ""I have to WIN, I'm the Good Guy"" on their badge and the Comanche had ""Miss"" on their guns. It's a rousing scene, but I find it odd that Ford would make such a mistake. Quite a bit has been said about the Native Americans depicted in the film. John Ford unfortunately didn't, in this movie, use a Native American in the Scar role. And he wasn't working with, or on the land of the Cheyanne or Comanche, but the Navajo. But he did employ Native Americans extensively in this and other movies as well as use their land at at time when funds were desperately needed. And he did evolve in his thinking about how they were depicted (see ""Cheyanne Autumn"" in which Richard Whidmark plays one of the first army men with a conscience, paving the way for so many more, less accurate but more PC, movies).From what I've read, Ford wasn't the greatest guy ever, and could be really hard to work with, but I think he was one of the greatest filmmakers ever. And this, having been completely ignored by the Academy Awards - is imho one of the greatest films ever.",The Searchers
212,SanTropez_Couch,Monumental Western,10,2 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersEthan Edwards (John Wayne), the little-seen uncle comes back to town to visit his brother, Aaron and his wife Martha and their children Lucy, Debbie and Ben. The appearance of Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), who's been taken in by the family, gives us our first hint of Ethan's racism. He greets him saying he could, ""Mistake [him] for a half-breed."" If this racism is intentional -- and most likely it is -- it suits Wayne's character. I've seen some comments saying how Wayne isn't racist, he's just vengeful. Bull. He's racist and vengeful and this welcoming proves it. Either way, it in no way diminishes this film as one of the great American films and one of the greatest of all Westerns.The next day (I think) while Ethan is away, the house is massacred by Comanche Indians. The night of the massacre it's dark and ominous at dusk. The boys are presumed dead and the girls possibly alive. Ethan, Martin, and Lucy's beau Brad Jorgenson begin their search to bring back whoever's still alive.We hear the Rev. Clayton, who also operates as a Captain, say of Ethan that he ""fits a lot of descriptions."" He's not a straight hero and I think Ford recognized this. Certainly other characters in the film, notably Hunter's, won't put up with his ignorant garbage. Ethan is a mix of cold-blooded, vicious killer and good ol' boy. He goes around venturing and seeing old friends, promises to get  Mose Harper a rocking chair but also shoots the eyes out of a dead Indian so he can't enter the spirit world. He's a flawed hero and his racism isn't supposed to be taken as proper.After Ethan disappears for a while and once he's pushed by Brad to tell him what happens and what he's seen, Wayne bursts into a fiery rage -- one of the best moments of the film and roars, ""Don't ever ask me more!"" It's a towering performance. There are people who think Wayne isn't a good actor, but I think they're confusing his acting and his voice. His casual mannerisms and voice are distinctive and oft-imitated but whenever he gets emotional, it comes through. A common misunderstanding people have, I think, is that a peculiar voice or an accent equals bad acting. Of course that's not true. Emotional truths and subtleties in character come through the speech. It's just such an obvious critique -- like the blanket heads (I don't even know what that means -- I hope it isn't racist) who think Bob Dylan is a bad singer. Untrue. He's got a voice some people may not like but he uses what he's got better than Whitney Houston.Juxtaposed against the arduous five-year search is the home life of the Jorgenson family. Brad Jorgenson, the son, is no longer a part of the trio of searchers. Ethan and Martin stayed for a night at the household and Laurie, the daughter, had fallen for Martin, naked in a bathtub. Part of the story is told through a letter Martin wrote to Laurie, and the search is shown counter to Laurie at home, waiting for Martin to come back.When Ethan and Martin do find some whites, the girls they see have gone insane. As Ethan sees it, once you go Comanche, you never come back. He'd rather see someone dead than be turned onto the Comanche's side. When it comes to the Comanche, Wayne spouts lines like, ""You speak pretty good American, for a Comanche."" (Always without the ""ee"").There's some comedy in the film, maybe it's comic relief, I don't know. Either way, when it involves Wayne, it's funny (""What if you'd missed?"" ""Never occurred to me."").The cinematography is absolutely stunning with a gorgeous baby blue sky, white clouds and the brown rock formations of Monument Valley. And that final shot, as Leonard Maltin warned me about, is a great one. It's one of those sum-up shots where everything is read on the actor's face and body language, such as the case with ""The 400 Blows.""  It's the final shot of a masterwork.Will there ever be a Western to top this one? That'll be the day.****",The Searchers
213,allie701,Painfully Dated,3,8 July 2018,"I'd read so many reviews describing John Ford's iconic Western The Searchers starring John Wayne as the best Western of all time, that when My husband recorded it, I thought I'd better watch it. 
Let me tell you, it is impossible to watch a movie as if the modern world isn't there. The Searchers was released in 1956 and it has all the prejudices and cultural mores of its era. The only good Indian is a dead Indian. Every female character is either annoying, stupid or craving marriage. The acting is wooden at best with many of the scenes set up like tableaux in an old melodrama. The dialogue is painfully predictable although maybe it would not seem so in 1956 and many of the plot points don't even make sense.
John Wayne said this was his favorite performance and the critics all gush about the complexity of his character. Well, if you have ever watched a John Wayne movie you know his performances are about as subtle as a shovel, and this is no exception. Sometimes he yells and sometimes he sulks. That's it. And if Wayne is bad, the others are embarrassingly bad. I cringed at the so-called romantic banter of the young leads and the tough talk of the Texas Rangers was pathetic.
The only aspect of the movie that stood up to scrutiny was the natural beauty of Monument Valley. Even Hollywood couldn't spoil that.",The Searchers

215,wall17,"Best Hollywood ""Classic"" Western, ever",9,25 April 2003,"(Big spoiler if you've never seen the movie.)Other reviewers have commented about the movie quite ably, but I'll add my own two cents about the greatest single shot of classic Hollywood. The closing shot of this movie never fails to get me, a big ole galoot, choked up. Ethan, John Wayne's character, has brought Debbie home at last. The shot pulls out of the cabin as Vera Miles runs to embrace Jeffrey Hunter, lovers separated by the search of five years. The Duke brings Natalie Wood in to the doorway, showing the big wide western landscape enclosed by the darkness of the civilized cabin. The cabin is completely dark: it serves as a frame. First the old Jorgenson couple takes Debbie back into the dark embrace of the cabin; then Vera Miles and Jeffrey Hunter sort of sashay around the Duke, and into the darkness. Finally we just see Ethan/Duke look into the cabin wistfully, as if it represents a level of civilization he can't participate in. Having returned the supposedly irrecoverably savage Debbie back to the settlers' world, he then turns, the door of the cabin almost like an old-fashioned iris shot. He's left alone with the wild openness, while we as the audience are left with the darkened point of view of the rest of the characters in the false security of the cocoon of the cabin.I don't know of another movie that serves to cap its grand theme and the fate of its characters so economically with a single final shot. The Duke as the archteypical guardian of society who is nevertheless outside its bounds is painted, nearly literally, against the western sky. It's been copied a thousand times since, and with modern sensibilities other westerns since are more ""accurate"" to the historical old west, but the original is still the most authentic.",The Searchers
216,rbstern,The Citizen Kane of westerns?,4,2 July 2007,"The reason I think of this movie as the Citizen Kane of westerns: Today's typical movie goers don't care for it. Movie aficionados do. Or maybe some do, and then others feel obligated to say they do. Ugh.This movie falls short in it's primary mission: Entertainment. The story is long and drawn out, but doesn't have enough depth to earn that length. The protagonists have a long road to demonstrate depth. It never really happens. One is loyal to both his family and his prejudices. The other is a simple minded but good hearted kid, on his way to being that very same thing as an adult. They remain who they were, with the expected friction along the way.It's got the classic fingerprints of old time movies: The acting is more like stage than film. Not a lot of vocal range in the delivery of lines, focusing instead on volume for the benefit of the audience hearing the lines. Unfortunately, the script isn't sophisticated enough for the wooden delivery to carry it through.Many scenes are corny and over the top. Supporting characters are predictable and fit neatly into clichés established over the previous decades of film-making. There is some depth to the two main characters, but it's not enough to carry the movie, and it is often lost with the ham-fisted acting. John Wayne playing a character with a first-hinted-at-and-then-plainly-naked dark side is not enough to garner my praise. In most of his westerns, he is morally neutral to slightly good, so it's not a big shift. The conveyance of unspoken feelings for his sister-in-law is probably the best work he did in the movie, possibly reflecting the best directing in the movie, but that's a small part of the whole tale.I love the theme and the epic quality. But the individual scenes and acting make the movie feel small, and I don't mean that in a good way. I just don't care much for the script and the acting, and that's what kills this movie for me.Perhaps this is a style thing. I'm not crazy about Citizen Kane either. Maybe this movie was a breakthrough in its day. In the end, it is the story and how the script, the actors and the director tell it that keeps a movie watchable across generations. This film misses in that regard.",The Searchers
217,dover,John Ford shows us how to make a Western,9,17 June 2002,"John Ford is a classic Western filmmaker (though certainly not the only genre in which he excelled), employing the classic Western film star, John Wayne, in perhaps one of the most underappreciated films of our time. Ford builds a thoroughly entertaining movie which explores classic Western themes without necessarily relying on these themes to drive the plot.Like any good Western, we are inorexably drawn to a kind of Cowboys vs. Indians saga, but Ford manages to draw us into the conflict in such a way that the mere ""Cowboys good, Indians bad"" aesthetic isn't really applicable here. While relying on the archetypical roles of the two groups to set up a conflict, Ford is ahead of his time in managing to characterize the Indians as more than ""noble savages"". Wayne's character's (Ethan Edwards) hatred of ""the Commanch"" is called into question a number of times, especially in his stormy relationship with adopted nephew and fellow searcher Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), who we are told is a quarter-Indian himself, and cannot bring himself to find the same sort of hatred for the Indians that Ethan holds.Ethan was a Confederate soldier in the Civil War, returning to his brother's Texas homestead after the war. A group of Commanches, led by the ominous Chief Scar, route and kill his brother's family while Ethan and Martin are investigating a cattle rustling, the Commaches' diversionary tactic. The Indians took the family's youngest daughter, and the majority of the film has us following Ethan and Martin in their attempts to track down Scar and take back the girl, Debbie (played by Lorna and Natalie Wood, at different times).Such a situation sets up one of the many moral ambiguities that make this more than an ordinary Western: the Commanches slaughtered Ethan's brother and his family - he seemingly has reason to hate them with the almost crazy passion that he does. Yet the more naive Martin cannot bring himself to hate them in such a way, and the split between them becomes a major point of contention when it becomes clear that Debbie has more or less been adopted as a Commanche (the two ""Searchers"" chase after her for about five years in film time). Furthermore, when the two ""Searchers"" actually meet Scar, who they've been chasing for years, he is presented as a rather intelligent character, although certainly one filled with vengance - he, too, has his reasons for waging war with the likes of Ethan and Martin, and cannot merely be written off a the type of bloodthirsty savage that is typical of the portrayal of most Indians within the genre.The film relies on enough classic Western material to imbue with the feel with the sense of such pictures. Aside from the question of Ethan's morality, Wayne plays him with classic John Wayne freewheeling confidence and swagger that made the actor such an icon, and it comes off quite well. We are also given a side story involving Martin's romance with the hard-as-nails Laurie Jurgensen (played by Vera Miles, best known for playing Janet Leigh's sister in ""Psycho""). The relationship is from a classic, archetypical Western mold - the two have been in love since they were kids, but Martin has responsibilites to his family that stop him from making the proper time for his beau, and his rough frontier-uprbringing leave him seemingly lacking the proper sensitivity for dealing with Laura (though he does, of course, have a heart of gold).As a side note, this film should prove immensely interesting to any serious fan of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy (the original one). While those films undoubtably draw a great deal of inspiration from Kurosawa's samurai films, there is most certainly a great deal (especially in the film subtitled ""A New Hope"") drawn from here. One scene in particular (when Luke returns to his farm after stormtroopers have blasted in pieces) is virtually ripped straight from ""The Searchers"". Ford's film is also full of the sort of gallows humor present throughout the trilogy, and even incorporates some rather goofy characters, the half-cracked Mose Harper (Hank Warden) and the incredibly over-the-top rival for Laura's hand Charlie McCorry (Ken Curtis), without ruining the overall serious feel of the film, but managing to squeeze laughs out of absurd situations (such as a fight between Martin and Charlie) without compromising the ability to quickly return to a solemn tone. Such deft touch, as well as the addition of wise-cracking dialogue (provided largely by Wayne and Ward Bond here) are a large part of what made the original trilogy so successful, and it's strikingly similar to the type of paradigm on display between various characters here.Regardless of ranting and raving about Star Wars, however, this is an excellent film on it's own merit.",The Searchers
218,jcuccini,A masterpiece,10,17 July 2021,"This is John Wayne's finest film and perhaps best job of acting, the story is very accurate in terms of white people being killed and their children being abducted by Indians during the 1800s. John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards brilliantly, he shows the hatred for Indians on his face which may be what keeps him relentless pursuing the ones who abducted his niece. It's masterpiece of writing, directing and acting.",The Searchers
219,zeedunn,A Classic Ford,10,28 October 2009,"The Searchers isn't my favorite John Wayne movie, but it was certainly good. The setting is the obligatory open prairie. The music swells in all the appropriate places, and the characters do what needs to be done. The pacing skips back and forth between serious scenes where people are brutalized and then humorous scenes that, to me, got in the way.There are also some very ingenious scenes. The scene leading up to the attack where the Comanche wipe out Wayne's family is foreboding in every way. The colors of the sky just look evil and without saying much at all, the characters demonstrate the sense of doom and dread they are feeling. The director here is John Ford, of course, and he uses all of the tricks that made him famous in the 1930s. Guess what? They still work in the 1950s and in the 2000s. Sometimes I think we were better off without all the special effects. Ford does certain things very well. 1. Landscape shots--There is nothing more beautiful than a Ford landscape complete with a fade from scene to scene. 2. Economy shots--Ford uses the camera well and uses one shot/take to do many things at once. At the beginning, he introduces all of the characters in just 3 takes. And few words are used. The woman Martha, Wayne's sister-in-law in this film, walks out of the house and watches Wayne approach. Then we see the rest of the family emerge onto the porch. Lastly, they all walk into the house. The only words spoken are ""Ethan?"", ""That's your Uncle Ethan,"" and ""Welcome home, Ethan."" Yet we know several things: Ethan (Wayne) and Martha love one another romantically, Ethan has been gone for a long time, the kids are glad to see him, and the brother isn't sure how he feels. Ford does this all with his actors' faces. It's marvelous.The basics of the plots are that Ethan comes home 3 years after the surrender of the Confederates to the Yankees. He plans to stay with his family until he can set up a place of his own. Then a tribe of Comanche Indians brutally burns his brother's house and kills the couple and possibly the son. The tribe also kidnaps both girls, one a teenager and the other about 8 years old. Ethan is determined to hunt down the tribe that killed his family and rescue the little girl. He is accompanied by his adopted nephew, a boy he doesn't trust because he is partially Cherokee and Ethan is a racist through and through. They search for the little girl FOR NINE YEARS. And when they find her . . . well you'll have to watch it to see. It's a great movie and is definitely worth a viewing.",The Searchers

I know most people think that John Ford and John Wayne are the greatest, but watching this movie feels like watching a television program.The only reason I watched it was after reading the book ""The Empire of the Summer Moon"", about the capture of Cynthia Ann Parker by the Commanches, and her son Quanah. The book is excellent, and it will also open your eyes to the grim reality of life on the plains. Cynthia Ann, like many other captives of the Indians, did not re-integrate back into white culture successfully.To sum up, just as a movie, this is not worth watching.",The Searchers

This is John Wayne's best performance and this is also one of the best movies, and westerns ever made. Actually, there are a lot of westerns that I consider to be some of the finest of the genre ever made, but the ones that should be at the very top of the list are ""The Searchers"" and ""Shane"". So if you ever want to see which is number one, meaning the best western ever made, then you should watch both, and then, form your own opinions. Everything has never been better, including the movie itself. Should never be remade, even though it already has, and those who have remade it have another thing coming. Mose Harper is the funniest character, and John Wayne is the best overall. John Ford is one of the best directors that ever lived, along with Hitchcock, Mann, Hawks, Hathaway, and John Wayne himself. Natalie Wood is even better than she was in Miracle on 34th Street. Ward Bond is excellent. Jeffrey Hunter deserves a ""job well done on the 1956 movie The Searchers"" as an inscription on his gravestone. And everybody else...well, everybody else is everybody else.",The Searchers

Wayne steals the show, of course, but Jeffrey Hunter does a fine job too, especially in how his character changes throughout the movie.Lots of subtlety here.  The encounter between Ethan (Wayne) and Scar (his nemesis) hints they might be 2 sides of the same coin; both seeking vengeance for murdered loved ones.  Watch for the line from Scar ""Your commanche is very good.  Who did you learn it from?""  in response to Ethan's similar stab about Scar's english.  We never learn where Ethan gathered his very extensive knowledge of indian language and customs, but it leads you to believe it lies at the heart of his determination.Watching this movie makes you realize how much the world has changed.  The words and deeds of Ethan ring true of a man with integrity and true beliefs, yet at the same time as a citizen of the politically correct world I'm conditioned to be shocked at times.  What a shame that movies today contain entirely more violence and sex than 'Searchers' but entirely less raw human character to prevent offending people and lawyers.Interesting to contrast the conclusion with the modern movies 'Dances with Wolves' or 'Emerald Forest' in which the white captives refuse to separate from their captors...",The Searchers
223,Slim-4,John Wayne's performance stands out in this awesome Western with an emphasis on character.,10,12 November 1999,"John Wayne plays his greatest role as Ethan Edwards, the lead character in this 1956 John Ford Western.  Ethan is a complex man.  You can see it in his eyes.  There is longing, loneliness, hate and love.  He is a mysterious character who never quite fits in.  He rides back into the life of his brother and his wife at the beginning of the film as a door of a Texas ranch house opens.  At the end of the film another door closes as all the main characters enter the house leaving Wayne outside.  The closing of the door at the end of the movie is one of the most powerful scenes in any Western movie.  Edwards watches the other characters enter the house, touches his wrist with his other hand and turns his back.  It is obvious that he is an outsider.He is an outsider throughout the movie.  When he rides up to his brother's ranch house, it is clear that his appearance is a surprise and perhaps an embarassment.  The brother (played by Cameron Mitchell) says that Ethan is welcome, but it's not believable.  There is something between Ethan and his brother's wife (played by Dorothy Jordan).  It is not entirely clear what it is.  It might be love.  It is probably platonic.  The truth is that Edwards' loneliness permeates his being.When his brother and his wife are killed in a Comanche raid and their young daughter taken we see another side of Edwards.  He hates the Comanche or ""Comanch"" as he calls them.  ""They aren't human"", he says.  He and young Martin Pauley (played by Jeffrey Hunter) begin a six-year search for the missing girl.  As the search lengthens Edwards' motives become less clear. Does he want to kill her?  He draws his gun to do so in one scene, but in the end he picks the girl up and carries her back to her people.  I have always had trouble reconciling Ethan's action at the end with his hate of everything touched by the Comanche.  At one point where he and Martin are looking at other captives, Martin observes that the captives ""don't look White.""  ""They aren't White. . .not anymore, Edwards replies.""  Perhaps that's why he must turn his back at the end.  He may not be able to reconcile his feelings about the girl with his hate for the Comanches who have defiled her.This movie has much going for it.  There is the usual strong cast of characters.  Harry Carey, Jr. and his mother are on hand.  Ward Bond does good work as a preacher and Texas Ranger.  The Sons of the Pioneers are here.  Ken Curtis provides some light moments in the film.  The fight between Curtis' character and Martin Pauley is one of the film's best moments.The scenery is awesome, but Ford used Monument Valley so often that it looks oddly out of place in this film.  The Indians include familiar, if nameless, faces from other films.  The Navajos of Monument Valley played Indians in many Ford movies.If this film has a fault, it is it's lack of humanity.  Edwards believes that the Comanches are less than human, but it is he who fails until the end to show his humanity.  There is a powerful scene in the film where he goes crazy shooting buffalo.   ""They won't feed any empty bellies"", he yells as he grabs Martin's gun to continue the slaughter.  This is not a normal man. There is something wrong with Ethan Edwards.  If we don't understand him by the end of the film, it is perhaps because he doesn't understand himself.This is a great film which can be watched over and over again.  The nuances of Wayne's memorable performance make every viewing a unique experience. There is always something there that you missed before.",The Searchers
224,mhesselius,Misguided and melodramatic,2,22 July 2010,"Perhaps John Ford's worst cinematic offense is one of those films that was indifferently reviewed when released, but has since achieved such revisionist stature that it's almost heresy to utter anything negative about it now. Obviously in 1956 John Ford the legend could do what he wanted. It's too bad he didn't want to make a movie featuring complex characters and a thought-provoking story. Instead we get a plot populated by sentimental simpletons doing hokey comedy: Swedish rancher Jorgensen in his gingerbread house, dense Charley McCorry, and simple-minded Mose Harper are exactly the types of stock characters that detract from John Ford's considerable virtues as a director. But the histrionics of all the other actors confirms that Ford was after an extremely melodramatic tone. In addition, he wastes a lot of film on Ward Bond's Ranger captain and Patrick Wayne's cavalry officer, characters who do not add to the story's development and slow the pace considerably. One can only assume John Wayne's son appears because Wayne wanted him to.The landscape is harsh and beautiful, but although barren Monument Valley can easily stand in for Apache country, it cannot take the place of the Great Plains where both the novel and movie are set. Am I the only one who cared that there was no grass in cattle country, or that ranchers in the 1860s were eating dough-nuts for breakfast? And what is it with these Indian captives who go insane in Comanche villages? Couldn't Ford show a little subtlety in his treatment of the interaction between Euro and Native Americans? His sympathetic portrayal of Cochise in FORT APACHE introduces a note of complexity in that movie, creating a dramatic tension that is missing in the melodrama of THE SEARCHERS. It is impossible not to hate Comanche chief Scar, the villain of THE SEARCHERS. Ford's only other attempt to humanize Native Americans came in CHEYENNE AUTUMN (1964) when he had lost his powers altogether. What a shame!",The Searchers

226,AL01-3,One of the Best,9,10 September 2000,"This is widely considered to be one of John Wayne's best films and with good reason. His character, Ethan, is obsessed with tracking down a band of Native Americans who killed members of his family and abducted his niece. It is apparent from his unwavering dedication to his quest that he will either catch up with and kill the Indian Chief responsible for the raid against his family or die in the effort. The Searchers is an incredible character study and the way in which Ethan is consumed with desire for vengeance is fascinating. This is a much darker role than the usual John Wayne character, but he plays the part extremely well. This is also one of the last and one of the best collaborations between Wayne and director John Ford.",The Searchers
227,riderpridethemovie,The real best western,9,13 June 2005,"I've never really enjoyed westerns. They just seem so cliché, all that landscape, dust and gun fighting. And how could they possibly pertain to my urban existence anyway? I doubt I could name more than five that I've seen (Shane, Quicksilver, The Lone Ranger, does City Slickers count?). But The Searchers has convinced me that maybe I should look deeper into the genre. (Of course, the only reason I rented The Searchers is because Paul Schrader said he based Taxi Driver on it.) Yes, the film has landscape, dust and lots of gun fighting, but it also has stunning cinematography, memorable characters and a complex story that put an interesting twist on all those clichés. Take the set-up for example. Uncle Ethan (John Wayne) moseys back to his brother's homestead after serving as a Confederate soldier. Everything seems just fine except that the returning hero really doesn't seem like much of a hero at all. He's curt, has his eyes on his brother's wife and is racist towards Indians, even his adopted nephew, who is one-eighth Comanche. Then his likable and accommodating family is killed off by the very Comanche he detests. This is akin to Hitchcock killing off Janet Leigh in Psycho. All bets are off, and the viewer can only guess as to who else will be killed off by the end, which is crucial when it comes to the climax. The final showdown with Chief Cicatrice is so nuanced, you might think it is simply another gunfight. But pay attention and you will see how every question the film has raised  how could the niece have betrayed them? is the nephew his own man or just Ethan's pup?  is paid off here. Ethan's subtle transformation is especially refreshing in light of the recent success of heavy-handed inferior films about racism such as Crash.",The Searchers
228,jackbenimble,The Searchers are lurcher's.,1,13 December 2009,"Oh dear not another one. I was bored, it's Sunday and sat down really looking forward to this supposedly great western to fill the evening void. Maybe I'm not qualified to comment fully as I didn't make it past half an hour. I figure if a film hasn't grabbed me by then it probably won't get any better. Usually a rubbish film will grab you then go downhill but this.......... well, first off I'm English and even I know that those funny things sticking out the earth don't come from Texas they're somewhere in Utah. That's the first insult. It may be great scenery but great scenery a great film it doth not make. And there's nothing glorious about glorious Technicolor either. It's like being hit on the head with a sledgehammer. Then, oh I dunno just that dumb acting from that time, those stupid children full of beans and cockadoodle dandy acting just irritate the hell out of me as if lots of energy will make up for real acting. Embarrassing. The story just plods along and doesn't build any tension whatsoever with a lot of hammy acting by our stars more fit for a TV show. Then it's just cliché after cliché and the end result is wishing the maker of this film would stop insulting my intelligence and pi** off. I disliked John Wayne as a small boy because I thought he was boring. I think he's boring now.

229,lee1888,Debbies Father,10,24 May 2006,"OK, I have gotten a lot of emails pro and con about Ethan being Debbie's father. And I'm sorry I wrote (welcome home) when in fact it should have been, Let's go home. But that only makes my point stronger. Point. Ethan didn't say, let me take you back home, or, let me take you back to the ranch. But, Let's (as in we) go home. (As in our home) I want you people to remember that in 1955&56 when this movie was being made, you couldn't even put and man and his wife in the same bed together. Look how watered down A Postman Rings Twice was in 1946. And it had all kinds of problems getting by the censors. John Ford did the best he could by giving you clue's in the first 30 minutes or so of this movie. Movies made back then were great because they not only entertained you but also, you had to use your imagination. Not like today's movies where everything is not only spelled out for you, but also put on the screen for you to see.But since so many people now day's needs it spelled out for them, I will do it for you.First of all, Debbie is only about 8 or 9 at the beginning of the movie. As far as how long Ethan has been always, we really don't know for sure, because we don't know if he was in the war for the whole 4 years. But what we do know is that the war had been over for 3 years. Quote, Aaron tells his son. (War ended 3 years ago boy) Now we can assume 4 and 3 are 7 so that makes it about right for Debbie. Now let's jump to were Ethan and Aaron are sitting and talking. Aaron says, Ethan, I saw it in you before the war. You wanted to clear out; you stayed beyond any real reason, why? Well guess what. Well the answer to that question is easy. If you watch the way Ethan and Martha look and watch each other. Look at the way she takes Ethan's coat and folds it up and puts it away and the way Ethan watches her. Then take a look at the scene were Ward Bond watches Martha go get Ethan's coat and brings it to him, and the kiss Ethan gives her on the forehead. You can tell by the look on Ward Bonds face he knows what's going on, and he is put in an awkward spot and all he can do is eat his donut and look straight ahead.Now, do I really need to go on?",The Searchers
230,wmcauliffe-00425,Best Classic Western ever,10,3 May 2021,For sure my favorite Western if not my favorite film. First saw it on the telly as a kid in Australia and it stood out then. John Wayne was never better in a film. Everyone is great in it and how John Ford filmed it all is magic. Modern woke reviewers miss the mark on this masterpiece as they do on most things. A must see for film lovers.,The Searchers
231,RHKLWK,An American Epic,10,30 March 2002,"This is one of the greatest films ever made, and it is not surprising that it is in the ""Top 250.""  I would assign it to the Top 20.It is a film of epic proportion, and it tells an epic tale.  It involves a 7-year search for Wayne's niece, who has been kidnaped by renegade Indians. 
There is a subtext in this movie, as there was in ""Shane,"" involving the love between a single man and a married woman, although in this film it is far more central to the story and to Wayne's character. 
As Wayne, a Confederate cavalryman, returns from the Civil War to his brother's homestead in barren West Texas (in 1868, amid ominous hints that he may have led a lawless life in the three years after the War ended in 1865), he is welcomed by his extended family, including his sister-in-law. 
The chemistry between Wayne and his brother's wife is repressed by both, but study the early scenes very carefully.  Pay particular attention to the scene in the bedroom where she caresses his great coat, and where they are saying goodbye.  Ward Bond's character senses the attachment, and during the goodbye scene he quietly looks the other way to give them some privacy, while finishing his coffee and donut.  The relationship between Wayne's character and his sister-in-law must yield to the story line, but I have no doubt that his love for her is what powers his maniacal 7-year quest to find his niece (her daughter), a search that takes him through blizzards and across deserts, and pits him against one danger after another.   The master, John Ford, was never better, and his company of stock actors is on hand.  Hank Worden, playing Old Mose, is hilarious, sympathetic, and important to the film's conclusion.  Wayne's son in real life, Patrick Wayne (in a very early role), is wonderful as the brand new shave-tail cavalry lieutenant.  Ken Curtis, who later gained fame as ""Festus"" on the ""Gunsmoke"" series, is perfect as Charlie.  And, Jeffrey Hunter does very well as the adopted nephew, who accompanies Wayne on the quest.John Wayne exhibits a remarkable acting talent in this picture.  As in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" and quite a few others, he demonstrated throughout the film that he was one of Hollywood's best actors.  His performance here was inspired.  He speaks one of my favorite lines, early in the movie.  Ward Bond attempts to swear him in as a Texas Ranger, but Wayne declines, saying it wouldn't be ""legal.""  He explains that he took his oath to support the ""Confederate States of America,"" and a man is good for only ""one oath at a time.""  That is pure John Ford.From the panoramic opening scene to the unforgettable closing frame, and throughout the film, there echoes the haunting refrain of the Civil War ballad, ""Lorena"":  ""The years creep slowly by Lorena, the dew is on the grass again . . . . ""  I cannot imagine anyone watching this film and not feeling some yearning for the distant past.  The beautiful cinematography, the sweeping grandeur, the epic story line, the appealing cast, the excellent script, the director of directors:  They all converged at this movie, somewhere in Monument Valley, and there will never be anything like it again.",The Searchers
232,sapblatt,Never knew John Wayne could act so convincingly,7,30 December 2003,"************* CONTAINS SPOILERS ***************John Ford's 1956 epic western `The Searchers' features some excellent acting from John Wayne as the returning home confederate soldier Ethan Edwards. Soon after Ethan reunites with his extended family they are slaughtered by Comanche Indians (except for the two young girls.) This action predictably sends our hero off on a course of vengeance.What makes `The Searchers' interesting is that Wayne's character is not on a traditional rescue mission, but rather he is setting out to kill the younger girl (the posse quickly discovers that the older girl had been murdered on the trail) because she has been contaminated by the Comanche tribe. It seems as if he is trying to rescue her from her horrible plight of being with the tribe for five years. These two characters are rater complicated as the various feelings and motivations are unclear. Does the girl (Natalie Wood) desire to be rescued, or is she happy amongst the Comanche? What causes Wayne to suddenly become more humane at the end and spare her? He seemed rather trigger happy and racist, so it was surprising that he did not end her life.This movie is considered to be amongst the best of all western movies, particularly amongst the John Wayne/John Ford epics. I do not have enough movies under my belt to comment on the latter, but as to the former I find the `The Searchers' to be highly over-rated. John Wayne's character is complex and played very well, but I find the rest of the cast to be pretty horrible with the exception of veteran character actors, Ward Bond (`Rio Bravo' `Mister Roberts') and Vera Miles (`Psycho' `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.') The other roles, particularly the ones played by Jeffrey Hunter, John Qualen and Hank Worden seem to be comical and over played.
The movie itself is amongst the most beautifully filmed I have ever seen. John Ford's familiarity with the location shooting in Monument Valley give this film great quality. Cinematographer Winton C. Hoch was surprisingly not nominated for an Oscar for this film (he won three times prior.) Even with all of the scenic beauty of this film I had trouble `buying' it as the location shooting looks nothing like the Texas prairie that was supposed to be depicted. The overall story of `The Searchers' has served as inspiration for many other movies involving a loners search for a missing girl, notably George Lucas's `Star Wars' and Paul Schraeder/Martin Scorsese's `Taxi Driver.' While there are some general similiarities with these stories I find that the original character is far more despicable than the `Star Wars' hero or the `Taxi Driver' anti-hero, Travis Bickle. I never got the impression that Travis was willing to kill Iris/Easy (Jodie Foster) in order to rescue her from her nightmarish existence and worthless life; he only desired to remove the evil forces that surrounded her.All in all, your time is not wasted watching `The Searchers' but it may not be as good as you have heard. John Wayne's performance along with the beautiful location shots are well worth viewing. For my money, the best serious westerns are `Once Upon A Time in the West,' `The Wild Bunch,' `High Noon,' and `The Unforgiven.' On the lighter side I suggest `Cat Ballou,' `Destry Rides Again,' and `Blazing Saddles.' `The Searchers' seems a little unclear to me as to what type of story it is trying to tell.",The Searchers
233,damonlaycox,The Greatest,10,12 April 2019,This is the greatest Western of all time. John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter make an excellent antagonistic duo. The cast is first rate.

234,Frank-87,Chief Scar is the good guy (too),9,24 February 2003,"Many comments on this page state that this flick is a bit dull and dated at times. Well I think that may be true to some extent, but still it has this monument feel about it, that does make it a classic somehow. Certainly there is not the joyfulness of ""El Dorado"" to be experienced here...
Several comments regret the arrogant view on the Indians, which are presented as utter stupid brutal savages (or ""bad guys""). Well, I myself dislike the black-and-white view of things that many Hollywood movies suffer from, preferring flicks like ""Flaming Star"", ""Little Big Man"" or ""Soldier Blue"". But still I disagree with those comments about this here flick: Chief Scar and Ethan are facing each other as EQUALS and they BOTH are aware of that. All the fighting and killing is originally initiated by the white man. That becomes clear (not only) when they both meet in the Indian village. They level with each other, and it is Scar who explains the reason for the raid on the farm: his sons were killed by white men. Yes, Ethan says that Debbie doesn't deserve to live any more after having been the squaw of an Indian (or something along that line), but this is NOT the attitude of the film-makers; the character Ethan is WRONG there at first and then he LEARNS and in the end he carries Debbie home on his arms. So I think, too, that the movie is a bit dated somehow. But the plot and the attitude are NOT simplistic. On the contrary, there are characters here which all are ""good"" and ""bad"" at the same time. The movie is worth to be watched closely and repeatedly.",The Searchers
235,m-carter-68742,Strong film,9,17 December 2015,"I found this movie to be a great standard for modern westerns. Firstly, John Wayne played his part to perfection even though it was a darker role for him to play. The meaning behind this film was that revenge can be ugly, but it more importantly gives light to the facts that not only Indians can be considered savages. The music in this films was spot on, it fit in well with what was happening. Editing and cuts were pretty smooth. Some things that I did not like was the length, being almost 3 hours long it takes some effort in the middle to keep focused. There were some scenes I didn't find necessary, like the winter scene. I understand why it was put there, to show the amount of time passed, but I don't know that it was necessary. Also in that scene, Wayne was still very tan...kind of odd for the middle of winter! Camera angles were great, they often looked up at Wayne, giving him an almost super hero type aura. If you put camera angle with proper lighting, it gives Wayne a hard look, and towards the end the shadows soften. Also, Monument Valley provides stunning views, one of John Ford's favorite places to shoot his films. This was one of Waynes many successful pictures, but this one was one of my favorites for sure.",The Searchers
236,cruizca,One of the greatest movies of all time,8,18 November 2020,"How good it feels to go back to the Wild West and see the arena again, the chases, John Wayne and Ford at the helm of one of the best westerns I have ever seen. Desert Centaurs tells the intriguing search for the kidnapped family of Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter). In this one, considered by Spielberg himself as ""the best movie in history"" we find the best Wayne, who, full of anger, shows racism and bitterness. Even if I don't always do it explicitly.And is that one of the things that make this story immense is the trust that Ford places on Wayne himself. It's great to see the comfort that the actor conveys in that role.Another point that makes Desert Centaurs shine with their own light is the quality of their shots. This is Ford perspective, depth and color. This is art.But it's not just the technical resources that fascinate me about the film. In addition to his enigmatic nature, Ford is also known to appear more stubborn than he really was. the script is full of unknowns: What did Ethan do when the Civil War ended? Some draw, from the affection that his brother's wife shows when she sees him, an old romance. So, to escape this scandal, Ethan would enlist in the military. What does seem clearer is that after the war is over, Ethan is dedicated to robbing banks (he gives his brother freshly sealed coins, which he quickly hides).The conclusion is almost as round as the movie itself. Some speak of over-acting and geographical failures, but that verdict is only the result of those who cannot see beyond the script and see Ethan as a common hero. Ethan is a loser, an outlaw, and homeless; as depicted in that beautiful ending. A masterpiece.The only question that arises now is ... Will I ever see a Ford movie that disappoints me?

People who dislike this movie (for whatever reason) tend to think that we Ford fans only say we like it because we have to, because everybody else says it's so great.  They're wrong.  I heard one positive comment about this movie, before I knew anything about it, so I rented it (now I own the DVD).  I remember after the final shot, I stared at the tv for a few seconds, then walked upstairs to my room, silently.  I couldn't think what to say, except ""that was a great movie!""  I was almost overwhelmed by Ford's complexity and simplicity, his plainness and his beauty, and of course the performances.  I couldn't sleep that night, all I could think of was the movie.  I hummed that song from the opening titles for weeks.  After seeing it I knew I had been privileged to witness one of America's great works of art.

238,vittoriocosanostra,A phenomenal view inside the wild west lifestyle,10,31 August 2020,"Few films purely about life in the old and wild west can really capture perfection as The Searchers manages to do so well. It has less sugar compared to the more tame and inaccurate Unforgiven (which is inferior to The Saerchers, objectively speaking). And it has more brutality and realism.The film begins with a flashback of a later scene in which a certain character is beaten, thrown in the back of a carriage and taken to a location to be buried by the two main protagonists. However, when the film starts, all the audience hears is an excellent soundtrack, we don't know what's going on yet. When everyone leaves the carriage, they discover that the character is not yet dead and continue to stab and shoot that person, respectively, in cold blood. After that, the iconic line 'As long as I can remember, I always wanted to be an outlaw' is told by the narration of Ethan (John Wayne) and the story begins with a young Ethan. Now, what the Ford myth did here was to introduce us to the brutal nature of western reality and the two main characters in an introduction that lasted a little over a minute, it is the definitive beginning of a film that instantly sets the tone for everything else. thing is to come.You know throughout the film that anyone can be killed at any time, and what happens is far from predictable, especially when Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) enters the screen, you have absolutely no idea what to expect. One of the other reasons why The Searchers is a masterpiece is due to the incredible cast it has. John Wayne, Jeffrey Hunter, Henry Brandon and Hank Worden in the lead, all seem to really be from the time of the soulless gunmen, rather than acting like them. Enhanced by other excellent performances by Vera Miles and Ken Curtis, it is truly a masterpiece of cinema acting.The film follows the life of Ethan Edwards along with an excellent narrative provided by John Wayne from the 1880s to the early 1900s, and as the film begins with the most positive and beneficial terms in the life of attorney for Ethan, who generally has 50's love songs playing in the background, later on in the film's timeline things get bloody and ugly and Ford changes the tone of the songs to give a more serious vibe and also changes their generations (for example, songs from the years 50 for parts of the 50s, 60s to 60s ... etc.). It immerses you in the film and the timeline that is playing at that point.Of course, the only big sequence is the desert rides with Comanches. Trackingshots are always impressive, but even more so when they also tell the story of how popular Ethan is.With a fantastic script, dialogue that never seems to be out of place, superb acting, brilliant musical choices, lack of coverage and really showing the facts of how brutal an outlaw attorney's life can be, it is an absolute masterpiece of cinema .",The Searchers
239,gregorhauser,Concerning Jeffrey Hunter,9,28 November 2001,Just want to add that in my opinion Jeffrey Hunter gave the best performance. The developing of his character is interesting to watch.

In it is a journey and search for a long lost relative thats been kinapped by natives for years. You get to see some incredible scenery and breathtaking lands as the heros do their best to succeed in their quest. Even the supporting cast was great in it with almost every character giving a memorable performance. It was said that many filmakers and directors were inspired by this movie and its easy to see why with how great it is.

242,jimkis-1,Near classic but flawed.,6,17 September 2007,"The main reason to watch The Searchers is to see John Wayne play a pretty unlikeable character. He does it so well once wishes he had played more villainous types in his career instead of caricatures of himself (as time went on). The Searchers and Rio Bravo (made a year or so later) are his two best films of the 50s. Arguably his 2 best films ever. But The Searchers has few flaws that detract from its greatness. One is the fistfight between Marty and his romantic rival; it's typical John Ford stupidity. All of his films seem to have a ""comic"" fistfight as apparently Mr. Ford thought a few numbskulls with an excess of testosterone braining each other was funny. Here it really destroys the mood of the film. (Actually, it's pretty dumb in all his movies.) In fact, the whole romantic subplot with Marty is unnecessary. It's Hollywood not the West. Another flaw is the appearance of Natalie Wood towards the end. This is a girl who has been living with the ""Indians"" for 5 years. Apparently there is an Avon lady in the tepee next door to hers, as she is sporting more eye makeup than any other female character in the movie. Whoever decided to make her up that way apparently did not care that it destroys the credibility of the character. Or is that why John Wayne didn't kill her -- because she is so cute and ""white people""-looking? Indeed, why did he change his mind? That is never truly explained. Nor is it explained why her sister was killed and she wasn't. Not really. And why did all the women who were rescued from the Indians go insane? Is it true that all women of the old west were functional idiots and the least little thing would send them over the edge? Not one woman had the stamina to survive the ordeal with her mental faculties intact? This seems highly unlikely. But to return to the movie itself -- it has seeds of greatness; it's just too bad some stupid decisions were made in the filming.",The Searchers

244,MattB-5,The Best John Wayne....,9,28 June 1999,"Great western, maybe the best ever. Far better than the monstrously overrated 'Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'. Wayne is terrific as the aging, bitter, violent but courageous Ethan, who is a much more interesting figure than most John Wayne roles because he is a flawed hero. Ethan is weary and has lost heart at the beginning of the movie, and finds a bit of his heart at the end, but you never feel that Ethan is a saint. Only real weak link is Jeffrey Hunter who is not convincing.",The Searchers
245,Dierk,The greatest western and maybe the best film ever,10,12 July 2000,"Well, a bold statement but true. Many people think there is not much characterization in the movie, I think they are wrong. The film is about character and family much more than about shaping America (which is a secondary theme). Ethan Edwards is a man who has lost everything when we first meet him. He lost a war (the Civil War), he lost his love (evidently his brother's wife) and therefore lost his home. As the title song implies, he will always wander to find his peace. When he returns to his brothers farm he tries to get back a family - and the Indian raiders destroy instantly. From now on he seeks only revenge. In a lot of scenes he tells of his hatred of everything Indian but his eyes betray him in two key sequences: After the first cavalry attack (we see only the result) Edwards looks at the older white woman with his nieces baby doll, and we know that he knows that the way the Indians are treated is wrong. The second sequence is when his niece comes to warn him. He lets her talk with Martin and looks at her lovingly until she says ""I am one of them"" and starts talking Comanche. He realizes that he has lost her, too. Afterwards he bequeathes his belongings to Martin - another dreaded Indian. But Martin is like a son to Ethan and everything he says and does to him during their search speaks of love and care - he actually wants to save Martin from his own unrest. After bringing his lost niece back he will wander on because he knows that his peace may lie in wandering on - searching (for) his soul. All actors are so good that it hurts, the viewer becomes really a part of their life. The only other film in which Wayne was as good is his last one *The Shootist*. And watch for the ""madman"" Hank Worden!",The Searchers
246,mr. sardonicus,Wayne at his best,9,2 October 2000,"It's difficult to comment on this movie because there are so many threads running through it. John Ford certainly deserves credit for creating this western classic, but it is John Wayne's acting and presence which makes this a masterpiece of western cinema. For all those yokels who think that John Wayne could not act, this film stands as solid evidence to the contrary. There is one scene where Ethan is in the presence of two white girls who had been captured by the Commanches he so bitterly hates. In this shot, he reels around and shoots a contempt filled glare at these two girls that is numbing in its effect. Wow! Rarely can an actor say so much with just a look. No doubt, this movie will be criticized for portraying the Indians as the bad guys, and, certainly, the film does show its 1950s stamp, but as a study of character, this is far from a black and white affair. Ethan is a complicated man who demonstrates the best and worst of American traits. All in all, this film deserves its place as one of America's best. I'm not sure that I would agree that it is the best film of all time, but it is without doubt one of the best westerns ever filmed.",The Searchers

This film isn't that great.,5,12 December 2007,"The Searchers has been totted as Wayne's greatest film so being a fan of True Grit and The Cowboys, I was excited to see it come on AMC recently. I TIVO'd it and watched it this week. Boy, was I disappointed. While I'll agree that Wayne's character has a dark side, I just didn't think it was well acted. And Jeffrey Hunter - where did he learn how to act?? His jerking movements of angst were laughable. In fact, I commented to my wife at one point that I couldn't see how Wayne kept a straight face acting opposite of him in some scenes. And honestly, I think Wayne had a hard time pulling off the dark character.Overall, I would only recommend viewing this movie if it happens to be on and you have a few hours to kill.

249,TheHighVoltageMessiah,"Great at Times, But Not Without Its Faults",8,14 January 2012,"John Ford's ""The Searchers"" has been heralded as one of the best films ever made, an assessment with which I personally disagree. That's not to say I dislike it. To me, it is quite a good film for the most part – only far from flawless.John Wayne gives perhaps his finest performance in the role of Ethan Edwards, the lone man who returns home from the Civil War three years late still in Confederate uniform and still bearing his saber. The film is not afraid to probe into the darkness of this character's soul. He is unapologetically racist, disdainful upon meeting the young Martin Pawley because of his partial Cherokee descent. But after a raid by the Comanche, the two set out on a years-long search for Debbie, Ethan's abducted niece. On the journey, Ethan's bigotry towards the Indians becomes a kind of grim madness. He is shown putting bullet holes in a dead Comanche's eyes so that 'he can't enter the spirit-land', and later wantonly tries to gun down a herd of bison rather than let them become food for those he hates. Wayne plays the part with brooding, frightening, merciless intensity. With one look into his steely eyes, the viewer understands that Ethan is as capable of barbarity and ruthlessness as the so-called savages he condemns. His external and internal odysseys are, to be sure, the stuff of greatness and epic in scope and power. If the film were confined to simply the quest to track down Debbie – gloriously told as it is through sweeping shots of the vistas of Monument Valley – and to Ethan's inner storm of fury, then its reputation would be, I think, more justified.But it is not. Interweaved with this thought-provoking search in the wilderness are the goings-on back at home. These often clownish antics seem so amateurish it is hard to believe they are from the same film. Vera Miles, as Laurie, squawks and squeals when pining for the absent Martin in a manner more befitting a lunatic than a woman in love. She may be amusing, but seems garish and too overwhelmingly silly alongside the more serious storyline. Similarly, the exaggerated Swedish accent of Lars Jorgensen and the idiotic drawl of Laurie's goofball suitor, Charlie, are played up for comic relief. Characters like these two are shallow stock figures and stereotypes, a far cry from the depth of the sullen Ethan. A little humor on the side of a moodier film can be a good thing, but this is jarring and overdone in the extreme. (On occasion, however, it works. The fool, Mose Harper, pops up in the movie every now and again, and actually becomes an endearing and colorful character.) Then there is that scene near the end which has somehow become legendary. Ethan pursues the fleeing Debbie, apparently with the intention of killing her because she has assimilated into the Indian culture. This is the moment for his boiling rage and passionate hatred to climax – much of the film has led up to this point. Yet instead of doing her in, Ethan gathers her gently in his arms and rides her home. Why? What is the reason for this remarkable turnaround and change of heart? What's going through his mind as he looks at her? What, for that matter, is going through HER mind as she looks at HIM? Natalie Wood looks lovely as Debbie, but is given little to work with and is underdeveloped. How does she feel seeing the people she has lived with for five long years being routed by the cavalry? Is she saddened, in shock? Does she care at all? Earlier scenes suggest she shares some bond with these Comanche, though she happily embraces Martin, who she knew in youth as her brother. These mixed attitudes towards her supposed rescuers and captors seem to merit further examination and study. But they are not examined or studied. Neither are the thoughts of Ethan, whose inexplicable act appears to go against much of what is known about his character. If he has his reasons for doing what he does here, they are not told to the audience. One guess is as good as another. As it stands, this famous scene feels as awkward and contradictory as the tacked-on ending of Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"".In spite of its flaws, I still enjoy ""The Searchers"". But it DOES have flaws, and I find it too rough around the edges to call it a masterpiece. The superior portions of the film are juxtaposed with sections of considerably less quality. This creates an end result that can be somewhat inconsistent and patchy, although it admittedly has bright flashes of brilliance.",The Searchers
250,fahdshakir,Overrated,4,25 February 2016,"The opening shot is pretty gorgeous and there are a few other remarkably picturesque moments, but let's be honest, the film itself is campy foolishness. Aside from John Wayne himself, the acting is terrible in that nonsensical and overacted ""aw shucks, billy!"" way that detracts from what was an interesting portrayal by Wayne of a seething and bitter old man presumably still pining for the good old days of slavery. And probably it's easy to say this now, but the movie itself is a sobering reminder of how poorly Native Americans were treated and depicted. I suspect that's why it's rated so highly, perhaps compared to other contemporary works, this movie was more progressive - I mean, he didn't even kill the girl at the end for having been with an ""Injun.""

251,jasonw-5,A western with subtext that lives on.,10,10 May 2005,"A truly great film that needs multiple viewings to really capture the depth and subtext that exists within each character. John Wayne's Ethan Edwards is such an unlikable character struggling with so much inner turmoil over hatred toward Indians, contempt towards a military that surrendered to the North and forever pining for his brothers wife that only John Wayne could have pulled off the role. Anyone else would have been despised by audiences of the time.Director John Ford holds back nothing as he captures both the darkness and the beauty of the rugged old west, setting his film deep in Monument Valley and easily making you forget the fact that the film takes place in Texas. The reasoning behind the lone star location reinforces the independence that these men are striving for, fighting not only to live free of government control but free of fear from the natives that surround them.Make this film part of your library and it will easily become one of you favorite films.JMW",The Searchers

253,imahottieandahalf,another western...,5,24 November 2003,"There have been many westerns made throughout the history of the movies. You have your cowboys and Indians chasing each other, exciting chase and fight scenes and some sort of a plot or another.  What was just described is your typical western movie.  Yet, `The Searchers' didn't seem to follow this generality of movie making.  	Although there were many negative things about the movie, it stepped away from the `norm' and that is a very positive aspect to the film. 
	The opening scene has a door opening, and the story begins.  `The Searchers' is a tale of a tragic event, which causes a little girl, Debbie (Natalie Wood), to get taken away from her Uncle, Ethan (John Wayne), and brother, Martin (Geoffrey Hunter), among her immediate family.  Once Ethan and Marty notice that Debbie was missing, they take off by horse and search for her for years to come. This is about the extent of the plot.  Doesn't sound very exciting, and well, to be honest, sometimes it really isn't.  The movie didn't necessarily make you lose interest in it; it was just slow and very repetitive sometimes.  	`The Searchers' seemed to skip from scene to scene very abruptly and it would introduce characters into a new scene without even mentioning them, leaving you to wonder where they came from and how they got there.
	`The Searchers' seemed to often skip from idea to idea as well.  There would be something happening in one scene and there would be questions coming up in your mind, such as, `why are they going there?' or `where did that come from?'  For example, in one part of the film, Ethan and a few others went out into the desert on horseback, and while they were leaving, Mrs. Edwards went after them saying something to the extent of `no Ethan, don't go!' Yet, it doesn't explain why he's leaving or what he's leaving for.	Overall, the movie was rather confusing, yet at the same time it was still very well done.  Another issue the movie had was the acting.  Half of the acting was tolerable, but the other half wasn't even nearly close to that.  I think the worst actor/actress in the entire movie was, one of the daughters, Lucy. She was random and she had no expressions.  Harsh, but her acting talent was non-existent.  John Wayne and Geoffrey Hunter are about the only ones with any talent in their body, so it seems. So, as discussed thus far, there are problems with acting and the portrayal of scenes and ideas.  Though, the cinematography of the movie was wonderful. The sets were well done and well placed, while the costumes of the characters were also portrayed very well.  `The Searchers' had perfect music, as well.  It's been said that, in plays, `a good pit is never heard.'  Well, the same idea goes for movies.  If the musicality of the movie is just right, nothing will stick out, and that is exactly what happened in this movie.  It was placed at the right times and it never stuck out, giving the movie just the right zing to it. 
So, in short, `The Searchers' is lacking in acting ability and plot, but the overall feel of the film is what makes the balance perfect and is what makes it become a great film.  Possessing the title of one of the best westerns ever made is one name that should stay with `The Searchers.'  Even though the movie is slow at times, it is definitely worthwhile to watch.  Opening with a clever beginning scene, it does just the opposite in the latter, so with a door closing, the plot has finally wrapped and the film has ended.",The Searchers
254,buddyboy28,Possibly the greatest western ever put on celluloid. Visually stunning and multi-layered.,9,27 August 2013,"From the opening sequence of the camera shot of the opening of a door which introduces the viewer to a parched barren landscape, to the closing sequence where another door closes the story, this is cinematic perfection. John Wayne gives one of his finest performances amongst his 150 movie roles in director John Ford's landmark western. Wayne walks a fine line between good and bad, heroic and reckless, as Ethan Edwards, an embittered confederate soldier who returns home from years of fighting in the civil war. e is a burned out loner, full of pain and anger, which is only further fuelled by the brutal massacre of his family at the hands of a Comanche tribe.Before the likes of The Man With No Name and Mad Max, Ethan Edwards was the ultimate symbol of an anti-hero. He is a dark and complex creation with inner demons. And yet he doesn't have one single scene of exposition where he talks about himself in any detail. He doesn't recount one painful experience in his life prior to returning home. He shows it purely through his expressions and attitude.As the far as the plot of the film goes, it's practically paper thin but the characters and the themes are from simple. It's by far one of the most multi-layered films I've seen. The story is set over five years as Ethan sets off on a never-ending search to try and retrieve his kidnapped niece at the hands of the Comanches and take his revenge. Ethan's obsessive quest gradually becomes darker as he battles against the wilderness, hunger, thirst, heat, cold and last but not least his nephew Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) who joins him on the long trek.One of the best aspects of the film is the relationship between these two characters, which in a way is the heart of the story. Martin is a quarter Comanche himself, so from the very beginning upon meeting him, Ethan has an instant dislike for the young man. Gradually as the pair travel together, their relationship is as hot and cold as the weather changes they face. It constantly changes between hatred, respect and affection as Ethan gradually finds some humanity throughout the journey.The film is one of the most analysed in the history of cinema, with many different interpretations of the characters motivations and back stories. For instance at the beginning of the film, we know instantly that Ethan is in love with his brother's wife. But nothing is said, we can just tell from their actions and body language. But we don't know if anything has happened between them. That's one of the most impressive things about a film that's 57 years old. It is so subtle and achieves different meanings and interpretations on subsequent viewings.It's easily one of the bleakest and most brutal westerns in terms of the events that occur throughout the story. And yet visually it's far from violent. Children are kidnapped, young women are raped and murdered, and men are shot and burned but hardly any of these despicable acts are actually shown. Ford proves that less is more. In 1957 because of the strict censorship, Ford obviously wouldn't have been allowed to show a lot of these moments but I have a feeling that even if the censors would have allowed it, he would still have filmed it in this way. Leaving the acts of violence to the viewer's imagination is much more powerful and unsettling.Because of the dark themes of the story, Ford chose to balance the tone out with some humour. The sub-plot involves Martin's on/off relationship with a woman who is impatiently waiting for him to return home so that they can settle down together. Apart from providing some comedy, I think this situation is a nice parallel of Ethan and Martha's relationship, and contrast his present loneliness. The fact that Ethan has lost the love of his life and his inner turmoil may prevent him from having an happy future like Martin. Or if Martin loses his woman he may end up like Ethan. Forever an outsider. As the story goes on, Ethan finds some of his humanity, and it isn't portrayed in a typical Hollywood magical transformation. Instead it's a more real gradual progression, and by the end he isn't a completely different person, just a less angry one with a less prejudiced outlook on people. It's a great character arc. Ford definitely created a classic here. It deserves it's status. The likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese cite it as one of the greatest films ever made and they're right. It's a visually stunning movie. The scenery is majestic. You could freeze frame many camera shots in the film and imagine it been a picture on your wall. The cinematography is so eye-catching and gorgeous. It's a masterpiece in film-making and storytelling, touching on a very dark subject matter that's wrapped up in visual beauty.",The Searchers
255,zootrouble,"A close second to ""how green was my valley""",9,10 December 2006,"John Ford here takes us into a character study on anger and hatred. Most westerns are not nearly as deep as this one. This is one thing that separates the work of Ford from others. His westerns are about the characters first, and the backdrop second. Of course, the shots of Monument Valley have no equals in the history of cinema, but even this greatness is secondary to the primary message of the movie.The movie is about loss-inducing hate, in its most powerful form. The primary character (played by the late John Wayne) here is revealed to be a madman in a sense, the kind of man who leads the mob. It is learned early on in the film that he lost precious family members in a massacre; his whole life is then devoted to revenge. Not unlike Moby dick, but with people; there are two sides here. Watch this one, but be prepared to be shocked. Wayne stops at nothing to achieve his desired affect.ZooTrouble",The Searchers

Perhaps audiences in 1956 were so enamoured with Ford and Wayne in general, and not too critical about (?un?)realistic sets, marginal dialog and a soporific story that the title has reached ""greatest"" proportions. I liked Steiner's music; is that what 'made it' in many minds?Maybe you take the grade school crowd to see this if it's screened and you'd like to show them an old western and what the movies used to be like.

It is also unceasingly melodramatic and the music is annoying, every line seems to be punctuated by the ridiculous soundtrack. All the actors are so wooden and come off as either insincere or just over the top ""emoting."" It is very tedious for the audience when every character is angry and emotional. The characters seem to be riding around in circles in the same 500 square yard area. There are so many goofs and mistakes it's like there was never any editing.

258,ericglunneborg,A man searches for his niece while dealing with racism,10,12 November 2003,"At first glance, The Searchers appears to be a typical western movie about cowboys ad Indians, or in this case, white settlers and Indians. The settlers are shown as hard working people trying to make a living in a desolate area. In contrast, the Indians are the bad guys who kill the white settlers and steal their young girls. In  reality, the movie is much more than that. It is a movie about a man's struggle with racism and the hatred and anger that can accompany those feelings.The story begins with Ethan Edwards returning to Texas 3 years after the end of the civil war. Ethan arrives at the home of his brother Aaron. The family, especially Aaron's wife, Martha and their three children, Lucy, Ben and Debbie, are happy to see him. The family has another son, Martin Pawley, who has been raised by Aaron and Martha after his family had been killed by Comanches. Ethan treats Martin with contempt and forbids him from calling him Uncle as the other children do. In stead, Ethan calls him a half breed, because he is 1/8 Cherokee. As the story continues. Aaron and Martha ad their son Ben are killed by a Comanche raiding party. The girls, Lucy and Debbie are taken prisoner. Ethan, Martin and Lucy's boyfriend Brad go out to hunt for the girls. After Lucy is found dead, Brad gets killed when, over taken with grief, he rushes ff to charge at the Indians. For five years, Ethan and Martin search relentlessly for Debbie. It becomes an obsession with them. Ethan searches for Debbie with the thought of killing her when he finds her. He knows that Debbie has most likely been raped and he justifies his thoughts by declaring that once a white girl is taken by a Comanche, she is no longer white.  Martin follows along to prevent her uncle from killing her out of vengeance.The name John Wayne personifies an American hero. The parts he typically played were rough and tough heroic individuals who were always on the side of justice. In this movie, however, he  plays a man who is heroic but filled with bitterness. John Wayne brings to life a self-confident tough loner, who shows love for his family and racial hatred  towards Indians and we can also assume, blacks.Jeffrey Hunter's portrayal of Martin Pawley helps us to see him as a young man who feels love and acceptance from Aaron's family. Although Ethan repeatedly tells him that he is no blood relation, Martin continues to refer to Aaron and Martha as his uncle and aunt, and Debbie as his sister. Although Martin may be naïve, especially in his romance toward Laurie and in his accidental purchase of a large squaw for a wife, he is nonetheless honest and ethical.Although the movie is mostly a drama, it does have it's lighter moments provided by the other actors.  Hank Worden as  Mose Harper regularly recites poetry and Shakespeare. He appears to be crazy and not aware of the seriousness of what has happened, yet, in spite of this, he plays an important part in leading Ethan to Debbie. The only reward he wants is to be taken home to sit by a fireplace in a rocking chair. Ward Bond, on the other hand,  is a talkative Texas Ranger Captain who doubles as a minister. He is able to switch roles from gunfighter to a man of peace without much effort.
Vera Miles is Martin Pawley's love interest who has waited for 5 years for Martin to return. Although she is angered by his wanting to continue the search for Debbie, her performance adds humor to the movie. A good example is when she reads the one letter that Martin has written to her in the 5 years he has been gone and she becomes  outraged when she learns that he has accidentally married a squaw.The reviewer gives this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating. It is filmed in an area that gives the film its rugged feeling. The setting is an untamed wilderness which gives a feeling of both beauty and danger. Unlike other movies that may sugar coat the issue, this movie describes the racial prejudice that many of the white people had toward the native Americans. John Wayne's character, in particular shows how someone can struggle with racism to the point that it becomes an obsession with him. It also shows, how a man can overcome racial feelings, as Ethan did when he found his niece. As he struggled with his emotions, Debbie was no longer the object of his vengeance and hatred toward the Comanche's. She was once again the little girl who he had loved 5 years earlier. The reviewer especially liked the similarities between the beginning and the end of the story, in the beginning, Ethan arrives as a lone solitary person, and he leaves the movi e in the same way.",The Searchers
259,Jason-38,"Not politically correct, thank God!",9,19 June 1999,"Read Alan LeMay's fine novel, THE SEARCHERS, and you will begin to understand that John Ford's treatment of this material is really restrained. Just as importantly, read the history of the Texas frontier and you will begin to understand that it was far more savage than anything this film depicts.In this politically correct age, it has become unfashionable to tell the truth about history. The warfare on the Texas frontier between the Comanches and the Texans was just as horrible as any war of ethnic cleansing. Historically, it was an inevitable conflict that brought about the end of the Comanches' way of life as plains warriors. The fact is that they brought it on themselves. Comanches, and their Kiowa allies, were predatory raiders. They had good reason for hating Anglo-Saxons and Hispanics. However, their methods of making war were inhuman.In John Ford's film (not in Alan LeMay's novel), Henry Brandon's Chef Scar has blue eyes. This was actually known to occur on the frontier. Obviously, it meant that the Native American in question had a white ancestor. The racism in the THE SEARCHERS is focused on the 19th century fear of miscegenation. John Wayne's character is obsessed with stopping his niece from being the sexual partner of a man of another race.Yet, the film and the novel end with an ultimate act of forgiveness. They do this in different ways, the novel being far more eloquent. Through their suffering, the characters come to have a greater understanding of what it is to be a human being.There is a lot wrong with the Ford film. Monument Valley, Utah looks nothing like the plains of Texas. The costumes, firearms, and livestock are anachronistic. However, there is lot more that is right about it. Essentially, it tells the truth about American history. It also has John Wayne's best performance. It would have been worthy of an Academy Award, if the Oscar was actually awarded on merit instead of industry politics.THE SEARCHERS means much more than awards or box office grosses. It reminds us of our own humanity. To paraphrase a quote that J.D. Salinger once used: God teaches the heart not with ideas, but with pains and contradictions. THE SEARCHERS teaches the heart.Historical fact, not politically correct nonsense, has much to teach us. Today, the Comanche people are respected American citizens. They have served with honor in the U.S. Armed Forces and in their communities. A number of them have white relatives. Many Comanches and Texans have embraced each other as family. Together, they have overcome a history of bloodshed and learned to forgive.As you may have guessed by now, this writer has Native American blood.",The Searchers
260,Blondeatheart56,"Good movie, bad acting",7,29 October 2003,"""The Searchers"" was one of those movies where at one moment it could have completely lost your attention and then it snatches it back up again with something funny or intense.  It has its good parts and it has its not so good parts.  For instance, the scene where Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) kicks Look (Beulah Archuletta), his Indian wife, down a sandy hill is definitely entertaining and a good part.  A not so good part could be any one of the parts that this reviewer doesn't even remember seeing!   ""The Searchers"" was definitely a western movie and it wasn't so bad that anyone should go around saying that it was one of the worst movies ever made. It had a good entertainment value and only put me to sleep a few times!The title of this John Wayne movie fits in with the movie's plot perfectly. The movie is about the struggle to find Debbie Edwards (Natalie Wood) after she had been kidnapped by Comanche Indians at the young age of 10.  The title, ""The Searchers"" is referring to two men in particular, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) and Ethan Edwards (John Wayne).  They spend 5 or 6 years searching for Debbie.  They never give up or start putting less effort into the search, even though that's exactly what it is, it's a search.  They don't know exactly where the Indians will be, they have to search for them. They do a pretty good job of it too.The acting in this movie was probably great for the time period it was filmed in.  But for our time it wasn't all that fantastic.  There were some parts where it was pretty convincing, but for the most part any fool could tell that it was just acting and nothing more.  The scene where Lucy Edwards (Pippa Scott) stares straight out the window and slowly lets out a horrific scream had to be the worst acting I have ever seen!  It was completely unbelievable!  It did provide for some entertainment though.
John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, the Civil War veteran who comes home at the beginning of the movie, all alone, to his family.  Wayne's character has a very deep hatred towards Indians which doesn't allow him to get along with Martin Pawley (Hunter) very well since he is a half-breed.  He calls Martin a blanket head more than once throughout the movie and that right there is a racist remark.  This reviewer didn't like Wayne's character very much at all.John Wayne's acting job wasn't all that bad.  Most of the time he was either being serious, mean, or loving.  Wayne is excellent at being serious and mean!  There would be times throughout the movie when he would be talking completely calm and then all of a sudden scream at the top of his lungs at somebody.  It was kind of scary.The most memorable character in the film had to be Mose Harper played by Hank Worden.  He was a little loopy in the head and the only thing he really wanted out of life was to sit in a rocking chair by the fire.  He loved to say ""Thank you kindly.""  If this reviewer could have met any one of the characters in the movie, it would have been Mose Harper.""The Searchers"" was your typical Western with typical cowboy and Indian costumes, typical cowboy and Indian music, and the typical cowboy vs. Indian theme happening.  It had a great amount of entertainment and an excellent plot.  The only thing that could have been done better was the acting.
If this reviewer had to pick between never seeing ""The Searchers"" again or having to watch it at least once a month, she would pick watching it at least once a month.  This movie definitely didn't suck and although it had it's boring parts here and there, it was a good movie.",The Searchers
261,marykateandashleyarebeautiful415,wide eyed and fun filled,8,31 October 2003,"A movie with fun filled adventure, semi romance, and comedy, not to mention a western. John Wayne as the leading role is a must, for his natural cowboy ways. Through out the movie you will embark on horseback riding, Indian fighting, life saving, as well as some old fashioned wise cracks. During this movie Ethan Edwards visits his relatives, he leaves for a little while. To his dismay he returns to some of his relatives being slaughtered by Indians. Though he finds the bodies of most of the women, he has yet found his niece Debbie's body. While thinking things through he besides to go and search for the Indians that took Debbie. Well he's not going alone, little annoying Marin Pawley is tagging along for the ride. Not just for fun but he calls Debbie family, the reason being Debbie's  parents had taken him in and treated him well. The travel on horse back for many years, they always found Indians but never the right ones. They communicated with them and sometimes traded with them, the funny thing is Marin one time ended up leaving with a wife. Well as they search they make friends and visit old ones. Then they finally found some information out about the Indians that took Debbie, the leaders name was scar. Ethan and Martin seemed to always be on Scar's tail but never caught up with them. Well they finally did and they saw Debbie all right but as an Indian and she did not want to leave she even called them her people. John Wayne was a terrific actor considering what year it was and the technology he had to work with. I loved his line that he always said ""That Will Be The Day"". Then Jeffery Hunter made a great sidekick, well if that is what you call his and Wayne's relationship during the movie. He was spunky and handsome for an older gentleman. There were other actors and actresses that did not make as much as an appearance during the film as Wayne and Hunter. Such as Vera Miles, she was very beautiful and they way she portrayed her character was very well thought out as you could tell. Not just by the way she moved on set but by her gestures and real feelings. My thought of this movie is that im not much of a western fan, if it wasn't for Wayne's and Hunter's little wisecracks I doubt I could make if through the movie. It was very humorous and fun, for a movie that normally wouldn't catch my eye. I would in deed watch it again in the future. Finally say they picked great actors and actresses to play the characters.",The Searchers
262,Jennydavis131,This movie is one of the better westerns that i have seen,7,31 October 2003,"The title of the movie `The Searchers' has to do with John Wayne searching for his kidnapped niece. The film begins with Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returning home to his brothers family after many years. His brother is played by Walter Coy (`The Young Guns'). Wayne finds out his family had adopted a boy, Martin (Jeffrey Hunter), who's a quarter Indian.  Because of that, Ethan does not get along with Martin very well. One evening while Ethan was away, the family gets killed by Comanche Indians, but the littlest girl gets away, but is kidnapped by the Indian chief. Ethan and Martin set out on a quest to find his niece, Debbie, and rescue her from the `uncivilized' Indians. During the whole movie, Ethan is planning on killing Debbie as soon as he finds her, all because she was raised by Comanche's.
This Film was directed by John Ford who had made many great western movies. The settings were very realistic and shot on location in Utah, and Arizona. In my opinion, John Wayne's acting was not very good. In some scenes, he seemed very dull and his signature saying `That'll be the day' is in almost every scene and gets old quickly. Only in a few parts did I notice some sort of emotion that would contribute to his performance.Racism was a big part of the old west and even the 1950's when the film was made. The director also captures this in a wide way. Wayne's character was very racist towards the Indian's.  He shows this by mistreating Martin and cracking racist comments towards the Indian's by saying `blanket head' and implying that the Comanche are uncivilized and brutal people.
This movie is one of the better westerns that I have seen, but still did not completely capture my attention. The film seemed to start out slow then have a rising action then slow than rise and so on. I would recommend this film to anyone who has not seen a western and wants to experience it, but it's not a film to see twice. I would rate this film a 7 out of 10.",The Searchers
263,Blondi85,A well done western film,8,31 October 2003,"Although this movie was slow at times, it kept my interest throughout the whole film. Even if you are not a fan of western movies, this is a movie to rent sometime in your life.The title of the movie is self-explanatory. The movie begins with Uncle Ethan ( John Wayne) returning to town after years of being away at war. His family greets him happily, especially his nieces and nephews, who he hardly recognized since he had been away so long. Tragedy strikes. Upon hearing that an Indian attack is going to occur, Ethan and Martin ( Jeffery Hunter ) go off to fight the Indians. They come back to find they're too late. Their house has been burned to the ground, every family member murdered and Ethan's two young nieces Lucy and Debbie missing and presumed kidnapped. The long search begins to find them, thus the title The Searchers.The acting was better than average. John Wayne portrayed the blunt, sarcastic, racist character believably. You can feel his hatred towards the Indians and his love-hate relationship with Martin and Debbie. Jeffery Hunter acting was also notable. His comedic timing was well done in certain scenes, as well as his dramatic abilities. His character, along with Vera Miles who played Laurie Jourgenson, provided the romance for the movie. There is a strong supporting cast including Natalie Wood.
The location they chose to film had the feeling of the old west. The scenery was beautiful. The photography showed the vastness of the large area they had to search. The costumes matched the era. The costumes look so dirty and dusty, it looks as though they have been searching for years.Lastly, even if you do not like western movies, the director John Ford brings out the best in cast and crew. This movie, considered a classic would be a great first time western to watch.I give this 1956 movie 8 out of 10 stars.",The Searchers
264,holograf,long and stupid,6,28 November 2020,"This movie was tediously long compared to the amount of things actually happening in it. also it has one of the stupidest plot twists in the history of film, when the lead character (john wayne) suddenly decides to attempt to shoot a beautiful 16 year old kidnapped white girl because from a distance he heard her utter a few comanche words. he failed in his attempt to kill her, and later we learned she is fine and not a deranged comanche. so why is he a hero? makes no sense. at the end a younger man saves her life, yet john wayne's character rides in with her and after safely delivering her he walks off into the sunset as an underappreciated hero in what is considered to be an epic scene. minor problem is it's nonsensical. absurd non-sequitors that had me rolling my eyes abound in this story.i thought finally i would see a john wayne movie where he did something cool that earned him his reputation that i do not understand, but nope, he did nothing in this movie but talk tough.",The Searchers
265,29055,Ford and Wayne doing what they do best,9,18 December 1998,"John Ford's classic Western, has inspired many quest movies and tv series since its release. The film is a series of episodes linked by the 10 year quest for a niece stolen by Indians as a child. Wayne's Ethan Edwards, an embittered Confederate veteran shows only hatred for all redskins and is uncomprimising in his intended treatment of his niece when he finds her. Modern cinema audiences may find this uncomfortable, especially since western folklore has been reassessed over the last 20 years. But don't let this put you off. Ford's treatment is a modern allegory and Ethan can be forgiven his sins when, at the final denoument, one act of kindness gives us hope, and we feel Ethan has learned an important lesson. Tolerance. Everything about this film makes it a classic and perhaps the best in its genre. Ford's direction is as impeccable as ever, Frank Nugent's script and Winton Hoch's cinematography give us some of the classic images of the cinema. John Wayne, as ever, doesn't even need to act. He just sits tall in the saddle and perpetuates the myth.",The Searchers
266,triton_ogletree,Difficult to describe...,8,6 August 2019,"On the one hand, this movie is extremely impressive. On the other, it's unnecessarily campy/cheesy to the point of irritation. I'm not sure how I feel about this movie (I didn't dislike it) but here we go...The good:The sets (natural settings in Utah) are fantastic!
The cinematography is masterful!
The film requires further viewings (this is a good thing.)The bad:Some of the characters are bad...like, really bad.
Some of the dialogue is also bad.The review:This is a complex movie with a simple plot (but perhaps not so simple.) Basically, a man returns from the Civil War after several years of the war being over. He is suddenly independently wealthy and decides to stay with his brother. Already his character is suspicious to say the least. His brother and him don't seem to get along too good which instantly makes the viewer question why he would stay with someone he doesn't seem to care for in the first place...and that's the point...This is a rare movie that doesn't try to spell everything out for you. You are meant to come to your own conclusions and consider why characters do what they do and what's going on behind closed doors. It is extremely successful in this aspect. Ultimately, some natives arrive and kidnap the main character's niece (in theory.) John Wayne gives probably his best performance in this film (sorry Rooster.) His character then embarks on a recovery mission to bring back his niece. As previously mentioned, the setting (although, not believable, as the film is supposed to take place on the plains and NOT Monument Park, Utah) is stunning and each shot looks like a painting. Seriously! It's breathtaking how good some of these scenes look. I love great scenery, cinematography and films that you have to think through and this is great in every facet of that. So what's the problem with this masterpiece of cinema? Why wouldn't I give it a 10?Some things in this movie are just plain stupid. First off, the antagonist (again, a Native American) is played by a very Caucasian (blue eyed) actor...why? There were plenty of native actors in America at the time, so why did this guy have to be so obviously not native? It almost feels like a black face moment for no reason at all. There's also a character that is (supposed to be the comic relief but in reality is...) just plain stupid. This particular character is annoying in the same way that I find Jar Jar Binks annoying. All of his lines are atrocious, he's not funny and he brings an unnecessary level of camp to an otherwise un-campy film.There's also some really melodramatic stuff that happens and it seems out of place in keeping with the tone of the film. I realize that the plot is melodramatic on its own but it doesn't need to become a soap opera and it occasionally does this and seems out of place. I liked this movie and want to love it but there's definitely some flaws. If you can get passed the ridiculousness that seems to be stitched in to make you feel things, this movie is pretty amazing. After you watch it (assuming you will,) let it resonate in your brain for a while and watch it again because like a magician performing a card trick, this film will make you think you know what's going on but you will realize quickly that you may have been incorrect in this assumption.It's absolutely worth your time (again, it's a flawed masterpiece but it's still a masterpiece) and is probably worth seeing several times (you'll see and realize things that you didn't on the first go around.) I just wish that a few things in this film were different as I would easily rank this as the best western that I have seen were it not for some cheeseball nonsense. Don't let that destroy the movie for you. It's great despite this but you may just end up with mixed emotions like me....I shutter to say this but...this might be a movie that could actually stand to be remade...if done correctly (which it wouldn't be)...but it's still hard not to imagine The Duke in the role...",The Searchers
267,StoryArchitect,Insight Story,9,24 June 2007,"I enjoyed ""The Searchers,"" especially some of John Ford's and cinematographer Winton Hoch's stunning shots, beautifully framed, of Monument Valley, but I found the incongruous music, bad acting, and Hollywood sound stage scenes distracting. Confusion between drama and melodrama threads its way through the film, as displayed by various actors, including Jeffrey Hunter (Martin Pawley), Vera Miles (Laurie Jorgensen), and Dorothy Jordan (Martha Edwards). So the film fluctuates between serious art and silly entertainment. Cliché and comedy kick against naturalism and tragedy. But sometimes it works: The offbeat court jester character, Mose Harper, for example, shows how Ford and screenwriter Frank Nugent use an archetype well (the glee Mose Harper displays in the face of battle reminds me of the antic samurai in Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai,"" made three years before ""The Searchers"").But the film's minuses pale in comparison to the film's pluses. I was moved by the grand vision and the grandeur of the film. I felt the sweep of the epic landscape and the epic story. I felt the visual romanticism of the West that Ford and Hoch painted on film. I felt the calculated contrast and fusion of shadow and light, deep and shallow space, human body and rugged terrain. Man and earth. I felt the grace and menace of the film's handling of terror and violence--deftly implied and left to your imagination, stirring in the viewer a sickening comprehension of horror unrivaled by ghoulish displays of blood and gore that you find in less mature works. I felt the subtly of John Wayne's acting and the simmering intensity of his character's (Ethan Edwards's) quest. I felt the power of the story. A classic hero's journey. A loner and outsider on a relentless quest. A quest to find a lost child. A quest for vengeance.But vengeance motivated by what? More than I thought when viewing the film without benefit of the special features and commentaries on the Blu-ray DVD.The commentaries educated me about the film's intelligence. I now have a far greater understanding and appreciation for the film's achievement in terms of directing, technique, editing, themes, and story. I understand what Peter Bogdanovich calls the film's intentional ""complicated ambiguity"" about racism, which oozes through the film's action and dialog. Ethan Edwards is a racist, a character flaw corroborated, I realized, by the exposition at the film's start where we learn about his service on the Confederate side of the Civil War.I learned that Ford's visual influences include artists roughly contemporary with the film's late 19th-century setting: painters Frederic Remington (1861-1909) and Charles Russel (1864-1926), and filmmaker D.W. Griffith (1875-1948). I learned that Ford didn't storyboard, he simply saw the film in his head, shot swiftly, in one or two takes, didn't shoot from several angles for coverage, never rehearsed action sequences, and assembled the film the way he shot it. Sure and efficient, Ford edited the film before he shot it. Effortless mastery.But I learned most of all about the story. I suddenly realized during Peter Bogdanovich's commentary that Ethan Edwards's (Wayne's) quest is motivated by more than a relentless search for a lost child. Bogdanovich didn't spell it out, but he told me what I need to know to connect the dots. He told me what I didn't pick up on at all my first viewing--that Ethan Edwards and his brother's wife (Martha Edwards) love each other. Wow. And once you're told this, you watch and see how Ford and Nugent reveal Ethan's and Martha's love clearly at the very beginning of the film. And then you understand--Ethan Edwards wants to avenge the brutal rape and murder of the woman he loved.Ethan Edwards searches not for just any child, but for his lover's child. He searches for the daughter (at first daughters, Lucy and Debbie) that he could have had if he were more like his brother, a homebody, rather than a ""prodigal brother""--a rebel. Martha married the backup man rather than the man she really loved, just as Laurie Jorgensen (Vera Miles) almost marries the backup man rather than the man she really loves, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), Ethan's surrogate son and sidekick.Ford, Nugent, and Hoch tell a tale of unrequited love and love avenged. A classic tale told so inferentially, subtlety, deftly that I didn't even get it at first. Ethan Edwards makes a journey of obsession. He runs on racist-fueled hatred for the Commanche (Scar) who butchered his (Ethan's) lover . Ethan's morally confused vengeance runs so deep that he seeks Martha's lost daughter not to save the daughter but to murder her. But the dark side of his nature loses. The hero side wins. I don't know if we can call it forgiveness. I think we could simply call it love: Ethan's love for Martha trumps the racist vengeance he feels toward Scar. In the end, Ethan saves Debbie, and in so doing he not only saves his love for Debbie's mother, his true love, Martha--he saves himself.

269,JPTaylor,A compelling but flawed film.,8,31 October 2003,"""The Searchers"" is, in itself, a paradox; the movie contains greatness, a compelling tale of persistence and obsession, the archetypal quest.  John Wayne's character is deep and visceral, and the cinematography is stirring and effective.  However, the movie is scarred by silly subplots that only detract from the theme and hold this movie safely from my pedestal of greatness.The film tells the story of Ethan Edwards, a rough, rigid confederate veteran of the Civil War.  All other characters are dwarfed next to him - even Martin Pauley (Geoffrey Hunter), his companion and co-star, seems shallow and simple by comparison.  Despite my usual prejudice toward John Wayne characters, I found Ethan's story engaging and rewarding.The Searchers opens with an indoor view of a door opening to a figure silhouetted against a majestic Texas landscape stretching out for miles, symbolizing one of the driving themes in Westerns - one man, poised against the elements.  After a short exposition telling us the characters and setting through casual dialogue, the story launches as a group of Commanche Indians murder a family and burn there house.  Ethan returns to find a burned house and the knowledge that two daughters have escaped and are now somewhere in the midst of the Texan desert, which drives the plot of the entire movie.Early on in the film, we can absolutely feel the hopelessness of the search - Ford allows his characters appear tiny and insignificant amidst an incomprehensibly large wilderness, and this technique is very skillfully performed. The cinematography is consistently epic and effective, such as when John Wayne and several other men coming riding in to meet with Indians, and the camera flies out to show John Wayne and his men pathetically small in the foreground while the many Indians progressively come into view in the background.  Ford's cameras are expressive but never forced, allowing the viewers to identify with the frame without shoving it in their face.Throughout the film, Ethan proves himself to be primarily driven by a passionate hatred and a lust for vengeance.  He does not attempt to hide his disgust with all things Indian - throughout the movie, he repeats this malevolent philosophy.  In a surprisingly gruesome scene, Ethan shoots out the eyes of a dead Commanche off-camera, simply because of the Commanche belief that doing so will prevent them from eternal rest. Yet as if to counter the film's serious tone, screenwriter Frank Nugent adds in scenes of mild comedy, including a subplot involving Martin's fiancé and various other random antics.  These are completely out of place with the tone of the rest of the movie.  It isn't just ""comic relief"" - it's completely outside the main story and works against an otherwise excellent film.  It is typical Western-style dreck in an otherwise atypical Western film.The film announces the true meaning of its name in the end credits, where a song mentions the search for peace of mind.  Ethan was searching for his niece Debby, but found his path in life in the process.  However, he remains true to his character - never does his undergo a magical conversion to more politically ideals, but he finds in himself a sense of compassion and understanding.""The Searchers"" is a film I would recommend as a western; however, I cannot wholly commend it as being a truly great movie.  While it is at times almost brilliant, it seems to be bogged down by the conventions of so many other westerns - the light comedy, the silly characters, the disgruntled woman - it's as if these were added in after the initial draft of the script was rejected because the publisher felt its audience could not accept a serious story.  So I reluctantly must give ""The Searchers"" a mere B-.",The Searchers
270,stardust106,All around good movie,6,31 October 2003,"A door opens, and so it begins.  Right off the bat the director, John Ford, makes a very impressive move by having the first scene open with what else, but a door.  I myself, not being a very big western fan, really enjoyed `The Searchers.'  John Wayne has an amazing talent.  I found myself loving him, yet hating him at the same time.The storyline is very touching, an uncle, being gone at war for many years, finally returns home to his family.  After a very short reunion, a Comanche raid kills the family.  Knowing that the two girls could still be alive, Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and his nephew, Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) set out to find them.  For years they search for the missing girls, when one girl winds up dead, they continue the search for the young Debbie Edwards (Natalie Wood).  But as the quest moves on, Ethan's motives become unclear. With the hatred he feels towards Indians, even his own nephew can't predict what will happen when they do finally catch up to the Comanche tribe and rescue Debbie.Even though, I thought this was a great movie, there were a few errors here and there.  With the plot as great as it was, there were times when it was hard to follow, especially in the beginning.  Also, the continuity of the film was a little skewed.  There were instances where in one scene it would be night, but in the next scene it would be day.Even with all the discrepancies throughout `The Searchers,' good things happen as well.  I really liked the theme song of the movie, it fits really well.  The costumes in the film look aged and tie into the time period. Also, the Edward's home looks very authentic, really dirty and rugged.With good things balancing out bad, `The Searchers' is an all around hit. The credit it has gained about being one of the greatest films of all time holds true.  `The Searchers' provides a delightful two hours of entertainment for viewers that everyone can enjoy.  Where else will you get to see a director make smart moves about things like having the last scene of the movie end with a door closing?  And with that said, a door closes, and so it ends.",The Searchers
271,beckr1,The Greatest of All-Time!!!,10,5 December 2017,"Monument Valley never looked better in VistaVision's filming process. Roger Ebert stated, ""John Ford's ''The Searchers'' contains scenes of magnificence, and one of John Wayne's best performances. There are shots that are astonishingly beautiful."" The only Western in history to be placed in the top 10 Sight & Sound Poll as among the greatest films of all time. AFI ranked The Searchers #12 in their all-time list and in 1989 the United States National Film Registry's first year of selecting films for preservation, chose The Searchers as one of the first 25 films to be deemed ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."" The Searchers has influenced films as diverse as Star Wars, Taxi Driver, Hardcore, Dances with Wolves, Saving Private Ryan, The Wind and the Lion and Apocalypse Now. David Lean studied The Searchers in preparation for Lawrence of Arabia and as a result movie history was made with that famous shot of the across-the-desert entrance of Sheriff Ali. Sergio Leone listed The Searchers as one of his favorite films. Much has been made of the film's racist overtones, but both sides were equally represented and based on historical fact. The basis of Ethan Edward's obsession is clearly stated when Debbie hides next to a tombstone that states the massacre of Ethan's mother at the beginning of the film. Not so obvious is John Ford's hidden subtext about Ethan's affair with his brother's wife and that Lucy or Debbie could possibly be Ethan's children. The thirst for vengeance makes total sense especially with the prospect that Debbie's been ""living with a Buck."" So many great scenes (the wedding scene, the letter reading scene) and lots of comic relief (""That'll be the day!""), keep the viewer's interest throughout. As far as I'm concerned, this is John Wayne's greatest acting triumph. When Ethan has to explain to Brad that Lucy was dead and he says, ""What do you want me to do? Draw you a picture? Spell it out? Don't ever ask me! Long as you live, don't ever ask me more,"" is delivered with such harrowing conviction by Wayne, it gives me goose bumps. Then there is the scene when Ethan sees two white women who were raped by Indians and regressed to their childhood, Ethan says, ""They aren't white. Not anymore."" As Ethan exits we are given one of the greatest close-ups in movie history (seen over and over again in motion picture retrospectives). John Ford was sparse with camera movements and so when he employs camera movements, there is a heightened sense of drama. Ford's camera rapidly tracks in on Wayne's face to that close-up and reveals Ethan's total contempt—a chilling moment. Every shot is framed. I've never seen a movie that did this so effectively and with such beauty. It's like Frederic Remington painted each shot. Keep in mind, this is all before CGI. The cinematography is stunning. Then there is that incredible final shot, perfectly framed again with awesome cinematography and John Wayne's personal tribute to Harry Carey. I am in awe every time I watch this movie.",The Searchers
272,jameskinsman,"If your searching for something great, you will certainly find it here!",9,3 July 2005,"The searchers is arguably John Fords Magnum Opus - and that is quite a claim considering his impressive list of films. It is a film that has everything; fine acting; exemplary photography; great storytelling; magnificent composition; the list goes on.This film is certainly not just for lovers of the western genre - it offers so much more and treats you to the wonders and treasures great film-making has to offer. It is an epic story, a complete watershed in cinema. Often credited as an early study of racism, this is not what lies at the heart of this picture. As well as racism, the films themes include individuality, the American character, and the opposition between civilization and the untamed frontier wilderness.After arriving back at his brothers home too late to save him and his family, the Searchers becomes a story of a desperate, hate-ridden quest. A heroic and epic journey of discovery which explores the psychological chaos of a deeply troubled, crusading man obsessed with revenge and hatred, who searches for his two nieces Lucy and Debbie who have been taken by the Comanche tribe who brutally massacred their family. The search for his relatives is mirrored also by his inner search for peace and his desire for acceptance in society.The films sophisticated and dazzling cinematography is extremely striking visually, and captures the harsh nature of the characters surroundings, accentuating its beauty and its isolating and dangerous nature. This is contrasted against the welcoming and homely nature of family life depicted in the film. This is the place Ethan Edwards longs to belong to. However his true home is the dangerous, brutal and unforgiving environment of which he has become akin to as a soldier in the civil war and one which ultimately alienates him beyond being able to re-enter civilized society. He becomes perfect evidence of what happens to an individual in the midst of a great battle when he gives in to his own hatred.Films shot so beautifully as the searchers are a joy to watch. Describing this film as a 'motion picture' really is quite appropriate, as you really do feel like the landscapes of monument valley, fords favourite locale, transcend the boundaries of the camera and become a beautiful oil painting come to life that grips and consumes the viewer. When you consider the vast range of great individual scenes, it is easy to see why so many of the film industries 'new Hollywood' directors such as Spielberg and Scorcese cite this as such a cinematic milestone and express the huge impact it has had on both their own work (Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver is almost a modern Ethan Edwards roaming the streets of New York in a taxi, instead of on horseback) and on cinema in the twentieth century as a whole.",The Searchers

277,CyndiReynolds4,"Not the action filled western most think of, but heart felt.",7,3 November 2003,"""The Searchers"", it's a name used in more than just one sense, an old western with a racial twist, staring John Wayne, Jeffery Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond and Natalie Wood.  This cast ensemble stars very impressionable performances by its collection of great actors.  Especially John Wayne's performance as a prejudice Ethan Edwards, which he portraits well. Jeffery Hunter and the other cast members complement each other in their acting abilities.  They tie in a more comical sense of relief, which off sets the seriousness John Wayne's character brings to the screen.John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards,who is sent out to look for his niece Debbie, along with her brother Martin played by Jeffery Hunter.  She has been captured by a tribe of Indians called the Comanches and Ethan and Martin are determined to find her no matter it takes. Over a period of five long years Ethan and Martin travel the west, fighting cold winters and hot deserts looking for the tribe.  Along the way things start to get rough.  As they follow every clue they can get Martin finds himself in a mess of troubles, which lands  him with an unexpected wife and has his girlfriend thinking of marrying someone else. As Ethan and Martin continue on their quest, many changes seem to arise, one being the fact that Ethan is prejudice and is out, not necessarily to bring Debbie home alive, now that she is one of them.  This long tedious trip leads them to her in the end, but not with out a good old fashioned, western shoot out. John Wayne plays a good Ethan Edwards, as a prejudice and wise cracking cowboy.  He is the tough one, who always seems to have something up his sleeve and rarely cracks a smile, but will come through in the end.  Wayne seems to be the perfect star for the part.  Although you might expect a more hard core part by Wayne, there's not too many big shoot outs. Jeffery Hunter plays the part of Debbie's brother, Martin.  Hunter's character is a more sad and not so rough around the edges, kind of boy. Which eases the roughness Wayne's character brings. The whole story isn't as action packed as most westerns.  There is one big shoot out, but not until the end of the film.  The story lines are alright, there were some dry parts of the film that maybe could have used action in it.  This is mostly why this reviewer gave ""The Searchers"" a 7 out of 10.",The Searchers
278,eyeluvhotboyz,Just another movie,5,31 October 2003,"The movie, `The Searchers', makes it impossible for the reviewer to have a distinct opinion.  There were some good parts, such as the cast and the language.  There were also some parts that countered this, such as the mickeymousing and the over-exaggeration of some of the acting.
The famous John Wayne plays the part of Ethan Edwards, a man searching for his niece that was kidnapped by Indians.  He spent many years raking the plains searching for an Indian chief named Scar, whom he believed, had his niece, Debbie.  This searching leads to a climactic scene in which Ethan sees Debbie for the first time.  Debbie has changed though, for the worse.The overall acting was pretty good.  Laurie, who is played by Vera Miles, provides both dramatic effect and unintended humor to the movie.  Laurie is in love with a man named Martin Pawly (also Ethan's sidekick throughout the film).  When receiving a letter that contains information she doesn't want to read, she dramatically throws it into to fire, revealing her immaturity to the point of almost being humorous.  The older Debbie works as a perfect counter to this role.  Played by Natalie Wood, she is very wise beyond her years, acting as if she is in her mid-thirties, when she is supposed to be in her mid- to late teens.The language was also very good in this film.  Accurately reflecting the language of that time, the characters did not fumble at all.  One example of this type of language is the words, `Thank you, kindly'. The mickeymousing was okay to a point, but then it slowly got ridiculous. Throughout the entire movie, mickeymousing was added to scenes that did not need it.  There was typical `western' music played in the beginning, and `attacking' music when the men were riding on their horses.  The director even went farther and played `scary' music when the Edwards' house was being attacked.  The only music that I would say I really enjoyed is the oboe part played when Ethan and Martin are trading with the Indians.  Then again, I am partial to oboe.The last thing that was not too good, almost to the point of annoyance, was the image of the Indians.  This movie had a very typical view of them. When the movie first shows the Indian, he is covered in war paint.  Throughout the movie, they are still covered in war paint, even when they are not attacking.Overall, this movie is worth seeing if the viewer is a fan of western movies, or John Wayne for that matter.  Not being a huge fan will result in yet another review like this one.  Nothing too fancy, only the thoughts on a mediocre movie.",The Searchers

From the beginning Wayne's character's identity was kept  sort of elusive, in a way that every one around him was shocked and accided at his return. Through out the movie Ethan is seen as the ""Ruged Individual"". ThoughJohn Wayne's character was not the only good thing about this movie. There was much humor, but not dry or corny. It was more clever humor. One of the best parts was near the beginning of the movie, when a group of men were 'searching' for a group of indians and were about to get charged when one of the crazyer men says; ""O' give thanks unto the lord for what we are about to receave"".Though there were some not so good parts about the movie. For example: the inmaturaty of the Martin character. When he did not agree with some of the decicions of the Ethan character, he goes and hides under his blanket. There he rightly earned the nickname ""Blanket-Head"".This movie is definitly a great one. It has a little of something for everyone. With its action and adventure. it has equal sadness and cheer.

The racial remarks made by Wayne are very surprising. Because he is known as ""the good guy"" but in this role the good and evil inside each person is shown through Wayne. This movie filled with a darkness never known before in one of John Wayne's movies is for a maturer audience, but teaches a good lesson for all to learn. The title ""The Searchers"" is explained through the movies plot. Ethan Edwards(Wayne) neice is taken captive by Indians. He and others search for five years to find her. As he is doing this his hatred for indians grows less as he befriends Martin Pauley, who is 1/8 indian. These two characters search for Debbie and when they find her each are tested by what they find. Eventually Ethan lets go of his hatred entirely as he says,  ""Lets go home, Debbie."" Though he finds Debbie he will always be searching for the younger Debbie, which stands for the innocence inside of everyone. Although this movie is generally dark, there are a few scenes that make thw veiwer laugh. Love struck Laurie lights up the scene as she kisses Martin Pauly unexpectedly. Years later Martin and Ethan stop by on her wedding, Martin and her fiance then proceed to fight for her. She then looks helplessly to Ethan and he says, ""Don't look at me, this is your fault."" Ford added these scenes perfectly, the veiwer is not weighted down by the darkness of the plot. The good and evil in everyone is shown in this film,, particualry through Ethan Edwards. Who is always searching for the good in every person, and then finds it in himself. ""The Searchers"" racism reflected the mind of society when filmed.

It's the perfect length for an epic visual feast. It tells a story in it's own impeccable time. It is a story spread over a period of years after all. The dialogue is brilliant, I love the way (now considered cheesy or clichéd phrases etc) the characters express themselves. The concept of the ruthless, merciless good guy isn't new but in this film I feel it's produced to perfection. I can only imagine that this movie is one of the first of it's kind.In an attempt not to be over analysing things, it seems to me that there is real depth to an old school cowboy and Indian picture. This is regard to the themes of racism and revenge, the war torn vet. Even the more obvious rebellion and admiration adds even more complexity to it. However, by modern standards, the acting is questionable. It's melodramatic to say the least and John Wayne, as iconic as he is, isn't brilliant.

The stinker Rio Lobo being a prime example. But this effort absolutely blew me away. You can see Ford's progression in using his cast, crew and especially Monument Valley which he apparently loved. His clumsy My Darling Valentine only hinted at how he could make that sweeping landscape actually one of the stars. And I'm glad he didn't plant fake saguaros like in Clementine. Ferocious acting in this one. It went on a little long, however the movie as a whole remained absolutely coherent, with every possible aspect of the genre thrown into a superb mix - driven, complex characters, change of seasons, cavalry charge, buffalo hunt, fistfights, romance.

284,na071,The greatest Western ever made - and why,10,11 May 2003,"May contain spoilersThe Western came to embody American values and ideology's, where the ideals of an everyman striving to conquer the frontiers land became an iconographic statement about the values and culture of the country itself. However, The Searchers is more than just this - it is an exercise in rugged filmaking and certainly more that a treatise on any Western patriarchical society.Starring the ultimate Western icon, John Wayne, the film examines the deconstructing of the Western myth through the eyes of a powerful, independent protagonist. Wayne's character, Edwards shuns the family ideal and brings to the fore a sense of desperation to cling to his own crumbling world that is advancing faster than he can cope with.Edwards' is first seen as a small, solitary figure against the impressive Monument Valley backdrop, always in shadow, and immediately we realise he is not the normal Western hero. He is a loner, a man who has lost the respect of his family and has become an outlaw. We learn that he is a Confederate soldier and an emotional cripple who must seek redemption of a kind unfamiliar in most Westerns. That is, he seeks redemption of himself from himself.The role of the Indian is vital to the film's success. The relationship between Edwards and Pawley is more than uncle and nephew and indeed it could be seen that they are father and son, subverting the growing acceptance of tolerance to it's extreme. The rules between the patriarchial figure and the more tolerant Pawley become blurred. Pawley represents a new, bold look on the Western hero as a driving force towards understanding and tolerance. Edwards is a disturbed, driven racist. Another interesting point is that Scar - the villain of the piece - is questionably Edwards other son, confirming the ideas that Edwards must obliterate his past if he is to be socially accepted once more.The violence of The Searchers is incredibly brutal. Homesteaders are slaughtered. Dead Indians have their eyes shot out. However, it is in the unshown violence that Ford allows the viewer to share the horror of what the protagonists have found. For example, when Edwards finds his niece, raped and killed offscreen, he says about the incident: ""Don't ever ask me again."" The feeling is one of utter horror at what fate befell the girl. In one scene, the violence hinted at women is shot in a documentary style thus inferring the horrors played against the female role. Debbie, Edwards' niece, is an independent woman who sees death everywhere. It is in the emotionally shattering climax when Edwards picks her up and says: ""Let's go home, Debbie"" do we realise that Edwards cannot kill her and that he needs her love to survive.That The Searchers is regarded highly is not unjustifiable. It transcends the conventions of the genre to present a startling movie based on loyalty, social acceptance and condemnation of racial hatred. One cannot fail to be moved by what appears to be a typical Western. Further investigation reveals that Ford and Wayne sweep aside convention. It is testament to both men that The Searchers is more than just a Western. It has become a vital part of the heritage of film, and one that says more about the human condition than many a social commentary could ever dream of.10/10 - a  truly cinematic classic.",The Searchers
285,IngmarTheBergman,Simple and offensive,6,11 January 2012,"I didn't like The Searchers. I found it offensive - not only by how racist the characters are - but how the natives are portrayed. The movie is nothing unique. It's a typical western with typical performances. I'm no John Wayne fan but I didn't think his performance was very good in this movie. He always underacts except for one point. However this movie isn't all bad - it has some redeeming qualities. As much as I detested the characters, I wanted them to succeed. The film is about a man (John Wayne) who goes to visit his brother's family when they're attacked by natives and all of everyone except the man, their adopted son (Jeffery Hunter) and a girl survived. Sadly the girl (Natalie Wood) was taken by the natives. It's up to John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter to save the girl - not matter how much searing is involved.

With John Wayne as a strong lead, the rest of the cast falls into place.  Showing a good, but not great, set up for the movie.  New in its time, the film is colored, and often remarked towards, as one of the best movies for cinematography and meaning.The movie literally opens the door to the Hollywood West; with John Wayne and Jeffery Hunter (his not-so-grateful sidekick) monopolizing the screen, you get a sense of hostility that becomes almost casual.  As they tend to lose anyone riding with then on their crusade, you become accustomed to them being at each other's throats, and John Wayne's repetitive sighing of: ""That'll be the day.""Events of the movie play a meager part in the overall feel of the film, but set up a crucial ending to John Wayne's character: Ethan Edwards.  On a journey to find his niece, Ethan gives numerous characters trouble, and continually degrades Native Americans.  All the time saying Martin (Jeffery Hunter, also one-eighth Native American) was of no use as an associate, much less a human being.The main reason this film is worth seeing if the lessons learned by Ethan. One in particular, seeing his character overcome a small part of racism, and therefore almost making a separate genre; close but not entirely ""Western."" Cowboys and Indians die when Ethan lifts up and hugs his niece that had been living with the Native Americans for years.  Even after repetitive claims of despising, and even wanting to kill her.It may not be the most captivating or exciting movie, but ""The Searchers"" is important in the United States view that had previously been fed by racist propaganda.  In 1956, when movies weren't even rated, ""The Searchers"" breaks a light on the population's attitude, and may even have played a part, small but necessary, in the demand of promoting tolerance in movie making.",The Searchers

289,kitkat-1,Ethan's motivation,8,26 May 2001,"Ethan's transformation over the course of his five-year search is not merely a plot device, as many seem to think. His initial hatred of Indians is set up in the first scene, where he pays his brother with newly minted, gold Yankee coins, several years after the end of the Civil War. An Indian Killer, hired by the government to put down uprisings and hostile Indian groups would have made plenty money, if he were sufficiently tough and willing to murder for money.Ethan returns home, reluctant to explain the missing years, but needing to be with his family again. He is a loner, loyal, and tough enough to do things ""civilized"" men could not. He is a man of deep convictions and strong feelings, but it is hard for him to show this vulnerable side. There are glimpses of the man beneath the mask, as when he knows his family is the target of a murder raid, and he cannot reach them in time.His tolerance of the part-Cherokee Martin Pawley grows to be a loyal friendship and bond of affection. Yet Ethan walks away alone. His vow to kill Debbie, who has been contaminated by her time with her Comanche captors, changes to a selfless act. He spares her life as a gesture to her family, and the other people who love her and mourn their own dead.In the end, Ethan must go on. He has not accepted Debbie as ""pure"", but he cannot condemn her without condemning himself. He rejects the ties of civilization and society, needing to be alone, answering to no one, yet he has found a part of his soul again.",The Searchers
290,LibertyValance27-1,"Not only a great Western, but one of the all time greatest films.",10,10 February 2005,"John Ford's The Searchers is a film that deservedly belongs at the top of the list of greatest Westerns and all time greatest films. This film is a masterpiece of American cinema, and is also a very entertaining movie. John Ford has woven a beautiful tapestry that has engraved an image of the West into our cultural psyche. Here Ford is clearly at his creative and professional peak, and is able to call upon all of his storytelling powers in order to creates a romantic, tragic, frantic and moving vision of the 'old west'. A lot of elements that are running themes in other Ford westerns are present here as well, but here they are vividly realized. Ford's use of comedy creates moments of levity, and comfort in otherwise tragic and dangerous situations. Also Ford's great talent for character study and development is on display here, each character is realized with such realism that it creates a sort of familiarity with them. By the end of the film, we know these people, their struggle, their loves, their wants and their desires. But such great characters could not have gone from Ford's mind to the screen without great actors. Wanye of course is sublime as Ethan Edwards. In Edwards, Wayne gives a perfect performance as the torn anti-hero. Ford and Wayne's masterful collaboration on Edward's character elicit the correct response from the viewer. We love Ethan Edwards and we root for him throughout the film, but why? He is a bastard, a racist, calloused, grumpy, angry, bastard. Yet Wayne somehow makes us love this 'bastard' and is able to show through the calloused layers of Ethan Edwards, his humanity, his loyalty, love and honesty that ultimately redeems him in our eyes. Jeffery Hunter is great as Martin Pawley, Vera Miles, and Natalie Wood also give good performances, and then we come to the usual gang of Ford collaborators, Ward Bond, Olive Carey, Harey Carey Jr, and Hank Worden who gives a comical and enlivened performance as Mose Harper. The entire cast gives this film the authenticity and brilliance it might not have otherwise had, had other actors been cast. But that also was due in great part to Ford's direction which has been recalled as perfectionism, and unrelenting, which is why most of his films are, well.... perfect.So many of Ford's trademarks are present in The Searchers, such as Ford's romanticism of the west and he seems to capture, through the camera his longing and desire for that time period. Also Ford's use of Monument Valley, which stands in for Texas in this film. Ford has used Monument Valley as the backdrop to many of his westerns, including ""Stagecoach"", ""Fort Apache"", and ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon"" to name a few.Ford is telling us so many things, without really telling us anything. For example, it is implied throughout the film that Edwards may have lived outside the law prior to coming home. This is implied many times, as when Ethan gives his brother Aaron a sack of 'fresly minted gold coins' the kind you would find in a bank. Also there seems to be some question as to where Ethan spent the three years from the end of the Civil War till he finally comes home. Edwards also balks at taking the oath in order to accompany the rangers,telling Reverend Clayton, ""I't wouldn't be legal"". Clayton quips ""Why? You wanted for a crime?"" Ford also hints to a secret and unspoken love that Ethan and his brother's wife, Martha seem to have, perhaps they were at one time lovers and Ethan leaving caused her to marry his brother. These questions are raised in the Searchers but are not answered. That is what makes great films like the Searchers great, the fact that they are multi-layered, and require many viewings, and after each viewing you are left with a brand new appreciation for the talents of all involved.",The Searchers
291,ryancrazylegsmcgee,It's not bad for a Western movie.,7,31 October 2003,"The SearchersOn a desolate, sun scorched land, there came a break in the mundane.  The children ran to the bleached and beaten front porch and strained their necks and eyes to see in the distance.  Just a speck at first, slowly a figure comes into focus.  He rides on a tired, old steed, with his head down and his hat hiding his face.  He does this probably because he is tired from his journey, but maybe he hides his face because he is ashamed of the things that he has seen before.  The wind whips by him, carrying with it the dust and the dirt from the trail.  And it seems as if even the wind and earth are trying to keep this tired old cowboy from seeing something happy for a change.  From seeing the happy faces of his young nieces and nephews.`Uncle Ethan!  Uncle Ethan!' the children cry and they rush to greet him, and pull him in through the door.  When they pulled him into their house, they brought in with him disaster, because all H-E-double hockey sticks breaks loose soon after.  Ethan Edward's (John Wayne) brother's family was all murdered by Indians, all except for the two little girls.  Ethan is furious and vows to bring back his nieces from the vile Indians who took them, and he won't stop searching until he does.At first inspection, The Searchers seemed like any other generic western movie, but when the plot has time to develop, in it is found something that most westerns don't have, depth.  On the surface, the main plot of the film is good and entertaining, but is the sub plots of the movie that make this film a cut above the rest.  Ethan is so driven to take back his nieces that he searches for her for years and years, but what evolves is whether or not he wants to rescue them, or kill them.  Because Ethan Edward is such a bigot, and so disgusted with Native Americans that just the thought of his kin living with Indians gives him the idea that ending their life is better then having them live it with `savages'.John Wayne played a very believable character.  He was tortured by his family kidnaping and murders, he was extremely racist, and John Wayne made me believe every second of it.  If he were a salesman, I'd buy air from him. And his supporting cast could all act decent too.  They did their jobs of supporting John Wayne and giving the audience some comic relief.  But lets all give it up for the man who made everything come together, the director John Ford.It is not an easy job to get many different people to come together and make a piece of art work.  John also had his mind on other things, like making mother nature help with a piece of art.  The scenes in this movie were all back dropped by beautiful wide angle shots of the majestic cowboy country. There were large and graceful rock formations that were so nice to look at that they deserved their own credit in the movie.Everything in this film worked and blended and made for an entertaining two hours.  There was so much going on in this movie that a person has to like it, even if they have their inhibitions before watching it.  Overall I give The Searchers a grade of B, because westerns don't do much for me, but I have to give credit where credit is due.  A lot of work went into making this film a piece of art and a piece of entertainment and the result was a great film worth watching.",The Searchers
292,Shortee16,Your typical western film,6,31 October 2003,"`The Searchers' is overall a good example of a classic western film. Starting from the movie's cast to its plot. Looking with more detail the cinematography sums up the usual western setting, having the view of Monument Valley, known to be John Ford's favorite vista points. Adding to how' The Searchers' is a great example of a western we've got a classic principal, John Wayne, who portrays Ethan Edwards. Who has come to his brother Aaron Edwards' (Walter Coy) house after serving in the US military. Joining his brother's family, his wife Martha (Dorothy Jordan), his little niece Debbie ( Lana Wood), his nephew Ben ( Robert Lyden ), and older niece Lucy portrayed by Pippa Scott. Also the family has adopted an older son Martin Dowley, played by Jeffrey Hunter. The story unfolds and reaches a climatic point of an attack made against the Edwards family leaving the burned corps of Martha, Ben and Ethan's brother Aaron Edwards. This attack is made by a Comanche tribe, who kidnap both Lucy and Debbie, thus beginning Ethan and Martin's 5 year search for the girls. As the movie follows their search, which begins as that of a rescue search, yet turns out to become Ethan's search for revenge. Surprising not only revenge against the Indians, but against Debbie, who is the only one still alive now, and according to Ethan is now one of them. Just as stated before `The Searchers' is a great example of a western film, because of another reason. Being how much emphasis is made on John Wayne's character, by turning the focus form searching for the girls to his raging emotions and selfish motives. This is typical in a western-John Wayne film. Meanwhile the viewer is taken on a John Wayne-emotional- voyage, the setting of this film also allows its viewer a trip; a trip through the typical western land. Where in occasion both Ethan and Martin encounter an Indian tribe; this is the only scene in which Martin's character can step out of Ethan's shadow and let his comical side show. After their first encounter with Debbie, who is now portrayed as a woman by Natalie Wood, she refuses to leave what is now her home. Towards the end her decision ends up being to escape with Ethan and Martin, yet the expression of emotions done by all characters when this event occurs is a poor one. `The Searchers' is the perfect film for those who call themselves western -film- lovers, and even more for those who are John Wayne fans, for that is what this film is about, it is about John Wayne. If one is looking for a taste of what a western movie should be, `The Searchers' is the one!",The Searchers

296,nycsean,"Awesome classic, that lived up to its promise",10,21 June 2004,"I have been stepping through the ""classics"" of film, pulling lists, renting and observing, usually finding some good ones, but also being disappointed as the films felt dated, or whatever was amazing and innovative has been absorbed and commonplace. Surpsised to see a Western, I rented the Searchers.And man was I surprised, its amazing, and like Kurosawa's Seven Samurai it's in no way dated, and in fact, has more hints of the changes in attitudes in the west than one would believe.First, watching this film, you are going to see what everybody else has been riping off and borrowing for the last 50 years- Star Wars, etc. Second, the cinematography, at a time before special effects, is in itself amazing. The camera work, from the opening shot that leads out the door, to Wayne staing outside the family's house, is stupendous. Characters and scenes are framed in a language that is both beautiful AND tell's the story. I don't think I will ever forget the shot of little Natalie Wood running from John Wayne's Ethan.As for datedness from the views of the west, I feel that the very changes we are aware off are hinted at here. The cavalry and the texans are shown as little more than raiders, not being particularly selective on who gets hit when they raid Indian villages. the majority of absurd, racist statements come from Ethan's mouth, which is a major part of his character.Which leads to the final amazing part of the film- John Wayne's character Ethan. If you thought Wayne couldn't act. or always played the same role, well you better watch this film. Here Wayne's tough guy act is stretched a little, to make him a dangerous character, whose actions are frightening to everyone around him. It's a subtle but amazing performance, that makes me a John Wayne fan.",The Searchers
297,mstytz,The songs and the title tell the story,10,22 November 2006,"Potential spoiler as this discusses the overall themes in the movie.One of the greatest westerns of all time, and certainly one of the best movies to provide us with a look into the soul of a man shattered by a lost love, a lost war, and loneliness. The continued refrain ""Lorena"" tells of the lost love, probably Ethan's brother's wife and how he is haunted by it. The continued Conferedate war tune refrain tells us how he is haunted by the loss of the civil War. And the loneliness, given away by the songs sung at the beginning and end of the movie.There are many searchers, not just the Duke, though he is the main one. He is searching for peace. Martin is searching for Debbie and Laurie's love. Laurie is searching for love too, and hopes it will be from Martin. The Jorgensens are searching for a future. The Indians, for respect and their land and freedom. In the end, its the Duke and the Indians, symbolizing the old west, that are left to search on, not realizing their time has past.A great movie, great cast, great cinematography, great performances. The Duke should have won an Oscar for this one, as should have the movie.",The Searchers

I cannot imagine watching this many more times.While the character development is good and the plot is occasionally interesting, the under-directed, over-acted dialogue delivery almost manages to ruin this movie.The locations are obviously NOT Texas, even West Texas.  It only snows regularly in the Texas Panhandle where the landcape is very flat. (More like Northwestern New Mexico.)  The timelines are not obvious; the viewer has no idea that five years has passed, but has to carefully listen for verbal clues in the dialogue.Some of the dialogue seems contrary to character, getting even corny at times.  And some of the characters act contrary to how we understand them to be, with little explanation.Still this is the best John Wayne western I remember watching.",The Searchers
299,tommagnenorbom,Mamma Mia,1,15 September 2020,"It's not often one gets the chance to quote ABBA when reviewing a Cowboy movie. But Mamma Mia adequately summons up my feelings after having watched this overlong movie, which is the best Western ever made according to several other reviewers. It's no such thing. It's boring, badly written and acted, and it has a John Wayne that is as wooden as any totem pole. In fact, I was looking for termites on the ground every time he scratched his face. That was considerably more fun than watching the ""comic"" interludes between the more serious business of chasing the predatory Comanches all over Texas. I mean the peaceful Navahoes all over Monument Valley. It turns out that the indian chief was a white guy with feathers and warpaint, as is often the case with indians in Westerns from the fifties.
The Searchers is an unsavory mix of ersatz drama and low comedy that never gels and leaves the viewers frustrated as well as dissatisfied. And did I mention that the movie is overlong? John Ford certainly succeeded in giving the impression that the search for the girl stolen by the Comanches took years, because it felt like the movie lasted almost as long.",The Searchers

301,tobys-1,What a good western should be.,10,7 May 2002,"The Searchers ranks as one of the greatest of westerns and one of John Wayne's finest.  It's a great story of a search for a captured family member and has the kind of `grit' I like to see in a western.  Although John Wayne plays a darker character than what his fans are used to, he is still superb and his character (Ethan Edwards) doesn't disappoint us in the end.This movie has some great action scenes, my favorite being the chase followed by the battle at the river.  Western action just doesn't get any better.  Filmed at Monument Valley, the scenery is awesome, especially if seen wide screen.The movie also has some comedy relief in the love and jealousy between Marty, Laurie, and Charlie.   Especially funny I thought was the fight at the wedding.Notable also are the `doorway' scenes that director John Ford used throughout the movie.  If you've seen it before and didn't pay particular attention to them at first, do so next time you see it.In sum, this movie is what a western should be:  good action, great landscape scenery, and a hero with the guts to push on in the face of odds.",The Searchers
302,bailodhia,Mystery solved,10,26 May 2007,"The fascination of this film is that it approaches all of its points obliquely and is really about hidden, complex relationships. Of course, we can readily see that Ethan and Martha once loved each other, probably the true love of each other's life, and for some unexplained reason, Martha married Ethan's brother. Possibly the fact that Ethan is a wanderer and not the marrying kind might explain it. But the most inexplicable relationship in the film is between Ethan and his ""nephew"" Martin. There is a mysterious, confusing aspect to every scene it plays out in. For me, the only possible interpretation of all of the clues presented is that Martin is actually Ethan's own son.When you watch it again from the beginning, keep in your mind the fact that Martin is Ethan's son. Suddenly, everything in the film makes sense - the tossed away comments, the emotions, what is said and strangely unsaid. And, of course, another mystery is why Max Steiner's magnificent score didn't even at least get nominated for an Oscar.",The Searchers

These lists vary to some degree but there are a number of movies - The Godfather, Star Wars etc that we expect to feature somewhere. As a movie fan I recently decided to fill in the blanks by making a point of watching those movies that frequently feature in Top 100s but have passed me. One of which was The Searchers.All I can say is viewer beware. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistically high but this is a hugely sentimental, overly long, poorly acted and poorly written lumbering ox of a movie. This may have been ground breaking in its time but its merits today I must confess were lost on me. John Wayne is usually wooden in my opinion, but in this movie he manages to multi-task by being wooden and unlikable at the same time. Way to go big guy!The entire movie meanders and trudges along without feeling like there will ever be a satisfactory conclusion. And guess what, there isn't. Others may complain about westerns of this type as being anachronistic, racist, sexist relics....but actually The Searchers commits are far worse movie sin.

304,jcjacob-37009,The GREATEST Western Ever Made!!!,10,28 March 2017,"The Searchers (1956), is perhaps the darkest of western films that John Ford has ever made. His intention was to not only make a film that is dynamic in scale, but to create an example about a character who is deeply and personally conflicted with his views on culture. John Wayne named his Son after the character Ethan. The film was a bit of a challenge for the filmmakers, especially when it came to shooting the movie in the land of Utah. Ford was careful with his subject matter, but was still the master when it came down to the films art.I've seen some of John Ford's Films, one of them would have to be, ""The Quiet Man"". Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, John Milius and Steven Spielberg have considered Ford as one of the Greatest Directors of all time. Some (if most) critics were disappointed when the film did no win any awards back in 1957. The film has stood the test as being an achievement, capturing the beauty of Utah and becoming an inspiration among many filmmakers from around the globe. John Wayne was nothing without Ford's advice or direction in the film industry.I was never fond of many westerns, but this film was a huge exception. It should be considered as a study of great Cinematography and Direction. Its' subject is deep, so you've been warned.",The Searchers

It is beyond great!!!!!!!John Wayne does not play himself nor his usual characters here. This oneseems to have several underlying seething currents. He already hates Indiansbefore the story unfolds, but after he finds Lucy, and buries her in hisConfederate coat, his character becomes much darker!Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) feels violated at the deaths of his brother, and the rape and death of his sister in law. He determines to take the captive back from the Commanchees, and kill as many as possible. Hopefully all of them. Hmmm.An eye for an eye???Wayne's character does not want to tell Bard and Martin what really happenedto Lucy as he found her. He is eventually provoked into telling something that disturbs him, and that he is obviously trying to forget.Unlike the first comment on this film I feel The Searchers is very special and beyond great!!!!!! It is John Wayne's BEST performance on film (In My Opinion), and it was Wayne's favorite role. I can see the seething cauldren of warringemotions cross his face and expressions.

308,rejj2369,No one understands this movie,10,13 July 2004,"The Searchers is perhaps John Ford's greatest film. The character studies are rich and complex and never too revealing, adding mystery and depth. The location in Utah's Monument Valley is magnificent. The Technicolor is simply stunning. And of course, the story set a standard for all action movies to come. The plot is simple and engaging and the subplot allows us to take a break from the relentless search. John Wayne's portrayal of Ethan Edwards is memorable. The dark, anti-hero persona gives the movie an edge not seen in those days. Jeffrey Hunter (Martin Pauly) and the rest of the cast give solid performances that are very natural and spirited. All of this is credited to the brilliant directing of John Ford. It is a great movie to watch. It is a great outdoor movie that should be seen on a big screen.People say that this movie is very racist and stereotype Indians. I disagree. I think this movie is about racism, period. Both races are ruthless and barbaric in this movie. Let's take a look:1. The calvary massacres an Indian village. 2. Ethan's hatred of Indians consumes him. But his hatred has a reason. And he is not naturally racist.3. Ethan is a loner, hated and feared by his own people. 4. When Ethan and Marty are hiding out in the canyons, they shoot the Indians in the back as they retreat. Not very noble, is it? 5. Ethan shoots three white men in the back during a shootout. I guess Ethan can do it to his own people as well! 6. When Ethan sees a group of tortured white women who were rescued from the hands of ""savage"" Indians, he fears for the worst. But when Lucy is found, she looks well and cared for. Ethan, upset with this unexpected result, decides to kill Lucy because she has turned 'injun.' 7. Marty accidentally marries an Indian woman. Although ridiculed by Ethan, the Indian woman is portrayed favorably throughout the film.8. Marty and a friend fight for Laurie's love (Marty's fiancée). It is a civilized fight among gentlemen. Ethan and Marty meet with Scar, the Indian chief who abducted Lucy. Scar realizes who they are but does not kill them on the spot. Why? It is a Commanche code of honor not to kill someone when he is at a disadvantage.9. Both races are good and evil in this movie. Ethan and Scar are both driven by revenge. One dies in the end, the other continues to live a life of a loner, dead in the eye of society. There are many reasons why I love The Searchers. It is a very simple story, yet says a lot. It is very entertaining and never boring. Unless you are a meat-head who cannot handle anything except mindless action sequences, this is the movie that stands the test of time, up there with Citizen Kane, Vertigo and The Godfather. Enjoy! Watch it on the big screen if possible. The special edition 2-Disc DVD set from Warner Brothers is an absolute must. If you are a fan, you will not believe your eyes when you see the new transfer. The film has been restored to its original VistaVision widescreen, color by Technicolor! On a final note, the last scene is pure poetry. Truly one of the greatest moment in film's history. John Ford really struck gold with this one.",The Searchers
309,queen_meow_of_ontario,Simply breathtaking.,9,21 April 2014,"A lone home amidst tranquil mesas. A family gathers on their front porch to watch a solitary man ride slowly up to their ranch on his horse in the waning sun. He stops, disembarks and walks up to the house, all in one single weary move. Note his stance, the rugged tiredness of life etched on his face. This lone drifter is Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and is perhaps the most brilliant character devised by Wayne and director John Ford. As the film progresses, we learn of his military days, his contempt of Indians and, most importantly, his psyche. Compared to another John ford movie, ""Stagecoach"", we can see the massive differences in character psychology and within the genre itself. Gone are the days of the brave hero riding in to save the day with wistful smiles all around; instead we have a savage man on an odyssey of revenge, hatred and bloodshed.In one scene, Ethan and a search party comes across a dead Indian buried in the ground. Ethan's suppressed rage overcomes him, and he shoots the corpse's eyes out. ""What good did that do ya?"" asks the Reverend. Ethan coolly replies, ""Ain't got no eyes so he can't enter the spirit land, has to wander forever between the winds"". This is by far my favourite line in the movie, because of the resonance it has at the end, with Ethan walking away into the winds, doomed to forever drift the earth. This movie is a beautiful spectacle of sight and sound. Not only do we marvel at scenes in Ford's beloved Monument Valley, we also find ourselves amazed at the level of detail in set design. Each frame is as if it were from a painter's canvas. Colour coordination was certainly something John Ford and his cinematographers fit perfectly into. There are few vibrant colours in each frame, but those that exist pop out vividly amongst the bleak, sepia-stained walls of the houses, and the valley. John Ford again demonstrates his powerful storytelling technique by using several methods of progressing the narrative. While crosscutting between action is used sparingly, a quasi-flashback stemming from a letter of Luke's kept my attention firmly rooted to my screen. These different methods of narrative progression are important because it keeps the viewer continuously involved with the story. Not once did I feel as if a particular scene droned on and on for too long, instead I felt captivated not only by a gripping storyline, but also because of the brilliant dichotomy between Ethan Edwards and the other characters. The Searchers is a lesson on psychology, sociology and filmmaking all at once. I love it.",The Searchers

One thing I liked about this movie compared to a lot of movies you see now-a-days, i.e. Captain America, X-Men, The Avengers, is that this movie revolves around dialogue instead of predictable action and fancy special effects. It was funny to see a Native American as the protagonist in this movie. Very much a sentiment of, ""the Native Americans are of a different culture, complete with different religion, than us."" Different times those Texicans lived in.The actors were really good-looking in this film much as actors are in films of today.",The Searchers
311,doniphon,One of the most beautiful movies ever made,10,24 September 2004,"I am amazed that some people are amazed to see a ""western"" in a top films list. I am in fact amazed that this film is not higher up in that list. It has always been regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made and I wouldn't think anything major has happened in films in the last decade to justify having 130+ movies being considered better!Which says a lot about how the enjoyment to be had from old films from a golden movie-making era is getting rapidly and perhaps irremediably lost. And this is not even a black and white movie! It is (perhaps) the best film of (perhaps) the best American director ever. Certainly one of the most influential. But I guess it is an easy looser. For those who are into action movies, action meaning something, preferably outrageous or fantastic, rapidly happening in the screen every second of viewing, The Searchers may appear slow and ""a bore"", for others, it is a western, i.e., not worth considering. Paradoxical, for a film that so strongly and definitely shaped the future of both action movies (Spielberg, Lukas) and art-house cinema (Truffaut, Kurosawa)And yet, there is so much beauty, character and entertainment condensed in this film! A grand example of movie making where dialogue lines are left to a minimum and images hold the task of telling the story and everything behind the story. It has stunning scenery and some of the most beautiful camera shots ever filmed. It has a simple yet mesmerising story of epic proportions. It has great characters, raw passions and subtle emotions. It is hard to imagine that anyone who loves cinema would fail to be engaged by The Searchers.The film has some memorable cinematic scenes. Consider Ethan Edwards, his dark big long body leaning against a wooden post supporting the porch of the quintessential west settlement house. The sun is falling on the hard wide landscape around him. From the door behind him come the light and the sounds of music and family chatter. One can almost feel the smell of warm food. There are no words, no dialogue, no explanation. The scene tell us everything we need to know: Ethan as an outsider, a man tied to his roots who will however never be able to fit in society but will forever remain longing around its gateways. A man whose only destination is to wander.",The Searchers
312,RickDJ,One of the greatest Westerns ever made,10,3 December 1998,"John Ford's ""The Searchers"" is one of the high water marks in the Western genre. Direction, cinematography, script and acting all combine to form what is perhaps the best Western ever made. The story of Ethan Edwards' five year quest to find his captured niece and avenge the massacre of his brother's family forms the framework about which Ford paints a portrait of hatred and obsession. Set amidst the striking scenery of Monument Valley, this movie embodies all the essentials of the Western movie.The tale of settlers struggling to maintain a foothold among the hazards of the West is a familiar one, but Ford strips these common themes down to their essence. Ford's direction sparingly tells volumes without hardly a word. Throughout the movie, what is not said is often of more significance than the actual dialog. A gesture and a few glances is all that is used to inform us that Ethan is in love with brother's wife and a few strokes of her hand on his coat tells us that the feeling is mutual, yet both are too honorable to betray Aaron's trustThere is no doubt that this is John Wayne's finest role, for which he deserved an Academy Award far more than for his role in True Grit. He brings to life the hatred in Ethan Edwards, so intense that it borders on insanity. In fact, the actors all do a good job, with Ward Bond's performance being particularly fine.A major flaw in the movie is the portrayal of the Indians which does make us cringe in the light of today's more enlightened attitudes. However, it is to John Ford's credit that he does indicate that it was the murder of Scar's sons by white men that turned Scar to a path of violence and hatred. However, other scenes follow the typical Western Indian stereotypes so closely, it makes one think that Ford was on autopilot in filming the scenes with Indiams.The other disturbing thing in the movie is the pervasive racism displayed towards the Indians. Ethan's racism is so extreme that it is clear that John Ford must have purposely been commenting on it and it's corrupting influence. However, many lesser examples are displayed by the other settlers, and it is not clear if Ford was purposely displaying the racism for us to disapprove of, or if he was even aware that he was putting it on the screen. One also wonders if the audiences of 1956 even noticed this racism.Despite these flaws, this is still one of the best combinations of drama, humor, and action found in the Hollywood Western, with a fine sentimental ending that leaves the viewer with a tear in the eye. The final shot is unforgettable, one of the greatest closing shots ever.",The Searchers
313,mpag,A life changing experience. Pretty much defines what the cinema is all about.,10,15 February 2001,"A film I saw as a child and still my favourite film of all time 25 odd years later. The lean purity of the theme and the narrative allow for great depth of feeling and interpretation to emerge from any number of viewings. Wayne was never better. His understated performance is exceptionally powerful, the torments and repressed feelings of his character beautifully expressed, a striking contrast to Jeffrey Hunter's occaisional moments of scenery chewing. A big influence on a whole generation of contemporary directors, most clearly (thematically) on Scorcese's ""Taxi Driver"". Probably more than any other American film it  most completely fulfills the cinema's potential as a great story telling medium. Needless to say, it benefits hugely from being available now in widescreen and restored colour, but you owe it to yourself to see it at least once on the big screen.",The Searchers
314,RtRevJeff,The Duke's favorite John Wayne movie,10,3 May 2002,"The Searchers is totally unlike any other John Wayne movie. A great character study of a down-and-dirty unrepentant Reb in absolutely remorseless pursuit of the Comanches who murdered his brother's family and kidnapped his niece. Wayne is one ruthless sunofagun in this pic. Jeffrey Hunter is a bit over the top as his sidekick, but the rest of the cast is solid (almost all appear in other John Ford movies). Largely set in scenic Monument Valley, which was one of John Ford's favorite locations, but also couldn't be more improbable for ranchers or farmers.",The Searchers

316,narnia4,"An influential, poignant, complex, and beautiful masterpiece",10,25 April 2011,"I'm a staunch, almost rabid, defender of this film. Sometimes I feel as if even those who ""get"" this movie don't get it. It goes without saying that the cinematography is breathtaking and the technical points are masterful, few who know film would dispute that. It's recognized as one of the greatest westerns of all time by many and gets its deserved recognition on most critical lists. Even with all of its accolades, however, I feel as if it isn't enough.There's so much depth to this film and beauty to its story, its one of those films that gives you new ideas each and every time you watch it. The plot goes far beyond the heads of the pc crowd who see it as ""racist"" or ""old-fashioned"", although I suspect that some can't get over the fact that this film is truthful. The film embraces neither extreme position, that the settlers of the Old West were honorable heroes or that the Indians were always simply innocent victims by evil white men. Rather, its a portrait of humanity as a whole and still applies today. As an example, think of the relationship and parallel between the ""villain"" Scar and Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards. Both are racists, but both are extremely knowledgeable of the language and customs of the other race. Both were subject to deaths in their family from the other side that led to their attitude, both took wives from the other race. That's just one small tidbit that adds to the complexity of the characters and the dynamic between the white man and Indian, there is much, much more.The characters are multi-layered, and yet the impressive thing about it is that they never talk about it. I suspect that this is part of the reason it goes over the heads of some who believe it to be overrated, because almost all of the character background is explored visually by Ford. Even characters that are dismissed as ""corny comic relief"", are not as they seem. One example of this is Mose Harper, a character that I, for one, still haven't quite figured out.A final note on the acting, the performances by a few may be the weakest spot in the film, and that's with all the performances being very good AND this being the best performance of Wayne's career.This is a film that everyone should see, talk about, analyze, and enjoy. It really is worth it, a true masterpiece.",The Searchers

Apparently being 1/8 American Indian is enough to make him a half breed out cast.The legend of John Ford is much stronger than his actual work - he was more interested in making a big money picture than he was a great film and it's apparent from seeing the work.Don't be another cardboard cut out and say ""Oh this is genius"" - just because someone tells you to.

319,lee188,Best western ever made.,10,16 February 2005,"In my opinion this is the best western ever made. John Ford broke the mold when he made this movie. Just the cinematography in this movie will take your breath away. The movie was shot in Monument Valley and in color. Ford made the actors wear bright colors against Monument Valley's back drop. And to me this brought out a much deeper and brighter color to the movie. Look at some of the bright color shirts Wayne and Hunter wore in the movie. Not to mention the Indian dress Look (Beulah Archuletta) wore. This film should have easily won cinematography, but was passed over.The story itself is as dark as the Valley's night sky. Wayne plays Ethan Edwards a confederate Civil War hero who comes back home four years after the war. Ethan is in love with his brothers wife after fathering a child with her played by Natalie Wood. Of course the movie has Natalie playing his niece. John Ford would only stick his neck out so far with the 1956 censers. But Ford left the door open and it's plan to see Debbie played by Natalie Wood and her real life sister Lana Wood was his daughter. This is why Ethan was so hell bent on killing her as soon as he found her. He hated Indians and couldn't stand the thought of his only daughter becoming one. Jeff Hunter plays the half Indian nephew Martin Pawley who travels with Ethan on their five year journey. After a short while Martin figurers out Ethan's plans to kill Debbie when they find her.This movie has so many great takes. When John Wayne rides up on the hill overlooking his brother burning ranch. He takes his rifle and slings it's cover off in one motion. The scene where Wayne is walking out the door at the army camp and looks back at one of the white captive girls. The hatred in that stare is enough to chill you to the bones.It's taken many years for a western with as much quality and meaning such as Lonesome Dove or Unforgiven to hit the big screen. If you have never seen this movie it is an absolute must see.",The Searchers
320,ponda_baba1,how it REALLY was,10,19 October 2005,"Movies can do only 2 good things, educate or glorify 'reality.' Seldom do we find movies like this that do BOTH. The triumphant soul of Ethan is heroic, NOT anti-heroic; the salvation of 'Debby' makes this epic NOT tragic. Delineate. This film does not follow the rules of tragedy, in Hamlet, the main character dies, Ophelia (his girlfriend) dies, his father dies.The people who think this film is 'racist' are in fact 'racists.' This film tackles a social TRUTH, that racial identity is GOOD. Violence only comes from NOT understanding someone else's culture, but you yourself MUST FIRST have a culture to understand. It tackles the upsetting fact that women nowadays of all races are more in danger of violence than ever before precisely because of 'integration.' A societal establishment and law can only be upheld by a 'race'. 'Pride' is not racism. Pride upholds beauty and the ability to think and judge, it creates rich culture and pacifist understanding. Pride gives you the ability to understand a Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai', a Fellini's 'La Strada' or a Bollywood's 'Sholay.' Pride finds beauty in difference while affirming it's own, and doesn't invade other countries.Many people in Oregon do not understand this film. One viewer correctly noted John Ford lacks flair in portraying female characters. The gorgeous Vera Miles is presented flatly, with little depth or verve; a far cry from Audrie Hepburn in 'Sabrina,' or Kathryn Grayson in 'Ziegfield Follies.' gsmith wrote that John Wayne wasn't the calibre of actor as Gary Cooper and Gregory Peck, which is to say Rembrant wasn't the calibre of painter as Mozart. Gary Cooper and Gregory Peck were DRAMA actors, Wayne was a WESTERN actor; which is why Coop won Oscars for 'Sargeant York' (which is a drama not a war film) and 'High Noon' (which is also a drama not a western) and starred in less than half as many western's as Wayne who won his Oscar for 'True Grit' and Peck won his for 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' (drama) This is the closest to a 'cultural' American film as i have ever seen. To hate this film is to hate all that is good and 'American.' This is the self-same myth of King Arthur or any knight who saves the damsel from the dragon. This is grandeur.",The Searchers

322,groovygavin2,The Greatest film of all time,10,3 May 2007,"Well written, acted, directed, and shot. It had a story, a moral, action, romance and humor; nothing was left out here. John Ford proves here he was the best director of his time and maybe of all time. He uses symbolism to make some telling points without wasting dialogue on it(Look at the shot of Ethan's sister-in-law getting him his Johnny Reb coat and the final scene with Ethan on the porch). John Wayne,in his best role, shows why he was much more than just a movie star. His subdued brand of acting is best on display in the scenes where he is staring at the deranged white girls at the Army fort or earlier when he comes up on his brother's burning ranch house. He also is the most dominant on screen presence of any time. He looms above the scene, darkly creating a constant feeling of danger and amusement with the unsettled feelings in others that he creates; a sort of vicious glee. Both Ford and Wayne show the prefect compliment to each other as any actor/director combination, better than Capra/Stewart, Deniro/Scorese, Spielberg/Ford, Howard/Hanks. Both mastered the say-less-show/do-more style. This is illustrated in many scenes but most of all when Wayne's Ethan Edwards finds his humanity. Here we see Wayne, frantically chasing Natalie Wood's Debbie, her terror/his aggressive sense of purpose, then her surrender; and his (to his humanity)with one line; ""Let's go home Debbie"".Here less is more, and it is never less of being more than everything else.

It is not a simplistic portrayal as with such inferior movies as 'Dances with wolves' etc in this movie we are forced to see the good and bad that each side is responsible for although ultimately it is the Indians in the movie that have been most persecuted.There is so much more within this movie but you just have to watch it for yourself it really is the greatest of all movies and I'm a person who has seen most.",The Searchers

The best John Ford's movie is THE LONG GRAY LINE, and after that only the movies that Ford's made with Jeffrey is excellent, all the rest is not very good. John Wayne do not exist close from Jeffrey Hunter, Jeffrey is many more beautiful, sexy, handsome, perfect, talented, etc. John Wayne never change, and here is all the same boring, ugly and awful man, and the silly open the door from Jeffery stolen the movie.

When Jeffrey talk all the people surrender, he's so charismatic, so everything, Ford's made a wonderful job when he put Jeffrey in this movie. Because if this movie do not have Jeffrey, this movie became one more silly movie in John Wayne's carrier. All Jeffrey carrier is perfect, he made very excellent jobs in the cinema, and in The Searchers he's the soul in this movie. Without Jeffrey The Searchers do not exist. His eyes, his smile, his face, his voice, his talent, his beauty,  his body, his color, his chest, his interpretation, his looks, his noise, Jeffrey Hunter is perfect.

325,ron101346,Over-rated unless you are an inveterate Duke fan,6,30 November 2013,"The Searchers is in the cannon of great westerns and rated (not by me) as the best John Wayne film, but I must lodge a minority opinion and state that it is over-rated. I admit that I am using current, not contemporary standards, but lasting quality is the mark of a great film, yes? First, what is indisputable is the magnificent cinematography and setting of the film: Monument Valley will never be as well photographed as it was in Technicolor and VistaVision (A superior wide screen process that preserved high definition even in the wide format).Like most wide screen movies, however, the drama tends to be diluted by the scenery. Even Director John Ford seems overwhelmed by the panorama, so that there are precious few moments of dramatic tension; instead, he resorts to too many gratuitous chases and gunfights to fill the frame (and waste the viewer's time).Another criticism (albeit coming from a world view 50 years after the film was made) is that the theme that ""Indians are bad, settlers are good"" is stilted and contrary to the truth. In fact, the obsessive killing of Indians and taking of their land accelerated with the end of the Civil War (the time of this picture) so that their aggression is entirely justified from the Indians' point of view.And, while we're at it, it is almost comical (and disrespectful of the Indians) to use a mishmash of contract players and just a handful of real Indians (none of whom were in the main roles). I got an especial laugh out of Chief Scar who was obviously a white man with dark makeup--and with a 1950's pompadour hairdo no less! When one wants to show the real heroism of the Western frontier, it is better to show how law and order conquered the white man (such as in ""Shane"" and ""High Noon""), not how the white man decimated the Indians.Ron Levine Philly",The Searchers
326,paulb_30,The Quintessential John Wayne,10,13 June 2007,"In so many ways, this film reveals the personification of the mythical Wayne that has contributed to his enduring popularity even nearly three decades after his death. The man on a quest who knows the territory, the challenges, and the enemy. The rugged individualist who doesn't need anyone to help him in achieving his objective. The cynic whose faith is only in himself and his abilities. The man of sensitivities who does his best to conceal them under a hard exterior. The memorable refrain, ""That will be the day,"" oft repeated to show his disdain for the ability of others to match his skills and commitment. He's not prone to talk much, but when he does, it's something worth listening to. Beyond Wayne's powerful characterization, the film is beautifully photographed and directed, creating a real sense of the grittiness and precariousness of life on the frontier. In my opinion it is probably the best of the westerns that John Wayne ever made.",The Searchers
327,trampoline,Ford set the standard,10,14 June 2009,"John Ford's The Searchers is perhaps American cinema's greatest western. Sergio Leone made truly spectacular westerns, full of epic scenes and magnificent characters, but Ford captures the utter brutality of the Indian conflicts and the shear expanse of the American west on film like no other. John Wayne, in arguably his greatest role, masters the multi-layered Ethan Edwards, a role left shamelessly off of the AFI's best heroes/villains list. Edwards returns to the far west after the Civil War to visit his brothers family. Tired and begrudged, he wishes to find a place in the newly settled land full of warring Indians and empty of lawmen. Wayne's character takes many forms throughout this cinematic journey. He is mentor, racist, protector, teacher, and warrior. He contrasts splendidly with the film's true virtuous form, woman. For it is the female that is held in the highest regard in this picture. She fittingly represents life. Ford frames her in the home where she cooks, teaches, clothes and longs for a civil order that includes marriage and children. The American Indian strives for this same cultural order, but he treats women as property. It is this duplicity, the treatment of women by the different cultures, that the male characters find difficult to reconcile. While Skar, the Indian war chief who Ethan Edwards pursues throughout the film, brutally kills white settlers and kidnaps young white females, it is Ethan who wishes to steal his niece back and kill her, thus denying her any true worth. Jeff Hunter and Ward Bond are also splendid in this film. Each represents a different type of frontier man. Hunter's Marty is a orphan of the open range, he rides bareback and sleeps under the stars like a coyote. Yet, he cannot escape his human virtues, instilled by Martha, his adoptive mother. Bond is perfect as the calvary officer and minister rolled into one. His reconciles his peaceful duties with his law-keeping ones in order to preserve some civil order, such as marriage, in the American western frontier. Once again, each character longs to protect the female form and her role in society. This remains the classic conflict in the film: white man's struggle to civilize the frontier and the ""savages"" struggle to keep it free and untamed.The Searchers survives as the greatest western for the depth that Ford captures in its scenery and within its plot. John Ford is an American cinematic master. This film gets a lot of play on television. Don't miss it.",The Searchers

I have yet to see a movie in which the characters are so fully and richly defined, and the times so faithfully reproduced. I agree with those who say that the Monument Valley in Utah doesn't resemble anything in Texas, but that is the only criticism of this film I can abide. Those who say John Wayne couldn't act or play anyone but himself had to eat those words after this film was released. Wayne sears the screen as the grizzled, bitter Ethan Edwards, who is determined to kill his niece, Debbie, the long-time captive of a Commache tribe.

333,skt171,"the best western ever, something new each time it's watched",10,1 November 2005,"I first saw this with my Dad in 1956, he was a great western fan. When I came out of the theater I was stunned. I knew there was something mystical there. Over the years saw it again and again on TV, mostly black & white, almost forgot it was in color. Finally released on video I practically required my four kids to watch it. Kicking and screaming they did. They got into it in about ten minutes and the rest was beautiful to behold. The movie holds up, Its just as fresh today as it was then. I've seen all of Wayne and Ford's movies and this is without a doubt the best they made and perhaps ever made of the genre. At about the 20th viewing I started wondering who was Debbie's dad. You really have to watch it that many times, and replay his sister-in-laws reactions around Ethan to ask that question. ""Lorena"" as the theme music was masterful. It's haunting. Ethan's dealings with the Indians usually characterized as racist are a lot deeper than that. The Indians they trade with, Marty's ""accidental"" wife and Ethan's treatment of her betray no hint of racism. Ethan takes no pleasure in the massacre done by the cavalry.Scar represents pure evil to Ethan. Like an avenging angel, Ethan must destroy him. Throughout their quest, Ethan shows an appreciation of Indian culture and custom. He understands and does not condemn their ways but Scar and his band are a different matter entirely. It goes even beyond revenge. The question asked by the director is, What happens to the soul of a man when he assumes the role of an agent of God? Others have asked that question in other films, but not like it was done here. The redemption sequence, his acceptance of Debbie and his return to civilization were masterful. Those of us who have tried to write fiction , especially myself would have been lost at this point and had no clue how to wrap up the end without blowing it. This is where Ford and Wayne earned their spurs. There was nothing trite nor saccharine about that ending. Even Ethan, framed by that doorway,turning his back on it and walking away sent the message that there are those who are separated from the rest of us, who are different, who accept the impossible challenge and can never be part of the life we lead. This should have been Wayne's Academy Award, not ""True Grit"".",The Searchers
334,m-s-lyst,"Stunningly beautiful, but....",7,18 March 2011,"This movie is beautiful. And it's John Wayne's most interesting character. But....I am sure everyone who's seen The Searchers have noticed this but, first of all, the Indian chief has blue eyes. Indian chiefs do not have blue eyes, least of all just after the civil war, which is when the story takes place. This is just one of The Searchers' annoyingly disarming errors. The Indians, set up as fearsome, ferocious, ruthless killers by John Wayne's Ethan Edwards throughout the movie, suffers, and conversely the story, by these sad mistakes.Second of all, and the first of the errors disarming the Indian menace, when this particular tribe of Indians chase you down and corner you in the desert, they apparently don't attack or even shoot an arrow toward you. They only do that when you're too far away for them to hit you. No, instead they ride from side to side in far ahead front of you. So even though you're forced off your horse and they have you cornered in a cave, all you have to do is wait them out. Bear in mind, this is The Duke they're chasing, John Wayne. You would think they'd be capable of more than putting on a horse show to get him so rattled.Third, actually the second most distracting error after the blue eyed Indian chief, is the magical shift of landscape in the course of one shot. Ethan and Martin are hunting buffalo. They have the herd in front of them on a snowy plain. Ethan runs, out of frame, enraged, firing at the buffalo in a frenzy. In the next shot, seemingly a short jog to the right from their initial position, on a wide, open plain, there are suddenly lots of trees and big rocks around Ethan and Martin. This is the kind of mistake you can't help but laugh at when watching a really bad B-movie. It's the kind of stuff you see in 80's ninja flicks. The Searchers consistently place in the top 10, even top 5, in best movie ever-polls. If the Indian chief had not had blue eyes, I would second the notion. But that's one distraction too much. Unfortunately, because it's otherwise one of the most haunting, amazing movies yours truly have seen. It's a breathtakingly, sweepingly beautiful movie. It's a poetic, epic beauty that has brought me back for repeated viewing. And I think it's an unabashed, brave portrayal of a hateful, disillusioned racist by John Wayne.On a side note, The Searchers also includes the single funniest spit take in cinema history.

337,rav_vale,Myths & Dreams play by different rules,10,18 July 2001,"I think I can understand, after reading many comments about THE SEARCHERS, why some people don't like it or think it is overrated: certain films, do not obey the rules of ""classic"" storytelling.  This film is one of them.  It unfolds and moves like a dream.  It is more like a myth than a piece of ""literal"" storytelling.   Ford made other movies like this, (notably THE QUIET MAN, my personal favorite).But I think THE SEARCHERS is Ford's most dream-like, myth-like piece in his oeuvre. Many of the things that people have nit-picked are correct: the turn arounds that make no sense, the strange sense of pacing, the ""wrong-ness"" of Monument Valley standing in for Texas.  And there are others. But for me, why I love this film and why it does grow on me each time I see it, it plays like a dream, like something out of the dream world.    Those accurate criticisms don't bother me, because for me, the synergistic quality of THE SEARCHERS make the whole much greater than the sum of its parts.  It adds up to some thing that tugs on chords in me that are not from the left side of my brain.This film is from the world of dream and myth and it plays different than a film like Fort Apache or other great ""linear"" Westerns.  It is a masterpiece both because and in spite of its flaws.   And if the dream doesn't resonate with that mythic part of a certain person, it is understandable why they would not like it.

339,camaraderiee,Not for this Time,2,6 April 2019,"This may have been a great Western in its time (and for 1956, the cinematography is beautiful!) but it's reached the point of too old to be watchable. The racism is extreme (again, as it stereotypical for Westerns of the era) and the sexism (including but not limited to unprovoked female hysteria and typical subservient behavior) makes it very hard to understand or appreciate in this time.
This is not a film to watch for entertainment unless you seriously enjoy olden Westerns. As a 90's kid, I was extremely uncomfortable watching it and had no idea how to make heads or tails of what to root for. The ""hero"" is toxicly masculine and angry, prone to fits of violent outrage, and the bloodthirsty savage stereotypes of Native Americans leaves the film...icky",The Searchers
340,reidel-1,One of the most overrated films of all time,3,23 March 2007,"I finally got around to watching this film again. I thought I had to as some of my friends and indeed the ratings and comments on this website suggested that it is an all time classic and a fantastic character study of a man obsessed with hatred. John Wayne never really interested me, I thought him simply a bad and one dimensional actor. But so often such actors have a surprise up their sleeve. I shouldn't have worried though. He is as ordinary as usual. John Ford has never heard of ""continuity"" as the boys seem to ride around the same two rocks for five years with some studio shots of them talking in the rain with some twigs around them edited in for good measure. I also find the script and the acting woeful. It was however a good idea and it could have worked in the hands of Fred Zinnemann or Eliah Kazan, to name just two directors who made really edgy and relevant films in the United states during the 50s. John Ford is one of the most overrated directors of all time and John Wayne simply was a bad and one dimensional actor.",The Searchers

As was the custom, there's predictable, lame ''comic relief', the musical score is loud, intrusive and bad and the overt racism had to have been cringeworthy even in the 1950's.

I named my son after Wayne's character in this movie (Ethan).Superior in location, acting, casting, and plot. It was enjoyable to see a movie that didn't make a complete villian out of someone who fought for the Confederacy. I especially loved the sexual tension between Wayne's character and his onscreen sister-in-law. I only wish they still made movies like this.

The hero isn't just the hero and everything isn't just black and white. The movie deals with un-westernlike topics such as racism.With all the above we have a great foundation and when it comes to the story it's just plain epic.

347,gsmith404,John Ford's best - One of the best Westerns ever,9,10 January 2004,"This is definitely not the best Western ever made.  It lacks the drama of High Noon and grandeur of The Big Country.  Further, John Wayne was never the caliber of actor that Gary Cooper and Gregory Peck were.  It might not be better, overall, than Shane.  I am not even sure that this is the best of John Wayne's films.  In my opinion The Shootist was better in many respects.The Searchers is certainly much better than True Grit, for which Wayne received his only Oscar, but it may not even rank among the top five westerns.  It is unquestionably the best of the John Ford westerns, and one of the top ten westerns of all time.  The cast was probably the best of any of Ford's films, and this is the only one I can recall with the sort of sub plots here.I have seen this film at least five times, and enjoyed it as much this evening as the first time I saw it.  This is also probably the only film in which John Wayne's character grew during the film.  It might be the only western to inspire a Rock and Roll classic.  After seeing The Searchers, Buddy Holly wrote That'll be the Day, which soared to a number one hit. On the subject of music, I am certain that the theme song was sung by the Sons of the Pioneers, but they do not appear in the credits, and the only member of that group to be credited is Ken Curtis, who plays Charlie McCorry.",The Searchers

Since that time, it just sat on my shelf collecting dust. This is even though I am a huge John Wayne fan with more than 100 of his films in my collection. I go in spurts about watching those films, sometimes not watching them for months, and then getting the urge and watching several of his films over a weekend. This is what happened this past week, as I began watching post True Grit films such as Big Jake, Chisum, and Cahill: US Marshall. It was after those films, that I thought maybe it was time to watch an older film, and I found The Searchers, still wrapped in cellophane.From the very first minute of the film I knew I had been insane to have never watched this movie sooner. It is truly a remarkable piece of art, and now I believe it is the greatest role that John Wayne ever performed.The cinematography is breathtaking and I'm sure at the time of it's release, when it was filmed in VistaVision, it must have been unbelievable. The intensity of the performance that John Wayne gives as Ethan is so shockingly incredible that at times you forget that it is the Duke on the screen. His character Ethan being so full of hatred and rage that you see it in every crease on his face, in his eyes, and in his voice.I see no reason to give the plot away other than to say it is a five- year journey of searching for Debbie (Natalie Wood) who was taken by the Commanche in a raid on his brother's ranch that left everyone else tortured, raped, and murdered.Rooster Cogburn has always been my favorite Wayne role. I have probably seen True Grit between 75-100 times. And for pure entertainment value, that is indeed a great role. The Searchers was completely overlooked by the Academy and that is a shame. Wayne's performance in this film was truly his finest and the collaboration with Director John Ford, their best.",The Searchers

This is fantastic composition. A hugely emotive soundtrack with religious overtones, reworked...And there's more. In the first reel, the characters arrive, always coming in from a distance, with others watching. A beautiful series of entries.In the end, they leave in a miraculously terse and absolutely epic piece of cinematography.

Story-wise, however, it falls flat and is slow-paced. Character development is inconsistent and even contradictory. As for the racial issue, I believe it is in line with the mentality of both Hollywood and the public at that time. Racial stereotyping still exists in today's Hollywood movies -- Martin Scorsese's Gangs of NY and The Departed, for example.

Often scandalously underrated as an actor, John Wayne is superb here as Ethan Edwards, a man torn between civilisation and savagery. That he is a racist is not in doubt, and he is an outsider among the whites. But you still get the feeling that he is the person the whites will turn to if Indians threaten. Ethan Edwards is a former Confederate soldier, with a shady past. He arrives at his brother's house with money gained somehow (he won't say) and there are hints that he is wanted by the law. He joins a posse of Texas Rangers in pursuit of Comanches, but here again we get the feeling that he is going to do things his own way, and to hell with anyone else.

The evolution of the primary and secondary characters was particularly enjoyed. Many of the actors were regulars in other John Wayne westerns which lended to the familiarity. The location shots and cinematography were also superb, although I know Monument Valley is in Utah and not Texas as the script would lead the viewers to believe.I would have liked to see more insight into Ethan's relationship with his brother Aaron and also Aaron's wife.  There appears to be more there then what the movie was willing to explore. However it was 1956 and elicit affairs between two brothers and one woman may not have been as vogue as they would be today, but that's what the book is for.  The movie itself is a well rounded blend of tragedy, comedy, drama, and action without expense of the plot.The Searchers is classic John Wayne western including the famous walk at the closing scene.

356,JJHLH1,A favorite film of great directors.,10,6 March 2011,"""The Searchers"" is reportedly Martin Scorsese's favorite film and he watches it once or twice a year. As one of the bonus features on the Blu Ray edition they interview him and he talks about why this film is so great. Every time I watch this film I appreciate it more, and am beginning to see why it is regarded as a masterpiece by most critics and directors including Scorsese, Spielberg, and Lucas. The film should be regarded as a masterclass in cinematography. The title of the film also seems to have a dual meaning. Does it refer to the obvious search for Debbie, or for the search that takes place in Ethan's soul? So many little things occur that are subtle, like the relationship that is hinted at between Ethan and his brother's wife through visual clues only, which ends up helping to drive the story. ""The Searchers"" is a great film in every way, and its stature will continue to grow with time. Like much great art it wasn't recognized at the time, failing to receive even one Academy Award nomination.",The Searchers
357,arothschild,Wearisome monotony,1,25 April 2006,"Well, the title doesn't lie; there certainly is a great deal of searching in this movie. Specifically, characters we don't like search for a character we barely know who is in the hands of a villain we don't mind. This is all in the name of a cause we reject. Nevertheless, they search and search.They go here and there and here again, based on the loose idea that ""Scar might be there."" Knowing that Westerns are frequently re-workings of non-cowboy pieces, one might be tempted to considered that he is watching a re-thinking of Pirandello's ""Six Characters in Search of an Author."" But to call the insubstantial stand-ins of ""The Searchers"" ""characters"" would be going a little far for me.I'm in the minority here. I've heard how this is an ""astonishing character study."" I agree that it's an astonishing study in something, but ""character""? Really?Consider: about 37 hours into the searching, John Wayne decides to shoot his niece, because after years of living with an Indian tribe, she's ""become a Comanche!"" and doesn't want to leave their village. Happily, half an hour later, she inexplicably changes her mind and he inexplicably changes his, and they ride off into the sunset together. That's not depth, it's just contradiction.Or here's one: at the beginning of the movie, John Wayne shows up at his brother's house. Much is made of the fact that no one knows where the guy's been for the last three years. At the end of the movie, we learn that--oh wait, no, no one ever brings that up again. Oops! That's not mystery, it's just omission.As for the ""author,"" part, well, whoever he is, he's a bit too stultifyingly dull for my tastes. Perhaps some feel that repeating the same line of dialogue a lot (""that'll be the day"") is a great character detail. Frankly, I think it's pretty juvenile stuff.Perhaps some feel that the Whimsical Characters in this movie are delightful; generally, I find that ""whimsy"" is where un-funny characters go to die.The author *did* write in a lot of searching, however. And some shooting now and again, just to keep things fresh. I guess there's some ""action"" from time to time, but nothing I'd call an ""action sequence."" See, an action sequence involves tension and release, surprise and fulfillment. A and B Shooting at Each Other Until the Less Famous Actor Dies has none of that. It's less interesting than watching John Wayne sit on a porch whittling, because at least in the latter case, he'd be getting somewhere.As for the rest? Well, some find the photography evocative, although everyone seems to admit that it's evoking the wrong thing (Utah, which doesn't look a darn thing like Texas). I find that unbelievable for a number of reasons: a) the most noticeable quality of the southwestern desert is its openness, and there's hardly a shot in ""The Searchers"" wide enough to evoke any real feeling of expanse; b) the nauseatingly saturated color is more evocative of Munchkinland than rocks or earth or sky; c) the too-mechanical blocking/shot composition gives a feeling of tight control rather than anarchy and/or danger; and d) a number of scenes use weirdly fake-looking sets. They're not particularly stylized (as in, for example, ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath"")--they're just silly-looking, public- access-channel-esquire sets.Even the music (by the otherwise great Max Steiner) doesn't seem to help much. For instance, everyone in the movie knows one hymn, which they sing cheerfully at a funeral and somberly at a wedding. At least, I think they're supposed to be singing it. If you look closely, you'll see that their lips aren't moving, but maybe in a town this boring, everyone has had time to study ventriloquism.I guess I don't understand what anyone likes about this endless exercise in tedium peppered with forgettable characters, thudding dialogue, and leaden acting. My guess is there's something I just don't get which speaks to many, even most. Don't pass up the movie on my account, but if you hate it, don't feel like you're the only one.",The Searchers
358,parableofthebeast,The depth of character developed by John Wayne was superb,7,19 November 2000,"I recently saw ""Searchers"" and John Wayne's performance was superb. As Ethan Edwards he gave us a deeply (perhaps desperately) lonely man who cannot realize relief from his plight via his love for his brother's wife, though their mutual love and attraction is always present, and always beyond the knowledge of the remainder of the caste.The movie's story line and it's treatment and resolution are excellent. The story is basically Hollywood formula, but manages to avoid racial stereotyping and moral judgment, allowing the audience to have its own experience. That was then and is now a rare and outstanding quality.Though the story succeeds and though John Wayne is remarkable, it remains a 1950's western. Over acting and the resultant bludgeoning of the audience obliterates most serious treatment of emotional difficulties and opportunities for the remaining characters to develop the depth the story offers.As filmed this is a fairly routine and dull story. The Duke's performance makes it well worth watching. He stands as an inscrutable, pragmatic hero caught in the vicissitudes of his time and place. We never know much about him. What we get is an exceptional performance in which his complexity, his personal beliefs, his expeditious and pragmatic action in dealing with difficult and traditionally moral events and social mores, his alienation (and perhaps fatalism), and his inability to establish any close relationships are never explained or spoon fed to the audience. We get a good look at this fundamentally unknowable and inscrutable man but we can make no conclusions about him outside the story presented. John Wayne's performance is a gift.",The Searchers
359,dbfulp,A triumph of film making for John Ford and John Wayne,10,18 August 2006,"The best director/actor combination in the history of cinema team up to create The Searchers, a masterful film in every way. This marvelous piece of film making was released in 1956 and one must only wonder how John Ford and John Wayne pulled it off. Racism, inter-racial marriage, murder and kidnapping are only parts of the plot and the many sub plots. John Wayne returns from the civil war and finds his brothers family murdered by hostile Indian's and two of the girls kidnapped. He pursues only to find the oldest girl a victim of rape and murder while the younger girl becomes one of the chiefs wives, the very chief who murdered her family. John Wayne becomes a bigot to the extreme as five years pass during the search. Jeff Hunter is his partner in the search but he wants her back alive where Wayne wants to kill her by his own hand for 'livin' with a buck' which is not being alive according to 'Ethan'. Ward Bond, Hank Worden, Vera Miles and John Qualen are just a few of the character actors who supply this grim tale with the humor to keep us sane during the unfolding of this tense story. The Character of 'Ethan Edwards' as portrayed by John Wayne is considered by many to be his greatest roll. I consider it to be Wayne's second best performance behind only the great 'Red River'. Many of today's directors have been influenced by 'The Searchers' and there is little reason to doubt their judgment after one views this motion picture. People should view the picture several times to see things they perhaps have missed at other screenings. This film is an absolute 'MUST' for all people who value excellence in film making. John Ford and John Wayne are unmatchable with this movie.",The Searchers
360,ticdoulouroux,Nuanced & Morally Ambiguous,10,10 October 2003,"Director John Ford turns a traditional `cowboys & Indians' Western into a nuanced and morally ambiguous story in this 1956 John Wayne vehicle. Wayne's Ethan Edwards is by turns taciturn, snarling, and raging - not much of a stretch, even for the predictably wooden actor.  But during the movie we see Wayne progress from hate-driven brute to stoic.  Not exactly a sensitive New Age guy, he nevertheless transforms from anti-hero to genuine hero by the end of the film.  In this way the movie is much more like a modern psychodrama than a plain ole shoot 'em up.  The inner tension emerges during a confrontation over the object of the search of the movie's title, missing niece Debbie (Natalie Wood hot off her turn in `Rebel Without A Cause').  Without explicitly telling us, Ford shows us that Wayne has become convinced that death is a better fate for Debbie than life as a Comanche squaw.  Hostage rescue segues into mercy killing?Speaking of racism, the film is larded with thoughtless denigrations and knee jerk cant of the only-good-Indian-is-a-dead-Indian variety but this is hardly historically inaccurate.  The `only good Indian' quote is after all a Teddy Roosevelt paraphrase.  And the Indian villain, Scar, is completely irredeemable.  But Ford portrays some natives with sympathy and a lot of the white men as bush-whackers, thieves, and knaves. It belies a certain 21st century politically correct deconstructionism to point out that acceptable movie dialog in the 50's doesn't work in the new millennium so I'll just remind viewers to keep the movie in proper historical context - both its 19th century and 1956.Costar Jeffrey Hunter is over the top throughout as whining, though stalwart fellow searcher, Martin.  He serves as part comic foil, part punching bag to Wayne.  Vera Miles is wasted in a romantic subplot for Hunter - her character barely develops beyond the cliché `girl he left behind.'  The John Wayne Players - Ward Bond, John Qualen, Harry Carey, Jr. and Hank Worden - make an appearance in supporting though caricatured performances but the uncredited costar is the spectacular Monument Valley, Utah.  Though set in west Texas, the unmistakable MV scenery is both stark and beautiful - more so than any place in real-life Texas.Overall it's a stunningly beautiful movie with a surprising performance from Wayne.",The Searchers

It is, and always was, full of clichés and racism. Today we are much more sensitive to these injustices than when I first watched it in the 1980s.

It deals with numerous themes and struggles-- from striving to bring back order into one's life and homeland, the search for identity, and what ideals we hold important to ourselves. John Wayne's struggle as Ethan to find Debbie mirrors the struggles of every American of the time-- the search for hope, glory, purity, honesty.  Appropriately, it even throws in racism into the mix in the fued between Ethan and Martin, again mirroring the battles between the races at the time the movie was filmed, and that same fued exists today, making this picture even better for capturing a battle that still effects America today.

The typical expression of feelings is throwing objects to the ground or shaking head nervously. It would be acceptable in the first silent films, but in 1956 it is pathetic.The story is so-so, but the ending predictable right from the beginning. Also some motivations of the characters are unclear to me (especially Ethan's and Debbie's).Indians are portrayed as primitive and childish half-monkeys. This is irritating even if we look at this film in the context of the whole western genre.The above faults cannot be justified by the film's age. There many older movies (also westerns) that have much better constructed plot and characters, better acting and direction. Slightly redeeming quality is good cinematography. Overall 3/10",The Searchers
365,conductor71-2,The mysterious ambiguous Ford,10,29 May 2008,"Initially dismissed by the critics of the time, 'The Searchers' gradually gained the reputation of one of the greatest Westerns in history over the decades, particularly due to the generation of filmmakers who saw it as teenagers when it was released, intrigued by the exceptional ambiguity of John Wayne as Ethan Edwards with the darker emotions unusual for a ""western hero."" True, Wayne's Ethan Edwards make us doubt quite occasionally whether rescuing his niece was really his motive. Even his companion Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) doubts his intention constantly, then shocked by Ethan trying to murder his own niece Debbie (Natalie Wood) that they finally have found.The critics today tend to interpret it as a critique on racism, as embodied in Ethan's violent hostility . The question of race is certainly an important theme; Ford for instance made Matrin partially of Native American descent, to integrate the question at the core of his film (in the source novel by Alan Le May, which certainly can be criticized as naively racist, there are no mentions of Martin being a hybrid). But the film's concerns on race are in no way simple accusations. It addresses the question of identity, and of where one belongs to. Martin is integrated to the white family in which he was raised, with only Ethan refusing to admit him as a family member. In turn, Ethan who is part of that family by blood, doesn't really belong there being absent for more than 7 years. He alienates himself from the community by pointing out that he already took the oath to the Southern Confederacy, refusing to take an oath for the United States to which the community now belongs to. While Debbie is a member of the family by blood and of the community by her ethnicity, Martin's sweetheart Laurie (Vera Miles) tells Martin, who is partially Cherokee, that Debbie doesn't belong to them anymore and that even her dead mother would have wanted her killed. The identity of the people, where they think they belong to and where the others considers them to belong is constantly and poignantly blurred during the development of the story.Ethan's genuine motive for continuing the search is indeed made clear already at the beginning of the film, though the film refuses to sentimentalize his grief which would have permitted us to identify ourselves with Ethan (as a hero avenging the death of the woman he loved). Not only that, the scene in which he finds her body suggests that Martha was stripped naked and raped, possibly scalped--traumatizing him with anger, also making him overwhelmed by his guilt-complex, is very underplayed, the atrocities only suggested with the darkness in the destroyed home..Ethan, though shockingly hostile, is not an ignorant racist as the other members of his community are; he is knowledgeable of the cultures and beliefs of the Indian tribes while he is dismissive to the Christian faith. Throughout the progression of his search, he gradually resembles more and more to the Comanches. The tribe he pursue is the ""Naiyaki"" Comanche, meaning the ""wandering ones."" He too is the wandering one, and the wilderness becomes his home, as it always has been for his nemesis Scar and his tribe.These whole complexities take place in the spectacular wilderness of the Monument Valley. The battle sequence exposes the white Americans as out of place, while the Comanches (portrayed by the local Navajos) are totally integrated in the magnificent vistas. The community Ethan originally belonged to is what we call the civilization, confronting a magnificent but alienating wilderness of the west, the Comanche being part of it, literally being native to the magnificence of the West. Olive Carey says ""one day it will be a fine land to live. Maybe it needs our bones to be buried in it."" Her family being the ""Jorgensen"" is significant--the immigrants from Europe came to America for a new home. It is the conflict of the wilderness and the conquering modern civilization, which Ford doesn't necessary show in a positive light--while the community of the white immigrants is seen as a warm humane one, nevertheless they are also shown quite often ridiculed, with over the top slapstick humors of the fights and conflicts that are pretty meaningless. The corruptive nature of the modern civilization is seen more harsher on the Native American side; the trading scene between Ethan, Martin and a Comanche tribe chief, in which Martin accidentally ""buys"" one of the women of his tribe. While Scar's tribe maintain their violent but yet noble integrity, that tribe is already corrupted by the capitalist system of our modern civilization, and seen as ridiculous.It is within this crash of two cultures that Ford shows the hostility-obsessed Ethan Edwards, dooming himself in loneliness, wandering in the wilderness, alienating himself from the community, and his nemesis/alter ego Scar. But Ford doesn't allow him to kill Scar. It is Martin who kills him in course of saving Debbie, more or less as a self-defense. One of the titanic figures of the wilderness is exterminated like that, with the other figure left without the chance of fulfilling his revenge, the mission he imposed upon himself. At the end Ethan, instead of that mission he saw as his, accomplishes a mission that he never thought of his, while Martin expected him to do--to save Debbie.'The Searchers,' though filmed and composed in the Ford signature of simplicity, is nevertheless hugely complex and mysterious. It never tells simple messages, instead it makes us ponder on the question of who Ethan is, where does he really belong to, who does he become in this journey in search of himself. At the end he leaves to the wilderness--the wilderness native to the American landscape, soon to be conquered by civilization. Ethan embodies what created America, but he doesn't have any place to stay there, can only wander in the wilderness.",The Searchers
366,EthanEdwards1,Influential masterpiece,10,31 May 2010,"I was too young to see this in a cinema -much to my regret-but have seen it countless times on TV, VHS and DVD. If I could only have 1 movie to watch for all eternity this would be it.Wayne has simply never been better - and this under-rated guy is very good indeed in the cavalry trilogy and The Shootist - but in The Searchers he is magnificent - almost Shakespearean.Wayne plays a bitter, disenfranchised loner who returns to his brother's family homestead. With great tenderness and sensitivity it quickly becomes apparent that he and his sister in law share a deep and abiding love for each other.When a Comanche raid destroys the homestead and parents, Wayne and an ""adopted"" mixed race Jeffrey Hunter become the eponymous ""Searchers"" - spending years trying to find Wayne's nieces who have been taken by the Comanche.The search involves some of the best landscape photography in cinema history - David Lean agrees and that's good enough for me- some exciting adventures and the inevitable - but forgivable - Fordian low comedy - and THAT was good enough for Shakespeare too.Two of Wayne's most compelling scenes are when he tells Marty and Brad about the rape and murder of the older niece and then when he is confronted by a group of women and girls who have been liberated from the Comanche - he conveys a bewildered mix of horror, revulsion and pity in a wordless and beautifully shot scene.The wonderful finale and renowned final shot usually just prompt me to start the movie again ! Some of the most respected movie makers in history - Lean, Scorsese, Spielberg, Eastwood etc, rate this movie as the best or among the best - and the most influential upon most of them - movies NOT just westerns ever made. They are right",The Searchers
367,chrispo1972,A masterpiece in bad acting!!!!!!!!,1,1 January 2011,"I've just watched this film and what can I say, it has got to be one of the worst examples of film making I've ever seen. John Waynes character is a one dimensional permanently in a bad mood anti-hero, that is so obnoxious you cannot empathise with him at all. Even so i just couldn't believe that he would spend 5 years searching for his niece to then only want to immediately shoot her the moment he discovers she's turn Commanch during her captivity. No matter how much of a racist Indian hater he was supposed to be this just didn't make sense, logically or emotionally, what did he really expect. The two actors who played Moses and Charlie were so awful I cringed every time they were on screen. The dialogue is comical but not in a good way. The film just shows up John Waynes lack of acting skills when he's taken out of his comfort zone, as another reviewer suggested Robert Mitchum or James Stewart would have done a much better job as the anti hero and still bring some sort of emotional qualities to the character. Very over rated.",The Searchers

But I'm disappointed. Any movie whose best actor is John Wayne has immediately got a problem. The women were terrible, Wayne's part-Indian sidekick was terrible, the kids were terrible. Ward Bond was good as the blustery reverend, but that's about it. I'm not saying Wayne was bad, just that he isn't here and never was an actor. A presence, yes. Otherwise, the scenery and Technicolor were real purdy. I'm not sorry I finally got to see The Searchers (the DVD is a good restoration), but it would be nowhere near my top 250 films. Time hasn't been all that kind to it.",The Searchers
372,beckaleck,John Wayne's Best Performance,10,31 July 2010,"This movie came out when I was 10 years old and I saw it for the first time when I was about 12. Since then, I have probably watched it 200 times. After watching it at that early age, I had nightmares about Indians coming to kill my family. I have also read the book many times and in the book John Wayne's character was Amos and not Ethan. I consider this movie to be the best performance of John Wayne's career. Having read all the reviews and the theories that others have written, I just wanted to get my two cents worth in. To the reviewer who believes that Martin Pauley was Ethan's son and that he was married to an Indian, I want to point out that toward the end when they were going into the village, he told Marty about the long wavy scalp that was on the lance and that it was his Mother's. The wavy one was red (strawberry blonde) and I don't think Indian hair is curly, so that blows the theory that she was an Indian. As to the theory that Debbie was Ethan's child, I can only say that this never entered my mind during all the times I saw this movie. Perhaps she was and that may have answered the question why Ethan stayed away so long after the war. This movie had perhaps the best sub-plot I have ever seen, where without one word ever being said, everyone knows that Ethan loved Martha and vice-versa. When Ethan first arrives at the ranch, his brother asks him why he stayed away so long and he looks at Martha and she at him and you knew they loved each other. Personally, I believe his search for Debbie all those years was for Martha's sake, and also to seek revenge on the ones who killed Martha. And, although he wasn't fond of Indians prior to that since he probably had been fighting them for years, once they killed Martha he went over the edge. If you will remember, when he gets to the burning ranch of his brother, he doesn't seem concerned about finding anybody but Martha and is frantically looking for her, and finally finds her in the smoke house or whatever the out-building was. I think after finding out that Debbie had been living with the Indians, he felt that he wanted to kill her, but I don't believe that he ever really intended to. His search for revenge is the only thing that kept him going, and when he finally found Debbie, his final mission was accomplished,and he could finally let the hate go. I believe that since he never came into the house, that he left and probably continued to roam the country like a lost soul until he died. I read somewhere that in the end when he is standing on the porch and he puts his one hand on his other arm, that it is a tribute to his old friend Harry Carey Sr, who was married to the lady who played Ms. Jurgenson in the movie. He had died prior to the movie coming out.Until I saw Lonesome Dove, this was by far my very favorite western, but I have to say that I now cannot decide which one is best. I have loved The Searchers for 50 years and Lonesome Dove for only 16 years. If I live to be in my 80's, I will revisit the question of which is best. Since Lonesome Dove was a 6 hour mini-series and this was a 90 minutes movie, it is hard to compare them. I just know that I fell in love with John Wayne in this movie when I was 12 years old and consider his character what a man should be - even as hard as he was. But, also I will never forget Gus and Woodrow in Lonesome Dove. That was an entirely different relationship and what made it so memorable is the difference in the two men, but the special bond they had in spite of it. Those type of friendships are rare indeed and their differences is what kept them together all those years. For those who haven't seen it yet - it is a must.",The Searchers

He didn't get it, but he should have. Wayne was probably the most under rated actor in film history. Also, Ward Bond was deserving of an award as Best Supporting Actor. This is one of the few movies that I have viewed that kept my interest from start to finish. Well written and well acted. Not a flawed performance in the whole movie. They just don't make them like this anymore. This is one of those films that should not be remade, because a remake would not do it justice. As a western drama, it rates right up there with Shane, The Gunfighter, High Noon, and Stagecoach. This movie is a must see for all true fans of western dramas.",The Searchers
375,andrewdaniel-43118,Meh,6,15 July 2018,"To be fair, I had high expectations for this movie so maybe I oversold it to myself. I heard such great things, but ultimately The Searchers disappointed me. The idea was great, the setting was good, but the execution was subpar. The acting wasn't that great, and there were a few moments where some of the characters' decisions didn't make sense. The ending where you think John Wayne is going to kill her, and then he says let's go home is cheesy. Not that I have a problem with John's character making that decision, but I just thought it was cheesy in the way it was done. There are many moments in the movie where the acting could have been better and the dialogue written more realistic, I'm not just calling out that one line of the movie. There were good moments in the film though, with my favorite being the sequence where the letter is being read and John and the other guy are trying to find Debbie. Overall, the movie has a great and interesting storyline, but poor execution.",The Searchers
376,elleglw,What is the main theme of The Searchers and how is represented within the films?,8,31 August 2006,"The Searchers is another classic film that will go down in history for its controversial topics and its technical mastery, although upon its release it was disregarded by critics as ""Just another Ford Western""(Eckstein).Some of the film's topics are the miscegenation of sexes , a love that goes beyond the norms of society ( Ethan and Martha), but most of all are its bold attempts to depict the racism of some of the Americans. The characters that portray such anger and detestation towards the Native Americans or Comanche are Rev Samuel Johnson Clayton(Ward Bond), Ethan Edwards(John Wayne) and Laurie Jorgensen(Vera Miles). Taking into account Rev. Clayton , he seems to be confused whether or not to do the right thing and bring peace to the community which is one of his most important roles since he is after all a Reverand , one that brings people closer to God. On the other hand he is also a Captain, one that brings order to the civilians , and those who do not follow him shall be punished , even by death. So we as viewers and critics of our actions , cant bare to imagine how can a person be both captain and Reverend , when those roles oppose each other?In addition Laurie Jorgensen has adopted some of Ethan's rude and maleficent nature. Even though she is head over heals for half English -half Comanche Martin Pawley(Jeffrey Hunter),and stands up for him through many occasions , she seems to not show equal measure to Martin's ""sister"" Debbie , who has been abducted by the Comanches at a very young age , after her family had been massacred. Furthermore we expect from her to represent the generic ideal , the woman that brings civilization to the frontier and reunites both cultures, but instead she represents the ideally sexual woman that condemns women from having relations with mix raced men.Lastly Ethan Edwards is completely the opposite of what we might call a hero in any film, especially a western as the main character is meant to bridge the gap between the civilizations . Instead he is an antihero , full of obsessive bigotry and a dark , mysterious attitude. Ford doesn't waste any time in showing what a disrespectful person he is , and that is shown in the first few minutes of the film when we are first introduced to Martin Pawley. Even throughout the journey he is teased and humiliated in front of other Americans.John Ford's mission throughout the film is not to cause an upset to the public but to show what a scoundrel some of the characters are and most of all to depict how people behave towards each other when they are trying to preserve their civilizations .",The Searchers
377,dbbry314,Top 3 Western,10,11 November 2005,"The Searchers has to be one of the best westerns ever. Wayne's performance is probably the best of his career. The story line, the characters and the actors who play them are outstanding. How can one not like this film. The suspense which is played out between the two main characters and the girl that they search for. What will become of her, or in fact them. How will Ethan react when he finds her, does he want to kill her and basically save the family name? What of the family that waits behind. All this plus Wayne's silent homage to his childhood hero Harry Carey make for a stirring and exiting movie. That is why, I cannot recommend this film enough, not just as a western, but as a great American film.",The Searchers

Of the thousands of titles I own or have researched, this one ranks among the very worst and clearly does not deserve the status it has gotten. To be fair, I tried to assess this film from all angles. Shame on me for purchasing it. The fact that this movie gets the high praise and recognition (ranked no.12 on AFI's 100 Greatest American Films 2007 list) is appalling. This falls right in line with America itself...low standards or no standards. It appears the Liberal and (or) grievance industry's influence may be the culprit here.

In The Searchers, the cast includes several stars who showed up often in his films, such as Ken Curtis, Vera Miles, Hank Worden, John Qualen, Harry Carey, Jr.  I'm not sure whether this was due to Wayne's loyalty to these stars or just that a certain chemistry seemed to derive from these actors in combination.  The Searchers is one of those classics which defies a simple explanation of why it was so good, but I think it's partially due to the feeling I get when I see it that ""that's the way it must have been.""

I'm not talking about dark humor; I usually appreciate that in a good film, such as Happiness (1998) or American Beauty (1999).

First of all, I have seen quite a few movies in my time, and the complexity of this film makes this one of the top 5 movies of all time. Steven Spielberg said (in an early 90's interview) that this movie was possibly the greatest of all times, due to the depth of the character studies. The interplay between Ethan & Martha (his brother's wife)is subtle, yet screams of an undying, yet unfulfilled love that has endured for several years. You have to see the scene where Ward Bond is left in the house eating doughnuts, and witnesses the final, tender goodbye, while looking straight ahead, coming to the realization of what it all means, and how hard it is for the two of them to keep it from everyone else.It is true that the film was filmed in Utah with the story taking place in Texas, but that quickly becomes a moot point.  There is not space to extol all the virtues of this movie The relationship of Ethan & Martin, Martin & Lori, and the raw emotion experienced by all members of the cast are worth the rental price. No cast member came back from making this movie the same way they were when they left. Watch the film, it gets inside you.

The casting, story line, individual performances, music, scenery, action, all most compelling. Our, my wife and I, enjoyment of the film grows with each viewing. A little trivia: I understand, from reading the book, John Wayne American, that Mr. Wayne was given no direction from John Ford as to what to do in the closing scene after he was left alone on the front porch of the house after returning with Natalie Wood, and everyone had filed inside. The camera was placed in the living room of the house aimed out through the doorway. The family had entered through the front door leaving Wayne standing alone on the porch, the search over, and he is framed by the doorway with the Monument Park in the background. The cast waited inside, along with Director John Ford, all watching from behind the camera, waiting to see what Wayne would come up with. Wayne simply stood there for a second looking in the direction of the camera, then slowly took hold of his right arm just below the elbow with his left hand, turned around, let go of his right arm and walked off in the direction of his horse.

Having discovered the book among my grandfather's books after having seen the movie, I also have to say it is one of the best adaptations of a book into a movie ever. Ford even recreates the dust cover scene in the movie! John Wayne gives one of the finest screen performances in motion picture history as Ethan Edwards, a racist with a murderous temper, who will stop at nothing to kill the Indians who killed his brother, nephew, his sister in law (who Ethan is secretly in love with)and kidnap his two nieces. With his adopted nephew, Martin Pauly, Ethan embarks on a five year quest to avenge his family. At first, his goal is to rescue his nieces, but early in the search Ethan discovers his oldest niece murdered by the Comanches (the scene where Wayne's character tells Harey Carey Jr. that the girl is dead is awesome in it's power). As the search continues, and as the younger niece grows into a teenager you come to the realization that Ethan is going to kill his niece if he ever gets the chance because ""shes been living with a buck"".

However, what lets it down for me is a fairly predictable script, and pretty dull acting. John Wayne is not bad- and he fits the character pretty effectively- but I just can't bring myself to view it as 'the greatest film ever made', as it very frequently gets called. It is a good film- 8/10 is hardly terrible- but I don't place it with Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey and the like. I'd still recommend watching it, but for me Sergio Leone's Westerns are the ultimate expression of the Western ethos; frankly I find the ending of this film a bit disingenuous.

390,Harm101,Excellent western movie about the dark side of the old west and one man's determination to find his niece who was carried off by the Indians.,10,10 December 2007,"This is a complex story of the hard life in the area of early west Texas. The Comanche Indian was a hard case and tough opponent for those settling and moving into the west. The west Texas rancher was or became just as hard as the Indian he was fighting. The two groups fought over land that folks in the east would not have owned on a bet. The Indians raided ranches, burned the houses, killed the adults, killed the infant children and ""captured"" the older children. The ranchers raided the Indian villages and killed every one, taking only the horses. Into this setting comes Ethan, back from the War Between the States, carrying new gold coins inferred to have come from a recent robbery. Shortly after arriving at his brother's ranch, Ethan is asked to help go after a band of raiding Indians that raided the neighbor's ranch. While gone, the initial raid was a ruse, the Indians attack Ethan's brother's ranch, kill the brother, the male child, rape and kill the brother's wife and then kidnap the two female children. Ethan starts a search for the captive children, his nieces, that takes him and the ""taken in"" ranch hand many miles and many years.

Edwards' willingness to disown his niece is understandable considering that white captives of the Comanche commonly saw their families horribly gang-raped, mercilessly tortured and murdered, yet within as little as 6 captive months often forgot English and became themselves equally cruel and violent toward their own people.To explain Ethan's hatred one must understand the Comanches did not raid solely out of vengeance at whites; as part of their culture they tortured, enslaved, raped other tribal members, Mexicans, anyone they could without compunction for pleasure and as proof of self-worth.

399,arcamedes8,one of my all time fav's,10,7 April 2007,"I must disagree with the last couple of posters about this movie. I think the movie is actually more than just the stereotypical ""cowboy's and Indian"" fare. Sure a lot of the native Americans were played by white actors, and chief scar hardly looked native American but these I think are minor quibbles. Many of the characters in the film were actually portrayed as out and out racists. The movie had a much more complex hero than most John Wayne cowboys: why? probably because Wayne's character was a racist, as were several characters in the film. Martin Paully ( Wayne's sidekick in the film ) is his polar opposite, he's there every time to play the counter part to ethan's racism. Perhaps that was ford's way of injecting his own views into the film, through the more sympathetic martin or at least providing a counter balance to the racism of Wayne's character. If you don't generally like westerns, or movies with native Americans portrayed as savages, don't shy away from this because there's so much cinematic beauty in this film, and a good John Wayne performance as a tainted hero. The film contains some great shots, and is one of the first pictures to feature that dark, loner hero which would be copied many times else where. The scenery is great, the canyon chase scene and the ending shot are extremely well shot. And for those western fans, it's also an exciting action packed film, and stars Ward bond ( who's always amusing! )",The Searchers
400,gregg1954,A Great Comedy,4,27 January 2007,"On a lazy Saturday afternoon, my wife and I watched this movie. Big screen TV, surround sound dolby, etc. We were prepared for what was reported as one of the great ""Westerns"" of the 50's. The plot began well enough....abduction, massacre, no punches pulled characters. But little did we know this would evolve into one of the more absurdist comedies and satires from the film school of ""Unintended Comedy Films"". Vera Miles had us howling. Her shameless screeching and whining was enough to not only bowl Marty (Jeff Hunter) over a bench, but we fell off our couches too. John Wayne or Ethan (big shoulders according the Chief Cicatrix or ""scar"") was...well....spouting some of the dumbest racist comments one could hear in a ""cowboy and injun'"" movie. This went way beyond stereotypes and well into shameless stupid acting, overwrought performances, and, well, a sense that this movie was just going to be way past embarrassing all the way to funny and back to awful again. Sorry, but we had to laugh when white women and girls acting schizophrenic or paranoid where said not to be ""white"" anymore. Not a crazy Indian in the movie though. Just a crazy script. If you want to laugh - and laugh pretty hard - then watch this and keep in mind THIS WAS NOT MEANT TO BE A COMEDY. I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, if you are looking for a serious movie of the non-linear variety watch Little Miss Sunshine and don't bother ""Searching"" for greatness in this mess.",The Searchers

402,gandst,Great Movie,10,17 June 2003,"The Searchers is the greatest western of all time and one of the best performances by John Wayne (Sands of Iwo Jimo/The Quiet Man being among them also). There is no way for anybody to know what director John Ford wanted to portray or intended for this movie. Here is my food for thought. There is a special connection btw Ethan (Wayne) and the sister in law Martha. All the scenes in which they interact, there are special looks that they give each other, to show that there is much more that could have went on in the past.  I think this the whole basis of why Ethan is a disgruntled, bitter man because he had a since of duty to leave his family and his love (even if she was already married maybe that's why he left), to fight the war and have his brother stay and it shows again when Ethan tells his brother Aaron to stay when him and the rangers first leave after the Indians. I think it was duty not racism that had him fight for the south and to go after the Indians. When Ethan and the rangers realize that it is a raiding party they all take off except for Ethan, knowing that the horses need rest again this deepens his bitterness because he knows that there will be nothing to go back to. He is set on vengefulness because he has a duty to try and right what went wrong in much the same way you find out later of why Scar raids the homes because whites killed his sons. Is it racism? In this case I don't think so, simply righting a wrong in their mind. John Ford did a masterful job of concealing the horrors of the people slain in much the same way Hitchcock did it in his movie Psycho (a classic) you don't see them die but you know they are dead and its left up to your imagination of how they got that way. That's what makes a classic----imagination.  The range of John Wayne is outstanding he can go from the best scene in the movie, `Don't ever ask me again' to `Come on blanket head' to `lets go home Debbie' and everything in btw.  This movie has action, scenery, love, hate good, bad and humor (not comedy) and a ending that is only suitable for a man that cant settle down and has to `wonder the winds'.  A well deserving 10",The Searchers
403,alhaqiqa,John Wayne knows better than anyone else,1,18 November 2007,"I simply had to write my first review for this movie, because I hated it! And because it is supposedly a classic! The only thing interesting about it was the scenery, but even that was bizarre, since it was supposed to be in Texas, and was clearly Monument Valley, NM. The acting was awful and leaden, the humor was childish, the characters were not developed, and the plot was simplistic. The quality was no better than the old 1960's TV westerns. What did John Wayne's son have to do with the plot, anyway? And on top of that, I had to watch John Wayne for two hours. That's what I get for choosing a ""classic"".

What made it all the more interesting to me was finding out a little more on Texas history and on the main story that this film comes from. As they say, fact is stranger than fiction. The scenery is beautiful although not of Texas, but I'll forgive Mr. Ford that  little bit of Hollywood make-over. The mood of the film carries the viewer over the dry regions, the sharp peeks, the bitter cold and on to the desolate. Wayne's character is a puzzlement and never really explained, which is what makes him so good. Its great to have a film that doesn't ""spell it out "" for me.

406,gpope,Wayne is the Weakness,1,7 February 2005,"I'm not a fan of Westerns but felt obliged to watch this because of its revered status. The set - the Monument NP in Arizona/Utah - is astonishing and the ultimate setting for a western. It's also difficult to fault the direction. The story is a brave one to tackle with its undertones of racism (presumably not such a big issue in the time the story is set) and you're left guessing until the end whether the uncompromising stance taken by Ethan throughout the film carries through. Ultimately though, for me, the weakness of the film is Wayne himself. The character he portrays is a very complex one, his outlook affected by past experiences with the Indians and in the Civil War. Alas, the role proves beyond him. He just seems unable to be able to show any humanity behind the bitterness and comes across as just a nasty piece of macho, reactionary work. Clint Eastwood regularly played the hard man but there was never any doubt that he was decent underneath it all. No such subtlety from Big John. When, at last, the story requires him show some compassion - you just can't believe him.",The Searchers

As this film stars John Wayne, who in his personal life never gave the impression of being like his character in the Searchers that of being a racist, the movie must surely be accepted as what it is, great entertainment and to be just that.",The Searchers

It is hard to get through the whole thing. And the passage of time was clearly not well thought out, there is no indication between the passing of a few days or many months/years. To me, it seems like an inadequate job of planning and execution for this movie. A lot of people seem to like how ""mysterious"" and ""complex"" John Wayne's character is. It's really not a big deal, I'm not sure what everyone gets so worked up about. OK, he's a brooding character with secret love and passions, but nothing that is truly groundbreaking, attention grabbing, or original. Also, there is a whole subplot with his partner, Martin, and another girl that doesn't really have anything to do with the main story. Overall, this movie lacked focus, direction, and pacing, and I would not recommend it to anyone.",The Searchers

Working together for the 12th time, John Wayne and John Ford forged a beautiful, and ultimately disturbing and moving journey into the mind of a troubled man, on a quest to find his kidnapped niece.Filled with underlying references to the cruelty of racism, and the barbarianism of 'civilized' American culture, The Searchers marked John Wayne's best ever acting performance, and a time in movies where the defining line between heroes and villains became very blurred.This is pure, classic film making at its finest, and a movie that many directors working today owe a lot of credit too.

John Ford always does such a great job developing the characters in his movies, and The Searchers has to be right up there with the best of them.  The scenery is gorgeous, and Ford adds some humorous scenes to counter a story-line that has some rather heavy themes.  And the music is just right for this movie too.John Wayne has one of his finest roles in playing the tragic, vengeful, and bigoted Ethan Edwards.  Ethan has trouble reconciling the fact that his niece Debbie, who has been captured by the Comanche chief Scar, will be raised by the Comanche and eventually become a Comanche 'Squaw'.  Such a thing is too much for him to bear, and he figures Debbie is better off dead. But Ethan finds some humanity in the end when he lifts a frightened Debbie high in the air, then takes her in his arms and says 'Let's go home Debbie.' Interestingly enough, Ethan picked Debbie up in a similar manner five years earlier when he has returned home after being away for so long.  Perhaps it is this memory of a little girl that triggers the tenderness in him when he finally catches up to her in the end.A wonderful movie.  One of the best!",The Searchers

413,xinyijoyce,To John ford salute.,8,26 November 2011,"First of all i would like to say this is a set of entertaining and thought of one of the film. Along with the music we gradually heated the film was brought to the exciting story.The Story takes place in 1868 after the first fruit after the first attack by the Indians, a brother, Ethan, this description is very wonderful, generous with Ford is not too messy, emotional expression on favorably. Then is the Isan way of revenge, which way to go for many years? At least 5 years of it, we can not perceive in the lens extended time, is Martin's letter to Laurie embodied.This broad-brush narrative Ford must have a short board, Clyde's death to his parents, feels too dull, slightly some fault here, for the description of the Indians also too one-sided, not just Ford deliberately this is his own stereotypes of Indians.However, in this film we see the magnificent yard desert solitary rock, Monument Valley always will be the impression of John Ford; see the excitement and intense horse-phase by western gunfight; see the beauty of winter in western, views to the people the attitude of hunting buffalo, in addition to this, Laurie's naughty just splashing water with a flat lens to show exhaustive, Martin's tender (although slightly exaggerated), pastor of the rigid, Moss's madness, only a few words are show perfectly. Martin first Indian woman with the ""wrong marriage"", then ""grab marriage"" cruel hatred are a lot easier than adding. Especially the last, Ethan picked up relative to pick up the child as Debbie (Deborah) said, ""We go home"", the concept of shadow had already been conquered, Ethan has also been oriented to hatred. Ford's final film is optimistic, as well as start and end times appear among the ""door"" of the lens, through this door, we see optimism, hope, future.See John Ford's film inevitably brought the total compared with some of Leon. As the title, Leone film personality of each character will be carefully shown, but the performance is very strong and deep; every narrative requires a very strict, there is an unexpected lack of emotion and expression; each lenses are very delicate, and even careful viewing will find Leone like to use the lens of the object to create a sense of the stage curtain (or a dog across the lens or camera panning over an moving objects).And Ford's lens is so compact and have the momentum, we will not see the movie Leon the intense horse chase scenes (the scenes have to admit that Ford means more magnificent than the rich), and for events grasp on the degree of relaxation (this is not like Leone's ""stretching time"" and the climax of an instant burst of theory). Leone is a small thing to read through the western, Ford is in a carefully written description of the west, while to us to paragraphs episode. A small in the large, medium and large see a small, two more of the look of the film, does not have a taste.Also, in this life, we must run to Monument Valley.",The Searchers

417,tanderson1412,THE SEARCHERS: A Truly Terrible Film,1,1 September 2013,"I admit it; I don't like John Wayne. Never have, never will. However, I felt compelled to view this film as I put together the content for a new class I am developing on Film Genres, including the Western.This film has been described by other critics as ""the greatest Western"", and the ""apex"" of the collaboration of Director John Ford and the ""actor"" John Wayne. After viewing the film, I can only say that I am totally mystified by this canonization. The 1956 film was set in Texas, yet filmed in the famous Monument Valley in Utah – you have to love it that our fictitious white homesteaders would build their ranches right in the shadow of these magnificent geological treasures. The Native Americans in the film are depicted as dime store caricatures – the war paint on Chief Scar looks as ridiculous as the actor they put into this getup, who was German born Henry Brandon, whose other roles included Persian, Arab, and Asian villains. His ""In'juns"" kill the white men's cattle with their spears, leave the carcasses to rot on the open terrain, and try to kill and scalp as many white men and women as they can. They also are depicted as completely inept in every shootout in this film, so their off screen success is just one of many inconsistencies in this film. Wayne's role in the film is that of a former Confederate officer, Ethan Edwards, who has a pathological hatred of Native Americans. In the beginning, he arrives at his brother's cattle ranch after an absence of many years; all is happy, here in Monument Valley. Everyone in this family looks like they bathe three times a day and always are wearing freshly pressed clothes. Even the cute family dog looks incredibly clean and well groomed is this supposedly dusty environment. But the family hears that the hostile ""In'juns"" are after their cattle; Ethan goes out to investigate, finds the speared cattle to be just a diversion, and comes back to find the homestead in flames; everyone dead except his young niece, who has been kidnapped by the ""Co-manch""(rhymes with ranch),as Ethan refers to them. He also refers to his adopted nephew Martin as a""half-breed"" because he is 1/8th Cherokee, and later also calls him a ""blanket-head"". And thus begins the search. Ethan is a man's man: he desecrates the dead body of one Native American by firing bullets into his eyes, because with "" what that Comanche believes, ain't got no eyes, he can't enter the spirit-land. Has to wander forever between the winds."" That Ethan even knows Native American spiritual traditions seems inconsistent with his character. Ethan shoots buffalo just to deprive the Native Americans of their meat, and shoots people in the back, including the totally inept Native Americans after one shootout, and a barkeep who gave him a tip about Scar's whereabouts --- Ethan wants to get his money back. The studio ""campfire"" scenes are embarrassingly phony, even for the 1950's, particularly compared with the beautiful Monument Valley shots. The lack of any ambient sound other than the crackling of the fire is both bizarre and surreal.Ethan and Martin trade a group of witless Native Americans some hats, and Martin unknowingly gets one of the Native American women given to him in the trade as a ""wife"". Of course she is overweight and has a silly smile, so this served as great comic relief in the film. They even call her ""Look"", because it is easier to pronounce than her actual name.The ""rescue"" of the niece from Chief Scar manages to stand out as the most ridiculous scene in the film. The niece is portrayed by the very young and badly miscast Natalie Wood. When Ethan and his nephew track down Scar, he invites them into his tee pee and there we see Natalie, hair in pigtails and dressed in buckskin; all involved immediately recognize what is at stake, but Scar has enough manners to not kill the men he has invited into his own tee pee. Ethan and Martin skirt the issue, take their leave, and then pitch camp on the other side of the river; Natalie comes running after them and speaks the only Native American word she seems to know:""Ontomea"" (Go away). These are my people now. Go away."" Oh yeah, very convincing. Then Ethan makes a move to shoot his niece because she has turned into a ""buck"", and he is sure that is what his late sister-in-law would have wanted. Better dead than ""in'jun"". After the inevitable battle, Ethan chases his niece down – we think he is going to kill her – but in the end, he gathers her up on his horse, and takes her back home to the ranch. The message? We should be cheering for Ethan, the mythic American hero, who stands up for all that is right and all that is good, particularly in confronting the savage Native Americans. And I contend that ""Ethan"" is really no different than the real John Wayne, who was even quoted this way in an interview:""I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them (the Native Americans) ... Our so-called stealing of this country from them was just a matter of survival. There were great numbers of people who needed new land, and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves.""This film is a cultural embarrassment. That it has been glorified by many critics and some of those who study the history of cinema is also an embarrassment.",The Searchers

423,sean686,"Should be in anybody,s top 5",10,10 June 2008,"An epic tale of vengeance, morals and the untamed West, The Searchers may well be John Wayne's finest moment. Returning home from the Civil War (three years after its end), Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) is heartily welcomed by his brother Aaron (Walter Coy) and sister-in-law Martha (Dorothy Jordan). It's been a long time and they're glad to see kin, especially in a place as barren as their semi-desert smallholding. Ethan carries with him a number of ghosts, such as just what he's been up to in the intervening period (not surrendering, that's for sure) and the unstated bond with Martha. The children are oblivious to these overtones though, with Lucy (Pippa Scott), Debbie (Lana Wood) and Ben (Robert Lyden) gathering around their uncle excitably, clamouring for presents.Their peace is soon broken, by the arrival of Captain Reverend Clayton (Ward Bond) with news of rustling from a nearby farm. Gathering a small posse of Rangers, Clayton enlists Ethan and Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) as volunteers. Martin was found abandoned as an infant by Ethan, only now his eighth of Cherokee blood sours Ethan's actions towards him. Still, the group ride off with Lucy's boyfriend Brad Jorgensen (Harry Carey Jr.) and slightly mad Indian scout Mose Harper (Hank Worden). Picking up the trail, they easily follow it until the find the cattle -- all slaughtered, for no obvious reason, by Comanche. Grasping the implications (that this was all a ruse to draw the men from the farms), the posse hurriedly make tracks to return.Back at the Edwards' farm, an uneasy dusk hush has descended. Uncomfortably aware of the danger, Aaron packs Debbie off to hide among the gravestones, while the family prepare to defend their home. Just as Debbie settles, the shadow of Comanche chief Scar (Henry Brandon) falls across her. The next morning Ethan arrives back with Mose, horrified to discover the farm a smoldering ruin. Aaron, Martha and Ben have all been murdered and mutilated, a horror Ethan intends to keep from the devastated Martin. Since the two girls have obviously been kidnapped by the Indian raiding party, a squad is formed to bring them back. Unbeknown to anyone, this is merely the start of a years-long saga for Ethan and Martin, a journey which will take them to what seems like the ends of the Earth.Dealing with elemental themes and characters familiar from a hundred different Westerns, The Searchers has been imbued with a unique quality by director John Ford. Above any similar film, the gradual transformation of a man from remoteness to humanity (while remaining essentially unchanged) is handled with sensitivity and power. Ethan is a rugged product of the desert, supremely confident in his own abilities and dismissive of the opinions of others. Without an emotional outlet, Ethan appears to exist apart from other folks, when he is in fact capable of extremely deep and long-lasting feelings. Thus he is spurred to relentlessly track down Debbie, never pausing and never quitting (particularly since Aaron suggested that he wanted to give up on their harsh ranching existence, before the war). However, as his love is overshadowed by a homicidal rage, Martin is rightly fearful for just what'll happen when they find Debbie.Placed within a magnificent storyline, detailed and complex, the characters fit perfectly within the context of their environment. Scraping a living within the hellish scrub-land, the Edwards and Jorgensen families are tight-knit and self-reliant. Years of hardship have toughened them up, without introducing inflexibility and bitterness; the chance for a dash of conviviality is eagerly grasped, when presented. The exception is Ethan, as scarred and unforgiving as the rocky towers of the plain, he is admired even as his type become gradually out-of-date. Wayne plays his role beautifully and convincingly, investing his words with a sour passion, more at ease with the desert landscape than flesh and bone. All of the characters feel right, even loopy Moses, but Ethan is central to the saga that is The Searchers.The landscape of Monument Valley (a favourite for John Ford) is brutally powerful, dwarfing the insignificant humanity which scratches life from its floor. Ford makes superb use of the vistas available but, more than this, his control over visual structure is absolute at every level. The final framing of Ethan within a doorway, representing so much about his past and future, is merely a single example. In tandem with this photography, the rich colouration of the film stock imparts a wonderful sense of depth, drawing out incredibly subtle shades from within the rusty-iron hued rubble. Externally The Searchers is a fictional piece, yet the lives which were ploughed into the soil of America (to make it what it is today) have never seemed so close. These determined settlers carried a dream for the future, a hope that is both relevant and needed today.",The Searchers

Nothing comes close until Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone re-wrote the rules in the 60's.

425,chashc,John Ford's Crowning Achievement,10,1 January 2006,"Perhaps John Wayne's finest performance against type as a racially charged vigilante. The scene in the army barracks and just his look of hate is enough to see the depth of this fine acting job. John Fords and John Waynes masterpieces. Wayne seems like an anti hero in this film, not accepting the end of the civil war and his outright hate of the commanches, is without subtlety, the distance he displays amongst his own family members just reinforces what I feel is his greatest performance. One must only look at his eyes throughout the film and see the seething hate he displays, Yet at the films end his sense of blood family outweighs his sense of hatred. As he stands in the shadows after bringing Debbie home it was as if he no longer exists because it was like the Jorgensen family was returning to Normalcy, and his services are no longer needed. Watch this film with no predetermined ideas, You'll enjoy it.",The Searchers
426,steve_jay,Moments of cinematic perfection,9,16 November 2009,"By today's usual standards the acting is mostly either wooden or over the top, it seems to have a ham script that's agonisingly frustrating because it leaves so many questions unanswered and a storyline so sexist and racist it's cringeworthy ... I guess, given that over 50 years have passed, it could be just a product of its time but maybe, just maybe, it was put together that way to provoke and stir the thought process of the moviegoer by a director way ahead of his time.Either way, to my mind, this is a movie that contains so many scenes of cinematic perfection such as the folding of the coat; the kiss on the forehead; the howling coyote; the burning farm; the lost coat; ""do you want me to paint you a picture ?""; the look from the shadows at the released female hostage; the moment Debbie is first found; ""let's go home""; the magnificent final scene and the overall cinematography ... its just breathtakingly brilliant and always will be.",The Searchers
427,dilloncrouse,two companions search for a girl captured by Indians,10,8 February 2006,"When I first saw this movie I was 10 years old. I'm now 13, and I love westerns. But then I was still under the influence that all westerns were the same. One night I stayed up late after my mom and dad told me to go to bed. I turned on my TV and was flipping through the channels when for some reason I stopped. I don't know why I stopped. It may have been God who stopped me because His favorite movie was about to come on, I don't know. The Searchers was just coming on when I stopped. I started Watching it but fell a sleep right around when Ethan and Marty visited the Jorgensons. I didn't see it again for another three years. I saw it again a few months ago and recorded it. It was then that I decided that it was the best movie that I had ever seen. I showed it to my friend,who hates westerns, a few weeks ago. I don't think he even blinked until it went off.",The Searchers
428,suburama,Bad bad movie portraying the true Americans in a bad light,1,24 March 2006,"All the western movies depict the cruelty of the wild west when they were half humans and half beasts when the immigrants attacked and occupied the American lands and butchered them without mercy(not that its expected from them)and yet have the audacity of portraying the victim Americans as villains. Its a shame such movies are made. Such gory violence should not be glorified. The Americans are nice people victimizes by the people who came by boats.Such movies however do portray some truth that Americans were killed without mercy. Bows and Arrows were met by bullets. I am sure you get the idea. Maybe you may not agree to it, but its the truth. And truth hurts.",The Searchers
