0,MartinHafer,a really good idea for a movie that never really jelled,5,17 August 2005,"This movie had so many things going for it: cool characters (such as the ultra-hip Buckaroo Banzai, the totally nutty Dr. Lizardo and Buckaroo's many sidekicks), cool effects, a weird and quirky story and a lot of energy. However, all these together just didn't work--as if somewhere the energy all vanished and the film had been hastily put together from outtakes. It is a real shame, as the idea of a rock and roll pretty boy who lives a life of adventure AND saves the world is a really cool idea--like a comic book and an old movie serial combined into one! But what happened?! I kept expecting it to pick up speed, but it just kept getting duller throughout. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE consider making a newer and much better re-make--the BASIC elements of a great movie are here and waiting to be utilized. As it is, the movie is at best average.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
1,SnoopyStyle,Not sure!,6,28 September 2013,"This is one of the craziest movies around. It's either inspired movie-making or convoluted B-movie mess. Quite Frankly, it's a bit of both. Buckaroo Banzai is a rock star, brilliant scientist who invented the oscillation overthruster which allows him to travel into solid matter since most solid matter is simply empty space. The evil Red Lectroids from Planet 10 are after this device. Buckaroo can see the aliens and must stop them with his group The Hong Kong Cavaliers and various people and alien along the way.John Lithgow is playing a weird alien the leader of the Johns. Ellen Barkin plays the damsel in distress. Peter Weller plays this seriously as Buckaroo. Jeff Goldblum is dressed as a cartoon cowboy. The whole thing is super crazy played with a straight serious face. I don't know to laugh at it or shake my head.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
2,gavin6942,Amazing Cult Film,7,15 April 2014,"Adventurer/surgeon/rock musician Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) and his band of men, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, take on evil alien invaders from the 8th dimension.What an incredible cast, with John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Goldblum and Weller himself, just to name a few. Thirty years later, this film is still a marvel to behold -- and while it may not be perfect, it is strange enough to make up for its shortcomings.I have only see the theatrical print (in a theater, no less), but now I want the comic books, the director's cut and so much more.

3,lee_eisenberg,dimensions of wackiness,8,7 June 2013,"""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"" is a movie that understands full well what kind of movie it is and so they made it as zany as possible. Peter Weller was a few years away from playing RoboCop when he played the renaissance man who travels through solid matter and brings Earth into confrontation with aliens. What was particularly neat was when they noted that all matter is mostly empty space due to the spinning of the atoms (which presumably makes it possible to travel through the matter). And of course the part about Orson Welles's radio broadcast was cool. But mostly, the movie is just fun, and it looks like the sort of movie that they probably had fun making. As long as you accept it as an unabashedly silly flick, you're sure to enjoy it. Weller, as well as John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum and the rest turn in some great performances.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
4,ccthemovieman-1,Another Loser For Lithgow,2,27 March 2006,"What a disappointment! With a title like that, I expected something really good, or at least fun to watch. It was neither. It was just another grimy flick with no values to it and no clarity or intelligence to the story. It was stupid and it was boring, which is about the worst thing a film can be. Come to think of it, I have never seen a good movie yet in which John Lithgow is the star, which may explain part of the reason just is so bad. Too bad, because the rest of the cast features some interesting names: Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd and Peter Weller, but this was hardly a film these actors want in their resumes.A vastly overrated ""cult"" movie.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
5,Quinoa1984,"a ""cult"" film that knows nearly no boundaries of creativity with its zany appeal",9,31 January 2009,"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai is a movie I dearly wish I could have seen on the big screen back in the 80s (if I had been old enough for it at the least). It's so, well ""80's"" but it isn't completely trapped in it. What it's about is... damn, should I even try? Actually, it does have a cohesive narrative, and more surprising because in the first few minutes, even with opening crawl, one is a little lost in exactly what's going on except a) Buckaroo Banzai had an American mother and Japanese father (and is played by Peter Weller who doesn't look like the latter much at all), and b) he goes through dimensions or something looking for martial arts moves. We soon find out he has mastered driving a car through mountains- since, you know, they are loaded with empty spaces and the particles are just so tiny to bother with- and has discovered an alien being, all of this in New Jersey.WHICH, you may recall, was the place where Orson Welles's rendition of War of the Worlds was placed in in the small town of Grover's Mill... turns out it wasn't a hoax and aliens had actually taken over Welles's mind and made him put on the broadcast. And, indeed, aliens have come to earth and may incinerate it and/or have the Russians involved somehow if Buckaroo and his men of scientists-cum-rock-and-rollers don't fight back against the maniacal Dr. Lizardo (John Lithgow playing some kind of, um, Italian baddie zapped with Alien prowess). Can he do it in time or will the president have to resort to war? Can he save his damsel-in-distress in the form of suicidal-turned-doctor Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin)? Why is Jeff Goldblum dressed up as a cowboy for the bulk of the movie AND from Fort Lee, NJ (a town, incidentally, not very far from my own home)? All these questions and more are... answered I suppose during The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai. This is like someone digested a whole truckload of pulp/sci-fi/whatever comic books and adventure serials- think Howard the Duck if it was *intentionally* awesome- and wrote a screenplay. Where else will we get Peter Weller, cinema's RoboCop AND star of Naked Lunch, playing a sort of super-hero who rocks out amazingly, invents things, propels through time and space, and can kill easily and swiftly while fighting for the woman on his arm? And where else will we see John Lithgow snarl and bug-eye Italian (?) and do all odds and ends of WOW things that mark this as a major career achievement? Here is where, and it's a lot of fun to see every cheesy line spoke (""Damn John Whorfin and the horse he rode in on"" or ""BigbooTAY!"" or even ""If you fail, we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves!"") with the kind of delivery that just goes to show how much a would-be Buckaroo Banzai ala Southland Tales fails so much by comparison.It's a wonder to behold, with every crazy synthesizer beat, with every other new turn of a wacky performance, and of course that final end credits sequence that will be etched in my mind forever as something really great to keep me in my seat before turning off the TV. This is how a 'cult' film should operate: don't try and please everyone, just do what you set out to do, however tenacious and maniacal and manic it may be with however many willing and able character actors and/or occasional stars, and you'll please immensely those who look for this kind of stuff.

6,wes-connors,"No Matter Where You Go, There You Are",8,21 February 2009,"Buckaroo Banzai's latest adventure (and, his first revealed in any media) begins with Peter Weller as the Samurai, ""renaissance man, neurosurgeon, physicist, race car driver, rock star, AND comic book hero"" test driving his Jet Car through a mountain. Due to the vehicle's ""oscillation overthruster"", Mr. Weller emerges unscathed - he and his Jet Car pass through solid matter. Unfortunately, the car picks up a glob of inter-dimensional matter. Coincidentally (actually, not coincidentally ), super-weird physicist John Lithgow (as Emilio Lizardo) ends his five decade residency at the ""New Brunswick Home for the Criminally Insane""...As it turns out, Mr. Lithgow is an alien (they are all named ""John"") from ""Planet 10"". On Halloween 1938, Lithgow and some ""Red Lectroids"" arrived on Earth. Their mission failed, and many were thrown into ""The 8th Dimension"". This event was, by the way, was misinterpreted as an invasion from Mars, by Orson Welles, during his infamous October 30, 1938 radio broadcast version of H.G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"". By the late 1960s, other media hinted at the continued Lectroid presence. Examples include ABC-TV's ""The Invaders"" and novelist Thomas Pynchon's ""The Crying of Lot 49"".Presently, defeating the Red Lectroid invaders is up to multi-talented ""Buckaroo Banzai"" (Weller) and his hard-rocking team of ""Hong Kong Cavaliers"": Lewis Smith (as Perfect Tommy), Jeff Goldblum (as New Jersey), Clancy Brown (as Rawhide), Pepe Serna (as Reno Nevada), and Billy Vera (as Pinky Carruthers). Suicidal Ellen Barkin (as Penny Priddy) provides Banzai romantic interest.""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (Across the 8th Dimension)"" is intelligent fun, from writer Earl Mac Rauch and director W.D. Richter. Lithgow is a perfect Lectroid, ""Laugh while you can, monkey boy!"" Really, he and the likes of Vincent Schiavelli (as John O'Connor) couldn't be anyone but aliens, could they? In hindsight, perhaps the ""Black Letroid"" and ""Penny Priddy"" parts might have been better re-worked. Still, it's a classic. And, it still leaves you looking forward to ""Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League"", with Weller and the Cavaliers.******** The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984) W.D.

Will New Jersey fit in with the rest of the Irregulars and why did he have a whole cowboy outfit with him? Why do they call him Perfect Tommy? Who is Hanoi Xan?

There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I'm not sure anybody knew.""

8,Hey_Sweden,"""I've been ionized, but I'm okay now.""",8,28 January 2014,"Writer Earl Mac Rauch and debuting director W.D. Richter (himself a writer of such things as the 1978 version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"") present to cult movie lovers a rollicking and memorable tribute to and send-up of the Saturday matinée serials of decades past. It has its heart in the right place while maintaining a completely irreverent attitude, a fair amount of invention, and a goofy unpredictability (even while telling what is ultimately a time-honoured tale of alien invasion). The movie features one of the most eclectic casts you'll see in this sort of thing, right down to the small roles. It's got fun alien makeup (by the Burman studio), an appreciable amount of cheese, some choice bits of dialogue, and a colourful bunch of cool characters.Peter Weller stars as the Buckaroo Banzai of the title, a celebrity and jack of all trades: he's a neurosurgeon, physicist, government troubleshooter, jet car test driver, and rock star all in one. He works with a dedicated team of fellow scientists and musicians dubbed The Hong Kong Cavaliers. They find that it's up to them to save the day when extraterrestrial villains called Lectroids start acting up. Among the newest members of Buckaroo's team are the troubled Penny Priddy (an appealing Ellen Barkin) and jovial ""New Jersey"" (Jeff Goldblum); the nemesis is Lord John Whorfin, who's taken over the body of a scientist named Emilio Lizardo (both roles are played by John Lithgow, who's in peak hammy form).You know you're in for some good times when you peruse the cast list: Christopher Lloyd, Lewis Smith, Rosalind Cash, Robert Ito, Pepe Serna, Ronald Lacey (the Nazi torturer from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" playing the President of the United States here!), Matt Clark, Clancy Brown, Carl Lumbly, Vincent Schiavelli, Dan Hedaya, Bill Henderson, Billy Vera, Jonathan Banks, John Ashton, and none other than Yakov Smirnoff playing the National Security Adviser! Everybody is fun to watch, with Weller thoroughly engaging as the game-for- anything Buckaroo, a man destined from birth to be something special. There's some poignancy here and there, but cast & crew commit to mostly keeping an upbeat spirit while the insanity of this movie plays out.This viewer is glad there is an audience for stuff like this (it *does* have a following); this is the kind of thing that ought to get encouraged more often.The end credits with Buckaroo and buddies marching through an aquaduct is irresistible and ends the proceedings on a true high note.Eight out of 10.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
9,preppy-3,OK it makes no sense...but boy is it FUN!!!!!!!,9,21 August 2001,"The plot is incomprehensible, characterizations are nonexistent and Ellen Barkin's character makes no sense.  Still I LOVE this film.  It never stops moving (heck, who needs to understand things?), is VERY colorful and has some incredible lines (""Wherever you go...there you are"", ""The Duece you say"", ""Cursa you monkey boy!"").  Also this is an instant cult classic...it demands multiple viewings to figure out what's going on (it took me 3 viewings)!  Peter Weller (whatever happened to...) is great as Banzai--he's handsome, square-jawwed and doesn't take anything seriously.  The rest of his crew doesn't make much of an impression (except for Perfect Tommy and New Jersey).  Lithgow, surprisingly, isn't good as Dr. Lizardo.  He doesn't go all the way with the role...he seems to be holding back.  Also, he's impossible to understand.  Barkin is just wheepy, whiny and annoying.  Still worth seeing...just don't expect a lot of logic.  Great closing credits too.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
10,Boba_Fett1138,"Odd title, odd movie.",5,24 July 2007,"Not too sure what to think about this movie. It seems like its a spoof, of what, I do not know however. Perhaps of comic-book type of movies from the '80's, or adventurous serials from the '30's/40's? But then again there's the problem that the movie is not really funny and on top of that, also not so very well made. Guess the movie can best be seen as a cult-classic, for the fans of it.To be honest, the movie began well and promising. It developed some potentially interesting characters and plot lines but for some reason as the movie progresses they don't get handled well. The movie becomes more crazy and crazy as the movie heads toward the ending. At one point I even stopped caring and wanting to understand what the movie was all about. It was confusing, it was poor but above all it was odd.The movie could had been fun, the movie could had been action filled but yet it all isn't. It's wasted potential, cause I guess that in essence Buckaroo Banzai isn't really a bad fun movie main-hero.The movie is only fun now really with its character's names. All of the alien's their first name is John and they have names such as John Bigboote, John O'Connor and John Smallberries. But other than that, there isn't really much fun present in the movie. The many famous actors however still provide the movie with some fun and this uplifts the movie. Amazing how many great actors are in this movie such as Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, Clancy Brown, Ronald Lacey, Vincent Schiavelli and Dan Hedaya. John Lithgow is deliciously overacting as the movie its main villain but I just wish that he had more sequences and was made more interesting as a character. Peter Weller was a great leading man in the '80's and he shows with this movie how well he can carry a movie.The special effects are all decent for '80's standards but perhaps overused a bit too much. The musical score is typically '80's like and absolutely horrible. Further more the movie is fairly well looking, too bad inexperienced director W.D. Richter doesn't know how to use everything to its full potential.Yet it's not all that bad and the movie still entertains, so the movie obviously still has some redeeming qualities which makes this still a bit of a watchable movie.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

The protective goggles made out of bubble wrap are my favourites."" My sixth thought was, ""Actually, this is really bad. I mean, this is poor. Incoherently told, not very funny, and technically poor even for 1984.

12,Mr-Fusion,"High-concept? Comedy? I dunno, but it's a lot of fun.",8,30 July 2014,"BUCKAROO BANZAI has an inescapable charm that makes everything about it surprisingly enjoyable despite its absurd premise, a plot that asks a lot of its audience (and places them right in the middle of things with very little warning), and the balls to expect you to either be along for the ride or make room for someone else. I love this movie, and even I freely admit it's insane. Part of the movie's winning formula is the stellar cast, fronted by Peter Weller, who was a terrific choice for the eponymous hero. He's a natural leader and can rock the bow-tie like nobody's business. His rock band is populated with great character actors, and John Lithgow and Christopher Lloyd are hilarious as the bad guys. The script is peppered with some great one-liners, and there's frequently something off about the aliens (their faces always have the same expression: confused). The story involves everything from other dimensions to chases and shootouts, and even throws Orson Welles into the mix. It's daffy, but never slow. I wish this movie had fared better 30 years ago; I'm still waiting for the promised sequel. It's a comic book movie to its core, wholly unique and gloriously '80s.

13,siderite,The all star movie you've never heard about,5,9 February 2020,"This movie is a joke. It's up to you if you like the joke or not. Everything in it is over the top, all except the budget, which must have been close to zero. I have no idea what Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd were thinking when they joined the cast, but it's pretty clear that they had a lot of fun.The plot makes no sense whatsoever, the characters are all part of scientist rockstar gangs, the story is part pulp comic book part Scooby Doo and the acting is so random that it is hilarious. This is one of those movies that you watch in disbelief and when it ends you kind of feel you wanted more. It's one of those ""What the hell did I just watch?"" things.

14,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Hey Buckaroo ya real cool cat, you got a little of this and a lotta that",7,4 May 2016,"I'm not sure I am able to review this film, I don't know what it is. I don't think half of the cast even know what it is. But I do know that I like it, a lot. It has a wonderfully infectious edge and does not care to conform to the expectations of any particular genre.Peter Weller is Buckaroo Banzai a Japanese/American rock star/brain surgeon/secret agent/rocket scientist who travels through the 8th dimension in his rocket car with the help of his latest invention - the Oscillation Overthruster. The success of this inter-dimensional travel brings forth the Rastafarian Black Lectoids, an alien race at war with the the Red Lectoids, led by a manic John Lithgow as Dr. Emilio Lizardo/Lord John Whorfin, who are already here on Earth and sabotaging Buckaroo and his very large easy-going entourage the Hong Kong Cavaliers.Honestly, there is so much going on here that it's very hard to get a handle on it. This also makes Buckaroo Banzai infinitely re- watchable. Imagine the insanity of Big Trouble in Little China and dial it all the way up past the threshold. It's incredible that I have only just discovered this film. Perhaps attempting to review it this soon after my mind has attempted to absorb it is a mistake. One could literally debate and discuss this crazy movie until the end of time and still not cover all of its idiosyncrasies. There is enough material in here for ten movies, yet it never once feels overly crowded, nor did it ever deliver the urgently-needed sequel the end credits promise. The film is PACKED with recognizable stars who debuted or were at there peak in the 80s. Christopher Lloyd and Dan Hedeya as the evil Red Lectoids, Jeff Goldblum as Buckaroo's new recruit, Ellen Barkin as the twin sister of his long-lost true love, Clancy Brown as his right- hand man, and a young Jonathan Banks (with hair).There are so many movies from the 80s that thrive on iconic imagery and eccentric creations. The Oscillation Overthruster really should be as well-known as the Flux Capacitor or the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, the rocket car should be as recognizable as the DeLeorean, Buckaroo's style should be as popular as Marty's orange body-warmer or Indy's fedora. What really should have caught on with audiences the most is Buckaroo's caring, kind personality. It adds yet another unique layer to an already multi-layered and highly unique film.It's a shame that Buckaroo Banzai failed to find an audience when it was originally released but perhaps having it gradually find its way into popular culture and naturally pull curious viewers into its culture is better than being rudely shoved in our faces.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

16,BaronBl00d,Lukewarm at Best,5,21 July 2012,"I get it. I really do. I get the creativity. I get the whole snappy dialog and outfits. I get the big 80's style hair. I get the bizarre story about an adventurer who is also a neurosurgeon/martial arts expert/physicist who can break the speed of light and travel into a dimension hitherto unbeknownst to mankind. See. I get it. I even get why this film has attained some sort of cult status. What I don't get it why? I watched, I sighed, I yawned, I looked at my watch, I looked at my watch again, I sighed - then I went to bed after the first 45 minutes and watched the remainder the next day with basically the same regimen. Look, this is a thick slice of 80's cheese to be sure, and I do respect the producers and director for trying something totally new. But, for much of this film, it is just silly. Peter Weller is a wooden hero surrounded by men with weird names and outfits who are going to help him save the world from aliens. There are two alien factions and I really do not want to investigate that any further as I stifle a yawn about to erupt. Weller and crew are lackluster with the exception of a very young Jeff Goldblum as ""New Jersey"" and a rather appealing Ellen Barkin as Buckaroo's former love's twin sister(?). Yeah, a lot was done with that storyline too! (NOT!) Saying ""bigboote"" fifteen times does not a good film or even great film make. This one is borderline for me. I admire the moxie it took to make it. The attempt to do something that had not been done before. The chutzpah(?) the writers had to make their hero all of those things without any former knowledge by the audience OR an attempt to look into the background with any depth whatsoever. The set pieces, the costumes, and that hair are wonders even for the 80's!. John Lithgow chews up scenery better than almost anyone even though he wildly over-does it in this even by Lithgow standards. But with all that said, the end result ultimately was unsatisfactory. The inane dialog, the cheesy special effects, the wooden, low-key performances, that ludicrous end credits with people bobbing their heads up and down, and a convoluted story. This movie flopped and clearly it should have. By no means is it horrible, but rather very, very, very pedestrian.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
17,funkyfry,very funny lighthearted movie,7,31 May 2009,"This one has just eluded me for years... one time I set out to the theater to see it at a revival, but the only showing had already been sold out. And it's a movie that could have gone wrong in a lot of ways, had it tried to be either more or less serious than it is. I like the movie though. I think it makes Peter Weller appealing, even arguably a bit sexy, which is an accomplishment in and of itself worthy of note. I liked most of the supporting performances and especially Jeff Goldblum, although I really don't think Ellen Barkin added much to the film.What I really liked were some of the random touches. Like the scene when these guys in suits are supposed to be some kind of alien investigators, and Vincent Schiavelli walks up with a huge glass pipe taking a toke talking about what a pleasant evening it is. I didn't even know they made pipes like that back in the 80s, sure never saw Cheech and Chong smoking one. Or the scene where the two guys are chasing after the aliens through the lab and one of them sees a watermelon on a table with a bunch of equipment and says, ""what's with the watermelon?"" and the other guy says, ""I'll tell you later"" but of course he never does. The opening scenes are good too, with Buckaroo Banzai doing laser brain surgery and then going right into a highly experimental vehicle and driving 500 MPH, then the next thing he's playing cheezy 80s guitar at some tacky neon club. It's hard to be enduringly cool if you're an 80s action character, but Buckaroo Banzai just manages to pass the test. A lot of the jokes in the movie pretty much fall flat, but you get the feeling that the people making it weren't even that serious about the comedy. It's just sort of a lark, one of the few self-conscious ""cult"" or ""midnight"" movies from the 80s that I've seen that I think really works and has its own special charm because it's not an imitation of anything else that I've seen.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
18,elshikh4,What's with the watermelon ?!,6,14 October 2010,"This is a different sci-fi movie. But can different be enough interesting? It depends on what different we're talking about.Different, in a good sense, comes from the imagination and wit; the lead as an adventurous physicist, neurosurgeon and rock musician. The Hong Kong cavaliers. The crying screaming heroine. A from-outer-space Mussolini. The story, especially a line like the conspiracy of hypnotizing (Orson Welles) in 1938. Creative details like a machine that recalls past times by attaching it to the tongue. And it has every little boy's inordinate dream; a kid who fights bad people while ""holding a gun"" WAW!It was rare to see a half Japanese heroic lead, or half Japanese anything good, in an American movie at the time. Thanks to not being Hollywood I think. Look at the way the American president is shown; so boldly ironic. It's one American movie from the 1980s that doesn't want to destroy Russia! No need now to say how Earl Mac Rauch's script has so special atmosphere, before being entertaining.The end's parade defines cool. It mirrors the team of heroes' confidence, variety and uniting. It's like the show's trademark at being simple and lovely. I love it as the movie's top product at all. After 20 years, director (Wes Anderson) did it again yet poorly in (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) as ""homage to the '84 sci-fi comedy"". Maybe the presence of (Jeff Goldblum), in both films, encouraged him.Singing The Skyliners' 1958 hit ""Since I Don't Have You"" is an exceptional moment. You can't find a moment as romantic as this in any sci-fi movie today. With that, singularity is something the movie, so worthwhile, wins.(Michael Boddicker)'s so 80s music, with all the purely electronic tones and whistling, was childish and innocent. Plus it did fine concerning the identity of the movie as another 80s relic hip. A single sonic special effect, recurs in the music, tickles me since it accords with another one in a Japanese Atari game which I used to play when I was a kid in the 1980s. I don't hear it ever since unless in Buckaroo Banzai.While it has fine merits that range between fresh, surprising, and nostalgic, the movie had to be willfully campy. Putting in mind how its director (W. D. Richter) co-produced it too (The no-money alert). Which leads us to ""different"" in a bad sense!Originally it wants to be comic book movie that tries to resemble cheap comic books. But maybe just resembling such a work isn't a great thing to do, since it would appeal just for the die-hard, really crazy, fans of it. Further, the lack of money seduced the movie-makers to approach it as a spoof. However, what's ""intentionally bad"" came off as eventually ""bad"". So, it almost ends up as 2 movies: a sci-fi comic adventure, and the ugly parody of it; in a way that embarrassingly doesn't work.The horrible masks, the terrible special effects, and the glasses that must be wore to watch outer space's messages; they're all bad elements that come from destitute production. The makers can't get away with it by alleging how their movie is a ""parody of the 1950's sci-fi movies"" or a ""spoof of the sci-fi novels"". That poorness managed to deform any dazzling image, lessen the respect for the heroic core of it, making the mix desperately cheesy and unsatisfying (The being-a-flop alert!). So, for me, this is unattractive cheese. And maybe the fans of the cheesy comic books themselves waited for more. And the other fans, who agreed with it anyway, were obviously less than making it a hit, only a cult classic over the years.Speaking of other things that bothered me; (Peter Weller). Yes, he looks agreeable, but mostly doesn't even try, to the extent of seeming soulless. Some reviewer said that ""Weller performed from the Zen zone, to be mistaken as stiff"". OK. That's fraud! And although ""No matter where you go, there you are"" is from (Confucius), but I still don't get its relation with the lead or the movie!So, ""What's with the watermelon?"" is a smart idea as a spoof, not in a spoofing-structured movie though. It could have been so smart spoof as a whole, to be for sci-fi what (Matt Helm) was for (James Bond). But the poor budget transformed it from a sci-fi mixed with comedy to more like a spoof of itself. Simply there is a difference between laughing at a genre, and laughing at the viewers; while selling them a poor movie as a mocking at the poor movies!It is half wild, half bad. Whether as a sincere to the cheesy comics or a mocker at it; both ways, I don't buy it. I can't imagine loving bad work, or loving bad work as homage to another bad work. And yet, the good points here force me to wait (Buckaroo Banzai vs. The World Crime League). I want the Hong Kong cavaliers to ride again, with bigger budget, and not the watermelon's secret; only more funny enigmas like it. Perhaps it'll be different AND wholly interesting this time.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
19,ackstasis,"""May I pass along my congratulations for your great inter-dimensional breakthrough.""",6,9 November 2007,"""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension."" It's a cool title for a film. As soon as I first heard it, I decided that this was something I simply had to track down. Aside from possessing a title so long that I don't have the energy to repeat it in its entirety, 'Buckaroo Banzai' also sports a stellar line-up of instantly recognisable names: Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd. You get the feeling that director W.D. Richter was attempting something in the vein of George Lucas' original 'Star Wars (1977).' He and writer Earl Mac Rauch basically created their own universe, filled it with wacky characters and developed a back-story to go with them, making this film seem as though it is merely one instalment in a series of Buckaroo Banzai adventures. Of course, success is based on a multitude of factors  one of them luck  and, unlike 'Star Wars,' this film performed abysmally at the box-office. However, with time, it has gradually found its niche audience, and this off-the-wall fantasy adventure has since developed a formidable cult following.Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) is the ultimate science-fiction Renaissance Man, a skilled neurosurgeon, particle physicist, race car driver and rock star. When the sinister activities of inter-dimensional aliens called Red Lectroids (their leader played by John Lithgow) threaten to destroy the world, it is up to Banzai and his gang, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, to rescue the planet from total obliteration. Considering that 'Buckaroo Banzai' is only a single film, it's surprising how complex and richly-detailed the story is. Characters frequently reference events and people as though we experienced them in a previous adventure, and it all moves so quickly that you'd better be paying close attention to what is happening. Every character has their own unique and laughable quirks (Jeff Goldbum, for one, spends the entire film in a ridiculous cowboy costume) but it's all part of the cult appeal.Though I admit that I enjoyed watching the film, it didn't connect with me like I'd hoped it would. 'Buckaroo Banzai' strikes me as the sort of movie that I would admire today if only I'd first watched it in my younger years: my unashamed love for such wacky 1980s sci-fis as 'Biggles (1986)' and 'Young Einstein (1988)' can serve as proof for this. Nevertheless, a sequel to 'Buckaroo Banzai' is a prospect that I would most certainly have looked forward to, since the film's universe is rich enough to have accommodated more than a few follow-ups, as well as a prequel or two. Indeed, though the end credits hailed the return of Buckaroo Banzai in 'Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League,' the production company Sherwood Studios subsequently went bankrupt after the film's commercial failure, and legal complications destroyed any chances of a return. Oh, well. Perhaps there's a sequel floating about somewhere in the 8th dimension",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

The film lives up to it too, and is simply one of the most unique, bizarre and original sci fi flicks out there.

But that is all thanks to the villains of the film whom more than wear out their welcome which means the director is probably the one to blame but let me just confirm that via IMDB really quick. Yup, the director was to blame. I could tell it was the director because the source material seemed good enough and the cast used for the film is freaking phenomenal in terms of star power.

28,jhclues,"A Unique, Epic Adventure",9,7 April 2002,"Since the release of this film in 1984, it has achieved bona fide cult status, and with good reason; for it is, without question, one of the most unique offerings in the universe of cinematic science fiction.  chock-full of quirky, memorable characters and scenes, `The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension,' directed by W.D. Richter, is laced with clever dialogue, action, adventure and surprises.  And where else are you ever going to find a main character who is a scientist, brain surgeon and rock n' roll star all rolled up into one?	After years of research, Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) and his colleague, Professor Hikita (Robert Ito), have successfully developed an `overthruster,' a device that has allowed Buckaroo to pass through solid matter-- a mountain, in fact-- driving through it at high speed in his specially designed and equipped car.  But when his achievement hits the news, it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum, where he has been a resident for many years, ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.  	But though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed, it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm, one of whom-- Lord John Whorfin-- has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body.  They are Red Lectroids from Planet 10 by way of the 8th dimension, stranded on earth (in human form) and awaiting the development of the overthruster, which will enable them to return home.  These are dangerous and resourceful beings, and they are about to take Buckaroo Banzai-- currently on tour with his band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers-- by surprise.  And soon, all that will stand between the Red Lectroids and the destruction of the earth, will be Buckaroo, his band and some help from his loyal followers, the `Blue Blazer Regulars.'	Working from the highly imaginative, clever and detailed screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch, Richter has fashioned and delivered a colorful and exciting adventure filled with subtle humor, the unexpected and an array of outrageous characters, from Whorfin and the Lectroids (all of whom have the first name `John'), to Buckaroo's cohorts like `Perfect Tommy (Lewis Smith)' and New Jersey (Jeff Goldblum), to the alluring, mysterious woman Buckaroo encounters, Penny Priddy (Ellen Barkin).  It's an unconventional, yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides, lines and situations, all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next.  He throws so much at you, in fact, that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through; but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings, because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be:  Pure entertainment from start to finish.	Peter Weller is perfectly cast as Buckaroo, and he successfully captures all of the elements that make his character the ultimate Renaissance Man of the immediate future.  With this performance, Weller becomes the personification of the genius, adventurer and master-of-all-things; it's the definitive portrayal of a unique individual, quite unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before.  Weller's Buckaroo is intelligent and self-assured-- watching him you get the feeling there's always something going on in his head, and always a step ahead of the next guy-- and it's his ability to convey the complexities of the character that makes him believable, and his incredible exploits seem credible.  Simply put, Weller has taken a comic book character and made him real, and it makes the film work.	As Lizardo/Whorfin, John Lithgow takes it magnificently over the top with a character that is something of a precursor to his High Commander Dick Solomon on TV's `3rd Rock from the Sun.'  And watching this guy in action is a real kick.  He's larger than life, wildly animated and extroverted, while affecting an accent that's a veritable smorgasbord of dialect.  He lumbers along like a mutated Quasimodo, and when he gives a speech to his fellow Red Lectroids about going `home,' it's one of the most hilarious scenes you're ever going to see anywhere.  There's definitely a method to Lithgow's madness, and it's a terrific performance.	Christopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids, `John Bigboote,' and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot (especially when Lizardo insists on calling him `Big-Booty,' and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced `Bigboo-TAY!').  And that's just an example of the many, many finer and detailed elements Richter uses to make this film so enjoyable and successful, from consistently funny verbal exchanges to broad physical humor, all interspersed with the action and woven seamlessly into the story.	The additional supporting cast includes Rosalind Cash (John Emdall), Pepe Serna (Reno Nevada), Matt Clark (McKinley), Clancy Brown (Rawhide), Carl Lumbly (John Parker), Vincent Schiavelli (John O'Connor), Dan Hedaya (John Gomez), Bill Henderson (Casper), Damon Hines (Scooter), Billy Vera (Pinky Carruthers), Ronald Lacey (President Widmark) and William Traylor (General Catburd).  A film that will take you on a wild ride and into regions beyond the known, `The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' is that most rare treasure among cinematic discoveries:  A truly unique film. It's enthralling and entertaining, and will keep you laughing and involved no matter how many times you see it.  And it's filled with great lines you'll be able to quote endlessly and use for any occasion.  Or, as Buckaroo himself would say, `No matter where you go, there you are...'  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

That's what Buckaroo Banzai, rock in roll scientist, doctor and larger than life cult figure adventurer and even the object of an in the film only comic book series (Peter Weller, the hero of ""Robocop"") tells his audience when they laugh at the down on her luck Penny Pretty (Ellen Barkin). Based on her resemblance to his murdered wife Peggy, Buckaroo springs her from jail and she accompanies him and his gang the Hong Kong Cavaliers, rock in roll scientist, and medical friend New Jersey (Jeff Goldblum) to a science hearing to discuss his latest invention and the discovery of the 8th Dimension. The only problem is that an alien race known as Red Lectroids and their evil leader John Worfin played by John Lithgow (everyone from the 8th Dimension is named John, even the women), are on to Buck's dimension crossing invention, and now Buck and the gang must fight the Red Lectroids with help of the Black Lectroids. Thing is Red Lectroids look like white guys and Black Lectroids look like Rastafarians due to bizarre fume they let off that messes with our nervous system and tricking us into thinking we're seeing regular human beings.Christopher Lloyd plays one of the Red Lectroids. Ironically, his boss in this film, John Lithgow, was considered for Lloyd's role, Doc Brown, in ""Back to the Future"".Clancy Brown, the villain of ""Highlander"", plays one of Buckaroo's allies.

30,Maziun,Cult movie that still waits to be discovered by the world,4,8 November 2013,"This has to be one of the most original , bizarre and unpredictable movies I have seen. A spoof of all those 1950's B-class science-fiction films and comic books (the scene with the Buckaroo Banzai comic book should tell you that). The closest movie I can compare it to is ""Big trouble in Little China"" or Monthy Python making fun of science fiction. It never takes itself to seriously. It's sort a joke on itself.What we have here is a pseudo science fiction comedy . All the ""science"" here is just one black joke – it's a parody of gibberish science you can find in many old movies. It's one of those ""love it or hate it"" movies. I don't think it's a masterpiece , but it's definitely not a piece of s*** that many IMDb reviewers call it.""TAOBBATED"" is a movie you have to watch at least 2 times just to understand what the heck is going on. On repeated viewings you will be able to notice many small jokes you might have failed to notice . For example I didn't understood why Doctor Lizardo (the main villain) destroyed the arcade game until I've noticed on third watch it was BUCKAROO BANZAI arcade game . ""TAOBBATED"" has a weird sense of humor –you either get it or don't get it. Some jokes don't really have a punch line (the watermelon) . Some are intelligent – instead of Green Berets we have Blue Blazers . I love : the billboard ""The future begins tomorrow"" , the John something aliases , ""No matter where you go, there you are."" , the coolest ending credits ever made.The cast is impressive with some future stars in it. Peter Weller (""Robocop"") gives a good performance as Buckaroo Banzai – modern Renaissance Man who is a rock musician/scientist/ neurosurgeon/action hero . He plays his character with dead-pan seriousness , which gives good comedic effect , considering all the crazy things going on. He breaks it few times (his subsequent detection of the sinister Red Lectroid agents , every scene with Penny). Ellen Barkin (""Sea of love"") is hot in every outfit she appears and she has great chemistry with Weller. Jeff Goldblum (""The fly"") is good as the mild mannered sheriff. Christopher Lloyd (""Back to the future"") is fun as the arrogant John Bigboote. The true star however is John Lithgow (""Cliffhanger"") as Doctor Lizardo, twisted fascist alien. I love his voice , his Italian accent , his facial expressions. He's a scene stealer with his over-the-top performance.The plot is quite innovative. Inter dimensional alien invasion theme in contrast to aliens from outer space which has since been overused many times feels very fresh. Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch is full of dry humor and action. Director WD Richter obviously directed ""Buckaroo"" to be a cult movie. Music by Michael Boddicker is really good. Atmospheric and upbeat works well for this comic-book like adventure. I love the ""Buckaroo Banzai theme"".The bad things ? The Hong Kong Cavaliers . With the exception of Jeff Goldblum they are rather bland characters . Not really interesting for the viewer , because the filmmakers never explored their personalities. This is a very low-budget movie. The Red Lectroid bivouac was actually an abandoned Firestone tire factory. It does look a bit dated with it's costumes and set designs. The dialogue sometimes can be incredibly heavy on the techno babble attempting to explain the science of the film. The love story isn't given all that much time to develop.A sequel was planned called ""Buckaroo Banzai against The World Crime League"" . A script written, but the funding did not appear after ""TAOBBATED"" bombed at the box office. The studio bankrupted . Too bad. I would love to see Evil Hanoi Xan (Buckaroo's arch-nemesis) and the cameo appearance of Jack Burton (Kurt Russell's hero from ""Big trouble in Little China"") ! I gotta look for the DVD - ""Pinky Caruthers Unknown Facts"" is a commentary that explores the universe of the movie and explains few things (the watermelon).This is a fine example of 80's film-making. It's a good movie to watch if you like strange , unconventional movies. I give it 4/10.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

Ellen Barkin's first appearance in the night club where her suicide attempt is misinterpreted as a assassination attempt is a example of the cynical detachment in which this film perceives life's unpredictable chain of events as either ironic or amusing. even the notion of particle physics seems intriguing but somehow funny.this film is also better sci fi than a lot would give it credit for. much of the sci fi that is offered up, especially these days on the Scyfy network, is neither realistic or probable speculation, i'm surprised at how grounded some of the science notions in 'Banzai' actually are. a lot of this film is typical 80's formula, aliens, evil villains, a cartoonish and matinée style approach to action sequences, and a reliance on big budget effects, but it's optimism about science and scientific research in undiscovered realms of existence and thinking, feels very much like the articles and covers of the 1980's popular sci fi magazine 'Omni'.mostly 'Banzai' is manufactured for silly fun. and that it certainly is. it is also one of the more off beat sci fi films from the 80's. too bad the film flopped and the studio never pursued a sequel like it had planned.

John Lithgow is the saving grace of this film, and his role is totally insane.From a cinematic and production viewpoint, this is not top-shelf. From a story line viewpoint, it's silly. Not that there's anything wrong with silly... if it's good silly. But this is camp that intends to be camp and fails. It's humor that sometimes kinda works but usually doesn't. It has one truly memorable line... and even in that ""No matter where you go, there you are"" just isn't all that funny. I'm sure some folks find it hysterical.

The truth is some people are going to love this... and a whole lot more won't even bother writing a rewiew. I love campy films, and sci fi camp more than anything-- if it's well done. This isn't well-done camp. The directing is disjointed and inconclusive. Overall it just sort of hits the end and... ends.The supposed ""secret references"" are often fictional.

Truth be told, most of the supposed ""hidden jokes"" in this film are more viewer imagination than reality.I really don't know why this became a cult classic. There's no denying that it did, nor that many people absolutely breathe this film. That doesn't mean viewers *have* to love it... or that anyone is stupid in declaring it ""not the best movie ever made""-- because it really isn't (not by a long shot).If someone loves this film... good on ya and more power to you. That doesn't mean that people who dislike this film are idiots. It means they demand a bit more in cinematic experience than ""let's throw stuff at the screen and see what sticks"". This *could* have been a great film. With a bit better script, a bit less cocky directing, and a bit more story this could have been an all-time great. Unfortunately it falls significantly short of that. Be a starry-eyed fanboy all one wants, this one needed a bit more polish.Some people think a man running around in a rubber Godzilla suit is the height of movie history. Other people... not so much.

33,artzau,A CULT CLASSIC!,9,8 July 2001,"My wife asked me the other day what is a ""cult classic?""  My reply was that it was a piece of art work that attracted a certain following which held the work was a ""classic,"" i.e., has all the attributes of something to be venerated.  The simple fact is, what is a classic to some, can be dog-do to another.  Ultimately, it depends what you like.  I like this film.  Why?  It is kooky, unpredictable, full of fun, does not take itself too seriously and has a lot of great people.  To begin with, there is pre-Robocop Peter Weller as the brilliant brain surgeon, rock star, scientist and spy, Buckeroo Banzai.  Lithgow is there too, having a field day hamming it up along with funny Christopher Lloyd.  Ellen Barkin and Jeff Goldblum also show up.  The scene where Lloyd flips off Lithgow is hilarious but my favorite takes place in the jail where Weller comes to rescue Barkin.  Now, bear in mind, I was teaching at the U. of Wyoming in Laramie, WY and saw this film at a tiny arts theater in that town.  When Barkin admits she's not only from Wyoming but from...Laramie...we all went bananas.  We knew why she was so traumatized!  But, hey, the line would have worked if I'd seen in it in Berkeley.  The quirky is always difficult to pull off.  There is a fine line between being off beat and off the track.  As one who finds teenage slice 'n dice films a proper substitute for an emetic, I enjoy the non-heros seen in the films of the Coen brothers, Guy Ritchie and Ridley Scott.  If these heros have virtue, it is often overtaken by their humanity.  The same applies to satire.  This film shows some very fine actors having a lot of fun.  The zany Christopher Lloyd has shown up time and again in amusing roles.  Weller has gone on to show he's a fine actor.  Ellen Barkin likewise has grown in her career.

37,cariart,Tongue-in-Cheek Cult Classic!,8,15 November 2000,"'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' nearly defies definition! A cult classic, this send-up of alien invasion stories, pulp fiction heroes, and adventure movies is a love/hate proposition; while I found it to be brilliant fun, many of my friends thought it was incomprehensible! One thing for sure...There is NO other film quite like it! Buckaroo (played with laid-back coolness by Peter Weller) is a Japanese-American race car driver/neurosurgeon/rock star/comic book hero who, with his rock 'n roll commandos, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, balances his time between saving lives, pushing the boundaries of science, troubleshooting for the President, and playing gigs in nightclubs. The film careens from one climax to another, scarcely allowing the viewer time to think (which, in a film like this, may be a GOOD thing!). Director W.D. Richter deftly keeps the tone light, although there is a heartbreaking death scene tossed in. Loaded with more imagination than any three films you can name, and a oddball sense of humor, to boot, 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' is a wonderful, wacky triumph, that challenges you to toss aside preconceptions, and 'enjoy the ride'! I HIGHLY recommend it!",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
38,Java_Joe,"Either you get it, or you don't.",9,29 September 2019,"Buckaroo Banzai is the very definition of a cult classic. It didn't do well at the box office, it got middling to fair reviews but it's developed an intense following over the years.It's strange, it's eclectic and it's absolutely wonderful. The script is clever, the acting is on point, John Lithgow steals every scene he's in. In short it's a masterpiece of weird.The story is of Buckaroo Banzai, a half-American / half- Japanese man of multi talents. He's a physicist, brain surgeon, race car driver and musician. He travels around the world with other similarly talented individuals calling themselves the ""Hong Kong Cavaliers"". And he's just invented the ""oscillation overthruster"". It's a device that allows you to travel through solid matter and emerge on the other side. Unfortunately a group of evil aliens want it to help free their trapped brothers and take over the world. It's rather deeply layered with a lot happening at once.It's simply a movie that defies description.

39,bregund,This film would never get made today,4,26 February 2018,"Well, I tried watching it again over the weekend. As you get older, some films you tried earlier in your life, and didn't like, begin to make sense. Some, like Sunset Boulevard, get infinitely better. Some, like Time Bandits, get worse. You start to see flaws where you didn't before, or touches of brilliance that had been hidden from your perceptions. For me, Buckaroo Banzai wasn't that great when it came out and still remains so, so it's comforting to know that some films remain consistent across your life. I don't understand what I'm looking at, I don't get the story, or why the characters do what they do, I don't get their motivations. I don't understand what the aliens want or what their plan is. What is that thing circling the earth? Why is Jeff Goldblum dressed like a cowboy? As a fairly astute consumer of films for over forty years, I'm accustomed to a certain degree of lucidity, linear progression, and clear presentation of ideas in my entertainment, and at every turn this film zigs when you expect it to zag. It's indefinable, which is fine as a standalone film that embraces irreverence, but the cost is confusion. I couldn't be alone in my assessment of this train wreck, given hollywood's current lust to remake everything under the sun except for this film. It's not entirely awful, however, with John Lithgow and his outrageous Italian accent, or Christopher Lloyd's ice-cold ownership of every scene he appears in.In another twenty years I'll watch this film again, maybe it will finally make sense to me.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

Richter and hearing of his association with Buck Bonzai, I finally made time to check this one out and see what all the cult fuss was.So if I like BTILC, I can totally understand a rabid fans loyalty to an overlooked classic. Hence, I won't trash on the Buck Bonzai people who adore this, because it had completely the opposite impression on me. A directionless mash-up of chaotic scenes (mostly chase) that involve a multi-faceted nuerosurgeon, a race of reptilian space crusaders, a troubled woman, and a mad scientist. There's lots of action, and pretty pictures to look at, but most of its ambitions lie in intentionally being incoherent. Like, ""Hey, this is kind of oddball, maybe the audience will take it for what it is.""Now, many have. Buck Bonzai is an eccentric mess of indiscriminate themes and antics involving part space opera and half governmental schtick. But its focus changes too often for the goal to be taken seriously.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is filled with long, boring still shots of inanimate objects and other things completely unrelated to the plot.  This movie features some of the most famous actors of the 80's and 90's - acting badly.  John Lithgow delivers a surprisingly stupid performance, and Jeff Goldblum plays - what else - a quirky super-genius.  Can you say ""typecast""?

This odd, quirky, derivative brand of David Bowie meets Doc Savage is the heart of what Super Hero adventures are all about. Naturally, there is an audience for hero stories that explore the dark sides of human character with the necessary gravitas, but an obvious point continues to be skipped and missed.Comic books and Comic Book movies are for FUN!'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Fun Dimension' would have been just as appropriate a title. There is a latent chuckle behind the introduction of every character and every outrageous situation. Besides that, more Pop Culture references that you can shake a Marshall McLuhan at in any medium.This is a visual feast calling all geeks and nerds front and center and to stand to post along with the Hong Kong Cavaliers. The plot is deliciously convoluted and complicated to the point of absurdity which is just the point. Buckaroo Banzai plays it straight while driving his Jet Car through a mountain with the aid of the 'oscillation overthruster' he and his mentor Dr. Hikita, admirably played by Robert Ito, have finally perfected. He inadvertently passes through the Eighth Dimension before coming out of the other side to Public Fanfare for his scientific breakthrough. Meanwhile, before you know it, Dr. Emilio Lizardo at the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane becomes aware of his success and the battlefield is readied for the Red Lectroids versus the peaceful Black Lectroids.Penny Priddy is kidnapped when the Red Lectroids invade Banzai's headquarters after being tracked down to Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in New Jersey. Priddy is tortured to reveal the whereabouts of the overthruster and in the end must be revived by Banzai applying the Kiss of Life. Our hero and his men succeed to avert World War III by foiling the machinations of Dr. Lizardo and John Bigboote', while the music rises to a cheesy swell on cue thanks to the musical score of Michael Boddicker.Peter Weller does a grand job as Buckaroo Banzai in a John Glenn sort of way, and Ellen Barkin delivers plenty of emotional fireworks as Penny Priddy. John Lithgow goes way over the top chewing the scenery as Dr. Lizardo, while Christoper Lloyd is suitably, fiendishly histrionic as John Bigboote'. Rosalind Cash makes an authoritatively hilarious John Emdall, leader of the Black Lectroids, as Carl Lumbly struts his stuff as her messenger, John Parker. The Cinematographers Fred Koenekamp and Jordan Cronenweth give the visuals a bright storybook feel, while Damon Hines as Scooter Lindley, son of Casper Lindley as played by Bill Henderson, leads the growing cast of heroes on a triumphant march through Sepulveda Dam, Martin Luther King style.While the end credits roll, we make a mental note that next time it will be BUCKAROO BANZAI AGAINST THE WORLD CRIME LEAGUE. We cross our fingers and hope we will have earned a place by then in the march.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
44,rparham,When cult classics go wrong,5,7 June 2006,"If there was ever a film to define the term ""cult hit,"" it is The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai. A box-office flop when originally released in 1984, the film nonetheless drew a significant following on video and cable, even to the point where a television series was pitched a few years back. However, the flip side of being a cult hit is that there is a substantial portion of the audience that is mystified as to what that small group of followers sees in the original material. I find myself among the ranks of those who look at Buckaroo Banzai and say ""Huh?"" Nonsensical, lacking in energy or humor, Buckaroo Banzai is pretty much an exercise in strangeness for strangeness sake, and that just doesn't add up to an entertaining time at the movies.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai focuses on the leader of an eccentric group of scientists/rock musicians, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, who travel throughout the country, play clubs and research particle physics as well. They carry weapons, drive around in a tour bus, and have a small army of volunteers, named the Blue Blazers. Buckaroo (Peter Weller) is a highly skilled neurosurgeon who gave up full time medical practice to engage in his eclectic lifestyle, and has, with the assistance of his surrogate father, Professor Hikita (Robert Ito), invented a jet car that can travel through solid matter by transposing to the Eighth Dimension. This is accomplished by a device known as the Oscillation Overthruster, designed by Hikita, which quickly becomes a much sought after item.It turns out that Hikita has been developing it since the '30s, where during an early experiment, his partner, Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), partially entered the Eighth Dimension and was possessed by a red Lectroid trapped there. He then managed to bring his fellow Lectroids to Earth, and upon learning of the successful test of the Overthruster, plans to use it to return to Planet 10, where his kind is from. Attempting to thwart this plan are black Lectroids, who team up with Buckaroo to fight Lizardo. At the same time, Buckaroo discovers the existence of Penny (Ellen Barkin) the twin sister of his dead wife, Peggy, which adds to his difficulties.If you can follow the above plot description, then congratulations, you may be able to decipher Buckaroo Banzai. However, the film's convoluted plotting will most likely prove off-putting to most audience members. In place of a coherent plot, Buckaroo Banzai would seem to want to jazz us with it's rather off-the-cuff, anything goes attitude, but it proves to create mostly indifference. The film wants to be a science fiction parody, theoretically sending up the genre, but it's difficult to determine exactly what it is parodying. A lot of the scenes attempt to be funny, but they fail to be. Screenwriter Earl Mac Rauch and director W.D. Richter have decided to treat this movie like darts tossed at a wall: throw enough and something is going to stick. Yet, in the end, nothing really does, and the endless collection of disconnected ideas proves almost distracting, not fun.The characters are also rather non-existent. Few of them make much of a distinct impression; most are just surface glitter, distracting us with wackiness, while lacking much of a core underneath. Who really is Buckaroo Banzai, or any of his co-horts? Peter Weller turns in a performance that could best be described as indifferent, breezing through the movie with the same basic expression and even level of energy. Jeff Goldblum is entertaining as one of his sidekicks, dressing up as a cowboy, but there isn't much outside of the outfit. When a character close to Buckaroo dies, there isn't a tear to be found because we barely know him. Also, the relationship between Buckaroo and Penny is almost nonexistent, and there is no chemistry between them to speak of.On the villainous front, John Lithgow turns in an acid-addled performance as Lizardo, but again, it's just over the top weirdness that fails to be very engaging. The character is saddled with an Italian accent that makes dialogue difficult to decipher at times, but even when you can, it's just not funny. The rest of the villains are filled out with veteran character actors (Christopher Lloyd, Dan Hedaya, Vincent Schiavelli), but they are just random bodies in the background.There are countless individuals who worship at the throne of Buckaroo Banzai, and there are more than a few cult films that have proved to be enduring entertainment (W.D. Richter's next writing assignment, Big Trouble in Little China, among them). But Buckaroo Banzai does not pass muster, proving that occasionally cult status is not a good measure of quality.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

Like the man himself, part musician/scientist/good guy in a pinch, this film falls into the cult status simply because it is too good to be anything else. Facing war in the 8th Dimension by an invasion of the world from a species of electroids all named John (Big Boote, Warfin, Parker, Ya-Ya, Small Berries, and so forth) from Planet 10, and who work for YoYoDyne Propulsion at Grovers Mills, NJ, Buckaroo must save the planet by sunset all the while making fun of everything and everyone with the straightest face in film history.

More subtle than Rocky Horror, more intelligent than any self-important Spielberg offering, and best of all, a showcase of the best costumes of the worst 1980s clothing styles including huge shoulder padded costumes worn by men and women.

64,drunken_critic,Hilarious fashion,6,9 April 2005,"This movie is like the cheesy MTV music videos of the 80's. It brought back flashbacks of mullet heads with thin ties and shiny suits. Why did every one dress like Duran Duran in this movie? Most importantly why did Jeff Goldblum dress like a cowboy? I don't know? Some people like cheesy movies and schlock, but this movie just annoyed me. The director couldn't hold a decent shot for more than 5 seconds. There were some visually stunning scenes of aliens inside a spaceship, but if you blinked you would miss it. He couldn't keep his camera on a shot, flashing back and forth between scenes. Also annoying was Buckaroo Banzai's group of friends. They seemed like a bunch of cocky morons. The only redeeming quality of this movie was a flashback to 80's style taken to the extreme. It brought back memories of people in Members Only jackets, parachute pants and big puffy hair. This movie is like a fashion time capsule. The most hilarious thing is people actually thought they looked good dressed that way back in 1984. It gave me a nostalgic taste of a time 20 years ago, and I am glad it is over.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
65,stiv-7,The cult movie of my generation.,10,6 October 1999,"I didn't get to see this one until it came out on video (for some reason Fox decided to dump it in theatres during the '84 Olympics), but I remember loving it for its out-and-out ludicrousness. It's a genuine cult movie, and I am a cult movie fanatic! Weller is great as Buckaroo, but it's the supporting cast who deserve kudos for pulling this off. Lithgow gives his best performance since Garp, and this obviously informs his portrayal of Dick Solomon on 3rd Rock. I caught it again a couple of years ago on video, and am dying to see this on DVD so its visuals can receive the sumptuous treatment they deserve (plus it'll get rid of the horrible anamorphic squeezing of the end credits). If you love stuff like Willy Wonka and other cultish films, do yourself a favour and check this out.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
66,dantown,A fantastic movie that just slays you,10,24 January 2006,"This is a ridiculous movie. It suffers from a ""deficit of exposition"". I have read the many negative reviews of this movie, and that is my Diagnosis.It does not follow a plot, from A to B to C to D, like a typical,predictable story.: The typical viewer wants a ""narrative"", which flows from one point to another, as many thousands of movies Do, and Should. For example, Shakespeare's Hamlet comes home, his Dad is dead, and his mother married the alleged fiend who did it. Hamlet must prove this foul deed was done by an evil man, and punish those who helped make it happen. Over five acts, Hamlet becomes a man, leaves his boyhood behind, loses his beloved mother-who betrayed him by marriage to a murderer-and ultimately, Hamlet destroys the kingdom, himself, and his rightful kingship.The play ""Hamlet"" makes me wonder at its timeless and ingenious beauty and its ultimate cruel and heartless end to a resplendently fine man. It is a crushing blow to me to watch it, or even think of it.Hamlet will live in me forever. It is a linear, understandable plot. Meanwhile, Buckaroo Banzai is an outstanding work of art which didn't get the Spielberg seal of approval. Or at least as I could imagine Spielberg-who directed the ridiculous and failed ""1941"": another challenging comedy, which has genius and failure in it. This movie Buckaroo Banzai is outlandish and beautiful. It ""suffers"", some may say, from a ""deficit of exposition"".The characters, the casting, the silly situations all shout to the viewer what a lovely work of fineness this is. Peter Weller is supremely well-suited to play a polyglot genius, Buckaroo Banzai, who battles the 8th dimensional goof balls, who seek galactic domination, or-whatever. John Lithgow is supremely gifted as a para-dimensional psycho with a good/bad Italian accent. This is the role of his lifetime. He not only chews the scenery, he digests it. Ellen Barkin is just supreme as the drunken lonely sexually hot suicide who finds meaning as an adjunct to the fine cowboy cavaliers who ride with Buckaroo Banzai. Jeff Goldblum, in woolly chaps, ten-gallon hat and bright double-breasted cowboy shirt is a SIGNAL moment in movie history. Oh wait- Jeff Goldblum IS HIMSELF a great iconic ACTOR who both RIDICULES himself, and then RISES above his own SELF-RIDICULE. He is an acting genius. This movie ignores Goldblum's fine acting moment, and scurries along to the next ridiculous scene. This is HUGE. This ""bad movie"" skips ahead to the next point: sorry pal, you just missed it. This movie is a narrative but with the exposition,connecting parts cut out-for a very good reason: It makes the movie an exceptional work of art, which will live as a model for many dozens of comedies to come. The dialog itself is a roller-coaster ride that never quite adds up-or does it? I couldn't decide. The movie presumes to decode the great mystery of Orson Welles, and well,does, or, whatever..... This is a beautiful movie, and a great gift. However silly it may be- this is a great movie.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
67,markkbranson,Enjoy this PostModern Romp!,9,21 June 2021,"I have seen ""BB"" probably 15 times and I love it. Let's see what it has going for it;(1) strong cast. We have Peter Weller as Buckaroo-multi-talented and fighting alien invaders. Weller is just super cool here and deserves applause for pulling this role off with just a slight smirk. Jeff Goldbloom is one of the many Cavaliers and he solves the riddle of the Orson Welles Mars invasion from 1938. Great fun to see Goldbloom in full cowboy dress! Ellen Barkin is the live interest and is simply wonderful. John Lithgow is simply a joy as an alien invader who has taken over his consciousness. And this list can go on and on.(2) great writing. Now this movie is not ""Citizen Kane"" but the story has wonderful post modern depth and self-referral (look for the comic book scene).(3) fun direction. Watch for the unravel of the aliens who look like every day Americans. This camera cuts are right in target. We see what the characters in the movie see: what better example of post modern film!To he frank, this film held up for me better than I thought it would. Other that Mrs. Johnson's big T-shirt and the obvious youthfulness of Weller et al, this doesn't seem nearly 40 years old.I hate there was no sequel/pre-quel as we get them today, but that might add to the shelf live if this movie. For a mind blowing trip to a comic book universe, switch over the Prime and indulge for an hour and a half. It is worth your time!",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
68,emguy,People Named John,8,17 September 2001,"I mean, you have to give some credit to a movie that makes it funny to know somebody named John, right? No spoilers here though - you'll need to watch the movie to find out why.It's a fun, quirky movie with the apparently simple goal of taking the viewer along for a fun ride. The movie is full of quick little throw-away lines, odd signs, and strange PA announcements you might miss if you assume they're just background noise for the scene (""There are monkey-boys in the facility"").The movie doesn't stop to explain much, so you need to pay attention (or just watch the movie more than once!). The movie hints at deeper backgrounds for each character. The Hong Kong Cavaliers, even the ones that don't get to say much, come across as good teammates with confidence and responsibilities of their own, not just as minor followers for the hero.The alien masks seem like they would have been too heavy and inflexible to allow any expression, but the masks retained enough features of their human counterparts to let you know which one's which, and the actors were able to convey mood and expression through the masks. Christopher Lloyd does a very good job, and I always enjoy seeing Vincent Schiavelli in a movie.One thing I've always liked about John Lithgow is that he seems never to play the same role twice. He looks like he's having a lot of over-the-edge fun as John Whorfin.A bit of trivia: A company called TGV (later bought by another company) made a software product called Multinet. The Multinet documentation used ""Yoyodyne"" as the hypothetical company that appeared in examples. I believe it used other names from Buckaroo Banzai as well.Sit back and let the fun happen!",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
69,mherrity,Closing credits,8,28 July 2020,Whether you are a longtime super-fan of Buckaroo and the Hong Kong Cavaliers or new to the experience.

70,cauwboy,Promises more than what it can give,5,11 July 2020,"So there are obviously people that loves this film, there are also those that don't like it at all. I'm somewhere between, the actors where fun to watch, John Lithgow as the mad villain and Jeff Goldblum as... well, same old Jeff. The film got this cult film vibe hanging over it, people that grew up with the film that have a close connection with it. As for me, I wasn't even born when this film came out, so I don't have that kind of connection with it. But I'm sure there are films I grew up with that I have a deep connection to that others consider trash, it's all from person to person.As for this film, the rolling text at the beginning paint up Buckaroo as a pretty fantastic person, but what we see is pretty normal stuff, even if we usually don't see a character run from a surgery to beating a record in speed with a fast car and then playing with his badass band. But yet it all feels so normal, and Peter Weller isn't selling his character as the kind of crazy genius that he is - he's very slow and cool and just not that wacky that I figured someone like that would be. It's more the characters around him that steals the light from him.And then there's the aliens and the plot. You have a problem when the good aliens and the bad aliens look the same, and the whole plot is just making less and less sense, maybe I wasn't focused enough while watching it, but I didn't really worry too much about any kind of character in the film, nor did I care about Buckaroo's love interest that turned out to just be a damsel in distress.As much as I love a wacky sci-fi, comedy, adventure, romance - this film just wasn't enough to satisfy me. But I fully understand if some people love it, the same way I love Flash Gordon, it all depends on when you saw it in your life.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

Take the current version of Doctor Who, give it guns, more eccentric companions and a tour bus instead of a police box and boom, you got Buckaroo Banzai and his band of Hong Kong Cavaliers. There is no doubt in my mind that the current Doctor Who series was almost entirely based on this film. The best part of this film are the trio of villains played expertly by John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd and the late Vincent Schiavelli. These guys are awesome. Vincent's dead, but goddamn it, we need more productions with John Lithgow and Christopher Lloyd together. The in- fighting between these characters is just a complete joy. Unfortunately the same can not be said for the good guys in this film. There is so little happiness to be found in this group as the tone is almost always somber despite the eccentricities of the main protagonists. Between Buckaroo Banzai trying to screw his dead wife's long lost twin sister, the gunplay (which just comes across as a letdown given the level of sophistication in the dialogue), the total nonchalance to which each team member performs their duty.

75,ociopia,"Exceedingly bizarre and original while derivative, campy and zany",10,17 October 2006,"One of my all-time favorite films that I will watch over and over again. In its time, the Rasta stuff was over-the top. For eye candy, Buckaroo and his gang are delicious. For just plain silliness, it can't be beat - well maybe it can but not in Sci Fi. Message - none. Purpose - to amuse. If you enjoy pointless fun, enjoy a great ""team"" sort of movie, and love sci-fi, then you will love this. It is sort of a ""Red Dwarf"" mixed with ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" type of movie but twisted with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid camaraderie and Bob Marleyishness ""what can any of this Rasta stuff mean?"" John Lithgow gives the performance that lets you know how he ended up Third Rock from the Sun. Peter Weller is great, as is the whole cast.

I remember seeing this in the theater with a bunch of friends when I was in college and it very quickly became an all-time favorite. When it came out on VHS, we would have weekly viewing parties.It IS weird, It IS quirky, and it is definitely an acquired taste in humor, but for some reason it also resonated with all of us back in the Big 80's. It's one of those films that you either get it and its aesthetic, or you don't. If you try to analyze like a film critic - yeah, it's not great.But the low -budget SFX, the throw-away lines, the silliness, and the total buy-in of all the actors make it completely enjoyable to watch and re-watch now 36 years later.Damn, I'm getting old.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

It's kind of like one of those Magic Eye Puzzles. You have to look at it with the right kind of eyes. Otherwise you'll just see it as a crappy 80s sci-fi spoof. But trust me, there's more there than meets the eye. Some of the jokes aren't obvious on first viewing, or the 100th for that matter.

I saw this in the theater over 20 years ago, and just finished watching it again (Feb 2007). Buckaroo Banzai was always designed to be tongue-in-cheek, and sometimes that goes over a person's head. I love the coolness of the movie, the breezy attitude, the corniness, the comedy, the heroics, the clever cast, the mythology, the music, etc. I mostly appreciate that the film tries to take us to a different world, both imaginary and somehow plausible. I recall reading a John Lithgow interview in which he stated Dr. Lizardo was his favorite character. I wonder if this is still true? This movie is for fans of quirky films, not for fans of Summer Blockbuster Generic Must-See Movies. If you are an average movie-goer, don't bother. Just rent your latest cineplex predictable DVD.

80,JimS_8686,"""What are you talking about man, some kind of Race War in New Jersey?"" - The President",10,16 March 2008,"The film opens with Dr. Banzai (Peter Weller), a brilliant neurosurgeon and scientist performing surgery from a remote location to correct an Eskimo's paralysis. The Jet Car is waiting outside - which may or may not allow him to break through into the 8th dimension with the help of his Oscillation Overthruster, an invention Professor Hikita and Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow) have been testing and trying to perfect for the past half a century. After the surgery, Banzai's experiment with the Overthruster proves to be a success. Later that evening, Dr. Banzai decides to unwind by performing live with those hard-rocking group of scientists, the Hong Hong Cavaliers, at a club owned by a fellow named Artie. Artie could care less about Banzai's scientific breakthrough, he just wants some music out of these characters. During the performance, a suicide attempt by a young woman named Penny Priddy (HOT Ellen Barkin) is thwarted by a clumsy cocktail waitress. She is apprehended immediately by authorities and taken away. The following day, Dr. Banzai springs her from jail cell due to the fact he believes she is his murdered ex-wife's twin sister whom she was separated from at birth.Life gets even more complicated for Dr. Banzai when he, along with the help of Dr. Sidney Zweibel (Jeff Goldblum), discover Lectroids by Planet 10 by way the 8th dimension invaded Grovers Mill, New Jersey 50 years before. Orson Welles' 1939 ""War Of The Worlds"" radio broadcast actually wasn't a hoax, Zweibel concludes. In the years since this invasion, the Lectroids - who look like regular folks to those who don't have the formula - have basically taken over a weapons manufacturer under contract by the D.O.D. and are in the process of planning global annihilation. Unfortunately the President, whose back is killing him, is oblivious to this fact as he leads a country crippled by a looming cold war with Russia. It's up to Team Banzai to take matters into their own hands, especially after the Lectroids abduct Penny and steal the overthruster which they would need in order to get back into the 8th dimension where they once resided.I first saw Buckaroo Banzai when I was in Jr. high during it's brief run at the theaters and am still quite fond of the film as an adult. Earl MacRauch's creative and original script is packed with exceptionally witty dry humor. Repeated viewings are a must in order to take it all in. It is no secret that this offbeat sci-fi adventure / comedy has developed a huge cult following over the years, and there's no doubt MacRauch along with director W.D. Richter made this movie with that intention.With this and RoboCop, Peter Weller should be proud of having appeared in two 80's classics. The rest of the supporting cast is great too. The underrated Clancy Brown shines in a small role as Buck's ill-fated counterpart Rawhide, and John Lithgow gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Lizardo / Lord Whorfin. One of the many great aspects of this movie is that you feel a real sense of camaraderie amongst the members of 'Team Banzai'.I must acknowledge that over the years I have recommended this film to several people and they came back to me saying it was one of the worst movies they have ever seen. This makes me appreciate Buckaroo Banzai even more. Orson Wells (the guy from the old wine commercials) has nothing on W.D. Richter. This is one of the top 10 films of all time.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
81,hawksburn,I've tried to like this movie for soooo looong...,3,4 August 2003,"This is a movie that I've tried again & again to like. It has all the 'cult' hallmarks, weird plot, bizarre characters, deadpan sarcasm....and aliens. Everything I'm supposed to like. But no matter how hard I try, I can't.
To tell you the truth I hadn't seen it since I was a teenager until recently. Then I thought there was something wrong with me. Was there something obvious I was missing that was inhibiting my understanding & enjoyment of it? Why wasn't I 'getting' it? As an (rather immature, depending on who you talk to) adult, I have to say, this pic is junk.
To say that actually p***es me off, because I like most of the cast in it, and basically with John Lithgow playing a mad scientist possessed by an alien from the 8th dimension, how could you go wrong?!?! If anyones perfect for a part like that it's him!!! The scene at the beginning where he attaches electrodes to his tongue & ears is pretty funny, but unfortunately there's not enough of that mugging in the rest of the movie which I'd suggest if given free rein he would've played to the hilt. As it is, he's still the most memorable and enjoyable character in the whole thing.There's something inimitably cheesy about the whole enterprise, but the parts are so downplayed as to give the viewer no interest in the characters whatsoever. Basically Buckaroo comes across as a bit of a wanker really. A 'dick' would be another apt description. ""Penny Pretty Annoying"" would be a better name for the token chick as well.There was supposed to be a sequel for this, but given it's box office perf that didn't eventuate. That disappoints me because I thought the material in another directors hands might have made a hugely entertaining sequel (i.e Austin Powers vs Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me).

83,kensai-5,A warning to anyone expecting an entertaining movie!,3,22 February 2007,"Well...You cannot disregard the attempt that was made by the producers. Especially not since they were even partially successful, depending on who you ask. You ask me, the movie failed.According to the IMDb, W.D. Richter has only directed one other movie, and it is comforting to know that he is aware of his shortcomings.It seems this was supposed to be an unusual, over-the-top science fiction movie, relying strongly on interesting characters and a subtle humor. And, yes, it was unusual. Over-the-top, too...but unfortunately not quite far enough to keep all of the audience awake. The characters...well...You can still grasp what they were meant to be like. It is possible to imagine an interesting story with these characters, given the room to display their depth and with a director who is better at storytelling. But in the given case, it is rather difficult to develop a caring for any of them, for what we mostly get to see are boring dialogs, completely at a loss of any emotion, and some cheesy action scenes, that I have seen children play with more suspense. There is no thrilling action and not any worthwhile performance. So what is there, other than a cheesy story?...Now, most of the people who disagree with me, seem to break the movie's fun-factor down to the incomparable humor it has. A humor so dry and ingenious that only the most imaginative and brilliant-minded people can comprehend it. (And those are, of course, only a select few that, as some people in the message board said, can only be found in the USA. I guess if I do not believe them, their nuclear scientist of a president is proof enough.) It is kind of strange that many, in the defense of this movie, are trying to sell their ability to laugh about it, as something special, like a gift, or a sign of genius. Well, yah, I assume that is how those people feel who are laughing about the cream-pie-into-face-joke...after hundreds of viewings, again and again. Discussing the quality of one's humor may be equally senseful as fighting over the best color, though...My impression was that the humor in Buckaroo Banzai wanted to be something special. But it turned out to be only blunt, due to the lack of passion that is evident at all times. Jokes that wanted to be witty left me with a sober aha-reaction, as the actors never seem to grasp what it is they are doing, or are supposed to represent. Most of the jokes were overly obvious, and when I did not laugh about them it was not my lack of understanding, but quite the contrary. I had the feeling of watching a cream-pie movie with robots as the main cast. Buckaroo Banzai can be very enjoyable for children. It must be fascinating for a child to see this weird scenario. And it seems likely that this joy sticks to you until adult-hood, like a fond memory. There are 2 actors in the movie who actually feel enjoyable to watch. Mood-wise, Jeff Goldblum and John Lithgow seemed to convey what the movie should have felt like: slightly over the edge (Jeff) to outright crazy (John). John Lithgow is more convincing in ""3rd Rock from the Sun""...He eventually realized how strange his performance must have seemed in relation to the passionless acting of the remaining Buckaroo cast. Jeff Goldblum was, at that time, always fascinating to behold.Regarding Peter Weller...Well...You can tell why he was cast as the lead in ""Robocop"", after seeing him play Buckaroo. It is somewhat similar to watching David Carradine (""Kung Fu"", the series)...Actually, I believe Kermit the frog has more facial expression than either of the two...and come to think of it, Kermit may have starred brilliantly as Buckaroo. Peter's faulty acting was probably desired by the director, though.If you ever liked Ellen Barkin, and you want to hold any respect for her, it might be a good idea to not watch this movie. That she received more roles after starring in this one, must be credited to her strong screen presence. Somehow you cannot take your eyes off her... And, oh my...in this movie, that was a really painful experience! She either was the strongest indicator for the inability of the director, or she took all of her acting classes after this movie! Actually, my bet is on the combination of both.There is no point in watching this to see Christopher Lloyd as he is mostly disguised (eventually he is glad about that, today) and hardly gets any chance to perform.My favorite scene was actually the end, which leaves the main troupe of heroes walking senselessly around a void but kind of weirdly beautiful area. They are just doing that, for a couple of minutes...and it was the only part of the movie I truly enjoyed! I recommend watching just these last 5 minutes (which are actually the credits, so this is not a spoiler, mind you)! But do not expect the rest of the movie to be this charismatic.

I was wrong. It is still unwatchable. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of campy, bad, B movies, but this thing is unbearable. It's not even a good ""bad"" movie (no cheescake or obvious production gaffes or inadvertently funny dialogue). No, this movie is rambling, pointlessly oddball, plotless, and just too too long. Just a lot of odd characters, some of them in rubber suits, and agonizingly slow action and dry, overacted dialogue. It takes forever to get going and then never goes anywhere. As I watched I wanted to recut the film and excise all the extraneous fat, though I don't think that would help much--there would be nothing left. You can't fix a film like this; you just have to start over.So, unless you're a white male geek between the ages of 18 and 30 who hasn't had a date in years (you know who you are), this film likely won't be for you. From what I can tell, the geekier a guy is (socially backward, nerdy sense of humor, etc.) the more likely he'll enjoy this movie.
The first time I saw Banzai was in the theatre I wasn't the one who drove so I had to stay--I was ready to leave 10 minutes into the show.  But this time on TV I had the remote and when I couldn't take any more, I happily switched to another channel. Ahhhhh. . .Don't say I didn't warn you. . .",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
87,joave,Still waiting for the sequel,8,6 November 2000,"A super sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but  also doesn't get out of hand with being too ridiculous. The characters are extremely well played and the idea of the movie is unlike anything I had seen before. Men in Black and Matrix probably borrowed some of their ideas from this movie - it is fairly obvious. The credits are some of the most memorable and enjoyable I have seen. It also mentions a sequel, but apparently Buckaroo had better things to do, like become Robocop!",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
88,Rastacat1,Too much fun...,10,23 October 2002,"I quoted lines from this movie for years. My old recorded VHS copy has worn out after years of repeated viewings, so I am thrilled that it is now out on DVD.The outlandishness of the main character and the far out plot seem on paper to be too much, but director WD Richter and the excellent cast pull off one of the greatest feats (in my opinion) in cinema history: Making a movie that really does defy pigeonholing into any genre or category. It is a pulp comic book, serial adventure, sci-fi, action-comedy movie with a dose of romance thrown in. John Lithgow's over the top performance as Doctor Lizardo and Peter Weller's superb job as Buckaroo along with the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum and scene stealing steamy innocence of Ellen Barkin help make this a true classic and one of my favorite movies of all time. The closest movie I can compare it to is another one of my favorites, Big Trouble in Little China.For those who have not seen the movie, Buckaroo Banzai is a world famous Neurosurgeon, rock star, comic book character, rocket car driver and scientist. He also has his own organization of boy-scout like groups called Blue Blazers. His band, The Hong Kong Cavaliers, are a group of top scientists and all around good guys with very distinct personalities. Penny Pretty is the love interest of Buckaroo, who also happens to be his deceased wife's long lost twin sister. There is so much going on in this movie that I probably saw it three times before I totally understood the whole story. Which in a nutshell is: Black Lectoids = good. Red Lectoids = bad. Dr. Lizardo is a Red Lectoid. The Black Lectoids have discovered that arch criminal Dr. Lizardo is on the loose on planet Earth and they threaten to wipe out the entire planet to make sure that he does not escape. They give Buckaroo 24 hours to capture or kill him before they put their annihilation plan into place. With his band and a few others, Buckaroo infiltrates the hideout of Dr. Lizardo and manage to set things right. I really could go on for pages on details on the story and the plot, but you wouldn't believe me. There is no way anyone could have gotten so much into a 102 minute movie. And do you know what the most frustrating part is? At the end they display to be on the lookout for ""Buckaroo Banzai and the World Crime Syndicate"". They obviously had plans to make another film after this one made everyone rich and famous. When that didn't happen (at least from this movie) that meant that the sequel didn't happen. The screenplay has been written for years and now and again talk comes up that all of the main characters needed for a sequel are interested, but still nothing has come of it.The disk is great with tons of extras including the segments ""Jet Car All Access"", ""Pinky Caruthers Unknown Facts"" and an alternate opening scene. There is another segment titled ""Buckaroo Banzai Declassified Documentary"" which is from the viewpoint that he is a real person. The writer and director also do a full length commentary and there are some other extras. Picture and sound quality are excellent. At around $15-20 this is one of the best buys going on dvd.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
89,eronavbj,precursor to Men in Black,6,22 December 2004,"Considering the success of ""Men in Black,"" Buckaroo should have at least been a moderate hit, in that it is no more or less strange and entertaining than that later sci-fi-alien-invading human cartoon. Buckaroo even has a better storyline (Orson Welles War of the Worlds broadcast of 1939 being genuine). Would Will Smith have made the difference? Perhaps a little more bathroom humor, a huge helping of added gratuitous violence, a female slapping all the men around, some thinly-veiled pejorative references to drug and tobacco companies, considerable sexual depravity and a homosexual hero would have elevated Buckaroo Banzai to the level of a neo-classic, a la Pulp Fiction.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
90,acts2120,Best viewed while wearing an aluminum foil helmet,10,17 September 2005,"This is the most bizarre movie I've ever seen - and it is one of my absolute favorites. The jokes are deeply embedded, and you have to pay close attention. The super-car that breaks sound (and dimensional) barriers idles when the ignition is turned off... the test code for the oscillation overthruster jet car is a spelling variation of ""signed, sealed, delivered""... The high-tech, alien-technology visi-glasses are made of pink bubble wrap...amidst the deafening screams of fans and the jazz playing horn section of the Hong Kong Cavaliers, Buckaroo hears one single person crying.... It's these bizarre little jokes are that make the movie great, but they are not every one's cup of tea.

Sure there is action. Sure there is adventure. But far and away what carries this movie over the top is its humor, some of which is in-your-face and some of which is so subtle you won't catch it all on one viewing.And even if you don't like the story line the casting is over the top. Weller, Lithgow and Barkin are superb. Lloyd and Goldblum are rarely better.Despite the bitterness of the Bansai haters, my prediction is that some day this will be considered a classic.

Greetings honorary members of the Hong Kong Cavaliers and to all you neutral observers and detractors as well. Hoping to clarify the mystery and purpose of this 1984 docudrama, I have scoured all available data (including movie reviews), scrutinized the musings of the film's director via the DVD's special features, and held extensive conferences with official representatives of the Banzai Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Strategic Information. I hasten to point out that my findings are inconclusive and that many questions remain. The film is (negatively) a rambling, disjointed pastiche of pseudo-hip, sci-fi/comic book inspired shenanigans that (positively) manages to generate inordinate amounts of charm and wonder through its fortuitous collusion of eccentric story line (battling aliens; a deeply depressed damsel-in-distress, (Penny Priddy); the actual Hong Kong Cavaliers honing their rock and roll chops; Buckaroo himself, pushing his new jet car- with the incredible Oscillation Overthruster -through the forbidding regions of the 8th dimension) and the glowing charisma of the actors at play: John Lithgow's Dr. Lizardo is hilarious and ingenious. W.D. Richter's nerdy persona obscures his inability to fashion Earl Mac Rauch's free-wheeling screenplay into a coherent whole. Still, the many facets of the story remain intriguing and Michael Boddicker's synthesized music is majestic and buoyant. However, the questions persist. What did happen at Grover's Mill in October of 1938? Was Orson Welles part of an invasion plot that involved mass hypnosis? Are there extraterrestrial biological entities living among us? Documentation outlining an thorough governmental inquiry into these matters has reached this commentator. A report by the investigators, special agents Mulder and Scully, shall be made available to the public in due course.

In  my old film club we rated films from 1 to 5, with 5 being ""mega-movie, kill to see"" and 1 being ""mega-dud, kill to see"" - this is a mega-dud.  It is exquisitely bad, taken just seriously enough that you really believe it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. It is even better than Doc Savage, MAn Of Bronze, and infinitely funnier than the remake of Flash Gordon.If you like sci-fi movies, hanker after the old days of Star Trek when the boulders were obviously polystyrene and the scenery wobbled, and you think Monty Python is funny, you will love this film.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

I understand awful brilliance in films like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes... and I understand that this film is simply a swing and a miss. As a serious film, I give it 2/10 stars. As a parody, I give it 3/10 stars. As a not-very-low-budget cult classic, I give it 1/10 stars.This film feels like an attempt at a semi-serious blockbuster sci-fi adventure that, when it went bad, they backpedaled to ""Oh, we meant it to be a parody."" Maybe there's some brilliance hidden in that but, no, it doesn't work for me. The film starts out interesting enough... but then it slips... and slips some more... and more... etc. The humor is spread thin and is mostly weak. By the time I reached the climactic scene, my mind was numb from all the bad directing and editing. If they were going for the most blah climax ever, they nailed it.It's too bad because there seems to be good potential here. Maybe a AAA editor could save it if all the original footage is still around -- but that's also assuming the director took some interesting unused shots -- which is probably too much to ask. The contrasts between Weller, Goldblum, and Lithgow could have been great but we see so little of it.It seems to me this is only a cult film because it is very divisive on the love/hate scale. I need more reason than that to like it on any level. I was a young teen when this movie hit but I didn't see it until 35 years later.

Those who love it are ready for a greater transformation in life.However, even better than the movie is the music. The credit score is perhaps the best ever written.

119,moxie-7,Cult movie or seminal?,8,4 December 2009,"There are, and always will be, differences of opinion about every movie. After reading the existing comments on this one I decided that one of the things causing those differences is the question of how many movies you've seen. I grew up in the 40s of the last century so I've seen an awful lot of movies. Maybe for that reason or maybe just because I'm a wacko, I tend to judge every movie at least partly for its relation to all the other movies I've seen.Take ""Buckaroo,"" for example. It came out in 1984 containing some elements suggested by ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) and ""Superman II"" (1980).On the other hand, its driving force shows up again in ""Men In Black"" (1997). ""Sneakers"" (1992) shamelessly copies one of its principal sets, the background of one of the characters, its technological McGuffin and one scene right down to the dialog.

I had ever loved this so much at a film this truly is one of the combine of science fiction and comedy in a unique way that had never done before like the other science fiction comedy movies that i loved.It fuses two cultures together with several disciples and throws in fascist aliens and mixes in with interdimensional fun for a awesome laugh.Welding the pieces together is a delirious, kinetic script by Earl M. Rauch.The film, although essentially a spoof of science fiction films and comic book superheroes, remains a delightful, inventive enigma of eighties cinema. The look of the picture is quite good, and (considering it's meager budget) highly-digestible. Given that the film never found a mass audience, it is surprising that so many individuals seem to remember it. substantial basics of storytelling and characterization is deemed imperative.

Great performances by John Lithgow and Jeff Goldblum in supporting roles.  Lithgow in particular is good as a scientist driven mad by the eighth dimension.

All other hero films (Tarzan, Superman, Batman, The Phantom, The Shadow, Doc Savage) already had their mythos firmly established in print: not so with Buckaroo.  They had to start at ground zero and explain everything in as little time as possible while giving you the film's own story: a very formidibal task.Then the money behind the pic got insulted.  He (whoever he is) felt that the theatrical release slammed him and was personally insulting: that's why the film was in the theatres for all of a week or so.  No PR, no theatre run time: miserable flop.I'm unapologetic: I think the story is great.  An fantastic take on Orson Welle's War of the Worlds radio broadcast, a truly all-star cast, alien Rastafarians, the jet car, some pretty good blue screen work on the cobbled-together Lectroid ship, and true love triumphing over death itself, not to mention one of the coolest end title sequences I've ever seen!  (I will fault the lighting on the parachute sequence)I think it was quite commendable, and a film truly worthy of the cult status it has attained with the science fiction fans.  I attend San Diego ComiCon every year, and every year I see Banzai t-shirts for sale along with all sorts of other merchandise.I only hope that the Fox series pilot is accepted, broadcasted, and becomes a moderately successful series, as that would give me a slight chance of someday getting the movie on digital media.Tanno Banzai!",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

Peter Weller lends a perfect, dead-pan seriousness to the very 'out there' proceedings, while John Lithgow chews up the scenery as the fiendish Dr. Lizardo. Ellen Barkin is particularly fetching as Penny Priddy, while Jeff Goldblum stakes out his turf with an engaging feverishness that is all his own. Christopher Lloyd takes a relatively low-key approach to his role and does well for it, allowing for Lithgow's extravagance. Welding the pieces together is a delirious, kinetic script by Earl M.

One criticism that makes this a less than perfect movie (although I rated it a 10 because it's just so way out there) is the audio track, which seems to be mixed way too low on my copy of the video, making it a struggle to hear what's being said over background noise, music, and tape hiss.

'Psuedo', because it is most definitely not serious about being 'Sci-Fi'. All of the 'science' is portrayed totally tongue-firmly-in-cheek. If you didn't get that with the ""baby bang"" reference from ""Doctor"" Penny Priddy during the press conference scene, well, then I'm sorry, but you're hopeless.If anything, this is an anti-Sci-Fi film. It's a spoof of all those 1950's-era Sci-Fi films where the incredibly bad science interpretation is played completely seriously. I mean, c'mon, the Overthruster tracking device with the UPS-truck turn-signal click should have clued you in that someone isn't quite serious here.What we've got here is a great romp with some future mega-stars having a great time. Lithgow's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Ellen Barkin is luscious in both that pink dress and her tied-up black skirt. That jail-cell flirtation scene... well, what more can I say? Those wonderful in-jokes: ""Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems"". YOYO-dyne? ""The Future Begins Tomorrow""... well, of course it does. ""Negative, we do not have crossover... we are over New Jersey. All is not lost."" Well, of course it isn't... or is it? (Born and raised there, Woodbridge Twp., sorry. To this day, my sister and brother-in-law live in New Brunswick, I'm not making this up.) If you own the DVD, as I do, then you probably know that practically nothing was created for this film. The Red Lectroid bivouac was an abandoned Firestone tire factory. If you ever did high-school drama, you probably recognized Lizardo's foot-pedals as an ancient lighting dimmer board. The spinning Styrofoam cup in the ""shock tower"" (an automotive term) takes the cake.There is so much going on in this low-low-budget film to laugh with, not at. If you watch this film looking not to trash it but to laugh with it, I think you will get far, far more out of it.I only wish they had been able to make the sequel.And finally, I originally saw this film when it was first released, in the Harvard Square cinema in Cambridge, Mass.

141,skydiver-5,Buckaroo Banzai is a cool name,10,4 February 1999,"Director W.D. Richter's THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is sort of hip, and kind of cool, but really isn't as good as it could be.It certainly starts out well enough. The opening credit graphics, and Music by Michael Boddicker, set a rousing tone for a grand, comic book style adventure.An opening story background ""crawl"", ala ""Star Wars"" lets us know about Buckaroo, played by Peter Weller (""Robocop""), and his mixed background (U.S. father, Japanese mother) his varied interests (neurosurgery, martial arts, particle physics), and the fact that he makes music with his off beat friends, those ""hard rocking scientists, The Hong Kong Cavaliers"".Without wasting time, Director Richter plunges into the action. At the salt flats, team Banzai prepares to launch its rocket car. The problem is, of' Buckaroo is not present and accounted for. That's 'cause multi-talented Buckaroo (Weller) is busy recruiting Jeff Goldblum (""Jurassic Park""), a top surgeon, who is performing an operation. After asking Goldblum to join his group, Weller inquires, ""Can you sing?"" Goldblum responds, ""A little... I can dance.""Soon Weller, dressed in a black, Ninja-style firesuit shows up at the salt flats. When Weller gets in the jet car, the film really takes off, literally and figuratively. When Weller goes off course, it appears he's going to slam right into a mountain. Instead, a blue beam from the jet car zaps the mountain, and then the jet car goes into the mountain. Instead of crashing, it enters a weird 8th dimension. We see a strange landscape, and unusual creatures, some human-like, some not. Soon, Weller and his jet car come out the other side of the mountain, unharmed. In this sequence, Richter and Director of Photography, Fred J. Koenekamp, really delivers the Sci-Fi excitement goods. This is my favorite scene in the film.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie never again reaches this level of fun and entertainment. The rest of the film is a mishmash of aliens, a mad scientist (John""Cliffhanger"" Lithgow at his most excessive) and a ""lost soul"" girl named Penny, played by Ellen Barkin (""Sea of Love"") in an early, non-impressive performance.The main problems lie with the Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch. His biggest mistake is that darn jet car sequence. The much acclaimed film ""Bullitt"" has its famous chase scene well into the film, which makes it all the more satisfying when it arrives. By contrast, THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI by having it's exciting jet car sequence first, gives filmmaker Richter nowhere to go but down.Another problem is the Hong Kong Cavaliers themselves. Other than Jeff Goldblum, they are a faceless lot, not very well fleshed out, and with little to do. Weller, as Buckaroo, is the whole show, and the rest seem like a Superstar's hangers on: perhaps important to him, but not interesting to the viewer.THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is like a Chinese dinner: an hour later you're hungry for a more substantial film. All you remember is the opening jet car scene and the cool music.THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI should be watchable for both undemanding Sci-Fi fans and the small fry, who may get a kick out of the aliens.

So odd that you might be rewinding at the beginning going, ""What the flippin' flapjack did I miss?"" You didn't miss anything, patient viewer, this movie is out to mess with your mind. I read once that the best way to explain this movie is to compare it to jumping in to the middle of a series of movies. You feel like this is Part 6 of something, since it doesn't start at the beginning. I like that explanation, so I'll leave it at that. You must have a blank, tabula rasa mind watching this.

Although the two have no plot material in common, the names of corporations and characters in the film are an obvious homage to the one of the writer's finest works. This film is hamstrung by poor sound quality, which makes it a bit of a challenge to watch. The nature of its humor (multi-layered and quite subtle) when combined with the slushy sound virtually guaranteed that it would fail in the theatre, but if released today might have made up the difference in DVD sales. I have seen the film probably 20 times and still notice new little tidbits of humor (hidden by the subtlety, not the sound). Lithgow is magnificent in it, Weller plays the cool guy to the hilt, and the surrounding cast is just a hoot. One of them just showed up on ""Lost"" which really pleased me as I hadn't seen him in other rolls in years. Buckaroo Bonzai is like the TV show Firefly -- if you're a fan you almost feel like a member of a fraternity or club. There's an inside edge to it that gets you excited when you run into a fellow Bonzai fan -- all the more intriguing because you get to compare notes on any jokes you may have missed. This film is just perfect for NetFlix. Request it, keep it for a month, and watch it four Friday nights in a row. You won't be disappointed.Sag.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
151,gonzo-thegreat,Buckaroo Banzai review,10,3 August 2012,"What is a cult film? Is it a movie that failed at the box office yet found an audience on home video such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Office Space? Is it a film that's so bad it's good such as Troll 2 or The Room? Or is a cult film just a movie with a rabid fan base that will throw out dialogue after dialogue and adorn rooms with odd memorabilia?Really a cult film can be all these things; the phenomenon of cult cinema has been around since the 50's with the infamously bad films of Ed Wood and it doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. The purpose of these reviews is to bring the weird, wonderful and downright insanity of cult cinema to you. The reviews will be broken up into the main review itself as well as quotable lines and oddest moments. Many will choose The Rocky Horror Picture Show as the ultimate piece of cult cinema, but really it's become so mainstream it defies cult films. The real king of cult cinema is the 1984 film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension.Film: The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension Director: W.D Richter Cast: Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is possibly the most nonsensical film ever to be put on celluloid. The majority of it doesn't make a lick of sense, the plot flies by without letting the audience really understand it, and we're just thrown into this world full of myth and science fiction and we just have to accept it. This is the beauty of the film, it just forces you to accept everything and enjoy it. Banzai is a melting pot of genres, a weird high-bred of action adventure, science fiction, comedy, satire, and romance and none of it makes sense yet it's a brilliantly original and enjoyable film.The plot follows the adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (Robocop himself, Peter Weller) a physicist, neurosurgeon, test pilot, and rock star who, along with his rock band/assistants, The Hong Kong Cavaliers must stop a group of inter dimensional aliens, lead by John Lithgow's alien leader, Lord John Whorfin trapped inside the body of an Italian scientist, in order to save the world. The film just drops you into all of this, creating an incredible myth surrounding Buckaroo and his band and intrigue among the audience about what exactly is going on.The beauty of the film (much like many cult classic) is that its flaws are also its greatest strength. The dialogue can be incredibly heavy on the techno babble at times attempting to explain the science of the film, and it can confuse the audience, but within two seconds there's some great joke or dead pan delivery made and we're sucked right back in. The cinematography isn't really all that spectacular, its flat and very colourful and really isn't great, but in Buckaroo Banzai it works because it makes the whole film look like a comic book come to life. That's the best way to describe Buckaroo Banzai; it's an old 80's comic book that somehow jumped onto the silver screen.The performances are all very solid in that great cult cinema way. Peter Weller is believably charismatic as Banzai, who delivers his lines with a deadpan that would make Bill Murray jealous. Banzai's Hong Kong Cavaliers include great eccentric performances by such actors as Jeff Goldblum playing a New Jersey cowboy, and Clancy Brown as Banzai's own personal narrator, Rawhide. The crown jewel of the film in terms of performances however, goes to John Lithgow playing the villainous role of Lord John Whorfin in the most over the top, insane way possible throwing out lines with an Italian accent that makes Super-Mario seem legitimate. It's a performance that will be forever remembered as one of the most brilliantly funny portrayals in cult cinema history.If the film has any legitimate flaws it's that we don't get to see enough of Banzai working with his team as they all seem like brilliant characters that just don't get enough screen time. The love story between Banzai and Penny Pretty (Ellen Barkin) isn't given all that much time to develop and could have been more interesting, especially with her being the long lost twin sister of Banzai's murdered wife.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension really is the ultimate cult classic, it bombed at the box office, at times it's so bad it's good and it has a rabid fan base that are still clamouring for a sequel. It's a must see film if you're a fan of cult cinema a truly brilliant piece of pop cinema that is so insane it works. Buckaroo Banzai is by far the weirdest film around and it's brilliant.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
152,ractajeno,A witty yet dry 'british stylized' comedy,7,5 June 2005,"If you like The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or Red Dwarf, chances are you'll enjoy Buckaroo Bonzai. It is full of subtle/dry humor and has an overall upbeat mood. The subtly dry humor is found in the background audio as well as the odds and ends that find their way into the set decor and dialog. These offer a nice array of silliness to punctuate the story with their own unique twists of humor.The cast is definitely All Star! Peter Weller (Robocop), John Lithgow (Third Rock from the Sun), Robert Ito (Quincy MD), Clancy Brown (Highlander), Ellen Barkin (Wild Bill), and Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) all have fun and amusing roles. Even the minor roles are covered well by perhaps lesser known yet veteran cast members such as Rosalind Cash and Matt Clark.If you're a fan of British humor, you should definitely enjoy this one, even though it may take more than one viewing to catch all the subtleties. If you haven't been exposed to this style of humor, this certainly isn't a bad place to start! If, on the other hand, this style of humor is not what you enjoy, it may not be the one for you. For everyone else, kick back and enjoy! If it weren't a bit of a cult classic, I doubt it would be available on DVD. I give it a 7 out of 10 since it may not be for everyone. Personally, I rate it a notch higher.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
153,jedit,A film that makes Manos look good,1,16 January 2005,"I kept hearing from people that this film was really smart and funny and cool and so on, so I gave it a whirl.My mistake. There's nothing resembling a plot or a joke, the acting is appalling and the half hour I watched before saying words I wouldn't say in front of my mother and switching off contained no redeeming features whatsoever.Why is this film worse than Manos? Because Manos had no budget and no professionals involved, is why. Buckaroo Banzai is on par with Manos in virtually every department, except that its cast contains normally excellent actors like Peter Weller, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd.If you die and go to hell, this film will be showing at the cinema. Avoid at all costs.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
154,FungusLord,Fantastic Cult Classic!,10,26 April 2006,"This movie gets the label of cult classic because it failed to cater to the mainstream taste buds of its time, but finds its circle of fans and keeps them watching it over and over again...slowly picking up new fans throughout the years.This movie which is sci-fi, comedy, romance, comic book, and other genres wrapped up into one has dry humor which one person wisely said (and I paraphrase) ""has a humor so dry you need lotion for it"". It has a physicist brain surgeon rock star named Bonzai Buckaroo.Anyone who is an 80's child like me, or likes to reminisce can appreciate the cheesy music and ""special effects"" of the time. It is definitely a movie for those that don't take themselves seriously and haven't lost the imagination of their inner child.I recommend it for anyone.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
155,straylight-2,watch it again and again,10,9 July 2005,"Some films I watch once-- I put many comedies in this category. Though, strictly speaking this is as much Sci-Fi as it is comedy. Other movies I'll watch maybe every blue moon and rarely, a few I'll see again and again. For me, this is one of the latter. It features an intelligent yet very funny script, terrific direction, contains enough details to bear scrutiny several times without revealing them all, and carries with it some extraordinary performances by some great actors. Pay particular attention to John Lithgow as ""Lord John Whorfin."" Fans of films like ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Big Trouble in Little China"" will definitely enjoy Banzai. If you're looking for an intelligent comedy this is the ticket.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
156,colin1mc,Parody at its best,10,1 November 2004,"Whenever viewing this gem, one has to also remember the times. Reagan's second term and after the first (and only worthwhile) Star Wars Trilogy (and what that caused to be brought forth). This movie took all that in and more; and spewed out a vomitus amount of seemingly incoherent information, doled out at a frenetic pace. How can we be surprised when Peter Weller does an excellent take on William Burroughs and soars in the lamented Odyssey 5 series, or Goldbloom does The Fly ( with a previous knowledge of webs with his role in lamentable The Body Snatchers remake)? The DVD will soon be part of my collection; for this is one movie (like Tremors) that bears up so well to repeated viewings.

157,TrthSkr1,Classic!,10,17 September 1998,"When I entered my vote for this film, I gave it a 10 for the simple fact that it is truly a classic.  Great campy sci-fi and humor, tons of stars-before-they-were-stars, fine example of 80's film-making!  I just love it!  (I actually own this movie on the old video disc format before there were VCR's and laser-disc players.)  One might say that the story and acting were cheesy, but that's what makes it great.  It's sort a joke on itself. If you haven't seen it yet, go rent it.  Especially if you like silly, low-budget, noble endevours.  Hopefully, it will have you laughing as much as I do every time I watch it!  There is nothing else to say except...ENJOY!",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

160,yasha-2,A disappointment that only shows after the first half-hour.,3,20 February 2000,"Oh, this movie was so promising when it begun! A hilarious story crawl leaves you anticipating a delicious romp through the cliches of alien invasion films. And at first it delivers, as Buckaroo Banzai (played rather woodenly by Peter Weller) demonstrates his gung-ho attitude and deviates from a test-run of a new, dimension-traveling vehicle - straight after performing neurosurgery on a desperately ill patient. He plunges through the eighth dimension - and a mountain - and emerges unscathed, if shaken.But when it cuts to a pub scene where his band - Buckaroo Banzai and the Hong Kong Cavaliers - play, the movie slides. Uninteresting plot twists develop, eventually going up the wall and out of any reason, and production quality seems to lose a few notches. John Lithgow plays a mildly enthralling mad scientist, whom we never see enough of, and a young Jeff Goldblum plays a new recruit for the Hong Kong Cavaliers.The premise of Buckaroo Banzai is well-thought out, but it seems the script could have done with a rewrite or two - interestingly enough, the credited screenwriter's other films aren't that well received at all. The result? It feels like an '80s bomb.A sequel would be interesting - something as absurd as this can be taken any which way. But *this* one went the wrong way. 3/10.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
161,mree,Delightful spoof of the sci-fi genre.,10,1 June 1999,"This movie is not meant to be taken seriously.  It is serious fun.  The cast is delightful and the story fast-paced.

But frankly, who cares. There a dead pan looks, sight gags, puns, bad costumes, and a list of stars that makes you blink twice trying to understand how they got these people to agree to do this movie. And that's the key - its just a group of people with a bad suits and wacked out lines trying to push the serious sci-fi concept out the window and have goofy fun with firearms and technology.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
163,Fratz,The world's best drug-induced product,8,17 August 1999,"The authors had to be under the influence of chemicals that are not normally present in the body (perhaps something from the 8th dimension).  It's a rare style of movie in that while the characters take themselves seriously, the movie does not.  This movie really makes no sense, but you don't want to watch it if it has to make sense.

165,virgil_goya,An aesthete's appreciation for the utterly absurd.,10,4 December 2000,"BB is a raucous, cult-classic action comedy.  In the tradition of Death Race 2000, BB was the ""1st"" installment of the world's greatest hero.  Buckaroo Banzai, comic book icon, brain surgeon, brilliant theoretical scientist, lead singer for the Hong Kong Caveliers (his band) and crime fighter et al battles against the Red Lectroids from planet 10 led by the evil Dr. Emilio Lazardo/John Warfin, played hysterically (and I do mean hysterically) by John Lithgow (in a performance that, at least in part, foreshadows the character he has gone on to play in Third Rock from the Sun).  The movie boasts an almost all star cast of actors and actresses that went on to considerable success and some others that are definitely recognizable as Hollywood character actors.  In fact, as one watches, one is amazed at all the faces that pop out and are recognizable.  A wonderfully playful farce with cheesy special effects and an absurd plot line, this movie stole my heart from the very beginning.  I'm especially fond of the ending credits and its silly, march-like musical epilogue.  This movie is stupid.  If you can't appreciate a stupid movie, then don't bother watching it.

I kept thinking that it was a joke and I would get it sooner or later, but I never laughed. I just kept staring at it and thinking what the hell is this.

On the other hand, all this may come as news to you. Many of you perhaps are not aware that any unresolved Buckaroo rights issues actually exist because you have quite reasonably assumed for years that MGM ""owned"" Buckaroo Banzai lock, stock, and barrel. Others of you, even after having read about the current rights brouhaha on many different blogs, may still be confused about the exact nature of the dispute. And, of course, some of you may just wish the whole problem would go away so that more Buckaroo Banzai adventures might appear.

176,PJ_Hoepelaar,A+ Classic with a twist,10,16 May 2011,"This is a movie that just doesn't seem to get enough attention. Just looking at the list of great actors that starred in this movie should be enough for any serious movie fanatic to become giddy with excitement, and rightly so.First of all, Peter Weller gives a stunning performance as the main character Buckaroo Banzai, an archetypical ""Renaissance Man"" whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas. A neurosurgeon, musician, quantumphysicist, and real-time action hero all rolled into one, he delves into the unfolding adventure in such a fearless manner that it makes our usual Rambo, Indiana Jones, or even James Bond characters that we are so used to watching seem wet behind the ears. Joining our main character there are the incredible performances of wellknown names such as Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, and Christopher Lloyd to name but a few.This in-your-face line up of top class actors gives the viewer the setup for a incredibly entertaining movie in which the action and comedy never seems to stop, never ceases to be interesting and more importantly: remains plausible. Because apart from it being great entertainment, it also provides a very real message that for its day, was years ahead of its time. The quantumphysical theme throughout the whole movie (I doubt whether the term 'quantumphysical' even existed back then) will carry on teasing the eager mind and will keep you thinking for a long time. Could it be possible that this movie provided the inspiration for other box office science fiction hits such as Back to the Future or even Clive Barker's Hellraiser? Same goes for the interdimensional alien invasion theme in contrast to aliens from outer space which has since been overused many times. But this science fiction/action/adventure movie does it in a way that grabs a hold of you and has no intention of letting you go for the rest of it's enjoyable ride. And neither do you want it to.I can somewhat relate to the criticism concerning the costumes and special effects. However, considering the cheap and simplistic costumes paired with the (sometimes) incredible popularity of a series such as Star Trek for instance, I truly believe the real science fiction lover will look beyond this and appreciate the overall atmosphere of the movie. Humanoid aliens may perhaps be a little less exciting than the CGI monsters in movies such as the Alien trilogy but hey, in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"" this just plainly isn't the case. We're dealing with Lectoids. And in this case, it's as real and exciting as it gets.Comedy lovers also get their fair share of laughs, as this movie is laden with the craziest situations and jammed with drywitted oneliners. All in all this is a very underrated movie that will never get old. Definitely a classic that everyone should watch at least twice.

But even though there are great actors in the movie (John Lithgow, Jeff Goldblum) the script tears the movie apart so much that I could barely figure out what is going on. I guess the coolest part of the whole movie is when Banzai goes through the mountain and comes out the other side. It makes you imagine if aliens are actually in other dimensions here on Earth.

Like when Buckeroo is in the jet car, the digital display flashes a pun sined...seeled...delivered. Hilarious? No, but makes a prop head like me smile, especially when I get the joke and someone else doesn't. Full of witty banter, and a must see for anyone with any intelligence.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
180,tstrej,"Sorry Pal, Everybody needs to see Buckaroo...",10,31 March 2005,"Memorable cast, bizarre humor, over the top performance by Lithgow... this is an essential must-see for any child of the 80s. This is basically a superhero film, with the protagonist Dr. Buckaroo Banzai playing a Batman type character allied with a group similar to the Justice League, who is a not only a Neurosurgeon, but an experimental physicist, a world famous playboy, crime fighter, and front man for an 80s boy-band (all revealed in the films first 5 minutes, this movie is not interested in long drawn out character development.) The frantic pace of this action packed masterpiece which culminates in a battle with Banzai allied with a Rastafarian space alien against the inter-dimensional villain Lord Whorfin, may be a little too extreme for most audiences.But perhaps Buckaroo Banzai is ahead of it's time. After reading the other reviews, possibly Banzai is still ahead of it's time. But whatever time this picture is right for, it is a time i wish i was in. This Blue Blazer highly recommends everyone to join Team Banzai, and rent this movie today.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
181,fireball_010,A sequel would have been awesome.,10,13 June 2005,"HOLY COW. I have only been around for 13 years now, and that was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I quote that movie almost everyday since I saw it, and hope to own it on video or DVD really really soon. Lines like, ""No matter where you go there you are."" and ""Give her your jacket"" - Buckaroo ""Why me"" - Tommy Prefect ""Because, your Mr. Prefect."" Buckaroo ""(pauses) You have a point there"" - Tommy, still crack me up. I would love to see the sequel the ""World Crime League"" but I guess some people don't have as good of humor as some of us. I guess it's to late to do that now, but man, It would have been one of my all time favorite movies. If your in for a good laugh, and can fine this rare treasure in some movie place, RENT IT, and if you like it, BUY IT.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

Stop watching after the excellent nightclub scene with Weller singing ""Since I Don't Have You"".
The rest of it sucks.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension

184,kovf2uluvk,Atrocious,1,27 August 2005,"This movie defies description. Some movies are bad enough they are unintentionally funny and hence watchable. ""Buckaroo Banzai..."" is not one of them. It tries to be a cute and funny spoof of B-grade sci-fi flicks but flops miserably. The laughs are few and scarce.I don't want to reveal any plot details but some of the references to other sci-fi movies are just plain tacky and it seems obvious (at least to this viewer) that the writers are trying too hard.There are tons of other truly funny spoof movies out there and the viewer would be much better off sticking to them. ""Doctor Strangelove"", ""Airplane"", ""Hot Shots"" (both parts), ""Naked Gun"", heck even ""Mars Attacks"" is much more watchable. Watch anything else but steer clear of the drivel that is ""Buckaroo Banzai...""",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
185,craygorfamily,A Unique Film,9,11 March 2006,"Fun, fun, fun. Disjointed, yes. Campy, with pride. Bad, don't bet on it. There are so many things going on that it can easily be confusing to a casual viewer, but in today's world where everyone has a DVD you can easily watch this film in your home numerous times with friends until you ""get it"" (like we did in the 80's, but when had to go to countless midnight movies).Now for those who get their kicks by rudely attacking this film. The are 2 kinds of people who don't like this movie. 1 - Those people on the lower end of the IQ scale (they don't have the mental ability to follow the numerous characters and their story threads). 2 - The people who are actually intelligent, but take themselves (and movies) too seriously.Remember, it's not a movie, it's a ""docudrama"".Support Dr. Banzai, visit www.banzai-institute.com",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
186,shayannjarm,This is the most amazing thing I wish I'd never seen,5,28 July 2018,"Surreal, confusing, non-sensical, great actors, plot holes.. Sci-fi? Parody? Pastiche? Comedy? Action? Drama? Romance? It's all and none of these; it's a cluster of the most indescribable nonsense which only occasionally attempts to make any sense, with a group of actors so talented that character development is meaningless, and who are so dedicated to the film's own lunacy that I can't help but revel in every moment of it's loosely structured plot and ambiguous storytelling. I don't know what I just watched, and I hate myself for loving such a complete waste of time! 
I'm currently unable to either confirm or deny whether this movie is worth watching. Honestly..
It defies explanation.
That is all.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
187,fiatian,A cult sci-fi classic !,8,20 February 2006,"'Buckaroo Banzai' is a classic 'B Grade' sci-fi movie with the added bonus of clever dialog, an interesting premise and a cast that includes actors who went on to become famous. Recommended to me by a friend, it took me a couple of viewings to get my head around what was happening, after that I was hooked. The concept of aliens invading earth and living amongst us is not new but the way it is dealt with in 'Buckaroo' is truly unique. It also explains why most odd people you meet are called John. The other thing I like is it doesn't take itself too seriously - they know they're doing a cheesy alien invasion flick & they're proud of it ! Yes; it has some clichéd lines, the clothes and hair styles are hopelessly 80's but this movie has remained a firm favourite for 20 years and I really can't think of another that can match it for concept and execution until 'The Matrix' came along.",The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension
