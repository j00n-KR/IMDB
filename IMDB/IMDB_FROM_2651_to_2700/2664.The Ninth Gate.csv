0,Leofwine_draca,Well crafted horror/thriller combo,8,31 August 2011,"Polanski's engaging devil-worship chiller is lush with a rich Gothic atmosphere and style to spare. The storyline is deceptively simple: bookseller Johnny Depp is tasked with tracking down copies of an ancient text believed to have been written by Satan himself. He soon finds himself menaced by dark and mysterious forces and discovers that nobody can be trusted. Although the film's nothing to do with the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, I found its depiction of sinister mysteries and ancient books to be extremely Lovecraftian in tone.It's a film with plenty of mystery and little solution. If you watch it waiting for a big ending, you'll be disappointed: the pleasure's in the journey rather than the denouement. Nonetheless, Polanski shoots his film just right, and employs a wonderful orchestral score which adds to the atmosphere no end.Depp's on solid form as the brash, rather unlikeable protagonist and Frank Langella delivers a powerhouse supporting turn. There's also Mrs Polanski, Emmanuelle Seigner, in the role of an ally not dissimilar to the one in Frantic. Bypass the occasional missteps – the jarring use of wirework in one sequence is a big mistake, and there are other cheesy moments – and instead relax and soak up the atmosphere.",The Ninth Gate
1,SnoopyStyle,"No tension, lackluster ending",5,10 October 2014,Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is an unscrupulous NYC rare-books dealer. He is brought in by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who specializes in collecting books on the Devil. He has just acquired the 1666 Aristide Torchia's The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows from the collector Andrew Telfer right before he committed suicide. Aristide was burned by the Inquisition along with his books except for three surviving volumes. Balkan is convinced that only one book is authentic and hires Corso to find the other two to determine if his is the one. A correct reading of the book's engravings is reputed to raise the Devil. Corso is skeptical especially since Balkan allows him to take his book. Andrew's widow Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) wants to get the book back. There is also the mysterious girl (Emmanuelle Seigner) stalking him.Director Roman Polanski returns to the supernatural with much less success. The premise of books which could raise the Devil is interesting. However the movie has no tension. Johnny Depp is a pretty compelling lead but the quest lacks the required excitement. The start is pretty good but the movie slowly deteriorates. The movie does have some spookiness like a musty old book store. The ending is so underwhelming that I lost any feelings for this movie.,The Ninth Gate
2,claudio_carvalho,Meeting the Devil,7,22 November 2012,"In New York, the money-driven dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare-books expert and partner of Bernie (James Russo), who owns a bookstore. He is contacted by the renowned collector of books about the devil Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), who has just acquired the rare The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows from the collector Andrew Telfer, to verify whether his book is authentic or a forgery. Balkan explains that the book was written by the writer Aristide Torchia, in 1666, with Lucifer and he was burned at the stake with his entire work. There are only three exemplars of The Nine Gates and in accordance with the legend, its nine engravings form a riddle to conjure the devil.The skeptical Corso accepts the assignment and has to flight to Sintra, Portugal, and Paris, France, to contact the owners Victor Fargas (Jack Taylor) and Baroness Kessler (Barbara Jefford) to find the genuine exemplar for Balkan. Meanwhile, he asks Bernie to hide the rare book. Before traveling to Europe, the widow Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) wants to retrieve the book and has sex with Corso, but he does not accept her offer. When Corso goes Bernie's bookstore, he finds his friend murdered in the same position of an engraving.Corso travels to Toledo, Spain, to meet the Ceniza twin brothers and learn more about The Nine Gates. During his journey in Europe, Corso is pursued by Liana and her bodyguard, who belong to the sect The Order of the Silver Serpents, and is protected by a mysterious Girl (Emmanuelle Seigner) with supernatural powers. Meanwhile, the owners of the two other exemplars of The Nine Gates are murdered. Corso becomes obsessed with the book and discloses the truth about it.""The Ninth Gate"" is a great movie with a confused conclusion that is not clear. There are many messy interpretations, but mine is very simple: neither the skeptical Corso nor the Girl is the devil. Corso becomes passionate with The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows and is protected by a supernatural creature. In the end, he succeeds in summoning the devil and The Ninth Gate opens to him and he will meet Lucifer. Just it! My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Último Portal"" (""The Last Portal"")",The Ninth Gate
3,gavin6942,Polanski is in Top Form,8,13 December 2010,"Book detective Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is hired to track down two copies of a book allegedly written by the devil himself, as a third owner thinks his copy may be a forgery. He travels to France and Portugal and anywhere else he must, but you never know where you may end up when you're tracking the devil... could be very dangerous.The movie stars crowd favorite Johnny Depp alongside cult favorite Frank Langella. I suppose Depp could be called a cult favorite, too -- a big star now, he has done his share of horror and weird flicks.Polanski is very concerned about ""physique"" when casting, which is why he wanted Johnny Depp and the actor in the opening scene (who was not an actor at all, but a production designer).The film is fantastic. A bit long, but not boring -- it has a steady stream of suspense, a solid plot, some intrigue, and you want to know more... Polanski excels with Satanic topics. It is very much, plotwise, a precursor to John Carpenter's ""Cigarette Burns"". (I have never heard Carpenter acknowledge this, but he must have known of this film.) Props to whoever decided to have Depp smoking Lucky Strikes, the most classy of all known cigarettes. That really adds to his character's tendencies to add a refined mystique to his exterior, while maintaining an impoverished home life.The DVD features commentary from the legendary Roman Polanski. His English seems forced at times, but do not let that take away from the rare opportunity to hear from the master. Never mind the fact his voice gives out after a while from eating too much chocolate and smoking a cigar.This movie is really quite amazing, and it makes me want to read the book it's based off of, ""El Club Dumas"", though I truly wonder if it could be better.",The Ninth Gate
4,lee_eisenberg,"nine gates, zero sense",4,1 May 2006,"Maybe it's just that Roman Polanski has made so many good movies that we expect too much from him. Most of ""The Ninth Gate"" is pretty interesting, but the ending makes no sense. Johnny Depp, as a rare book collector who uncovers a satanic plot, should have been able to make much more of the character. Instead, the movie doesn't really explain anything.Granted, the movie wasn't a total waste. Those two guys in Portugal were neat. As it is, any movie about satanism should be neat. But this one just never really makes the most of its potential. Most of the people involved have done better than this, especially Depp and co-stars Frank Langella and Lena Olin.",The Ninth Gate
5,jboothmillard,The Ninth Gate,4,29 October 2007,"When I saw the advert for this, I thought it would be quite interesting, but I don't think it's a film I'll be seeing again, from director Roman Polanski (Chinatown, The Pianist). Basically Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare books expert and dealer, and he is seen by rich book collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who hires him to validate his newly purchased copy of The Ninth Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows by 17th century author Aristide Torchia, one of only three that exist. The book supposedly summons the Devil, and Balkan claims it is a forgery, he has hired Corso to find the other two copies, and find out if it is genuine or not. So as you'd expect, the film sees him travelling a lot, finding the two books, and spotting the differences between them and Balkan's copy, this is probably the only interesting bit in the film. I could hardly concentrate towards the end, and I can see what the critics mean by a disappointing hallucinatory climax, for example, Corso and Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) having sex on the grass in front of a burning building, I must have missed him going through the Ninth Gate. Also starring Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl, Barbara Jefford as Baroness Kessler, Jack Taylor as Victor Fargas, Tony Amoni as Liana's Bodyguard and James Russo as Bernie. I can't believe I waisted just over two hours of my life to watch this film, I mean it was okay in places, but definitely not as good as I'd hoped. Okay!",The Ninth Gate
6,ccthemovieman-1,Proves You Don't Need A Ton Of Action To Make A Good Thriller,9,9 November 2006,"What makes this movie rather unique in this day-and-age is to see a horror- occult movie that has very little action. That may turn off a lot of modern-day viewers and critics but I thought it was refreshing.....as long as the story could still keep one's attention, which it did. It also did it with a pretty long movie: 133 minutes. I have played this movie several times for friends and no one has gotten bored.The attraction is (1) decent acting; (2) some great sets; (3) an involving story; (4) interesting characters and (5) low profanity.What keeps most viewers interested is simply wondering what is going to happen next in ""Dean Corso's"" (Johnny Depp) quest to figure out the hidden message. Without giving anything away, this is a classy, solid thriller.....and more importantly, fun to watch.",The Ninth Gate
7,rmax304823,A thriller about bookworms!,6,12 July 2009,"Frank Langella is a wealthy collector of rare books who hires expert investigator Johnny Depp to travel around France and make sure that his, Langella's, copy of a medieval book is authentic by comparing it to the two other copies known to exist.The content of the book has some sort of supernatural significance. As Depp probes into the other copies he finds that all three are identical except for some discrepancies in the nine illustrations. Most of the illustrations carry the initials of the historical artist, but scattered among the existing pictures are slightly different illustrations signed by ""LCR"" -- or ""Lucifer."" It emerges that an examination of the Lucifer illustrations leads (somehow) to a ritual that will enable the successful puzzler to enter the Ninth Gate and become all powerful -- or something. Yes, the plot is odious, an imitation of the cheap garbage that now fills our screens. They have names like ""Night of the Demons"" and ""I Dismember Mamma."" What those cheapies don't have is style, and this one does.There's not a car chase or an exploding fireball in the whole movie, and only one gun shot, which is a bloodless mercy killing. Now, that's a refreshing fact in itself. This is a thriller based on character, everyday incidents, and mooning over musty old books, and it works.I was grateful too for the absence of supernatural special effects. Granted that Emmanuelle Seigner's strong-jawed face and hypnotic, feral, and almost horrifyingly beautiful cornflower blue eyes, sometimes takes on a demonic aspect, but that's it. All the events we witness could actually take place.All the events except one. And that's the last one. Depp solves the final puzzle. Don't ask me how, but one of the illustrations has a naked babe riding some kind of monster, the babe resembles a 17th-century version of Seigner, and that opens up the Ninth Gate for Depp.On the other hand, Polanski's work has always had one feature that has sometimes weakened the whole work, and that's a surprise, usually tragic ending, a final bitter twist. He was into tragic endings long before the Manson affair. ""Rosemary's Baby"" involved devils before the flesh-and-blood devils destroyed Polanski's family. Even a comedy like ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" ended disappointingly in an unamusing way.The last shot is of a figure we presume to be Depp walking through the portals of a blindingly back-lighted château. I couldn't figure it out.What I enjoyed most was seeing the troglodytic Johnny Depp wandering around Paris in his extra-long overcoat and poking into musty old book stores with comic proprietors, or into private collections in the hands of oddly eccentric characters who have monstrous lesbian secretaries.What I enjoyed second-most -- and this is a confession -- was watching the wild-eyed Frank Langella convincing himself that he has solved the puzzle of the illustrations, has become immortal and pain-free, then setting himself ablaze and finding out that he was WRONG. I don't usually laugh at full-body burns but I was expecting some computerized imaging to transform Langella into a Disneyoid manticore and, instead, here he is, running around yelling and brushing at the flames just as the rest of us mortals would! Langella is pretty good, by the way. Depp is required to be polite and introverted. (That is, he doesn't act like an American.) Seignier is given a lot of attention, but I never could figure out her role in the story.Not bad overall. Perhaps better than that, if you catch it from the beginning, as I did not.",The Ninth Gate
8,ma-cortes,"Mystery, suspense and terror with a cool Johnny Deep and well directed by Polanski",6,30 October 2008,"The books-sleuth Dean Corso(Johnny Deep) is contracted by a famous magnate and tomes collector named Balkan(Frank Langella) to authenticate the rare text 'The ninth gate of the kingdom of shadows', a 17th century occult book reportedly have been written by the demon.

Glamorous cinematography by Darius Khondji and suspenseful musical score by Wojciech Killar. The tale is based on Arturo Perez Reverte's novel whose books have been adapted to cinema in several occasions(Alatriste,Nautical chart, Tablet of Flandes, Fencing master).

9,BA_Harrison,No rare books were harmed in the making of this film.,8,11 March 2012,"Unscrupulous book dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is drawn into a dangerous world of witchcraft, magic, and mystery after he is hired by collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to seek out the only remaining copies of Satanic textbook 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows', a work reputed to have the power to summon the Devil.After several viewings, I still don't fully comprehend everything about The Ninth Gate: it's one of those film that is deliberately ambiguous. Despite my frustration at my lack of understanding, I still have a fun time trying to further unravel the riddle, spot as-yet undiscovered clues and diabolical references, and work out the answers to questions posed by the plot.While the film's inconclusive narrative does little to diminish my enjoyment of this wonderfully complex supernatural thriller, which benefits from excellent direction from Polanski, a great leading performance from Depp, and a suitably ominous score, I do struggle with the way in which the bibliophiles portrayed treat their treasured tomes, smoking fags and slurping alcohol as they study the text, handling the books sans protective gloves, and leaving vital pages to gather dust on top of old bookshelves—I treat second-hand paperbacks better than that!7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",The Ninth Gate
10,moonspinner55,Mumbo jumbo,4,31 July 2016,"Johnny Depp gives a joyless, enervated performance as an American dealer in rare books who accepts a job from collector Frank Langella to compare Langella's copy of a 17th century book adapted from the writings of Lucifer to the two known remaining copies--one in Spain and the other in France--with only one of three tomes thought to be authentic. Soon, Depp feels he's being followed and, indeed, an enigmatic blonde begins popping up along his journey. Rather dreary occult thriller from producer-director Roman Polanski, who also co-adapted the screenplay with John Brownjohn from Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel ""The Club Dumas"". Polanski is trying for a low-key menace here in the style of Val Lewton or Jacques Tourneur, but he's unfortunately saddled with miscast Depp, not only callow but indifferent to the material. The plot mainly consists of exhausting legwork, though Langella is amusingly sinister and the supporting performances are fine. The production is handsome, and the devilish trappings are occasionally absorbing, yet portions of the movie are head-scratching (such as when Depp barely reacts after discovering a friend hanging upside down in his book store!). Not exactly the picture to get Polanski back on solid ground. ** from ****",The Ninth Gate
11,Quinoa1984,"One of the underrated Polanski films, not that fantastic but not too bad either",7,23 July 2000,"Roman Polanski shows his great directing talents here with this film, even if at times the story risks (and does) run off its own theological hinges. He brings back the issue of the devil (first time in thirty years), making it a pretty good subject for the film, if not as impressive as in his first outing with the material. To say it could've been better is really more at the screenplay, which dives down into 'what' territory after the first hour of its mystery story. And, on a repeat viewing, my reaction is about the same as the first time (my first Polanski). Yet, thanks to great scenery, a good plot, and some better than OK acting by stars Frank Langella and (more so) Johnny Depp, this film should be seen by Polanski fans, even if saying that it won't be like his classics is a fair bet. At the least, there is a very strangely filmed sex scene.",The Ninth Gate
12,wes-connors,Roman Polanski Goes to Hell with Johnny Depp,5,16 April 2009,"After being hired by Frank Langella (as Boris Balkan), ""Johnny Depp unlocks the gates to hell, in Roman Polanski's newest thriller. Depp stars as Dean Corso, an unscrupulous rare-book dealer who is hired to locate the remaining copies of 'The Nine Gates of the Shadow Kingdom,' a demonic manuscript that can summon the Devil. Corso becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving murder, theft, and satanic ritual; and, ultimately finds himself confronting the devil incarnate,"" according to official synopsis.In order to look old, bookish Depp occasionally has a chalk-like substance added to his temples. He treats rare old books indelicately, and sometimes blows tobacco smoke on them. Despite these early warnings, ""The Ninth Gate"" becomes intriguing, as Depp's character unfolds the mysteries of three Satanic volumes, and their differing illustrations. Emmanuelle Seigner and Lena Olin are obviously bad news, but Depp messes with them anyway.The major film's main weakness in that it doesn't go anywhere with its promising storyline; and, most importantly, it lacks a satisfactorily ending. You might even call it incoherent (see for yourself, if you dare). Darius Khondji's cinematography, and wheelchair-bound devil worshiper Barbara Jefford (as Baroness Kessler) are strengths.***** The Ninth Gate (8/25/99) Roman Polanski ~ Johnny Depp, Emmanuelle Seigner, Barbara Jefford",The Ninth Gate
13,Coventry,Doesn't come close to Polanski's earlier work but still enjoyable,6,17 November 2003,"I was pretty enthusiastic when I heard Roman Polanski was preparing a new film about my all time favorite topic : the obscure and alternate religion. For a second there, I thought he was going back to his most primitive roots and masterpieces like Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion. Of course, the quality of The Ninth Gate doesn't come close to these titles but it stands as a decent effort in the genre and it certainly is one of the top horror stories of the nineties. I don't even think Polanski is to blame for the fact that The Ninth Gate doesn't reach the same level as his early work. The story and the production values were a lot more ""mainstream"" and a much larger audience was intended. Polanski did the best he could with it and his style is clearly present in the movie. A lot of credit should go the perfect cast as well. I don't think it was possible to put together a better cast for this type of movie. Johnny Depp is outstanding as the arrogant loner who tries to clarify the secrets behind 3 copies of the diabolical book ""The Nine Gates"". He plays his character like it was intended to be played...vicious, brutal and mysterious. Frank Langella is excellent for the role he plays here. He's the rich collector who sends out Depp to investigate the background of the books he lives his life by. I can't give enough praise to Lena Olin neither...she's one of the most sensual, mysterious and macabre actresses alive and no other woman could have played her role better. Her character is much like the one she did in 'Romeo Is Bleeding' ...an irresistible - yet very dangerous - stylish woman who you can't help but to worship. And of course Polanski couldn't resist to cast his very own wife ( at that time at least ) Emmanuele Seigner in a raw but very erotic role. Well, I don't have a problem with that...She sure can act and the look in her eyes keeps you close to the screen constantly. She's at least as attractive here as in that previous Polanski movie ""Bitter Moon"" ...expect for the fact that she was the only good element in that movie. There's a lot more to enjoy about the Ninth Gate. Especially the first half of the movie is a success. The terrific opening scene and credits ( through nine gates ) immediately set the right mood and atmosphere. The first 45 minutes of this movie are a macabre and fascinating excursion into the more dark side of religion. This part of the Ninth Gate really keeps you focused and very close to the screen. Too bad this level of quality isn't held up the entire movie. Too many twists and illogical sequences weaken the movie and the finale is - as usual in this kind of movies - way over the top. A real shame but not a complete disaster...By the time the movie starts to lose his grip and power, you already gave it a high rating in your mind.",The Ninth Gate
14,Theo Robertson,I Got Taken For A Ride,4,3 November 2003,"I vaugly knew what the plot was for THE NINTH GATE . It centered around Johnny Depp playing a character called Dean Corso who is trying to track down an occult book , so right away I was expecting something similar to a HP Lovecraft tale but this isn`t really what I got with this movie . What I got was almost two and a half hours of Dean Corso sitting around drinking coffee , asking for directions , drinking wine , asking for more directions , receiving a phone call and drinking more wine . There are supernatural elements to the story but these take up a minute fraction of the running time . Roman Polanski might not be a very good human being but he`s not a bad director . THE NINTH GATE is lit very moodily and is very well edited . However I have call into question the decision to cast his wife Emmanuelle Seigner in a very important role for the simple reason that she`s an absolutely awful actress . It`s not just in this film she`s hopeless , everything I`ve seen her in - Which strangely were also directed by Polanski - proves she`s hopeless . "" Are you going to take me for a ride ? "" she asks Corso which led me to shout at the telly "" Polanski`s taking us all for a ride if he thinks you`re an actress """,The Ninth Gate
15,Doylenf,Stylish European backgrounds add flavor to otherwise enigmatic story...,7,20 August 2006,"Roman Polanski's stylish direction is a big plus factor in being able to appreciate THE NINTH GATE for the handsomely photographed thriller that it is in a tale about a man's quest for the only genuine volume of a work penned by the Devil when only three such volumes exist. The mission is assigned to a sleazy book dealer always on the lookout for a sweetheart deal (JOHNNY DEPP who wears glasses to appear scholarly) and it is his acceptance of that mission from an equally shady publishing magnate (FRANK LANGELLA, who literally phones in his performance), that makes the film a clever psychological thriller.For all its cleverness, it does leave one stumbling in the dark toward the end which has a climax that is more confusing than enlightening. It's the kind of ending open to a host of interpretations and perhaps it was the enigma that puzzled too many in the audience and kept the film from having the sort of popularity it deserved.Depp is not as quirky as usual in his characterization and perhaps this is why his fans failed to recognize the full merits of the piece. It's the kind of story that Alfred Hitchcock would have enjoyed filming and no doubt, for added insurance, he would have summoned Bernard Herrmann to write the background score. Perhaps the film would have risen to the level of some of Hitch's best works--but here, unfortunately, it's not one of Polanski's best.Having said that, it's definitely worth viewing for an interesting tour of European locales, striking color photography of handsome sites, and a few intriguing twists along the journey into darkness. If it's not first rate, at least it tries.",The Ninth Gate
16,LeonLouisRicci,Underrated Satan Stuff,8,21 April 2013,"This is not as relentlessly creepy as say, Rosemary's Baby (1968), but it definitely has a creep factor. It is part Film Noir and part Supernatural and it is the Noir parts that work the best but when you have a story about the Devil Himself, or rather his influence on certain gullible types, this makes for a semi-scary fall down the path or persuasion, either real or imagined. It is a brooding Movie with an occasional witty line that makes you smile but most of the time our ""Hero"" is looking frighteningly over his shoulder through the haze of cigarette smoke and smoky colored liquor. He is befriended and beguiled by a sensuously frumpy seductress (taking on the style of her target) that is at first an enigma but as time goes on and bodies pile up it becomes clear that she is more than meets the (green glowing) eye.The Movie is fun and frightening and is sombre and scary, well acted and looks ominous. This is light weight Polanski and that is better than most, and can be enjoyed as a Mystery delving into eclectic circles and bizarre Cults. You know you're in for some tantalizing teasing, if you look quick and close, at the beginning when the earthly antagonist punches numbers on an elevator keypad accessing his private floor. One guess what the three numbers are. Most Director's would have shown that in close-up, but we are not dealing with most Directors here.",The Ninth Gate
17,CinemaSerf,"""Some books are dangerous...not to be opened with impunity""",7,21 March 2020,"Johnny Depp near his best in this devilishly demonic detective story. He is an unscrupulous, but knowledgable New York rare book dealer who is charged by the millionaire Frank Langella to authenticate a text. ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"" may or may not be able to summon the devil - or, at least, bestow the owner with some semblance of Satanic power. His search for the truth involves deceit, lust, many murders and a cat and mouse game with deadly consequences. Emmanuelle Seigner is suitably enigmatic as ""the girl"" - a sort of angelic person with ninja skills and Lena Olin hams it all up nicely as the sex-kitten (with claws) baddie. I enjoyed this; it is a complex supernatural thriller that doesn't try to impress with cheap special effects (though the music can be a little annoying at times); it's well written with a strong cast. At 2½ hours, however, it is too long; there are plenty of establishing shots that could have been trimmed/dumped to up the pace a bit more.",The Ninth Gate
18,poolandrews,I liked it but it's far from perfect.,6,29 October 2007,"The Ninth Gate starts as New York based rare book dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is hired by wealthy businessman Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who collects rare ancient occult books which deal with the devil & satanism. Balkan hires Corso to authenticate his copy of 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows' that legend has it was co-authored by Satan himself & of which there are only three in existence although Balkan believes only one is real while the other's are fakes & he wants to know if his is kosher. The first of the other two books resides in Portugal with a collector called Victor Fargas (Jack Taylor) & the other in Paris with Baroness Kessler (Barabra Jefford), wherever Corso travels death seems to follow as he digs deeper into the meaning of the books & discovers that they may be the key to unleashing Satan himself upon the Earth...This French, Spanish & American co-production was co-written, produced & directed by Roman Polanski & has a few admirable qualities but ultimately isn't that successful & let down by a few things. The script by Polanski, John Brownjohn & Enrique Urbizu was based on the novel 'El Club Dumas' by Arturo Perez-Reverte (it actually had a large subplot about a secret society obsessed with serialised novels such as those written by Alexandre Dumas during the 19th Century, a subplot which wasn't included in this filmed adaptation) takes itself extremely seriously & indeed wants to be taken very seriously which is sort of it's downfall. The basic story is interesting for a while but it takes ages to get to where it's going & the straight faced nature of all the mumbo jumbo nonsense is a little hard to take seriously. At well over 2 hours in length the film outstays it's welcome, for a film with a fairly simple plot & little on screen action it sure takes it's time & I have to admit I was starting to lose interest in it. I didn't like the ending either, the ambiguity surrounding the identity of the woman is frustrating to say the least, I had sat through over 2 hours of this to get to a resolution but if anything the end just poses more questions. In fact on the IMDb 'FAQ' page for The Ninth Gate the only question asked so far is 'Who was the girl?' & every vague response is different which says everything about the mess of an ending. Also, if Balkan was prepared to kill people for the other two books so readily why did he need Corso? Surely Balkan could have just have the people murdered in the first place & steal the books, does that not make a bit more sense instead of letting Curso wander around Europe with his copy & indeed the only one in existence? Having said that I thought the film had some interesting ideas & the basic story behind it was solid & could have made for an exciting supernatural thriller which to be fair it almost is. The character's are pretty good & the dialogue is fine but it's just a bit too slow & hard to stay with.Director Polanski returns to the horror genre for the first time since The Tenant (1976) & The Ninth Gate is a surprisingly bland film, it's well made & there are one or two little touches of style & imagination but not many. The film is very grounded in reality until the very end & tries to pile on the paranoia & mystery which is alright but at the expense of being scary or frightening, in fact until the final few minutes there is no indication anything supernatural is going to happen at all. There's no blood or gore & few special effects.With a supposed budget of about $38,000,000 (which sounds a lot considering how the film turned out) this is well made with that big budget Hollywood look, shot on location in France, Spain & Portugal. Depp made this before he shot to mega stardom as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean flicks, the rest of the cast are pretty much unknowns to me.The Ninth Gate is a straight faced supernatural thriller which could have been better but then again it could have been worse, some of it works while some of it doesn't. I liked it, just about, but I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again.",The Ninth Gate
19,lastliberal,"Even Hell has its heroes, señor.",8,22 July 2007,"Arturo Pérez-Reverte is one of my favorite authors, so it is natural that I want to see movies based on his books. I do not compare them, I just enjoy both forms.This film is an excellent example of the psychological thriller. Don't look for a lot of whiz-bang special effect, although the fire work is excellent. Director Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Chinatown) certainly know how to make a film that exists on so many layers. The search that happens throughout the movie is a waste of time as the prize is there all the time for those who can see. Now, I don't believe in Lucifer, but the fact that he/she was there every moment in the movie is a good metaphor for the fact that he is ever present in our lives. Of course, if you look for the he, you will not see the she.Emmanuelle Seigner (Frantic) was brilliant as Lucifer - there I told you, so now you can watch more closely.Johnny Dep and Frank Langella (Dracula, Superman Returns, Dave) were also first rate in their performances.",The Ninth Gate

Therefore, this review will be entirely based on the film as entertainment, and as a piece of art that wasn't understood by the author of the review(yours truly). First off, like most other Polanski films(at least to my recollection), this features some great dialog, an involving story and a likable lead character. The plot is very good, and it evolves nicely throughout the film. The pacing is very good, I was rarely bored. It seems to go out the window near the end, though. The final few scenes seemed tacked on as a result. The acting is all top notch... there wasn't one single character who I found poorly acted. The cinematography is exceptional, though I have come to expect nothing less from Polanski. Roman reuses Emmanuelle Seigner, the young French beauty he earlier used in Frantic. She does an equally good job in this film. She's mysterious, hypnotizing and alluring. Though I don't understand her native tongue, I believe I'll have to find some of her other films, just to see more of her. Polanski certainly knew what he was doing when he chose her for the part. All in all, a very good horror-mystery-thriller, which should entertain even the most critical fan of any of those three genres. Unless you're into western religion, however, you will probably have the same reaction as me(not understanding it). I recommend this to any fan of Polanski, Seigner and films with supernatural undertones. 7/10",The Ninth Gate
21,anaconda-40658,Open the Gate.,8,10 September 2015,"The Ninth Gate (1999): Dir: Roman Polanski / Cast: Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Emmanuelle Seigner, Lena Olin, James Russo: Intriguing horror film dealing with the forbidden. Johnny Depp plays a rare book dealer assigned by Frank Langella to study The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, which was printed in 1666 and believed to have been written by Satan. With three copies in existence Depp must discover which one is real. A strange woman joins him as numerous attempts are made on his life. Detailed screenplay that places viewers in Depp's position where trust is a risk. Langella dominates with his deep voice and authority although his scheme comes off as embarrassing when factoring in certain facts. Featuring enchanting art direction to further enhance the story . Emmanuelle Seigner is enchanting as an angelic figure whom may confuse viewers by its third act. Lena Olin is fetching as a woman after the book after her husband hung himself. Directed by Roman Polanski whose Rosemary's Baby is superior and dealing with similar themes. He also made Chinatown as well as Repulsion. Visually well made with creepy locations and angelic figures that seem to be watching. Compelling thriller that is sometimes corny but comes through on suspense as well as the ability to be curious. It is about unknown dangers that we willingly trespass. Score: 8 / 10",The Ninth Gate
22,Aaron1375,"Started out interestingly enough, but the ending was just to bizarre.",6,2 September 2008,"I saw this movie on television a while back and only watched a bit of it because I had something to do. Suffice to say I found it very interesting as Depp's character was appraising these books and then went on to have an interesting conversation with another character interested in a book known as the ""Ninth Gate"". Well I found this movie cheap years later so I bought it and it played out somewhat good, as all the book research was actually pretty interesting. Also, there was possible conspiracy afoot. A few twists and turns here and there as Depp's character does not know who to trust, as he is set on a mission to compare three books with each other, those who own the other books are being snuffed out. Then near the end it just got to weird as Depp's character seemed to do some stuff that did not seem to be his motivation for the majority of the flick. He seemed to develop an interest for what the book did on the spur of the moment and it kind of made the movie crash when there were some strange happenings. Still, it was enjoyable enough for what it was, just needed a better ending possibly more realistic. For the most part though this movie is sort of like the satanic version of Da Vinci Code...however, it still has some humorous moments as well and strange bits of music that makes it seem like it is a comedy.",The Ninth Gate
23,The_Void,Brilliant horror-thriller from the winning combination of Depp and Polanski,9,30 August 2004,"Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor, and Roman Polanski is a fantastic director. These two have proved this fact time and time again and there is no disputing it. In this film, the latter directs the former who plays mercenary book dealer; Dean Corso. Corso is hired by a mysterious book collector to find the last two copies of 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows', a book reportedly co-written by the devil. What follows is a film-noir style mystery, fleshed out by a generous helping of Polanksi's trademark offbeat characters and general weirdness.The euro-Gothic style of the movie, which is reminiscent of such horror classics as Suspiria and Inferno, lends this movie a great style and one that you don't see too often in the more recent horror movies. Roman Polanski is well known for creating the more off-the-cuff type of movie, and this one firmly fits into that mould. Polanski gets to show his wicked sense of humour a few times in this movie too, which is always good to see. The more obvious humour is shown when the truck driver gives Depp a hand signal, but the more absurd humour is at it's best with the fire and wheelchair sequence, which is absolutely delicious and maybe even the best scene in the movie. As mentioned, the movie plays out much like a film-noir mystery. Like other films of this ilk, such as Angel Heart, The Ninth Gate draws you into it's mystery, and is a mystery film first and a horror movie second. This is definitely true of this film, as despite a few scenes of horror; such as the scenes with dead bodies, the film stays in mystery mode for a lot of it's duration and rarely goes over the top, which is much to it's credit.Johnny Depp takes the lead role in this movie. I am a big fan of Johnny Depp; he's a great actor, and he has more than enough about him to totally carry a movie on his own. This is without a doubt Depp's movie, but he is lent support courtesy of a great support cast which includes Emmanuelle Seigner (Polanski's wife and the actress that starred in Frantic and Bitter Moon, two other Polanski films), Frank Langella; who is delightfully creepy, although a little camp in his role as the mysterious collector that hires Depp and Lena Olin, a fine actress that starred alongside Depp in Chocolat.The characters in The Ninth Gate don't undergo that much of a change. This is true for all except Johnny Depp's character. Like any good film-noir, the focus is firmly on the lead and the film is mostly about him being lead deeper and deeper into the film's dark underbelly. The fact that the other characters don't develop much, hardly matters; the story and central character are more than interesting enough to keep the audience interested. The supporting characters that don't develop are already given a defined character anyway, and therefore don't need to develop in order to develop the story. The story is most definitely the most important aspect of this film; it meanders and is as unpredictable as you would expect a Polanski story to be. For the most part, the film stays much within the realms of reality, and it only really ventures out of the realm of logical possibility towards the end.The ending of the movie features a sex scene that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie, and it is never really explained exactly why it's there. By then, however, you will have already spent two hours enjoying your ride through Polanski's twisted mind, and this won't be enough to spoil it, but I do feel that this scene should have been cut from the film as it is unneeded. However, towards the end, the film does feature a deliciously over the top ceremony. Although this also goes against the flow of the movie, it does do it justice as it shows us, basically, what we have wanted to see all along. It is a shame about the very end, as it is rather anti-climatic; but when I think about it, it's the only way that the film could have ended without becoming really silly.",The Ninth Gate
24,zetes,Might have been tolerable at 90 minutes,5,13 September 2009,"Somewhat embarrassing supernatural thriller from Roman Polanski. Johnny Depp plays a rare book collector who is employed by Frank Langella to compare his super-rare demonic scripture to the two other copies in existence. Depp at first is ecstatic to get such a high paying job, but soon he is being attacked by the book's former owner (Lena Olin) as well as being stalked by a bizarre and mysterious blonde (Emmanuelle Seigner). People begin to die all around him. With films like Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant under Polanski's belt, one might hope for something eerie and subtle. No, this is something more along the lines of Sam Raimi, loud, campy and kinda silly. But not in a bad way, necessarily. It can be quite a bit of fun at times. I loved the bit with the electric wheelchair, for instance. However, the film moves pretty slowly, there's not enough of the fun stuff and I had lost interest pretty early in, only occasionally getting back into it. It really doesn't need to run for two hours and fifteen minutes (to add insult to injury, Lionsgate's Blu Ray, which can be purchased for $10, lists an incorrect - and much shorter - running time on the back of the box).",The Ninth Gate

26,whpratt1,Polanski Creates a Masterpiece,7,26 June 2007,"Greatly enjoyed this very mysterious film dealing with people trying to secure very rare books dealing with the supernatural and a desire to secure the powers of the devil. Johnny Depp, (Dean Corso) and Frank Langella, (Boris Balkan) are the two men trying to obtain these books in order to find the Secrets of the Ninth Gate. Boris Balkan wears very thick eyeglasses and you can hardly recognize him and he also likes to stand in a circle of fire and laugh his head off. There is a mysterious Girl who makes quite a few appearances in this film played by Emmanuelle Seigner,(The Girl) who is the real wife of Roman Polanski. As this film progresses, you will begin to learn just who this girl is, especially when you see her sexy burning Green Eyes glaring into your eyes and she does a very good job of seducing Dean Corso. This is truly a great film and Roman Polanski made this film into a Classic for all generation to view and enjoy.",The Ninth Gate
27,JamesHitchcock,Occult Neo-Noir,7,10 August 2011,"Although the year 2000 represented nothing more than the 1,999th anniversary of the year in which a sixth-century monk mistakenly believed Christ had been born, the approach of the end of the second millennium was greeted with dire predictions of the end of the world and an upsurge of interest in the occult. Even the panic over the supposed ""millennium bug"" can be seen as a millenarian prophecy wearing a secular disguise. It is therefore perhaps appropriate that 1999 was the year which saw Roman Polanski's supernatural thriller ""The Ninth Gate""; it was by no means the only film with a demonic theme to appear in this particular year.Dean Corso, a New York rare-book dealer, is hired by Boris Balkan, a wealthy book collector, to authenticate a book he has recently bought, ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"", a volume of occult lore written by a seventeenth-century Italian author named Aristide Torchia. Torchia was burned at the stake by the Inquisition and surviving copies of his book are extremely rare, although two other copies are known to exist. Legend has it that Lucifer himself acted as Torchia's co-writer and that possession of a genuine copy of the book will enable the owner to conjure up the devil.Balkan has recently acquired his copy of ""The Nine Gates"" from another book collector named Andrew Telfer, who committed suicide soon afterwards. Telfer's widow, Liana, wants the book back, claiming it was her property and not her husband's to sell. Corso travels first to Portugal and then to Paris to examine the other two surviving copies, but realises that by accepting Balkan's commission he has put himself in danger as there are persons, possibly including Liana herself, who will do anything to obtain a copy; several persons connected to the book meet violent deaths.Despite the paranormal theme, ""The Ninth Gate"" is not a horror film along the lines of ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Omen"". (Or, for that matter, Polanski's earlier ""Rosemary's Baby"". Although he has publicly said that he does not believe in the occult, he clearly has an imaginative interest in the theme). There are no ghosts, demons or monsters and no spooky special effects. For much of its length the film resembles more closely a neo-noir thriller with the book acting as what Alfred Hitchcock called the ""McGuffin"", an article of no great importance in itself but which the main characters in the movie are all trying to get hold of. There is a resemblance between Corso and the private detectives who were the heroes of many of the original films noirs. To begin with, the only explicitly supernatural element, apart from the book's subject-matter, is the presence of a mysterious young woman, never named and only referred to as ""Green Eyes"". This woman, played by Emmanuelle Seigner (aka Madame Polanski), acts as Corso's guardian angel (or should that be guardian devil?) and seems to possess powers which go beyond the purely natural.The film has something of the feel of a tale by that Edwardian master of the ghost story, M R James, a feel heightened by the solid period interiors in which much of the action takes place. James's stories often centre upon an artefact (sometimes, indeed, a book) with supernatural powers, the nature of which is gradually revealed as the story develops, and an initially sceptical narrator whose scepticism is replaced by a realisation that the forces which confront him are real. So it proves here. Corso, initially motivated solely by the prospect of a lucrative deal, begins to realise that Balkan, Liana and others may want the book for reasons other than its financial value.Although Johnny Depp can be good in films about the paranormal or the gruesome (""From Hell"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""Sweeney Todd""), this is not his best performance. It was a mistake to try and make him look older, as even with greying temples he does not seem convincingly middle-aged, and his acting is flat and uninteresting. (There were reports of artistic clashes between him and the director).The film as a whole, however, is a reasonably good one. Polanski is one of those auteur directors (others include Kubrick and Peter Weir) who try not to repeat themselves and to make every movie as different as they can to its predecessor. (His film prior to ""The Ninth Gate"" was ""Death and the Maiden"", a study of the politics of dictatorship in Latin America, and his next two were to be ""The Pianist"", about the Nazi occupation of Poland, and an adaptation of Dickens's ""Oliver Twist""). This film is not only different to ""Rosemary's Baby"" but also different to Polanski's previous neo-noir, ""Chinatown"", from 25 years earlier. That film was set during a hot, dry summer and shot in a harsh, glaring Southern California daylight. In ""The Ninth Gate"", by contrast, the colours are darker and more muted; it has an autumnal feel to it, even if the state of the vegetation suggests that it too was filmed in summer.The plot is less complicated than that of ""Chinatown"" (or many other neo-noirs) and, although it is at times slow-moving, it never loses the viewer's interest as it moves towards its disturbingly ambiguous conclusion. I would not rate ""The Ninth Gate"" quite as highly as ""Chinatown"" or some of Polanski's other masterpieces such as ""Tess"" or ""The Pianist"", but it is nevertheless an interesting film, proof that it is possible to make a supernatural thriller without resorting to shock tactics. 7/10",The Ninth Gate
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,There's a first for everything,5,15 November 2004,"This is a first for me not really liking a Johnny Depp film. I have been a fan of his way before ""Pirates of the Carrabean"", the first film I saw of his was ""Edward Scissorhands"" when I was 5 years old. I was hooked ever since. I have -ALMOST- seen every movie of his. That's how much I enjoy his work. So, I didn't really hesitate to see ""The Ninth Gate"". It was an alright movie. It didn't really excite me though. Throughout the movie, for me at least, it was pretty predictable. Roman is a very gifted director. I think he is one of the best around, and the picture is very well directed. It was just the story for the most part. I think I've seen too many ""End of Days"" type of movies.5/10",The Ninth Gate

The movie has all the trappings of an successful ""thriller"" but misses it's mark on several counts. However, if the viewer doesn't mind making a few leaps of faith and contending with a clumsy and ambiguous ending, they'll likely enjoy this otherwise well crafted movie.",The Ninth Gate
30,MovieAddict2016,"Better than I expected, even if the ending leaves a bit to be desired",7,5 September 2005,"Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a mercenary book-hunter, employed by a mysterious wealthy man named Balkun (Frank Langella) to trace the sources of a controversial, rare manuscript which contains clues leading towards the ""Ninth Gate"" - the place at which the Devil is resurrected, or something to such an extent. (The film is kind of shady when it comes to what, exactly, the Ninth Gate really is.) Corso is given the manuscript and told to find out of it's genuine - he begins his journey and immediately finds himself entwined in a supernatural force. His friends are murdered, a strange woman tries to seduce him and steal the book for her own purposes, and then he finds another replica of the book - identical, save for varying drawings inside the pages.The drawings and their differences, when assorted correctly, are believed to open the Ninth Gate. Corso knows he's gotten into something deep and wants to stop - but he can't find his mysterious employer and he is constantly being pursued by a demon woman (Emmanuelle Seigner).Roman Polanski is a great director but when ""The Ninth Gate"" came out in 1999 it seemed to die out rather quick. I had heard bad things about the film and never got around to seeing it until just last night.Although it's not a great supernatural thriller like ""Rosemary's Baby,"" it is very entertaining and ambiguous enough to merit repeat viewings. There's a lot of stuff I didn't understand, or things I knew I didn't pick up on, that I'm sure would enhance further viewings.However I can see where the bad reviews come from - many audiences were probably not willing to look deep enough into the film and just wanted cheap horror scares. This movie is not what the ads make it out to be. It's very atmospheric, subtle and creepy - ""Jacob's Ladder"" meets ""The Exorcist."" Depp gives a good performance and the makeup and alterations to his hair really do make him look older. (He's even got realistic grays.) After seeing this I thought he would be the perfect choice to play Doctor Gordon in the film remake of the video game ""Half-Life"" - he looked just like him.The rest of the cast are okay - Seigner is given little to do but look sexy and Lena Olin basically has the same thankless task. Langella is good but he's not on screen very much. It's really Depp who carries the film.""The Ninth Gate"" isn't a flawless movie and it isn't something that shocked me. I felt the ending in particular was a bit sloppy and too ambiguous - after reading the message boards I understand more, but there's some weird stuff that happens at the end, and unless you're a rocket scientist who picks up on really obscure stuff, there's a chance you might not really ""get it.""

33,sddavis63,Decent Time Waster That Gets Overly Silly At The End,5,14 February 2001,"Johnny Depp was well cast in this movie as Dean Corso, a somewhat shady dealer in rare books, who is hired to investigate the authenticity of an ancient text purportedly written by Lucifer himself.The first three quarters of the movie was pretty good. It actually plays the story line relatively seriously, as Corso finds himself dealing with dangerous people trying to stop his investigation, and this was shaping up as a pretty decent suspense/thriller. But everything falls apart in the last half hour or so, as director, co-writer and co-producer Roman Polanski decides to give up on the pretense of a serious movie and simply descends into childish and both undramatic and unfrightening and very predictable horror-type schlock.If it's possible to spoil the end of this movie, this could be a spoiler, so you might not want to read on, (here's your chance to stop)but if you can picture Frank Langella (playing Boris Balkan) frightening the wits out of a coven of witches by shouting ""BOO"" at them, then you have an idea of how weak the ending to this movie is.",The Ninth Gate

And certainly it's a nice looking, well-acted film, but it is also quite slow moving, with little moments of pseudo-suspense that have little impact and a predictable story.Still, I would call the movie a watchable time killer if not for the ending, which neither explains the mysterious blonde's role nor offers any sort of visceral satisfaction.I've always found Polanski pretty hit and miss, and in terms of the suspense/mystery/horror genre, I would consider this far weaker than The Tenant, Repulsion or the over-praised Rosemary's Baby.

This horrific and insane act on Telfer's part leaves the audience wondering what exactly was the reason to make him do this self-destructive act. You get the answer soon enough when New York rare book dealer the anything for a quick buck Dean Corso, Johnny Depp, comes on the scene within minutes after Telfers demise.For some strange and unexplained reason Telfer had sold this rare book about Satanism to rare book collector Boris Balkan, Frank Langella, who's a closet Satanist himself. Getting in touch with Corso Balkan Balkan tells the greedy and unethical book dealer that he wants him to track down the other two remaining copies of ""The Ninth Gate to the Kingdom of the Shadows"", the book that Telfer sold him before his suicide. Balkan wants to find out if the copy that he has is the only one of the three that's authentic.Things starts to go downhill for Corso almost as soon as he agrees to work for Balkan when his friend rear book store owner Bernie ,James Russo, whom he gave Balkan's book for safe-keeping ends up murdered. Feeling a bit strange in what he's involved with Corso also ends up getting attacked by Mrs. Telfer Liana, Lena Olin, who want's her dead husbands book back and almost ends up scratching his eyes out after trying to make like she want's to have an affair with him.Going to both Portugal & France where the two other ""Devil"" books are located Corso is confronted with a double murder of the two people Victor Fargas & Baroness Kessler, Jack Taylor & Barbara Jefford, who own those two ungodly manuals of the Black Arts with them being burned beyond repair. This leaves only Balkan's book being the only one of the three left and obviously the one that's the real McCoy not a cheap and powerless imitation. It turns out that Lena has been following Corso all through his travels in Europe and the first chance that she gets in finding Corso not having the book with him has it lifted from right under his nose out of his hotel fridge where it hid it.Corso soon realize that the book is what's needed to conjure up the Devil himself by this Satanic cult that Lena heads and in return have him, the Devil, gives them all his powers that are far beyond the imagination of the human mind. Corso and a mysterious girl, Emanuelle Seigner, that he met back in New York, who like Lena followed him back to Europe track down Lena & friends in this French mansion outside Paris. It's there where their having a Satanic powwow to bring their master, from hell, back here on earth. It turns out that all the chanting and praying on the part of Lena & Co, through the power of the book for Satan to come back to life, from the world of the dead, and reveal himself is all for nothing. As all this is going on Balkan crashes the party and after strangling Lena chases the Satanists who did nothing at all to stop him from murdering their leader out of the place. Balkan then takes off with the book to secretly use it himself, in an abandoned monastery, in order to give himself the evil powers that Lena couldn't give them or herself.Gut spilling ending that has a totally crazed and happily insane Balkan put, or so he thought, the puzzle of the book ""The Ninth Gate of the Kingdom of the Shadows"" into place. Balkan by fitting together the books nine mysterious illustrations and then by chanting out a secret Satanic prayer he feels that he'll become as powerful as Satan himself. It just couldn't have happen to a nicer guy then Balkan, who by now seemed to have completely lost his mind, as he tempted both the fates and laws of nature in trying to prove his invincibility only to show to himself, and the startled movie audience, what a first class jackass he is. Balkan in dousing himself with a can of gasoline and then setting himself on fire to show himself and Corso, who tracked him down in the monastery, just how invincible he really is. Instead Balkan end up as one of the Devils many slaves who were insane enough to think that he'll reward them with eternal life by foolishly doing his bidding.As for Dean Corso he just about had enough of the rare book business, after what he went through in the movie, and decided to do his best to forget the whole thing by getting away from it all and and going legit in opening up a bed & breakfast in out of the way Key West Florida.",The Ninth Gate
36,paul2001sw-1,"Potbolier, pastiche, Polansksi!",2,27 November 2005,"Arturo Perez-Reverte writes taut thrillers whose distinctive settings almost manage to disguise their fundamentally generic elements; Roman Polanski has a long and interesting career as a film-maker; and yet this adaptation of one of Perez-Reverte's works by Polanksi disappointingly emphasises all its more potboilerish elements. So the plot feature megalomaniac millionaires, secret societies, a hero who never goes to the police when witness to murder, and a mysterious, kick-boxing female sidekick. While the film features dire acting (Emmanuelle Seiger is especially bad, it's not actually possible to tell if she is trying to play a human or an angel), hackneyed (English) dialogue spoken in cod-European accents, and some of the most risably choreographed action scenes I've ever seen. This level of basic ineptitude simply wasn't something I expected from Polanski, although the comic soundtrack rather adds to the impression that it's intended as pastiche (although, if so, it's pastiche without jokes). And the film is also lazy, failing to follow through its conceits with rigour. For example, the story hinges on a priceless ancient book (a book, in fact, for which people are prepared to kill), but the hero walks through the streets with it under his arm in a linen sack, and reads it carelessly, dirty-fingered and smoking. The film loses further marks in its ending. Polanksi has, I believe, added satanic elements to the original story (in keeping with his previous work), but these are simply ludicrous; and the film's final ending just baffling. As is the fact that such a distinguished cinematiste could have made such a truly awful work.",The Ninth Gate

Still, the 'The Ninth Gate' inspired by the book by Spanish author Arturo Pérez-Reverte is quite a good film by itself, bridging between the devilish movies of the 90th and historical thrillers of the 2000s. It is a little bit too long, and loses interest in the last quarter, especially as the ending is not really very satisfactory, and the bigger mystery of the movie - the identity of the green eyes lady - is not really solved either, besides the very obvious explanation. Johnny Depp is a fascinating actor to watch in any film, although here he seems a little bit distracted or un-interested, as principal hero could have shown some more involvement in the the search of the Ninth Gate, or at least for the two gorgeous women who try to reach for his attention.

According to sources, only three copies of that book exist, and in three different places. After losing his friend who has been killed for that book, he leaves on the mission. He wants to verify Balkan's book but finds something else! During his dramatic travels through Paris and Madrid, too many things beyond his expectations are revealed!Ninth Gate is a great oddity of a film. It's often surreal, complex but always fascinating and engrossing. The story is heavy with Gothic themes, with a very creepy atmosphere surrounding it. The finale is especially intense, and really had me on the edge of my seat. Johnny Depp is perfectly suited for the main role while Frank Langellas is terrifying in his role. Performances Johnny Depp gives yet another fascinating show. He's on the ball the whole two hours or so, and the main reason why I remained interested, even after two hours. He's mesmerizing to watch, and his performance is utterly captivating. Frank Langella is a madman here, fittingly terrifying. I couldn't take my eyes off of him, and he gave me the willies. Lena Olin plays seductive like nobody can and she plays her role to perfection here. Emmanuelle Seigner is great as the mysterious woman; I was intrigued by her the whole way. Bottom line. It's confusing, but not in a bad manner. Simply put I was too fascinated for it to hinder me too much. If you want a good Gothic thriller, look no further. Patience will be required. 8 ½ 10",The Ninth Gate

42,tabuno,"Slow, Absorbing, But Perhaps Dated",7,16 January 2019,"3 September 2014. The Ninth Gate reminds me of a more somber, less charming, Hitchcock version of Charade (1963) and an attempt to envelope both a mystery thriller genre with suggestions of the occult. Polanski's 60s direction doesn't age well from his classic horror movie Rosemary's Baby (1968). Today's emphasis on dramatic, stylized hand to hand combat scenes, The Ninth Gate seems pale and actually staged. Depp's character's lack of meticulous care for a rare book and its security seems out of place nowadays, and his character's evolving relationship with the mysterious girl doesn't seem genuine or believable considering the reoccurring circumstances.Polanski does successfully evoke the thriller mood, a slow paced effusion of atmosphere, yet the pacing seems too slow for the lack of the depth substance and crisp cinematography. The clues and mystery evoked is effective, the plot line relatively clear and consistent, yet the magic and spark are missing.",The Ninth Gate
43,slightlymad22,"Depp Remains Watchable, But He Is The Only Reason To See This",6,1 March 2018,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to The Ninth Gate.When this was announced I was disgusted Depp would work with Roman Polanski. I decided to still see it in cinemas, as I did everything Depp made back then. I think my disgust may have clouded my judgement as I hated it. And like Fear & Loathing, I have never revisited it, despite the DVD sitting in my collection for over a decade. Depp is once again solid, but this movie is not two of his better hours. Frank Langella normally brightens up any movie just by having his name in the cast. But here he is in pantomime villain mode!! He even shouts ""Boo"" at one point!! Depp's Donnie Brasco costar James Russo has a role as Depp's trusted friend Bernie. Who says his loyalty is 100%, unless there is money, women or work involved.I found the score too quirky at times, the CGI poor and I'm still not sure what happened at the end, or why?? It's certainly not clear!!The Ninth Gate grossed $18 million dollars at the domestic box office, not landing a spot on the highest 100 grossing movies of the year.Depp met Vanessa Paradis whilst filming this movie in France, he promptly fell in love with her and moved to France. There was no more arrests, no more trashed hotel rooms and outside of one incident early in their relationship, there were no more fights with paparazzi either. The next 5 years would be the most stable period of Depp's adult life.",The Ninth Gate
44,Thanos_Alfie,One book for everything...,5,28 November 2018,"""The Ninth Gate"" is a Mystery - Thriller movie in which we watch a book dealer who is driven from money and nothing more, contacted by a famous collector in order to contract him to bring him the last two rare copies of a daemon book. He already has the one but he wants also the other two. After he contracted by him, the book dealer gets into very weird, dangerous and supernatural situations and he will have to fight for everything.I liked this movie because of the plot which was very interesting and kept me alert in most of the duration of it. In addition to this, the direction of this movie which was made by Roman Polanski was just brilliant but in my opinion, the duration of the movie shouldn't be more than two hours. I also liked the interpretation of Johnny Depp who played as Dean Corso the book dealer and he was very good at it. His interpretation didn't remind me at all Captain Jack Sparrow since he hadn't played that role yet but it was a nice surprise for me to watch Johnny Depp as an actor and not as a pirate because I always have this feeling when I watch a movie with Johnny Depp which was filmed after 2003. I also have to mention that I liked the interpretation of Frank Langella who played as Boris Balkan.Finally, I believe that ""The Ninth Gate"" is a good movie to watch and I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much. I recommend everyone to watch it because it's something different, it has an interesting plot with some plot twists that you won't expect and it's a movie that you won't forget. Just be prepared because in some points the movie is a bit boring but give it some time and you won't regret it.",The Ninth Gate
45,Dr_Coulardeau,What about Lucifer seizing power in the White House?,9,26 August 2015,"This film is in a way a classic, though it brings together several trends that have been used and developed by other authors, directors, and producers. It is based on an old medieval book that has survived the burning of the author at the stake in three copies only. The book was authored by the man who was burned at the stake and a representative of Hell, of Satan himself who signed the illustrations as LCF, aka LuCiFer. But there are only three out of nine such illustrations signed by him in each copy and the altogether nine illustrations all have one LCF version. And there we come to the great classic of diabolical and black-magical literature that Dan Brown has illustrated in all possible shades of grey and even black.The three copies are one in the USA, and the other two in Europe, one in Paris and the other somewhere in Spain and the dealer who sold the one presently in the US is in Italy or Spain, the Mediterranean sinkhole that led to all heresies and religious crusades. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is hired by the owner of the US copy to find and examine the other two to identify which one is authentic. And we enter a thriller since finding the other two copies and getting access to them will be difficult and very dangerous. Strangely enough, Dean Corso will find out he is followed if not chased by two people, one dark-skinned man, aggressive and targeting him to get rid of him, and the other, a woman, trying to get the nine illustrations for her own sake, and she needs Dean Corso to reach them. She will save Dean, Corso's life a couple of times.When Dean Corso and his opportunistic and circumstantial ally have collected the nine illustrations, they discover Boris Balkan, the owner of the US copy had been following, taking no risks at all, and at this very last minute he recaptures his volume and the nine illustrations of the other two volumes in some ritualistically organized ceremony in some Saint-Martin chateau or mansion or castle, but of the post-medieval type in France, which is not in line with the genre of the book at stake here, and not to be burned. Boris Balkan (mind you, a US collector with a Russian first name and a Greek surname, what a triad!) is thus able to get rid of a devilish and satanic competitor, a woman actually, who wants to get access to hell through the US volume she stole from Dean Corso. Boris Balkan is thus able to gather the nine LCF illustrations and he can go to an old castle somewhere in Europe, actually, it does not matter where provided it is ancient and medieval, hence in ruins, where he lays out the nine LCF illustrations in an order that is not made clear as for its signification, and then he invokes Satan but it does not work because one of the nine illustrations is a fake, which Dean Corso discovers when he intervenes. Boris Balkan gets dead in a way or other and Dean Corso goes back, alone, without his female sidekick, to Italy or Spain, to the Mediterranean heretic sinkhole, to see Pablo & Pedro Ceniza, the two dealers who sold one copy to Boris Balkan. And by accident, the genuine ninth picture is discovered and the whole shebang can start all over again, but that will be for our next life on earth or in hell.The scenes are spectacular, the cities, including Paris, are beautiful, the action is so dense, rapid, and hot that we get more than just plainly singed by it and it is all to no avail since the ninth gate to hell is not opened by the black magic straight out of the distorted minds of the Middle Ages because mostly they were Christian, all of them with no exception, full stop and period, and to have some diversity some people had to be satanic as if Satan and all the other devils existed for real. What has been called the Dark Ages were not dark at all. They were, in fact, luminous but with a religious ideological light that only existed in the illuminated minds of some monks, priests, and popes. The darkness of Satan, Lucifer, and Hell is nothing different. It is the religious and ideological darkness that only exists in the minds of some metaphysical necromancers or alchemists, generally called witches or wizards by the other side of the ideological coin which is neither silver, not gold, just plain at best bronze, at worst lead.The question is, in fact, not about the story itself, but why do people today find some attraction and appeal in such diabolical stories? Why is hell a very potent and active dimension of modern life for some people on all sides of the ideological chessboard, and there are four sides as is well known since this chessboard is square. To reduce it to two sides only is vanity, infatuation on one side or the other of this bipolar reduction of the universe. And this binary subduction is the diabolical architecture of life for those who are binary minds. They know it is wrong, but they consider the other two sides as extremes and thus negligible and the wiser ones in this dual binary overview of things just would like to bring the two ""basic"" sides together into a bi-partisan deal, or into a union and transcendence of left and right, and this transcendence leads to some kind of supremacy for this union, and in the US at least, this supremacy meets with color and revives or stimulates a white supremacy tendency among politicians and people. In Europe, it is more complicated but such national or Christian or European or civilized supremacy finds its way into projects like Brexit and into any attempt to solve a problem with a referendum. And in Italy they saw many - some say five - stars after their referendum that sent the political establishment to hell for exactly fourteen months so that all the ministers in this period can apply for their retirement pension when they were ousted by parliament.That's the very deep fundamental craziness of modern humanity in the 21st century: to be different, to be a child of diversity, you have to renegade - as a transitive verb, it is a vast program of diversion, division, and dispersion - the establishment and to flirt with extremism, supremacist heresies, alliances of fire and water, hybridizations of the most estranged and unnatural entities like a democratic reference and the diabolization of the other side that opposes your ideas. Because the tendency in today's western democracies is to diabolize, satanize, luciferize all those who oppose your own views, because you and you alone are pure, divine, real, and thus you and you alone deserve to have power and be elected, re-elected and if possible re-re-elected. You can expect the re-re-election of Trump in 2024, even though the constitution does not permit it. Who cares? Certainly not the devil or Lucifer, that fallen angel of light that has become the angel of darkness in the process. If you are not convinced, just go to Supernatural and ask the Winchester brothers, Sam and Dean, or Dean and Sam, to explain you the subtlety of this fiendish, heinous, hellish, wicked, demoniac, infernal, satanic, serpentine world, and the eight qualifiers are not opening onto Hell like the Ninth Gate, but onto the Apocalypse and the Second Coming and Doomsday and the Last Judgment, the four corners of the chessboard on which we have been playing our plotting and plot-scheming.Enjoy this descent into the plotting of all plotters in the world who bring the Qanonplot onto the Qtiplot of our Artificial Intelligence.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUOLDER REVIEW: To be rated under averageA small film with a rather big budget travelling from New York to Spain (more or less not famous places) and to France, Paris of course. A film about the Devil or Satan or Lucifer had to be produced in the satanic year 1-999, just before the diabolical new millennium.Apart from that the plot is so light we could think it was bought as a premium in a barrel of washing powder. The only interesting element is the suspenseful editing that makes the film have good rhythm. But the rhythm of the editing is not enough to make a good film.Clichés upon clichés. The best ones are the baroness in a wheel chair with a ""secretary"" that looks like a prison warden and goes out in the morning to buy oranges. The younger desk clerk in a four or five stars hotel in Paris who is authorizing a woman to go to the main character's room because she claims to be his wife. The concierge will apologize later on but it will be too late. I guess that younger desk clerk had not gone through the proper vocational training.The best cliché is the fact that the devil is a woman, white of course and blonde of course again. She is s devilish person obviously since she can move around without any means of transportation except thin air. But she is the excuse for Polanski to put some female flesh on the screen. He is a lot more modest about male flesh. Why did he get Johnny Depp then? A fatso like Depardieu would have been just alright, and a lot more impressive.Johnny Depp is underused indeed. He is static, inexpressive, cold like a slithering snake, badly dressed and hardly human.Well enjoy it if you can. I guess with a good shot of vodka maybe. . .Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Ninth Gate
46,filipemanuelneto,A Gothic and gloomy film.,9,27 July 2016,"This film tells the story of Dean Corso, an expert on trade of rare books, which engages in a macabre story while trying to ascertain the authenticity of a rare book for a wealthy client. Directed by Roman Polanski, which also provides the script with John Brownjohn and Enrique Urbizu, this movie is starring Johnny Depp, Frank Langella and Lena Olin.This is one of the least known films of Depp's career, an actor who is fashionable and has many admirers. Perhaps the reason why this happens is the uncomfortable atmosphere of mystery surrounding the movie until, finally, ""swallows"" the main actor. The story is deeply mysterious: a book written by the Devil, pictures that can be used to invoke it, and a search across Europe, where every step you can find a strange place. Indeed, it was not by chance that Polanski chose Sintra as one of the scenarios for the story. The small Portuguese village is famous for the mysterious and enigmatic environment, as well as the legends it has. The choice of an ancient Cathar castle for the grand finale is also not devoid of sense, for all those who have studied history and know what were the Cathars.But the film is not only based on demonic mysteries, rare books and enigmatic places. The actors greatly contributed to the quality of the final work, with Depp to give evidence of tremendous versatility and talent, and Langella wisely using his grim appearance and incredibly dense voice to build a very calm character, but extremely scary and dark. Lena Olin is excellent, and although its no longer a young girl, she managed to build a great and sexually powerful character. But one of the strangest and most controversial characters is played by Emmanuelle Seigner, the wife of Roman Polanski. Its an attractive girl whose name is never revealed, but it will follow throughout the film, never showing clearly what it is, or who she is, despite giving various clues and proofs of supernatural powers and to know more about the events than it really wants to reveal. Guess who she is...The sets and shooting locations were chosen carefully, to give the film a dark and Gothic look. The photograph, something misty and dark, will also give their contribution to this environment, as well as the soundtrack, which is a great quality. It's a movie to see and review, although only people with some insight will be able to understand the film in its entirety.",The Ninth Gate
47,Tweetienator,The Art of the Devil,7,23 September 2019,"Well, luckily The Ninth Gate is way better than the way our hero handles the antique and ueber-rare books - smoking, drinking coffee or booze while torturing the pages... If I got such books and someone would treat them like that I would personally grant him a trip to hell - pronto, fast and clean ;)
Anyway, The Ninth Gate is one of Mr. Depp's better movies before he got totally ""sparrowed"". What you get is a nice little mystery with some taste of the devil. Not excellent but good.",The Ninth Gate
48,imseeg,"666 reviews were written on Imdb about a somewhat ridiculous story about the devil. This is the 667 th review, debunking any silly magic this movie portrays.",6,28 April 2019,"It was an average, yet quite decent slowburning and suspenseful movie UNTILL the last 15 minutes, in which the climax was just a bit silly. From 7 stars downgraded to 6, because of this particularly silly (predictable) ending.The story is about Jonny Depp searching for 3 copies of an infamous, extremely valuable, historic book about the devil. While searching for it, his life gets endangered. Will he succeed in finding these 3 books written about the devil or will he die trying? That is the cliffhanger of this story.Everything about this movie is rather average. Photography, soundtrack and editing are all ok-ish, but nothing great either.And that stings, because this movie wants to be grand and mysterious, yet looks a little bit silly. Johnny Depp's performance doesnt help much either, because he is somewhat of a comical character, which deflates the mystery instead of building it up. I would have rather seen Jack Nicholson perform this role. Jack could easily have performed a devious devilish character. But that's 20-20 hindsight...Concluding: this is a quite nice, slowburning bookdetective story, but one cant certainly expect any greatness. It will make pass the time quite nicely though.

49,Vartiainen,Blunders its great premise,6,11 December 2020,"Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a rare book dealer, who gets commissioned to hunt down three copies of an extremely rare book, said to have been written by the Devil himself. But is he the only one hunting for them and what does his employer intend to do once they get their hands of them?The film was directed by Roman Polanski, one of the great names of the horror genre, and it definitely shows. The film has a great style, heavy atmosphere and enough gothic religious imagery to choke a nun. Whenever the Devil and his presence is spoken about or on the screen, the film works marvelously.That being said, the story is not told all that well. The biggest issue is the lack of stakes. For most of the film, Corso is simply wandering around Europe, talking to people, examining these paintings. We don't get any sense of urgency or why it matters whether he succeeds or not. Sure, there's some tension, because, you know, the Devil was mentioned, but it's nothing concrete.It's not until the end that something starts to happen with any speed, but by then it's too little too late. Not helping the matters is the fact that the ending doesn't make much sense and doesn't offer enough answers or resolutions to satisfy the viewer.The Ninth Gate is a good film if you're really into religious symbolism and like the kind of atmosphere these films have. It's not a good film at all if you're just looking for a good story to experience.",The Ninth Gate
50,GOWBTW,It's right in front of your face!,8,16 May 2018,"This movie deserve credit. It has great cast, a great plot, but questionable critiques. Johnny Depp plays rare book collector Dean Corso. Very articulate with his job. Very cutthroat as well. He gets the books cheap, and sells to the highest bidder. But a client name Boris Balkan(Frank Langella) gives him a opportunity he will never forget. He gets to check out and compare 3 books written by the Devil. One of them is exact and the others are forgeries. One is made by the author who committed suicide, and the widow(Lena Olin) tries to get it back from Corso. In New York, Corso gives the book to the owner of the rare bookstore. He would keep it save after he was killed. Corso goes to Spain where another man is drowned. But Corso isn't alone, he would encounter a mysterious woman(Emmanuelle Seigner) who seems to help him all the way. 
The movie was long, but it wasn't boring. Plenty of suspense. It was amazing when the widow got the book back and tried to do the ritual with the book, but is killed by Balkan and he scared off the Satan worshippers. The great parts of the scenes is when Balkan tried to make himself loyal to Satan, but when he sets himself ablaze, he got what he deserved, betrayed. The background of the castle on fire, makes a perfect setting for the sex scene between the Girl and Corso. Memorable to say the least. 
There are some good and bad points on this film. But to me, it was worth my while.

51,FiendishDramaturgy,"Tense, edgy little bit of dark drama. Not bad.",7,30 December 2003,"Okay, Edward Scissorhands threw me off Depp completely. Benny & Joon was NOT a good movie, in my opinion, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape was good, but at the same time, weirdly atrocious.But of late, I'll say in the past few years, Depp has risen above his little avant-garde style of role choices and thankfully, so has his performance quality. While he seems to loathe the mainstream, he fits into it quite well, in my opinion.The Ninth Gate was a HP Lovecraft-esquire story in which Depp's character is an antique book dealer sent out to compare three copies of a book most dire. His job is to authenticate the copy held by his employer.There are some slow spots where not even character development is being utilized, and Emmanuelle Seigner's acting talents are practically non-existent. Those are the down-sides of this production.Beyond that, the story was dark and riddled with intrigue, the direction was adequate, and Depp's performance was outstanding. Too bad this movie did not rate his attempts. The potential for greatness was wasted here. The best aspect of this movie was Depp and the almost good story line which was botched somewhere along the path to the cutting room. It had such a great potential, but this production fell far short of realizing that potential.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend.",The Ninth Gate

53,jamesrupert2014,"Interesting and moody supernatural mystery let down somewhat by weak, predictable climax",7,6 April 2020,"Antique book hustler Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is hired by obsessed collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to hunt down all remaining copies of a medieval book allegedly co-authored by Satan. As the bodies of book collectors (usually a pretty safe occupation) begin to mount, Corso realises that other people, and maybe other things, are looking for the same tomes. Disgraced (in some eyes) director Roman Polanski does an excellent job in building tension and unworldliness (helped by Wojciech Kilar's score) as Corso travels through France, Portugal, and Spain locating the books and piecing together the mystical message hidden in the etchings. Depp is very good as the somewhat unlikable reluctant-hero and the rest of the cast is fine. The most intriguing character is the enigmatic 'The Girl' (as she is credited, Emmanuelle Seigner), who seems to be some kind of guide (although who/what she is and to where she is guiding is unstated - there is much speculation on-line). Unfortunately, much more could have been done with the character - there are a couple of hints early in the story that she is preternatural (she seems to almost fly at moments) but when confronted she reverts to a very mundane (and clichéd) action-movie brawler, which is a lot less interesting. The film has great sense of sombre menace that unfortunately is marred by a couple of scenes that look like they are lifted from one of Hammer Film's less-inspired fright-flicks (such a Liana Telfer's (Lena Olin) post-coital attack on a satisfied looking Corsa) and the entire Satanic ceremony scene, with acolytes enrobed in what looks like black prom-dress material and wearing the kind of pentagram jewellery you see for sale in goth-shops (admittedly, Polanski's intent may have been to make the devil-worshippers look silly and ineffectual (as per Balkan's accusations), but if so, it rubs off on the movie). The climax is a bit weak and inexplicable (given what the audience has been told) and after all of the Latin (or faux-Latin, I wouldn't know the difference), Balkan's incanting in English seems out of place. The final scenes with Corso and Girl, and the near-epiphany closing shots almost make up for the preceding climax but would have been more satisfying if the Girl's character had been deeper (not necessarily 'explained', just more developed). Anti-smokeristas beware, the film is full of fire and ash imagery, so not surprisingly Corso is a chain smoker.",The Ninth Gate

The storyline Involves a rare book dealer that is hired to hunt down three books supposedly written by the devil himself.

This movie is directed by legend Roman Polanski (Chinatown) and stars Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands), Frank Langella (The Box), Lena Olin (Chocolat) and Emmanuelle Seigner (Frantic). The storyline for this picture is pretty interesting, intricate and well delivered - like a devil version of the Da Vinci Code. There's some great action scenes too including a great one with a flaming wheel chair. The cast delivers fantastic performances and Depp is really good in this as you'd expect.

But Polanski has got a good, if basic, grasp of occult atmospherics. His detail is well-researched and convincingly portrayed (in a Wheatley-esque sort of way).

Also in line with The Exorcist and The Omen, this film has excellent production values, a good cast with an intelligent script, and even a bit of mystery woven in. I did not care for the ending, which I will not reveal, but it appeared to be a bit abrupt. Depp is very good in this role, and controls himself most of the time from being too cutesy and irreverent. He still maintained his persona of being clever and intelligent, without being sappy. The story line is interesting and may have been a bit too deep for the average American moviegoer, who is really not that literate.

Some images are really impressive in this movie and will stay on your mind for a while. I don't want to reveal too much but the movie includes a creepy murder scenery in France and a very unique sex scene for example. Even the locations and the different languages spoken in the movie are exotic and add a very special touch that should please to those who are interested in foreign history and culture.Even though there are some lengths in the beginning of the movie and even though the book still beats this adaption, this Gothic and occult thriller is a must see for any cinematic maniac when director legend Roman Polanski and one of the most brilliant actors of all times with Johnny Depp work together. The movie gets more and more intense, atmospheric and dynamical with every minute and has some good ideas even though I thought the devilish ending was a little bit too predictable after all but it leaves you on a rather mysterious and uneasy note instead of having a mainstream conclusion. The book and the movie are definitely extraordinary despite a few little and definitely pardonable flaws.Anybody who likes to have a dark ride should get in and watch this gripping and unforgettable flick.

However, The Ninth Gate provided some escape.Johnny Depp played a role which seemed meant only for him, considering the moribound nature of the character's demeanor. The cinematography was very good, and the deep, baroque soundtrack really brought some atmosphere. In a way, it did the same thing for books what Pi did for math: make it more interesting than it naturally appears to be. A solid film to watch.",The Ninth Gate
62,Jonny_Numb,Ponderous Polanski,6,13 May 2006,"On a purely technical level, Roman Polanski has made some of the most entertaining, enrapturing long movies in the history of cinema. ""The Ninth Gate"" is another epic that goes on for over 2 hours, but ultimately suffers from a distinct lack of wonder and urgency. For a film whose theme regards the revival of Lucifer through an ancient text, it never feels overly apocalyptic. It doesn't help that our protagonist, rare-book dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp, still excellent), is so mercenary in his quest that he never displays much in the way of human emotion (he barely reacts to the death of a collaborator, for instance). Lena Olin shows up in a few scenes as a femme fatale; Frank Langella plays a millionaire looking to conjure up Old Scratch (and quite literally 'phones in' his performance). Polanski's overall execution is rambling--15 or 20 minutes could have easily been shaved off this baby, and the end result would have been a much more economical picture. However, he wrings as much passion from the B-level material as possible, and winds up with a result that is not on par with his previous works, but still not all that bad.",The Ninth Gate
63,Steffi_P,"""Something a little less conspicuous""",7,8 March 2012,"The Ninth Gate was not a movie that fared particularly well either commercially or critically, in spite of a high-profile star and a producer-director who has successfully straddled both art-house and popular filmdom for decades. It does admittedly begin with some rather awkward premises. First of, all it wants us to believe that second-hand booksellers are a bunch of amoral double-dealers generally lacking any sense of human decency (and for all I know they may well be). It then goes on to try and convince us that that nice young man Johnny Depp is just such a bastard. It's a shock, I know, but give the movie some time. There's intriguing stuff afoot here.Roman Polanski co-wrote as well as directed this thing, and he has constructed a tight if rather bizarre little thriller. As opposed to the relentless pacing typical to the genre, Polanski employs a slow, creeping style, with lots of long takes and a moody, wandering camera. The opening shot is oddly brilliant, taking us from a cityscape in through a window (like the first shot of Psycho, but facing outwards), so that the view recedes to a vanishing point. The eerie quietness of the picture's design makes for some effective shocks. When Depp is at the old man's house, he's reading quietly, makes a discovery, and then the phone rings. The phone call has no bearing on the plot, but it's timed right to make the audience jump. Polanski populates the picture with the different and the unexpected – a bodyguard with bleach-blond hair, a Sikh taxi driver, a set of identical twins (part of a symbolic theme of doubles and copies). Throughout the movie little things are creeping into the frame, not intrusively but enough to sneak them into our consciousness. Some are clues, others are red herrings, such as the attention drawn to the secretary's oranges.As for Mr Depp, he's cast against type, and reacts by underplaying the role. He's a performer who shines brightest when at his most flamboyant, and though by no means bad, he is simply not very exciting here. Meanwhile Emmanuelle Seigner acts about as well as bread pudding, although being she does at least look right for the part (sexy yet evil). Frank Langella is the only player to really stand out – you can truly believe in him as a fusty old book collector who's gone to the dark side.Other than the wonky acting, there are a handful of things to dislike about The Ninth Gate. The occasional attempts at action seem poorly staged and out of place. A particular blunder was the idea of those slow-motion jumps that Seigner does, which remove a lot of the ambiguity around her character. But in spite of these flaws the movie is good enough at being a thriller that it manages to hold our interest for its two hour runtime, which in all fairness is more than many technically less-flawed movies can boast.",The Ninth Gate
64,ShootingShark,Literate And Intelligent But Scary And Fun Satanic Plot Horror Flick,7,17 July 2005,"A dealer in rare books takes a job from a sinister figure to investigate the authenticity of the three surviving copies of a medieval tome, The Nine Gates, rumoured to have been written in collaboration with the Devil. He uncovers a satanic secret hidden across all three books, which leads to double-crossing, murder, and ultimately a gateway to Hell.Based on the book El Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte, this is a beautifully creepy horror-odyssey film, as hero Depp sinks inexorably into the mystery, struggling at first to give credence to his mission but ultimately being seduced by the possibilities it might lead to. All-important atmosphere is perfectly judged by Polanski, with excellent camera-work by Darius Khondji and the brilliant use of the Seigner character. Credited only as ""The Girl"", this mysterious and seemingly all-knowing figure may be a demon or even Satan himself (herself ?). The movie wisely never explains her presence, and uses only the subtlest of touches to suggest her other-worldliness. She is a fascinating figure to try and fathom. The cast are the usual assortment of Polanski wackos (including production manager Jose Lopez Rodero as identical-twin brothers, would you believe), and all acquit themselves well. Depp is terrific, playing a bewildered middle-aged sceptic without histrionics, thereby giving the movie a crucially ordinary centre from which the madness can spiral out. At one point when asked by Seigner what he plans to do as they confront some heavies he says, ""I was going to hide behind you."". Langella does a textbook job in Menacing as Depp's Faust of a client (there's a lovely moment where he breaks up a satanic-cult meeting by shouting ""Boo"" at the crowd), Olin is her usual deliciously depraved femme-fatale, and Jefford is wonderful as a crisp no-nonsense French aristocrat. Polanski has crafted an intelligent, enigmatic, spine-tingling, literary horror-film, set against a marvellous international backdrop, with a great script and cast. This film proves that horror and culture need not be mutually exclusive.",The Ninth Gate
65,truemythmedia,"Not Great, Not Terrible; Acceptable",6,21 October 2019,"I generally really enjoy Polanksi's films (""Chinatown"", ""Repulsion""). I think even his lesser films, like ""The Ninth Gate"", have some moments that make them worth watching. I had seen ""Ninth Gate"" once before my most recent viewing, and I remembered thinking that it was an alright film with one or two scenes that really stood out, but I also remember thinking that overall this entry into Polanski's oeuvre wasn't particularly memorable or groundbreaking (not when compared to some of his classics anyways). My second viewing has solidified my original assessment: for Polanski, this is nothing special, but, I still think that it's worth watching for those who have an interest in the director. It's not a bad film, but it's a bit too long, and many of the scenes that are supposed to be wrought with tension are rather emotionless and sometimes even a bit dry, and the topic is similar enough for ""Gate"" to draw comparison to a far superior film in his filmography (""Rosemary's Baby"").",The Ninth Gate

67,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Mystery with Dark Undertones,9,8 September 2019,"This was a film that I remember watching when it hit the movie channels and I loved it. There was something with the mystery that sucked me in. I love the idea of this book and trying to authentic it as well as the cult that is interested in it as well. To get into this though, the synopsis is a rare book dealer, while seeking out the last two copies of a demon text, gets drawn into a conspiracy with supernatural overtones.We start this film off with a man as he is committing suicide. He writes a letter, before hanging himself. We then meet Dean Corso (Johnny Depp). He is looking a book collection for a family. The father had a stroke and he's unable to walk or speak. He tells them what it is worth and they're eyes get big. There's a four volume of Don Quixote that he purchase. It is as Corso is leaving that the numbers he told them are exaggerated, making it difficult for his competitors.He then goes to a lecture done by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella). Corso notices a girl, Emmanuelle Seigner, in the audience and she looks at him. Corso dozes off and has to be woken up by Balkan. The reason that Corso is there is Balkan has obtained a copy of a book called The Ninth Gate. There are supposedly three copies in the world and Balkan wants to know if the one has is real or not. He wants to make sure they all are authenticated and if there's any differences or not. Corso takes Balkan's copy and heads out. He seeks out Bernie (James Russo), a rare book dealer, as well as other contacts. This will take him over to Europe where the other two copies are held in Portugal and France.The problem is that he is being followed by Liana Telfer (Lena Olin). Her husband was the one who killed himself and he sold the book to Balkan. She wants it back as it wasn't his to give away. The girl is also following him, but she is quite cryptic in her responses. There is also a strange black man as well who is after him as well. This all leads him on a dark journey of discovery of the truth to this book and the cult that wants it.Now as I kind of said, I used to really like this film, but I'm sure that I hadn't seen this in like 20 years. I wasn't sure if it was going to hold up. Interesting enough, I actually read the book off of a recommendation from a podcaster I'm a big fan of and it was like 20 pages in that I realized it. The mystery of this film is something that really sucks me in.The book that Corso is looking into I find to be extremely interesting. The pictures in it have an eerie feel to it. It is even cooler that he figures out there are variations to the books and that there's technically one true copy, but there is much more to the story of what is going on there.There's also a cult we learn around the middle of the film and that is something else that I'm a fan of. There is something so creepy about it and how they're done in secret that I am intrigued by. What happens to start off the climax is what I actually envision a cult like this with the type of people in would actually be. This film though does take more of possible supernatural feel than the novel. It also is much darker if I'm going to be perfectly honest.Next I want to move into the pacing of the film. This one runs about 2 hours and 15 minutes. For that running time, I never really got bored to be honest. I think part of that is co-writer/director Roman Polanski knows how to build atmosphere. The moment the book is introduced, there is just this impending dread that Corso can feel. There is something that happens in New York that makes him want out and this is literally like 30 minutes into the movie. I really like that we can feel that in order to proceed, he has to lose himself and he knows it. That makes it even darker for me. I don't mind the ending overall.To the acting of the film, I thought it was pretty solid if I'm honest. This is actually one of my favorite Depp roles. He just embodies this guy. There is a bit of sleaziness to him, but for the most part he's a good guy. The type of work he deals in I love, especially the investigation part. The problem though is that he kind of has to work outside the rules at times. Langella is solid here. I just kind of wish there was more of him. Olin is quite attractive. Seigner is interesting as she is mysteriously always there. There's a supernatural element to her, but it is played so low key, you aren't sure if it is real. We do see her topless as well. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.As for the effects of the film, they aren't a lot and what we get is mostly practical. We get a bit of blood that looks real. There is something cool done with the girl's eyes that I liked. The only CGI I can remember is the fire that is during the climax. For it being done with computers, this is actually some of the better use here as fire can be extremely difficult to create. The film is also shot beautifully, especially the castle like structure in the end.Now with that said, this was one that I really liked back in the day and wasn't sure how it was going to hold up. Surprisingly I still really enjoy it. This is a later Polanski film and I would say that with this one, he still had it. I really like the mystery of this book and what Corso is finding as he looks into it. Being that there's a cult involved as well, you have me on board. It is paced in a way that despite its longer runtime, I never get bored. I'm waiting to see what happens next. There aren't a lot of effects, but what we get is good, even the CGI fire is fine. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it fit the scenes and I have no issues there. Not a great movie, but definitely very good. I still really like it and would recommend this to horror and non-horror fans alike.",The Ninth Gate
68,Samiam3,"A mysterious thriller that is watchable, but has little to offer",6,16 August 2010,"For a two hour plus feature, (which is plenty of time) The Ninth Gate, doesn't manage to accomplish as much as it probably could have. The problem with the movie basically comes down to a lack of ambition. As a mystery it is not terribly involving, and as a thriller, not too exciting either. The story is not very complicated, and does make progress, but only in baby steps, and when all is said and done, you feel like you've only gone about ten feet.The Nine Gates is a book supposedly written by the devil himself. Only three copies remain, one is in the possession of Boris Balkin in New York. Balkin hires renowned dealer Dean Corso to go to Europe to search for the other two copies. He is suspicious that one is a forgery. The more Corso discovers, the more danger he is putting himself in. Someone else is after those books, and will kill to get them.simplicity is usually a positive attribute in movies, but not with this one. The story line, is unoriginal, and it doesn't come to life until the last fifteen minutes. There are hints that The Ninth Gate could've been something more interesting. Just occasionally it flirts with Christianity related fantasy, but chooses not to embrace this. Something else that gets squandered is Johnny Depp's acting ability. He does a credible job, given the limited depth and scope of his character, but he is essentially just a body to be moved from one place to the next.The Ninth Gate, is watchable, but it never gets off the ground. It is a gate whose doors are closed to the possibility of something more epic or clever.",The Ninth Gate
69,Spleen,You can almost smell the old books,10,23 November 2001,"If I were compiling a 1999 top-ten list the first two places would be easy (""Topsy-Turvy"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut""), and the following seven slots could be filled without too much soul-searching; after that, the levels of quality start to blur into one another, and tenth spot would pose a problem.  In the end, out of sheer perversity, I'd probably give the nod to ""The Ninth Gate"" - nobody else seemed to like it much, but unlike the dozens of gimmick-heavy pieces critics and audiences of 1999 evidently preferred, at least it's a FILM, not an illustrated manifesto.The premise is delicious: an obscure old book (Polanski makes it seem just as real and as rooted in history as the King James Bible), rumoured to be written by the devil, exists in just three copies, and the New York millionaire who owns one of them has reason to think that two of the three are, in a sense, forgeries - written by the author to whom the book is officially attributed, yet differing subtly from the diabolical original. He sends a young dealer in rare books (Brad Pitt, magnetic as ever) over to Europe to investigate.Europe turns out to have the same quality of overcast twilight as New York - it seem as though the entire story takes place in a comforting, enveloping, Old-World kind of semi-darkness.  (Polanski gets all the little details right.)  The score is as well judged as the photography, and every cast member, down to each single, obscure, walk-on bibliophile, fits neatly and memorably into his or her role (I had no idea it was even possible to assemble a cast of character actors as good as this, these days).  The real treat is watching the investigation.  Soon enough (but not too soon), we discover the secret of the three books, and it turns out to be a trick worthy of the devil - a genuinely cunning, even sophisticated, idea in its most visually accessible form, perfect for a diabolical folktale.",The Ninth Gate
70,Seraphion,A curiosity tickling plot,7,6 August 2014,"The story opens up in a shocking fashion, straight with a disturbing scene, strongly suggestive although not directly graphic. The story unravels piece by piece in a good manner and steady pace. The end finale though is rather greatly predictable since there are very revealing hints repeated throughout the movie, and centered on just one character. The hidden conflicts don't really explain themselves clearly though. The conflictive relation between Liana and Boris doesn't get to be clear even to the end of the movie. The acting is nice. I enjoy Depp's performance here. He gets into character well and managed to get the character's habits to be performed just as a normal habitual person does them. Having Frank Langella to anchor the final conflict in is also great in giving depths to the early conflict start and the finale.",The Ninth Gate
71,Rob_Taylor,A pretty good mystery/horror movie overall.,8,26 January 2003,"In the era of Hollywood action blockbusters, it was a pleasant surprise to witness a movie that did not rely on endless explosions and special effects to keep the audience enthralled.Ninth Gate is memorable in that it catches your interest. Essentially a mystery, you follow Depp's character as he tries to unravel the secrets of a book reputed to summon up the Devil.There's plenty of mysticism and occultism threatened throughout the movie, but it isn't until the end that it really makes an appearance. At that point I was uncomfortably reminded of such classics as ""The Devil Rides Out"" in terms of people in robes etc.. Or as I've heard it referred to ""Mumbo-Jumbo, Dennis Wheatley"".The cast is not particularly brilliant, though Depp is reasonably good. He seems to be trying to carve out a niche for himself in strange films involving mystery and horror. Perhaps he fancies himself as the next Peter Cushing? In any event, a competent performance and the other members are bearable.It's not a film you can watch many times and enjoy, unless you miss the point of it the first time around, when a second viewing might help fill in some holes.The only thing I can say negatively about it really is to do with the basic premise of the book in the film. It's supposed to be allow the Devil to be reborn, but I can't help but think that, if I was the Devil and had ""co-wrote"" the book, I wouldn't have made it so convoluted and blasted difficult to get to the bottom of things.Anyway, a different type of movie from the usual action-fests, and refreshing because of it.",The Ninth Gate
72,Sandcooler,"Not a masterpiece, but still wonderfully macabre",8,1 January 2012,"""The Ninth Gate"" is one of those clever, thought-out, dark thrillers that always seem to go under the radar at first. At the box office it was a total flop, but over the years the appreciation seems to have grown exponentially. It's still not a mainstream type of thing by any means, but it does have somewhat of a cult status now. A thriller about a guy (even if the guy is Johnny Depp) who traces books for a living is a hard sell, maybe that's why people seemed hesitant to acknowledge it's existence. It's totally worth it though. I'm not saying ""The Ninth Gate"" is a perfect film, but it's atmosphere can't be beat. The fantastic soundtrack, the beautiful locations (particularly when on fire), the quirky local characters: the movie has so many impressive stylish touches you can forgive the occasional contrived scene. The plot is just your average running from here to there and back and you also get some weird coincidences that tie everything together, but like I said that's not really the point of the movie anyway. Just lose yourself in the occult style and enjoy the ride.",The Ninth Gate

This movie is definitely a well-made film--a great opening credit sequence, an enjoyable original musical score by one of my favourite composers, the Polish Wojciech Kilar, and intelligent sound editing, good photography, notable performances by Olin and Depp in particular, and last but not least a mature direction of the script.What made me sit up, however, is that another film with a similar structure was made by another famous director using the same haunting minimalistic score on piano several times during the film, the very same year--Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.

Before I saw the movie, someone told me the director only made this movie because of commercial reasons, meaning that he needed to do this movie to get money from a big studio for another project and that he probably didn't work on it with his heart and soul...Not a good start to watch a movie, i know. But I have to say that i was pleasantly surprised. Of course this isn't one of his best movies, of course it's sometimes a bit predictable, but did it bother me? Not really. In the end I liked it. The story is about the book detective Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) who has to check if the rare book of one of his clients is real. There are three copies in the world and the owner believes he's got the only real one.

Other characters are not veru persuasive, too. Apart from very blatant goofs as for handling old books, and excessive smoking, the whole idea seems laughable and at times void. It also smacks of total boredom that Depp vivdly possesses while on the limelight.

However here as the story is approaching the end it begins to look like if Polanski had not the slightest idea how the movie would end and how could he disentangle the plot he has built scene after scene. Because the screenplay at the same time it's developing itself, become weaker and weaker till it reaches a climax which looks more than an anticlimax in so far as it is so inconclusive and meaningless and looking as if the director decided to end the story by any means since he didn't know how to untie the skein he had coiled.

78,tomsview,The Devil and the Depp,8,28 March 2015,"The journey is definitely the most enjoyable aspect of ""The Ninth Gate"". Although some feel the final destination is a bit of a let down, I don't think it's all that bad; it would be hard for any ending to be totally satisfying after the long and absorbing build-up, which occupies most of the movie.Johnny Depp was the perfect choice to play Dean Corso, the slightly disreputable book dealer who receives a commission from wealthy book collector, Boris Balkan, to find copies of a rare book supposedly written by the Devil. Frank Langella gives Boris Balkan lashings of the urbane and cultivated gravitas that he has honed to perfection over the years.Corso's journey takes him to some fantastic locations across Europe and these add to the richness of the film. He also meets fascinating characters along the way including two beautiful women played by Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner, who with their broad cheekbones and calm exteriors have a similar, arresting look; they could almost be sisters.Polanski is such a clever filmmaker that we are led to believe that rare book collecting is just about the most important pursuit in the world. The look of the film is sumptuous and there are some delicious exchanges between Corso and Balkan, reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet in ""The Maltese Falcon"".In fact, the book at the centre of the story, ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"", acts in much the same way as does the falcon in Huston's classic movie - it's the 'McGuffin' that drives everything forward. Despite English being his second language, Polanski has always had an ear for the language, and the script has a lightness of touch helped in the playing by a slightly tongue-in-cheek performance by Depp and a slightly over-the-top one by Langella.Polanski's films always have great music and Wojciech Kilar contributed an atmospheric score for this one, with an appropriately quirky theme for Corso as well as some suitably eerie passages for the supernatural elements.For anyone who likes movies that are built around intriguing investigations, this film delivers. I have seen it quite a few times and enjoy it just as much each time - I think that is about the best endorsement you can give any movie.",The Ninth Gate

The film is professionally made but there's absolutely nothing in it: no interesting characters, no interesting drama, no interesting setting, no interesting story, etc. Everyone looks like they just showed up for work, shot some scenes and went back home. No one, and I mean no one looks interested in what they're doing. His previous films, including FRANTIC, suffer from this as well. Everything is simply a job to Roman ""Punch your card and grab your paycheck"" Polanski.Polanski's films are usually overdirected products but his earlier films had a flair of fun and a definitive ting of danger in them.

The fact that it has a supernatural undertow to it makes it intriguing and helps one to pay attention as the subject matter of itself is mysterious enough. Trying to make the movie make sense by comparing to real world doesn't work. You have to suspend beliefs and be entertained. The lead is hired to track down books that are sort of a puzzle that answer a riddle of a sort that develops within the movie. The premise?

The guy who was hired (Depp) to track down the clues for the man who wants to get to know Satan personally gets interested himself as the clues surface and questions are answered. Now, it becomes a race if you will to figure it out and bring closure to the quest but who will it be? Who will get the invitation?

84,classicalsteve,Underrated Horror Film Which Also Explores the World of Antiquarian Books,8,4 April 2015,"Supernatural horror and antiquarian books have interesting overlaps. There is something mystical about ancient and medieval books, especially those with covers which look like medieval doors, potentially unlocking mysteries within. For many centuries, books were regarded as far beyond mere utilitarian objects for the transmission of information. They were seen as carriers of secret wisdom of the ancients and even powerful transmitters of taboo knowledge. The Book of Kells, produced in the 8th century, was regarded as a holy item with divine power. ""The Ninth Gate"" fuses the world of antiquarian books within the genre of supernatural horror.Loosely based on Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel ""The Club Dumas"", the story concerns Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), an amoral book scout and dealer who trades in antiquarian books, predominantly those printed prior to 1800. These tomes are quite distinct from the modern hardcover editions published today in millions of copies. Each copy of an antiquarian book produced pre-1800 had to be hand-printed on presses and hand-bound. They are found in leather and vellum bindings, some of them commissioned by the nobility. The paper used in older books is of a superior quality than today, making them desirable to a number of eclectic collectors willing to pay large sums to acquire these treasures. Corso, often using deceitful tactics which would make used car salesmen seem like saints, attains these items and resells them for hefty sums to moneyed albeit eccentric collectors. In an early scene, Corso over-appraises a rare book collection (called high-balling) in order to attain a sought-after set for cheap. (For those of you who know about antiquarian books, the set is actually the so-called ""Ibara Don Quixote"", printed in 1780. Although not a first edition, the Ibara Don Quixote is regarded as the finest edition of Cervantes' novel ever published, with engravings by the best artist of Spain at the time.)Corso is then hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), an eccentric scholar and high-end book collector obsessed with the supernatural, the occult, and the underworld. (It is not uncommon for wealthier book collectors to hire book scouts as agents to find particular editions.) Balkan reveals to Corso his rare book collection which has an interesting focus: antiquarian books whose subject is the Devil. However aside from the many hundreds of volumes of books in leather and vellum, there is one recent acquisition which is Balkan's prized possession: a particular 17th-century book called ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"". According to Balkan, ""The Nine Gates"" is a book of spells written by the Devil himself, and if used correctly can be used to summon the Devil in person. The book was printed in 1666 (of course) and features medieval-like woodcut engravings on nine of its pages preceding each of its chapters or ""gates"". Only three known copies are extent, according to Balkan, and he wants Corso to tract down the other copies in antiquarian libraries in Europe. (Unlike the Ibara Don Quixote, ""The Nine Gates"" is not a real 17th century book, as far as I know.)So begins a suspense-thriller in which antiquarian libraries and supernatural horror become unlikely bedfellows. During Corso's travels, he meets eccentric characters whose only commonality is their love for ancient, medieval and renaissance books. Shortly after Corso accepts Balkan's assignment, the widow of the man who owned The Nine Gates makes an unexpected call, wanting the book back, claiming her husband would never have sold it to Balkan. There are Spanish twins who repair and sell such books, often allowing their cigarette ash to fall on the covers of books hundreds of years old. He encounters a collector who views his books like children. And there's a wheel-chair bound old woman who takes an immediate disliking towards Corso, questioning his intentions.This film may be the only one of its kind in cinema to tour the world of antiquarian books and their corresponding collections. Differences between copies from the same edition, called states, are also explored, a detail of book collecting which may not have ever been demonstrated in another film in English. While art collectors, collections, and heists receive far more cinematic treatment, antiquarian books and collectors exist underneath the radar. Certainly not for all tastes, and only about 50% of Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel, ""The Ninth Gate"" is still a fun fresh horror-suspense thriller and not to be missed if you're a bibliophile. If you also like horror books, this film is definitely a treat in its original first edition.",The Ninth Gate

86,one9eighty,Supernatural/ Occult mystery adventure - fun but dark,8,7 August 2017,"Johnny Depp plays a book specialist, Dean Corso, who's hired to by Frank Langella's Boris Balkan to authenticate an occult books called the Ninth Gate. With one of only three remaining copies of this book to hand, the others being destroyed over time by the Church and religious fanatics, he travels to Portugal and France to compare the book against the other two surviving copies. He comes to the conclusion that all three remaining copies share a secret but before he can investigate fully he's thrust into an adventure he isn't ready for which exposes him to a dark underworld he wasn't aware of. Not everything is as it seems, and not everyone is who they suggest they are.This is an underrated and brilliantly intelligent film which shows that you don't need glitzy special effects to make a film which audiences will enjoy. A good story and some suspense with occasional mystery will trump Hollywood CGI any day (although I have to admit that there is some elements of CGI in the film but for the most part it's low key and not too obvious). This film probably isn't for the fast-food film fans of today, it's not an action film and if you have a brain you can see lots of layers to the film - unlike modern films which are 'what you see is what you get'. Directed by Roman Polanski and primarily filmed in central Europe (due to being wanted for crimes in America) the audience is kept on tenterhooks as it follows Depp's character on his journey of discovery and danger. The film is based on the book ""El Club Dumas"" by Arturo Pérez-Reverte which looks at secret satanic societies attempts to meet with the Devil himself (or herself). I'd lump this film in with other supernatural/occult films, the likes of ""End of Days"" (although there is a lot less action), ""Stigmata"" (but slower in pace), ""Don't look now"" (without the threat of a serial killer), ""The Wicker Man"" (without the orgies). It feels like an updated version of late 70's and early 80's supernatural/ occult films, maybe even some of the later Hammer House films which dealt with the Devil rather than monsters in the night. The audience learns information at the same time as Corso does so although it isn't a fast paced spectacle it is engaging, more in line with classic mystery films unlike modern ones where audiences have advanced knowledge of events, this is film 'school' not film 'kindergarten' after all. There is a lot more to this film than what you see on screen, it's like an onion with various layers of content, but some of it is a little too clever for modern audiences (sorry but it's true, especially when I read some of the reviews here which missed the point). I'm loving some of the reviews and theories found here and it's warming to see that despite the idiots who didn't get this there are some people who really did get a grasp of it, bravo to you. I enjoyed this and I'd happily watch it again. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10.",The Ninth Gate
87,CharltonBoy,Not for the lovers of Gore Horrors.,7,28 August 2002,The Ninth Gate is not exactly the the most fast paced horror i have ever seen in fact it is quite slow but not at all boring. The is a european made movie that has got a top Hollywood actor to play the lead role and it seems to have worked. Johnny Depp is a very watchable actor who makes the best of every role he takes on and because the story line is quite slow paced Depp makes the film very watchable because he is in nearly every scene. The story is about a Book collector/investigator who is asked to check the authenticity of a book that is supposed to be written by the devil himself.As i have said this is not a shock horror it is more of a thinking man's horror so if its a Scream type movie you are after dont bother but if its an intelligent horror that you want this is for you. 7 out of 10.,The Ninth Gate

Lured by the massive amount of money he's going to receive, he sets off right away only to soon find out that he will be putting his own life into peril.It's a very mysterious plot which keeps you wondering right from the beginning as the search is proving to have much more implications that one could have ever imagined. It is very complex and thus hard to anticipate what will happen next, managing to attract your attention most of the time. The main actor plays a very exciting role and plays it well while most of the other actors keep up with his performance. I witnessed some superficial scenes and some character's decisions which are quite hard to explain but nothing that can affect the overall experience. This story of the nine gates of hell deserves its nine stars rating, the only thing which kept me from giving it maximum score was its finale which wasn't as conclusive as I hoped.

His searches take him to Paris and other countries where he befalls some obstacles while trying to track down the books. Along the way, he meets ambiguous characters who trick him into being good or evil, depending on the point of view.The problem with this film is that the pacing was slow. Generally-speaking, it did have some good ideas, but it really failed to captivate me. It could have helped with chopping out some of the unnecessary plot and speeding up some of the scenes. It also was not very frightening. My personal taste gives it a 2/10. Pretty good idea, but it just quietly bit the dust.",The Ninth Gate

91,esteban1747,Another Polanski's mystery,6,11 May 2005,"Polanski once again directed an interesting mystery film-thriller starred by Johnny Depp and seconded by Polanski's wife, Emmanuele Seigner, and Lena Olin. From the very beginning one is trapped by the excitement and curiosity to know about the fate of copies of a particular book. In fact the excitement lasts only until the secret is discovered. The film although starts in New York where Polanski cannot be, it recreates mainly in Spain and cold Paris. The merit of this film is that instead of looking for a rare jewel, the agent (Depp) was trying to understand the mystery of a book. The environment of the film was all cultural since it shows three or four libraries, but also with some doses of violence. Instead of being a Superman, Depp behaved as a normal human being, only cautious when the circumstances demand to be like that. The film is good to be seen, in addition to its excitement, it gives also some entertainment.",The Ninth Gate

It's pace will cast a spell on some, while infuriate others.  But this is a gothic mystery, and everything happens for a reason. Polanski, the master of small details, once again wants the audience to figure things out for themselves.  Allow yourself to be lulled by the pace and sucked into the mystery and the details, and you will have a devilishly good time figuring this one out.  This isn't as great or as bold as some of his earlier horror films (i.e. ""Rosemary's Baby""), but Polanksi can still weave a tale for those who enjoy the macabre and bizarre.  This is worth a view for filmgoers those who enjoy more ""classic"" horror. 9/10",The Ninth Gate
94,Antagonisten,Lacking toolbox,6,30 November 2005,"I have been the owner of the excellent orchestral score to ""The Ninth Gate"" since it was released. I have listened to Wojciech Kilars music countless times and finally decided that perhaps i should also see the film the music was written for.I had heard many things about ""The Ninth Gate"" before watching it, both good and bad i might add. One of my friends holds it as one of his favorite movies, but he also expressed that it was demanding in the sense that it could seem bewildering to those who were not updated on the mythology. And i guess i am one of those people.. I though this movie was intriguing in many ways and i was not really disappointed by it. But still i feel that it has perhaps a bit too much mythology to it.Doing as Polanski does here, presenting a lot of events and a story but leaving the interpretation to the viewer, is usually something i appreciate. Perhaps i feel this time though that i don't have the necessary toolbox to really understand all of what Polanski wanted to say. Yes, he has a man (Balkan) who seems to be an avid satanist wanting to gain power through an ancient book. He uses an unknowing agent (Corso) to help him. And then others are entered into the mix on both sides of the fence so to speak. Even though i am fairly sure i understand the movie and it's events well, i still don't really know the significance of ""The Ninth Gate"" itself. I have heard that there are DVD's out there with a commentary track where Polanski elaborates on these subjects, unfortunately the DVD i bought is not one of them (that's what i get for being cheap!).So to sum things up i liked the movie but it leaves me somewhat unsatisfied in regards to it's resolution. That being said though i guess it might make a lot more sense to someone not being as 100% detached from religion as i am.6/10",The Ninth Gate

It is not the kind of movie you see every day, there is some degree of quality about it that, in my opinion, places it in the upper crust of movies.It is a slow movie, but I could not have seen it other wise. Because of the sense of intrigue about it this pace is just perfect, you keep yourself in front of the screen throughout.As it deals with the supernatural, that makes it interesting to stat with, but Polanski has done a great job for its audience and so has Depp.A genuine good movie, thrilling and atmospheric.9/10",The Ninth Gate

Johnny Depp shows us again he is the best actor in the world with his acting skills, how devoted he is to the character and how well it turns out. The story reminds me a bit of ""Sleepy Hollow"" in many forms. Both of them are mystery and fantasy movies, with elements such as religion, sorcery and a conspiracy going on. the movie impresses with its story, it's mostly easy to understand the plot and yet to be surprised by a few turning events.

Without much horror!I mean seriously the script sucked the spasmodic dramatic music made me laugh and the storyline hmm well it was obvious fairly early on that Polanski's missus was a for want of a better word Demon or as they say round my area up to no good!

So, The Ninth Gate is a slight disappointment. I like the film, and Depp, Olin and Polanski's wife Seigner are all great -- what's up with Depp's intonation though? -- but the film is too long, there are not many films that survives being over two hours long (I'll watch Summer of Sam tonight and to my great disappointment I saw that it was 134 minutes long) and The Ninth Gate certainly doesn't  -- it should have been at least half an hour shorter. And at times it gets too close to the ridiculous for it to be comfortable. Well, like I said, it's a good film, but it is seriously flawed. (6/10)",The Ninth Gate

I expected a lot better from the man that directed the classic film, Rosmary's Baby, but oh well.It starts off pretty interesting where an old man hangs himself and later on Johnny Depp gets hired to search for two copies of a rare book. His job is to compare the other books with the copy he already has to see which is authentic.I was a bit confused in some parts of the film and I think I got the ending, but I'm not quite sure. As usual Johnny Depp does a good performance as the book detective, Dean Corso. I still think his best roll is in the Tim Burton film, Sleepy Hollow.This is one of those slow-paced movie where not much action goes on or anything, but it's still interesting. I was hoping to see a few demons or maybe even Lucifer himself, but was dissapointed that nothing of the sort was shown in this movie.The only thing close to it was some blonde chick that apparently could glide in the air and make her eyes glow. There weren't any real scary parts and I don't even consider this a horror film. Blockbuster called it a Drama Mystery and usually they don't know anything about catagorizing films, but I hink they were right about this one.",The Ninth Gate
100,bat-5,"Interesting premise, but flawed at times.",6,16 March 2000,"What Roman Polanski excels at is creating character driven stories, and the problems that arise from the characters needs.  Johnny Depp is a book detective sent out into the world by Frank Langella to authenticate a book that is allegedly co-written by the devil himself.  Strange things occur as Depp gets closer to his goal, and he is aided along the way by a mysterious, unnamed girl.  Problem is, there are other forces working against Depp, and anyone who has come in contact with the book, or its companion volumes, has met with a ghastly fate.  What I liked about the movie was the way Polanski suggested that the devil need not be made of flesh and blood, but rather manifest himself in man.   Through man, the devil does his dirty work.  He lies, steals, cheats, kills, all the good stuff.  The film is shot well and we get lovely views of European locales, but the overall package is a mixed bag.  There were scenes that had me stifle a laugh, and I'm sure there was no comedic intention.  The ending left me a bit confused, and I can't say anymore or I'll spoil it for those who want to see the movie.

102,pfgpowell-1,Twaddle - sad but true,4,1 May 2009,"What a very odd film. Roman Polanski's at the helm, Johnny Depp gives it his all, we start with a lot of hi falutin' tho' under the circumstances reasonably classy guff about Satan and Lucifer, the whole thing gets off to a cracking pace with mysterious twists, then it degenerates into a made-for-TV movie and not a very good one at that. The only mystery here is, given Polanski's undoubted talent and back catalogue, that The Ninth Gate isn't substantially better. But it isn't. It is very ordinary indeed. As usual, and you can't blame them for this, IMDb headline their viewers' comments with the most positive reviews, and there you will be informed that this is 'a masterpiece', 'Polanski's most underrated work', there is even a serious claim that this is some kind of intellectual examination by Polanski of what movie-making is all about. Well, I'll take that claim with a large pinch of salt, and if, by chance, it is true, Polanski is kidding no one but himself. This is a potboiler, nothing more and nothing less, and I'm not at all sure that Polanski didn't have his tongue firmly in his cheek. The recurring theme music is oddly and insouciantly jaunty, and not at all in keeping with the deadly, deadly serious business of raising the Devil. I suspect that Polanski is having a good laugh at those who engage in that kind of hobby and quite possibly at those moviegoers who are prepared to take this kind of hokum seriously. Most of it is nicely filmed, after all, Polanski knows what he is doing, but the last third of the film, in all sorts of ways seems oddly rushed. In the end, The Ninth Gate is a disappointment. We are served up an interesting first course which promises several delectable subsequent courses. But all we get is a burger and Coke. The only place you will catch this is on late-night telly, which is where it belongs. And if anyone is inclined to bend your ear with tales of 'Polanski's forgotten/underrated/misunderstood masterpiece', find something else to do rather than waste a minute giving credence to twaddle like that.",The Ninth Gate
103,dansview,Interesting and Slow,6,18 January 2014,"I never got what people liked about Johnny Depp, but I kind of liked the way he played this part. There was something very natural about his portrayal of a sort of detached rare book dealer. What a weird and intriguing concept. A bachelor in his 30s who is kind of cynical and sleazy, but who makes a living dealing with articles of high culture.Frank Langella plays evil beautifully here.The director cast his young wife in the role of a mysterious stranger and she plays it with a truly eerie, all-knowing aloofness. The one thing I didn't get is why Depp's character never freaks out about this woman's special powers. How could he spend a whole movie seeking the key to evil and not notice the supernatural strangeness of his companion? He asks her who she is a few times, and then just accepts her as some weirdo who follows him.I loved the European settings and as much as violence and satanic themes normally disturb me, I have to say that the death scenes and portrayal of evil in certain characters really stuck with me.I see that many people on the net are attempting to explain the plot and conclusion. I think the best one I read had it right. The girl is the Devil and she's in love with Depp. So she guides him to her kingdom so to speak.I would have preferred more character development, but that is my complaint about most films. How did this guy become who he is? He is ultimately seduced by the devil. How does one go from being a book dealer to wanting to summon Satan? A little more background please.

And yet the story begins so great, a millionaire who collects old books wants to have the one that is written by Lucifer himself. Three of them exist and it's Depp's job to find out which one of the three is real and which ones are fake as after all there is only one real book. We don't tell the plot but the end will be different nontheless... Why is it so bad then? Hmmm too many unanswered questions, Polanski think it's important to start digging out some details but further in the movie it's like he has to give them an abrupt end (and no this movie is already too long so...) and the end itself just reminded me of ""Angel heart"", you see we saw it all before and for a moment I thought it'd be a brilliant movie if Johnny Depp only had to search for a rare book that wasn't written by the devil as the movie would have been much better without the cheap horrortricks (you aren't frightened one second if you wanna know...you even can use a clock just in case the eyes are closing down).",The Ninth Gate

A neo-noir mystery thriller about Devil worshipers...why not! Tonight's movie is Roman Polanski's flick The Ninth Gate (1999) starring the ever-versatile Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, a shady New York book dealer who is hired by a millionaire to authenticate a book, a legendary manual of satanic invocation ""The Nine Gates of the Shadow Kingdom"" which was allegedly written in collaboration with the Devil. Corso goes across to Europe to track the other copies and to make comparison with his findings. During his travels Corso comes across a sinister plot and finds himself in a labyrinth full of pitfalls and temptations, interesting and disturbing encounters and mysterious deaths.The movie overall is intriguing and entertaining as it is drenched in the occult with references to secret orders of celebrity and political persons...for those Illuminati beleivers. The direction of the film has great pacing and brings up a lot of questions in each scene which provides the final climatic scene as a riddle itself. Depp's performance is not quirky in comparison to his other performances. His take on Corso is cynical in particular of the occult and makes questionable ethical decisions in his journey to unravel the truth. To other it may seem flat however he brings the right tone of a man who just wants three things, a drink, money and the truth. The locations of the movie are beautifully shot and the filmmakers take of the girl with the green eyes is perfect.

And if not wants him to bring back the real one at any cost. Eventually find it himself Stockton pursued by strange figures and eventually set out to find out the truth about this scripture. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor and like many amazing actors when they're given the right script and direction they can make a movie Great but when they're not even though I can't hold it together this is one of the sensitive one the 19th is not want to Depp best or Polanski's. The concept of the film adds for an intriguing plot however but while it does offer a mystery that first entices you it becomes overall convoluted situation as the film progresses at a time as the patient does add up but help but it does feel as though there are many scenes that do they could've been cut from this. Like 35 minutes could've been easily cut from this film for certain moments. As I said I will as before I will Johnny Depp but here it doesn't really feel as though he's gets off I just thought of is more of a serious character it kind of starts to feel kind of almost like a spoof or a parity of some kind that the more bizarre and strange things begin to happen he doesn't question anything he's barely phased by anything and honestly looks way more annoyed than anything that actually terrified. Eventually the movie your counters a girl multiple times and I spell eventually they end up working together to to get the other box there's a scene where he where she takes some blood and just wipes it on us for head and he just continues to walk around with it all. There are many scenes like that it kind of makes you question what is the town that has films going for although there is one funny scene there's one funny thing involving the factory to costly talk about how priceless and precious these books are but literally everyone is smoking around them. The film itself is also more sticking to its miss mystery thing weather whether there is actually something supernatural going on here or not the movie does keep building up to it I'll do it investigation are you look at these books he spends A lot of time look at these books and compare them and ask you if you walk along with them you notice the changes before they even brought up and it caught up immerses you in a way but however if you're expecting to a lot of action or saying something about you things thrown around he won't be getting much out of this movie but there is some going on it's mostly dialogue and investigate it.it overall a avAverage movie with it and then that's very lackluster and very little funerals that stick with you outside of them scripture this is easily one of John is more forgettable films now because of it it's bad because but because it rather Bland and basic.",The Ninth Gate
114,undeaddt,This movie left me amazed.,8,9 February 2018,"Just WOW. I was left speechless from the greatness that this movie achieves. I would have never expected that I would be this interested and amazed by a movie about a devil, but man, Johny Depp did his homework. The movie feels so creepy and authentiic at the same time, with a handfull of crime and death scenes that were perfectly made. The way the movie slowly, but effectively progresses, the lighting, the acting, the creepiness and most of all, the story behind it all. Big praise to the novel writer who first of all, wrote this piece of art. 8/10 at least for those who will get the meaning of the movie.",The Ninth Gate
115,patriciogl10,Engaging mystery with some minor flaws.,7,13 November 2018,"Make sure you watch this film with the lights dimmed, or with no lights at all, it really boosts the tenebrosity of the film's atmosphere. So, I found this film to be really interesting, so clearly made in the 90s, it has that undeniable feel for me. Polanski's direction is top-notch; quickly immersed in the film I could tell I was in the presence of a well directed motion picture. The story is really engaging, you got Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, a rare-book dealer who is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a renowned book collector, who has recently acquired the special book of The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows and requires Corso to verify its authenticity. There are only three copies of the book in the world, so Balkan has Corso to look for the other copies to compare them with his.In my opinion there is some clever thought put into this plot. Corso's research and the emphasis put on the pictures and the summoning of the Devil make up for excellent entertainment. I will say, that some of the effects were particularly unappealing. And also, in some parts of the movie, specially in the final act, the acting provided by some of the performers was considerably defective. It sort of took away from the mystery vibe that was going for, and at such an important part of the film, it leaves it somewhat hard to take it seriously.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film, and would certanly like to replicate the very same scene in which I experienced it, but I imagine a second viewing would be further enjoyable.",The Ninth Gate
116,jonathanruano,Ninth Gate -- A Satanic film that does not quite get off the ground,5,2 October 2009,"Roman Polanski's ""Ninth Gate"" has a great set up. Corso (Johnny Depp), a book dealer, cheats people out of very expensive books and then sells them on the market to make a hefty profit. He is also an expert on rare books and can tell the different between a 16th century edition of Cervantes' Don Quixote and the forgery. One day, he is given a mysterious assignment by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who wants to know whether his book, ""The Nine Gates,"" is a forgery or not. The assignment is strange, because Corso is convinced that the book is genuine and that a comparison with the two other ""Nine Gates"" in existence is unnecessary. Then Corso embarks on several misadventures.Unfortunately Corso's misadventures do not play very well, since there is a very strong undercurrent of silliness and persistent dullness in Polanski's ""Ninth Gate."" No adequate explanation is given to why Corso, all of a sudden, becomes obsessed with the satanic secrets hidden in the Ninth Gate books. More importantly, why would anyone want to go through the Ninth Gate anyway? If the Ninth Gate leads to hell, then presumably there is no point in finding this gate since no one wants to get stuck in the afterlife prematurely. If on the other hand, the Ninth Gate is the conduit leading to Faustian pact, then what does Corso expect to gain from this pact? None of these questions are answered, with the result that we see Corso wandering aimlessly in a journey that has no apparent purpose. The only saving grace is some of Woijciech Kilar's Satanic score and the lovely European scenery, but that's it.",The Ninth Gate
117,ikanboy,Polanski goes to the devil's well one too many times,5,26 June 2007,"It's amazing how a great Director like Polanski can make such crap! I was hoping he had his tongue in cheek, but it's more like we have our fingers in our throats! Cliché followed by numbing cliché. Depp out of his Deppth! Langella over the top again! Lena Olin is hysterical! So many holes in the plot they should have made this in Switzerland!Doing a movie about the devil is always risky because if you don't manage to create evil, you end up creating farce! The closest this movie gets to evil is Lena Olin's imitation of cat woman, and she gets to do it twice! If it was a good movie one could forgive some of the WTF plotting that permeates the screen. Langella has a book that ""may"" have been written by ""The Devil"" and he hands it over to Depp to shlepp around Europe with it! Why? To see if it's authentic! And how do we know i's authentic? Why Lucifer signs his initials on the drawings! Freaking brilliant!Depp who is supposed to be a rare book wheeler dealer continually smokes cigarettes while poring over the book. In this movie everybody smokes, and when we see the Lucky Strike pack always nearby we know who helped bankroll the movie, not to mention Shell, whose sign is displayed everywhere, even outside a Hotel! C'mon Roman! Bad guys keep following Depp to steal the book, which isn't hard as Johnny keeps it with him for the first half of the movie, and even leaves it on a library table while he's off trying to find a mysterious blond student (Polanski's wife: flat affect and all) - who as it turns out can fly, but Johnny never notices!Lo and behold the book is finally stolen by Lena Olin's henchmen, one of them a gay African with dyed blond hair, who manages to miss many opportunities to just march up to Depp and steal the GD book. Langella is P.O.'d that his book is stolen so how does he get it back? He walks into Lena's cabal and takes it! Oyve! Then to prove he's gained the power of the Devil the dumb Schmuck pours gasoline on himself and lights it. He should have at least tried it out on his pinkie! He makes a complete ash out of himself!In the end after missing out on clues such as the blond girl's flying and super hero karate, and ability to show up anywhere, and disappear at will, Johnny finally gets it! If she ain't the devil she's certainly the devil with the blue dress; so off he trots to find her! Oh and finally what irked me: every car Depp steals miraculously has the keys in it. As if!",The Ninth Gate
118,ivanmessimilos,"Great start, not so great end",7,5 September 2021,"A good mystery thriller about occult things. Depp did great in the lead role of a book detective, as he was once called in the film. We as viewers are confused because many strange things are happening that are not explained to us. The feeling of loss and mystery accompanies us all the time through the film as we search for meaning and I see it as a good thing. However, again a lot has remained unexplained, ie it remains for our personal interpretation. I didn't like it even on re-watching because it only develops a number of theories and explanations from fans, and it's impossible to prove who exactly is right.",The Ninth Gate
119,Chalice_Of_Evil,A film about books has never been so interesting...,10,26 December 2008,"Regrettably, I never saw this film at the theatre. I wish I had, though, as it is just my type of movie. I first saw it on TV, and after taping it and watching it numerous times, I realised this was a film that I simply HAD to buy on DVD. And so I did. I've watched it a few times since then, and it's still as good as the first time I watched it (if not better), which is why I regret not getting to see it at the cinema. So...what makes this film so great? Well, to put it bluntly...EVERYTHING. The story, the way it's told, the way the film looks, the characters and the actors, the MUSIC - it all combines to make what I think is a superb (yet sadly underrated) film. Okay, so it may not be for everyone. It's not mindless action, for one thing. It actually requires some *thought* and some may perceive it as ""slow and boring"", but for those who like a good psychological thriller filled with mystery, intrigue and supernatural elements, then this is the film for you.Johnny Depp adds yet another fine performance to his already extensive resumé. Dean Corso is a character who, in the hands of a lesser actor, may have come across as someone quite unlikeable. In fact, at the start of the film, Corso isn't a particularly likable guy. But Depp wastes no time in making you grow to like him, and pretty soon you're on his side, as he goes on this rather bizarre assignment of his. And what a journey it is, filled with an assortment of weird and wonderful characters - all brought to life by actors with varying degrees of experience (but all of whom give equally solid performances).Frank Langella as Boris Balkan is an ever-looming presence in the film. Although he doesn't share that many scenes with Depp (and is mostly just heard over the phone), Balkan's voice is more than enough to remind Corso of what he's gotten himself into. He's a scary guy, and Langella does scary more than adequately. Then there's Lena Olin. What can you say about her? She's - quite simply - awesome. She's sultry, sexy and deliciously evil. As Liana Telfer, Lena Olin gets to play low-key menacing, only to switch to over-the-top chest-biting/face-scratching psycho woman on a dime.Then there are other characters that Corso encounters, like the twin Ceniza brothers, Victor Fargas and Baroness Kessler (and her scary secretary), not to mention Telfer's ridiculously-haired bodyguard. All these characters have their quirks and every one of them makes for an interesting encounter with Corso. However, the best - hands down - has got to be The Girl (nicknamed ""Green Eyes"" by Corso), played to perfection by the mesmerising Emmanuelle Seigner. I had never seen her, nor heard of her prior to this film. I can safely say that I have been missing out in the BIGGEST way. What a find she is. Emmanuelle is everything this quite essential character needs to be: she's alluring, she's mysterious, she's wicked and most importantly, you can understand why Corso would be drawn to her. In her mismatching socks, dirty sneakers and baggy anorak, she is the most unassuming person Corso could meet...but there's this underlying sense of malice. With her otherworldly features (most notably, her brilliant green eyes - which cannot be anything but supernatural in nature, given the way they flare up occasionally), not to mention the way she seems to - on occasion - FLOAT, you can tell that she's bewitching Corso (in a sense) and aiding him on his journey towards what he seeks.All of their scenes together are great (and yet, she's not overused in the film. She only appears at key moments and her interaction with Corso is all the more effective *because* of the rather limited amount of scenes they share). It all culminates in a rather steamy scene outside an appropriately flaming castle. This scene is most memorable, due to the excellent use of effects. They're so subtle, and yet incredibly effective. Just watch her face (and yes, I realise that's probably not the thing your eyes would be immediately drawn to in the scene), keep an eye out for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it changes and how eerily effective they are. It's one of the creepier moments in the film (and quite possibly my favourite moment of all). The music also helps make the scene unforgettable. This movie is filled with great moments, though. It's all exquisitely shot, the music is perfect throughout, and it's evident how much precision and care has been put into the film (even the beginning and end credits are memorable/unsettling). And the moral of the story? Beware the blonde with the excessively hairy eyebrows. Don't have sex with the devil in disguise in front of a burning castle.",The Ninth Gate
120,wnterstar,Great movie,8,19 March 2005,"I liked this movie. It kept my interest throughout the entire film. This movie is a study in subtlety. The plot moves slowly forward, edging closer and closer to the truth. There are no major car chases, no drawn out fight scenes, no erotic sex scenes, and yet your mind is captivated. It shows the power of the written word is still almost mystical to many people.SpoilerThe only thing that keeps this movie a ten for me is the questions left at the end. Who was the girl really? Was she the devil? A fallen angel? A minion of Hell? When did Corso go from feeling that he was trapped in a game he couldn't escape to wanting to open the Ninth Gate itself?",The Ninth Gate
121,galensaysyes,"Wrong actor, wrong director, bad ending",4,1 August 2000,"Nobody does occult movies any more, I usually like them even when everyone else loathes them (e.g. ""Exorcist II"", ""The Seventh Sign"") and I was looking forward to this one. But it's a dud from the get-go. Johnny Depp is sadly out of his depth as a book dealer losing his soul; his performance doesn't go beyond the beard and glasses. Indeed almost all the actors are wrong: They look wrong, they sound wrong, and their lines ring hollow. When the wonderful actress Barbara Jefford turns up actually playing the part called for in the script, she seems to be in the wrong movie. Everyone supposes--as I supposed myself--that Polanski is well suited to supernatural subjects because of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Macbeth"", but recalling them I realized that the dread they evoke depends on the horror of the everyday. Where the supernatural is unavoidable, as in the scenes of the three witches in ""Macbeth"", Polanski handles it with no special skill. The scenes in this movie fail entirely to create a sense of dread, of unearthly forces, of cabals and conjurations and powers beyond our ken; it never once makes you look over your shoulder or into dark corners or under your feet. It all seems like a balmy summer day on the Riviera. And the occultism turns out to be a cheat. When a story turns on a riddle, making the riddle a blind (as in this film and ""Die Hard 3"") turns it into nothing but a trick to keep the audience watching. Even if it turns out to be irrelevant, or to lead on to something else that's the true key, it should have a solution on its own terms. And the last two scenes are weak to the point of meaninglessness. I'll bet that the film was originally intended to end with Depp's finding of the note, which would have made the point intended, albeit unexcitingly. But it wouldn't matter, it all turns out to be a trip nowhere. The Ninth Gate, The Fourth Pentacle, The Sixteenth Covenant--it could be called anything. And it'd still be nothing.",The Ninth Gate

He got involved the problem as much as he couldn't take it back.The cinematography and layouts were really good. I like the director! He directed some anxious scenes skillfully. For example, a taxi driver was reflected on the glass in a part of scene. In another one, I saw only someone's feet from the bottom window. Also, I was so awful that a wheel woman kept bumping against the wall many times.
I wasn't satisfied with the ending, but, possibly it was a kind of happy ending. I saw that the director did his best to make a scene which a mysterious woman stared at the protagnist with bloody nose. Certainly he wanted to shoot that.Lucifer was never summoned by anyone. He was a chooser. The person who had been fascinated with the demon was just a toy for the demon. Actually, the progress was meaningless. It's ok that only the chosen person by the demon send resume later! That's so easy. He never summoned it. He was gotten attached to it without knowing.",The Ninth Gate
123,rhinocerosfive-1,"""You know, it's come to my attention that you know too goddamn much""",8,9 December 2007,"Dean Corso is damned anyway; most of his sins are forgivable, but he smokes in elevators, and that's that. So he makes the most of it by using hell's most exclusive entrance, via the rarest of books. But along the way he pisses off one of the most villainously named institutions in film: the Balkan Press. It sounds like a boot on the neck, and Boris Balkan's massive build looks as if he could press pretty hard. A detective story set in old libraries is a commodity to be approached with trepidation. Such romance is contained in the premise - the knowledge of the ages as the key to some contemporary revelation - that the issue is almost inevitably disappointing a la NATIONAL TREASURE or DA VINCI CODE.But this is Roman Polanski, not Ronnie Howard; and though it's predicated on the supernatural, this is hard-boiled noir, not an action vehicle. Lena Olin has more than a gun in her stocking, Emmanuelle Seigner flies a BMW broom, Johnny Depp chainsmokes Luckies, Frank Langella delivers Clare Quilty via Dracula. Wojciech Kilar bolsters Polanski's creepy atmospherics with a score that merges the Hitchcockian elements of Bernard Hermann and Dmitri Tiomkin. Plus corny dialog, tasteful grue, nasty shocks, and the least predictable ending in a shamus caper since KISS ME DEADLY. Oddly enough, it's almost the same ending, except that Mike Hammer's meeting with the devil may be postponed beyond the end of the movie.Now if only Warner Brothers would release a decent DVD version of FRANTIC, my collection of scenes featuring Polanski's wife brawling on Seine embankments would be complete.",The Ninth Gate
124,gilleliath,a modern classic,9,26 November 2020,"There are so few horrors of real quality and this is a pleasure from start to finish, a film that still satisfies even though you've seen it enough to be familiar with every twist. I don't think the budget was huge, but the Polanski name can attract top actors - this is work watching for Frank Llangollen's sinister yet velvet-toned performance alone. It's understated yet, like The Omen or Rosemary's Baby and unlike the typical hotties-in-peril slasher flick, there's an uneasy sense of threat to the whole world, to yourself. And without the benefits of any special effects, Emmanuelle Seigneur manages to be (as Dr Terrible used to say) truly diabolical - that final scene really sends a shiver down your spine. That's what true horror is about, not how many gallons of blood you can spill.",The Ninth Gate

But what begins as just another job quickly turns into a twisted fiasco-nightmare that brings out the worst in everyone. It's like the Devil Made Them Do It or something.

It actually starts off fairly promising, but by the second half it just gets so ridiculous where I was actually laughing at some of it's most 'tense' moments. I was really laughing with the action sequences. Who knew this was a comedy?Johnny Depp is pretty well the only bright spot. He probably just wanted to work with Polanski, unfortunately he did this movie. It was so predictable, yet they still leave you hanging at the end without explaining anything. The ending was also super anticlimactic.For being rare book experts, none of the characters really act like it. They're all smoking over them, and manhandling them constantly.I'm usually fairly easily entertained, so for me to rate this a 4 really says something.

A demonic and supernatural book believed to have the power to summon the Devil is found in the old man's possession and Depp is called upon to verify it's authenticity. The collector is a powerful and wealthy man and tells Depp to keep it safe. When it is inevitably stolen as you know it's gonna be Depp has to track it down and recover it. What entails is a race to achieve the seemingly impossible yet possible. To pass the Ninth Gate and meet Satan personally.

128,deadbull-95171,So excellent a movie I can only watch it on rare occasions,10,24 May 2021,"As fine as the performances are by Depp and Hemingway and Olin and Langella especially, it is Polanski, behind every moment, who owns this masterwork of his.I had the 2 disc set and it was a most memorable time when the second disc , where the entire movie is played minus the soundtrack, with Polanski casually discussing every scene in detail as they occur. This disc was as fascinating as the movie, listening to this eminently brilliant guy talking about his decisions in a manner so casual, it is if he's sitting next to you and you are a couple buddies talking about a good restaurant or some such.But the movie. Roman always dips into the dark side, in his career and with the astonishing personal tragedies and messes in his own life. Could there have been an Exorcist without Rosemary's Baby? And somehow it's led to thisIts a detective story and a horror tale, and a demonic fable. It is full of revelations and twists, but subtle, more subtle then the vaguely similar, tremendously enjoyable, but less beautifully made Angel Heart.There are some subtle but powerful effects, most notably in Depp's relations with Hemingway, that are quite beautiful and almost thrillingly creepy because they are so organically integrated and strong.Depp is like the Mickey Rourke detective in Angel heart, more or less following
a preordained demonic trail, and so much for what i will say of the plot, that has easily followed complexities.But to me, the real star is Polanski. It is the absolute seamless astery of his human and set materials, his astonishing editing down from the book, The Club Dumas, where his extractions have improved the text by emphasizing the core story lines.Imagine Moby Dick minus the chapters on Cetology, or Don Quixote (of special relevance here), minus the major secondary tale within.Even the opening credits show Polanski's genius in using time , not wasting it,
The credits are roll in such a way that they are truly a part of the movie. They are not a distracting irritating bore.I'm focusing on technique here, which is close to flawless, and certainly inspired, and sublimely confident.Everything about this movie screams elegant film-making. And everything about it shames the grossness and stupidity of ""Hollywood."" productions, with rare exceptions. This thing is a work of art that never feels pretentious or artsy,Polanski's brutality and cruelty are all there, but never with such suavity.I have enough semi spoilers here. And you might not be as impressed anyway,
He has made so many quirky wonderful movies, and this one has the arcs of violent volatility softened by the sheer brilliance of production.It is the mature work of a hugely gifted and envisioned guy, and all the decades of his craft are in clear focus here. An undisputed masterpiece in ""my book"", so good that it's like a gold bug looking at a ton of gold he can't get his hands on, so it's hard to watch sometimes, it's just that good.",The Ninth Gate

Roman Polanski, the controversial former husband of actress Sharon Tate and still wanted for his dalliance with a 13 year old girl, was certainly the right man to direct this dark film, filled with the realities of human frailty. Depp was the ideal actor, his ability to interact with others, yet stand apart from them is a crucial element of the film. As with all Polanski films, this one is filled with villains with nuances of evil, from the jaded, wealthy Lena Olin to the pontificating and self-righteous Barbara Jefford. Emmanuelle Siegner, Polanski's wife, provides our supernatural character, but on whose side is she? The plot weaves intricately from step to step and the reality of the book is only revealed in the end. Rated R for nudity, language and violence, this film is definitely a late night indulgence for the grown ups.",The Ninth Gate
130,pontifikator,Polanski does it better,7,6 May 2011,"This is a competent semi-horror film directed by Roman Polanski in 2000. It stars Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, our hero, and Frank Langella as Boris Balkan, our villain. Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner (wife of Polanski) are our sex interests. ""The Ninth Gate"" is in the same genre as ""The Omen"" and ""The Exorcist"" - adult horror films based on some involvement or other with the devil and having adults who refuse to accept the existence of such a beast. Polanski does it better, though. In ""The Ninth Gate"" the issue isn't whether the devil is real and what we're seeing is attributable to Satan and his minions. The issue, on the surface, is whether one particular book is a genuine 17th Century work. There are two other extant copies, and Corso is hired by Balkan to look at the other two and compare the works. Corso is told that if he determines that any one of the three is real and if Balkan's copy is a forgery, Corso is to acquire the real copy at any price.We follow Corso as he goes to Europe and meets with the owners of the two other copies. Things go horribly wrong even before he leaves New York, and if we're paying attention, we realize that the horrible events mirror the engraved images in the mystery book, which is about Satan. Accidents befall Corso and the owners of the other two copies, again suggesting the graven images. Rather than making Corso dumb and ignoring the obvious hints as do the characters in ""The Omen"" and ""The Exorcist,"" Corso picks up on what's going on and begins to search not just for the other copies but for the underlying reason for the events unfolding before him. Ultimately, the true search has nothing to do with the physical copies of the book but with the metaphysical truths which may be shown in the engravings. Although the movie has no great themes nor depths of characters, Polanski and Depp keep it moving and keep our interest piqued as Corso parses his way through the variations among the three copies, deducing why the differences exist and why they're spread among the three books. Polanski keeps us in the dark about the identity of the character played by Seigner, so you're on your own in determining who she really is. ""The Ninth Gate"" is not a great movie, but, to mix my metaphors since the movie is about books, it's a real page turner.",The Ninth Gate

132,merrywood,Superb Cinema in the Polanski tradition,10,12 March 2000,"The Ninth Gate is a well-written story beautifully realized by Roman Polanski.  Its serene opening credits promise mystery and a fulfilling cinema experience and the promise is kept.  In my case, I saw the opening and entire film immediately after a series of stupid promos for forgettable junk films depicting a series of boring explosions accompanied by loud, irritating noise.   I was about to get up, ask for a refund and walk out of the theater when these graceful titles started.
	The Ninth Gate's occult theme is rendered in Polanski's celebrated cinematic style with subtlety, deft, and visual beauty.  Its casting is impeccable, and most rewarding with the unfailingly good stage and screen actor, Frank Langella, who plays a rare book collector and then some.
	  For those who are tired of ducking and weaving the current, standard Hollywood product of ever cheapening special effects, meaningless, boring stories or non-story films with puzzling characters that are never known or understood: this is a satisfying, welcome reprieve.  It is a glance back to a more artistic, eloquent Hollywood of a more rational period.",The Ninth Gate
133,senortuffy,I never knew devil worshipers could be so boring.,5,8 August 2003,"This is a lame mystery about a book detective (Johnny Depp) who is hired by a collector (Frank Langella) to track down the other two copies of a book that contains the secret of how to conjure up the devil.  Roman Polanski is responsible for this mess.For one thing, the lead character is as dynamic as mud.  I've seen several Johnny Depp films made in the past few years, and I have to conclude he's incapable of playing a mature adult.  Frank Langella is good as the evil character pulling everyone's strings, but Depp is like a boy in a man's world.  Everyone, including the two female protagonists, Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner , manipulate him with ease.  And the story is thin also.  If the viewer could have been drawn into solving the mystery of the engravings with the characters, it might have been interesting, but you're left to watching reaction shots to something you never really see yourself.  The solution is briefly mentioned near the end, but that's not very satisfying after wading through nearly two hours of muck.The story had the potential to make a decent film, but it wound up in the wrong hands.",The Ninth Gate

135,nick121235,polished thriller,8,30 April 2018,"On my second rewatch I upped this film half a star. It's genuinely pretty entertaining, and I think the first time that I saw it, I wasn't quite expecting such a ""commercial"" film. I think I was right on the tail end of finishing Venus in Fur in fact, so I was looking for something more... art-house. 
At any rate, this film is highly entertaining, a slow burning thriller, the type that Polanski is so damn good at.

136,AZINDN,9th Gate-Euro Trash,3,10 January 2007,"Roman Polanski tries to present a tale of devil worship in the modern era with his library- centric tale of greed and murder in the book trade. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a sleazy appraiser of rare books who is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a ruthless collector of missives on Satan. He has acquired a rare volume titled ""The Ninth Gate"" which is reputed to hold the key to conjure up the demon, and provide its owner with supreme ""self- enlightenment."" Corso's task is to compare and contrast the remaining volumes of the book held in private collections in Europe and report back to Balkan on the authenticity of his book. Somehow, there exists in Europe, groups of aristocrats who, having outlived love-ins, have turned to devil worship to provide excuses to meet in castles and have orgies. Priestess among this group is the widow, St. Martin (Lena Olin), a woman who wants her book back from Balkan at all costs.The thinly veiled excuse to visit European locations in Spain and Paris provides Polanski and Depp with the fodder to drag the story through deserted estate homes, old book collections, and the Seine where Depp keeps running into Mrs. Polanski, a somewhat handy person to have in a scrap as she floats through life hanging out wherever Corso seems to hang his hat, and she can kick fight when Corso gets attacked by lackey's of Mrs. San Martin. Throughout this film, the theme of books co-authored by Lucifer and possessing the key to demonic enlightenment is a somewhat convoluted mystery of who has the real volume of the ""Ninth Gate."" Balkan wants his copy to be the only authentic copy, and he kills everyone who possess the rival copies burning libraries in the process. Nevertheless, his heavy handed arrogance is not sufficient to pull the secret of the three volumes together to permit him to access ""The Master"" leaving only Corso and Mrs. Polanski in the end to do the deed.While some may find the ramblings of Polanski's tale entertainment, it is a shoddy production with little to compare it to earlier works by the director, who should never cast his wife in his films. She has no chemistry with Depp's Corso, and while she is unique in appearance, is not of the calibre of actors as Olin, Langella and Depp. All in all, a significant disappointment and silly film that can easily be overlooked in the oeuvre of an auteur filmmaker who should have known better.",The Ninth Gate
137,steven-222,The devil is in the details...,10,2 December 2009,"This movie is like a Swiss watch: a stunningly crafted thing of beauty. I give this ten stars, alongside Polanski's THE PIANIST. While this is not a transcendent revelation like THE PIANIST, sometimes a movie can ""just"" be a movie and still be sheer perfection.As in the best Hitchcock movies of the 1950s, every scene leads beautifully to the next, and there is a tingling delight in just about every shot. Watching it unfold the first time is pure pleasure, but the film also pleases on subsequent viewings. I particularly love the subtle (dare I say devilish?) humor, which is so often a part of Polanski's films, especially those with a supernatural element.Special mention to the music score by Wojciech Kilar, to Johnny Depps' perfectly calibrated performance, and to Frank Langella, who delivers one of the most memorable performances of his career, mostly by phoning it in (literally). As his character, Boris Balkan, discovers (also literally), the devil is truly in the details.",The Ninth Gate
138,Snowgo,Nothing To Make Us Think,5,17 August 2014,"I was willing to go along with The Ninth Gate until I realized that it was playing out just like another Johnny Depp picture, Sleepy Hollow, where-in, one-by-one, people are killed by an unseen, unidentified force or entity.Apparently, the writers/producers of both pictures felt that there was no need to let the viewers know what was actually happening and why. When the baroness was killed, I shut the movie off. Enough was enough.I can suspend some disbelief, but when Bernie was killed, M. Corso should have called the police, instead of inevitably becoming a suspect in the murder.Also, you think he might want to see to a burial/funeral for his business partner before he flies off to Europe? The door to the antiquarian shop was unlocked, so maybe Mr. Corso figured the next customer would find the dead body and take care of the arrangements.After Fargas.., and then the baroness, were killed, Corso would have been an international fugitive. (Oh yes, the flying lady would have saved him from all of that). I am glad we have angels on the side of those who would do (just about) anything for money and who make it their sole raison d'etre.The music in this movie was incongruous to the point of it being ridiculous. When the lady hit Corso over the head with a bottle, I thought I was watching The Naked Gun, or some similar movie. Were they trying to be funny?Gratuitous violence with no explanation. Lots of brandy being drunk and cigarettes smoked.Like in Sleepy Hollow, an excellent acting performance by Johnny Depp is wasted by screenwriters who underestimate the intelligence of their audiences.",The Ninth Gate

There are some pieces that might not make sense but that really doesn't take away from the film.  What makes the movie is the performances and the main plot.  Johnny Depp made a good move when he accepted the role of Dean Corso.  Lena Olin and Frank Langella did well as the two people who tried to play Corso at every chace they had.  Emmanuelle Seigner was a surprise as ""The Girl"". Many people who watch this movie will ask what her significance in the movie was.  I think I have figured it out but I won't reveal that.  Roman Polanski did well in making an exceptional work about satanism even though it wasn't as good as ""Rosemary's Baby.""

141,TheEtherWalk,Why I love this movie,10,29 June 2013,"The Ninth Gate by Roman Polanski is not a perfect film by any means but it still remains a personal favorite of mine. I can understand some of the detractors of this film. Technically it's kind of odd and goofy. The tone is quite strange. In particular the character of the Albino seems horribly cast and the movie doesn't really go for thrills or scares. And the whole runtime is pretty much about a guy studying a book for 2 hours. But it creeps up on you and gets under your skin somehow. The Ninth Gate by Roman Polanski is much more than just a film. It's on of the most fascinating and cerebral studies of Laveyan Satanism ever put on film. It's the book itself that gets under your skin more than anything once you realize that everything about Corso's journey is tied into the engravings and altered by their meaning. What is that meaning? Well that's up to the audience, but the dialogue and visuals and full of little clues that point to something revelatory upon repeat viewings. For one thing, everyone seems to serve Corso's every whim. Is he actually the Devil? Laveyan Satanism is basically the idea that Satan is inside of us all, not a living entity. Is the secret of the book that it unlocks the True Will? The power to master one's own destiny? Or was it Corso's destiny all along? This film is definitely not for everyone but I find it endlessly fascinating. Everything means something if you really look closely.",The Ninth Gate

The movie is a very intriguing story about a rare book dealer looking for three books that are supposed to be the same, but some of the illustrations have subtle differences.  Some are signed under a different signature, by the devil himself.  The movie follows him through his quest for the different books and he gets caught up in a conspiracy. One problem is this woman who is helping him find the books.  You never really find out her purpose.  Also, the movie has no climax.  That's right, not there.

147,alexx668,9th Gate..,7,21 February 2005,"Polanski's ""the 9th Gate"" is more or less ""Rosemary's Baby"" revisited. The only difference is that Polanski is now much more of a Hollywood director than he was in 1968. That means that while primarily the film is once again an exercise in Hitchcock-ian suspense, the narrative is more linear and generic, even adding action (car chases, martial arts) and black comedy elements. Also, the aesthetics are much less elegant and idiosyncratic.While enjoyable in it's action/ thriller crossover, the script is predictable, and it's metaphysical meaning too vague. Polanski is no philosopher; he is merely expressing his belief in the supernatural, and perhaps destiny. But when compared to the monumental neurosis/ delirium of ""Le Locataire"", this is a big let-down.",The Ninth Gate

Langella has hired Depp to find two other copies of a book he has called ""The Ninth Gate"" which was possibly written by the devil. There are three copies in the world and Langella wants to know if his is authentic. This is when murder and mayhem run wild. This is a drag on film that just when you think it's over it goes on. There is hardly any supernatural elements in this film at all. It's just a bad murder mystery. The special effects aren't too good and the acting is over done. The film just has long boring conversations. This is one thriller that could pass off as a bad teen horror movie. Not even Depp's performance can save this one. Don't waist your money.

He is aided along the way by a mysterious woman with supernatural powers who may or may not be working for Balkan (or Satan himself?) The music score is excellent and richly composed throughout. The European sequences look very nice indeed, in fact the film's production design looks almost gold coloured in every scene, no doubt thanks to Dean Tavoularis who worked on The Godfather films.Special mention to Lena Olin for her fantastic turn as a sexy hothead femme fa-tale who smolders in every scene shes in. This is the type of role that has become her trademark. Frank Langella is impressive as the mysterious Balkan, after this performance it can only be a matter of time before he is cast as the new James Bond Bad Guy.If you are a fan of such movies as The Omen and Chinatown, this film is for you.The Ninth Gate is a superb mystery thriller with lashings of Gothic Romance and millionaire devil worship, one of those films you watch once and discover it was much better than you thought it was going to be.

153,dutchchocolatecake,requires symbolic literacy,10,3 May 2016,"This movie is superbly made puzzle and most people won't ""get it"" because they are hung up about the idea of the Devil (and their own preconceptions of the Devil).The movie is dualistic in it's character development, telling a story of two paths (Balkan and Corso's) and how vastly different they are when they converge at the end of the story. Balkan is still driven by passion and obsession, whereas Corso learns that knowledge can have greater value than money. The difference is obvious and yet most people don't seem to notice it. Balkan starts out as a high handed, sanctimonious Satanist yet becomes more pathological (and out of control) in his desire to summon The Devil, Corso becomes more thoughtful and genuinely interested in the puzzle of the engravings that speak to achieving a higher plane of consciousness.There is symbolism through the movie that takes the viewer on a journey with Corso (the Tarot's Fool). There is plenty of esoteric analysis available on the Internet if you google the terms ""Tarot"" and ""Ninth Gate"" and ""engravings."" If you aren't already somewhat familiar with occultism, it's probably going to go over your head. Googling ""Cathars"" is also helpful.I think if I were to give an overall summary of what this movie is trying to say, is that freedom and personal power don't come from self-delusion or worshiping Satan. The Ninth Gate portrays Satanism as a personal and intellectual failure on the part of so-called spiritual rebels that can't see past their own impulses and ego. The lesson of the movie is that enlightenment comes from within and a willingness to let go of attachments to the physical world. The Ninth Gate is almost like Buddhism in this respect.",The Ninth Gate

155,e-m-hobo,Matter of factly documented and perfectly vile,8,2 June 2021,"I'm a big fan of vile stories as in stories about vile individuals with vile motives, intentions, and desires. Most of the characters in this movie are, which makes it wonderfully tasty, saucy, raunchy, and also perfectly honest in the false pretenses of many collectors being completely without any respect for what they collect.If you smoke over a collectible book or simply a book I desire, or in a room with monumental paintings on the wall for that matter, I supposes it pushes me off balance. If you accompany it with a glass of whiskey you offer the honesty of an astronomer witnessing evidence of Einstein's theories gazing at the stars. That's the least lack of remorse these characters display.This is and will remain one of my favorite movies. Murder, sex, intrige, deals with the devil, devil worshipping sex cults... It's got everything a young boy like me needs for entertainment. Perfectly wicked, perfectly vile.Why the two stars off? Well, it was impossible to believe that they didn't see the main character coming at one point. At another, the appearance of strangulation may have been captured on the victim's face, but the angle revealed that the hands were quite distant from the throat, even if it was only for a brief time.That may have been due to the chosen style of directing: the perspective of a neutral onlooker that perfectly frames the moment in time, the thing that happens at that point in time, without imposing on the audience any sense of what they should feel. The movie offers plenty of substance, so had the director chosen such an angle, it wouldn't have been wrong, but the realism of the surreal story as it unfolds before you to my opinion is both engrossing and exciting.Some documentary style movies fail in that regard in that if what you need to see is in frame, that's sufficient. A good documentary maker without prejudice does frame the story as perfect as can be. You need to see this, and now look here, because you also need to see this. None of the imagery in the Ninth Gate falls flat, whereas in other movies sometimes it does.Unfortunately, to me the timing of the characters approaching could have been handled better. First they put in some effort not to be seen and then they just walk up. That's a shame. Then the direct shot relentlessly showed us how a movie is really made: without hurting the actors. A pity when it comes to the imagery. Don't worry, I also love the actors.Great movie with a minor flaw or two. Maybe three, but I think I forgot about it.",The Ninth Gate

The usual warnings apply.Johnny Depp has matured into a good actor, and it was interesting to watch a movie in which he is undergoing this maturity process. In The Ninth Gate, he plays a rare book expert who has undertaken a commission to support the provenance of a book that will supposedly call up the devil by comparing it to other extant copies of the book. As he does so, people start mysteriously dying and the other copies are destroyed.This movie is actually a reasonably good whodunnit quest sort of story....up until the last 10 minutes, where it falls miserably on its butt and leaves the entire story completely unresolved. Directed by Roman Polanski? C'mon, Roman, you can do better than that. We never find out who ""The Girl"" is; we never find out if he actually unlocks the secret of the book. Depp's acting performance is the only reason I gave this movie a 5. Otherwise, from that sucky ending, I'd have scored it a 2 and that would have been generous of me.",The Ninth Gate
157,SILENCEikillyou,The nine gates go very deep... Enter if you dare!,9,1 November 2002,"At first, I want to say how well, I believe, this movie was done.  Perhaps, a bit too well.  Many people have given proper consideration to this film and should be commended.  However, for light enjoyment with spooks and scares; look elsewhere.  The horror that is present in this story is far more permanent and dangerous than making the viewer jump in there seat (which I never did).  My usual format goes that I say what I liked and then root out what might not have been so good.  The acting, the direction, the plot, appropriate lack of action, and musical score all were very powerful.What worked:  Most of the things I mentioned above.  In particular, I think Depp has just the right amount of nafarious atmosphere about him.  Drinking, smoking, sex... it seems he falls prey to all vices.  And, he cares only for himself which is true Satanism.  The French actress was superb... I'd like to see her in more films where a mysterious heroine is required because she fits the bill.  And sexy...  Nevertheless, each of the actors and actresses did a top-notch job portraying their roles.  I also liked the movie's atmosphere... seductive; just like the book in the story.What didn't work:  In short, nothing but the ending which I will go into in a moment.  I think the all-out drive of the movie was it's combination of several elements, but this ending -- though I might know the reason for it -- was a huge let-down.SPOILERS -- SPOILERS -- SPOILERSFirst of all, I think most people have hit the conundrum, surrounding the mysterious girl ""Green Eyes"".  Some say she's Lucifer.  Now, I'm not a sexist, however, I'm pretty sure that Lucifer is not a woman.  At least, not according to the Bible.  However, if one wants to look to the Bible for answers to help explain this movie... well, there might not be much except perhaps in Revelation.  The harlot or whore that rides the beast.  The picture, as well as, some artists rendition of this depiction in Revelation almost perfectly match the final engraving in the Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows.  The one where ""Green Eyes"" appears to be riding some sort of beast to the castle.  Supposedly, this picture in revelation is a whore that has consorted with the beast, maybe a dragon, most certainly the devil, or Lucifer.  Therefore, she says she is a student of sorts.  A student of Satan.  Near the beginning of the film, Balkaan is giving a lecture.  In it he states that a witch usually are companions with familiars which are usually to say that they are animals that have the spirit of demons or other beings in them.  What's to say then that Satan doesn't have his own 'familiars' and that they are witches/harlots/servants or students that run his errands and do his bidding.  Also, one could note that when Balkaan specifically speaks of this witch-trivia, the camera goes to a full focus on ""Green Eyes"", alone.  Polanski's way of letting us know that she is a witch (or fooling the viewer), and that she is actually a 'familiar' instead. Lucifer's familiar, a witch.Now, about the ending.  Alfred Hitchcock had a name for it in a movie when the focus is drawn to a certain object (in this case the gate - in others, like Pulp Fiction it was the briefcase - in another movie it was something in another case; I can't remember the name).  At any rate, directors like to do this where the actual focus of the story isn't really important, at all. The object of the movie is to bring out other intrigue while making one think the intrigue is the gate, itself; when it isn't at all.  I don't like it, but really good directors and screen-writers love to use it.  Like it or not, it's their call I suppose.9/10, though I wanted to take more off for the ending.thank you",The Ninth Gate

160,Aditya_Gokhale,Excellent film...Grossly misunderstood! Easily one of Polanski's finest!,9,27 November 2008,"Some of the critics ratings and user ratings really surprise and shock me at times. ""The Ninth Gate"" is rated so low, even by the critics (and several movie buffs), I really did not have much expectations from this movie. However, it was after all, a supernatural thriller by Roman Polanski and that was reason enough for me to see it. This, along with some comment I read somewhere that it is similar to Angel Heart, heightened my curiosity and finally saw it! And boy.. am I glad I did!This is one of Polanski's finest films. There is no sense comparing it to Polanski's earlier classic based on the supernatural, Rosemary's Baby. That is, of course, a classic, but that does not render The Ninth Gate any lesser in terms of quality. The story revolves around a man called Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), who happens to be a dealer in rare books. He is hired by a wealthy book collector by the name of Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to authenticate a rare and very special book in his possession, ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows"". There are only three surviving copies and Balkan is convinced that only one is authentic and the others, forgeries. Corso takes up the job and then begin his investigations and a very mysterious odyssey full of twists and turns. To reveal anything more would be a crime. One should watch the movie to experience it completely.Polanski has incorporated all the elements that make for a great movie. An interesting plot (based on ""El Club Dumas"", by Arturo Pérez-Reverte), Darius Khondji's brilliant cinematography, Wojciech Kilar's killer background score, Polanski's masterful direction and the overall atmospheric nature of the movie make up for a great watch! Not to mention some great acting from Johnny Depp (always dependable) and Frank Langella. And let's not forget Mrs. Polanski herself, Emmanuelle Seigner in a very interesting role. As for the poor reviews this film generally got, I must say I am stumped. There is not a single weak moment; the proceedings glide by smoothly, and are more than intriguing. Suffice to say, it's a very well made film and a fascinating experience.Never mind, that some so-called critics have lambasted it for some unanswered questions and ambiguities in the story. They are probably the kind who like everything packaged in a neat order with ends all tied up, and are averse to enigma and ambiguity. My viewpoint is that there may be untied ends and unanswered questions...but it is nothing that can't be figured out.The Ninth Gate is the kind of movie that you would wanna watch again..and then discuss it with fellow-viewers..then watch it again. And am sure, every viewing will yield newer ideas and interpretations..",The Ninth Gate

Roman Polanski is always interesting, at least, and with such stalwart credits as ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Chinatown"", I figured, ""how bad could it be?"" Trust me....THAT bad. The plot was simple and interesting enough to command my attention but the storytelling could not at all keep it. I fell asleep and missed the ending and from what I understand, that did not hamper the whole film experience. Johnny Depp was gorgeous and adept and Frank Langella was sinister enough. I agree with another reviewer in that the picture set a mood and always remained on the fringes of being a thought-provoking piece of work, but, alas, fell horribly short. Of course, you must be true to your own opinions and tastes. It is worth a viewing for no other reason than it has a reputable cast and director, and is a mood piece but the bottom line is this is one to use on those nights you can't fall asleep and you don't want to use drugs of any sort.

This movie has so many hidden gems that you need to rewatch over and over to fully grasp the craftsmanship of Polanski's epic epic movie! From the creeping little ominous tones of music when the plot is thickening, and then when you know something bad is about to happen the music gets a long pulled out eerie feel to it. Almost like you can feel what your watching. And Depp's acting to where you think he's just a quiet book dealer with some moderate vices. Then over the course of the movie the devil student girl sinks her hooks into him. And she gets the man she wanted all along to go to the Ninth Gate... P.S sorry Franky L. you weren't worthy! Hahaha!! EPICCC!!! Truly EPICCCCC. 10/10",The Ninth Gate
163,MovieJunkie1976,The devil in the details..,6,25 June 2019,"What was right about the film. The story. Though conjuring the devil is no new idea , the delivery of the script is highly enjoyable and engaging. The Cast. Lead and support alike , veteran actors like Johnny Depp and Frank Langella combined with actresses the caliber of Lena Olin make for great show.What was wrong with the film. Well , the story. As we journey along with Corso ( Depp) through his peril , basic reality begins to interfere with disbelief , the murder of the book dealer , Corso being on site after. The Murder of Vargas , certainly not Corso but lifting evidence that will be noticed missing would lead to questions. If none of that works ,being known as the last person in the company of a murder victim and the last one leaving a fire meant to conceal said murder is certain a way to get you a stop at the local jail. Forget Balkan's murder in public with witnesses and the two people Corso killed himself , though those deaths are debatable.An enjoyable film if you don't mind the obvious flaw and story premise.3 stars ( of 5)",The Ninth Gate
164,jerry_dean67,A solid 7 rating.,7,18 March 2000,"Not the best Polanski movie I've seen, but still an enjoyable thriller.
The characters were interesting, the story kept me involved, and the acting was good to. My only complaints would be the mysterious girl whose presence was never explained, and the ending which didn't leave me satisfied after watching everything before it.I'll rate it a solid 7 rating. Not perfect, but still an enjoyable show.",The Ninth Gate
165,TheProteanGirl,Could've Been Amazing!,7,12 January 2021,"The premise and mood of this movie were amazing. This is the exact type of thing I like to see in thrillers. However, it really could've been better executed.Firstly, the girls' role is never really explained. Who is she? Why is she helping him? She has these levitation and eye magical abilities so she's clearly not human but then is she the devil or his helper? I wish they would've, in the end at least, told us who she is because we don't know for sure and that is annoying.Secondly, they put all this effort in focusing on these ""gates"", and the books, and how they differ only to leave the viewer empty handed in the end on what it all means. What was the point of him writting the LCF and AT on that paper? What was he getting at? What is the meaning of the differences in the images of the different books? Everything is so cool and intriguing but nothing is explained in the end, leaving it completly up to the viewer. I know online and from the book there is an explanation but I wish the directors would've clarified it in the end. Otherwise it all kind of seems pointless.They had this great and unique topic, a rare book, something I've never seen a topic of a thriller before, but they messed it up. I think they were planning a sequel but it never happened. Eitherway, it was more lackluster than you'd expect a movie of this type to be. I really expected more and was dissapointed by the lazy attempt at concluding the story.",The Ninth Gate

I felt as though I was watching a movie of truth, in that, as if, the author new what he was talking about. I do not have experience in any of this and was somewhat kept in a mystery throughout. Many reviewers here seem more knowledgeable. Johnny Depp is a superb actor. One of the best of today. I like this role of his the best. Many of his roles are based on kooky characters which he does not need to showcase his skills. I did not realize this was a Polanski movie. But he is an excellent director.

169,Brian B-2,"Tedious, obvious",3,28 January 2001,"1999 was the year of demonic movies, but save your time for Stigmata, or even End of Days . Roman Polanski misses the boat here. There is no action. The plot is trite, and unfolds tediously. Johnny Depp sleepwalks through his starring role . Frank Langella is hammy when he needs scarry. Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner are ornamental, but wooden . Seigner's character is intended to be mysterious . In this the movie finally succeeeds in something , but as a result, we never figure her out, leaving us with no characters to care about, not even an anti-hero or attractive villain. Polanski might have made a tight 105 minute comment on the attractiveness of evil, or the inevitabilty of descent once one wanders from virtue . Instead, he gives a 133 minute cure for insomnia , which is self-consciously artsy, rather than entertaining. An average episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer has more tension, and more fun . Lets hope Polanski gives us a better effort next time.",The Ninth Gate
170,Ken-208,Good until the End,5,14 March 2000,This movie seemed good until the end.  The end really spoiled it.  After waiting 2 hours to see the ending it doesn't really have much of an ending and that kind of ruins the movie. The first 75% of the movie is reasonably good.

171,j-penkair,What A Story-telling Thrill!,8,25 September 2014,"Just finished the film and wondering how hard Roman Polanski must have rode the entire film crew, so the seamlessness and steadiness of the story-telling appears as we see it. Polanski's strength is always with the great combination of all the shots that move the story forward. I doubt it if he can endure a dull moment in any of his pictures. As a Buddhist, I am quite foreign to the concepts of God and the Devil. Not something I heard growing up. However, Polanski's masterful story-telling allows people like myself to join and enjoy the ride, nonetheless. I get to understand the power of these two creations, God and the Devil, to the believers. I can see how the mysterious woman helper, played by Polanski's own wife, is the Devil himself (or should I say herself?), and gets his/her will at the very end. Film students can learn a lot from Polanski in his skills in make-believe and the suspension of disbelief. It proves to me that all the computer- based special effects can sustain the audience only at the film's viewing time, for the lingering memory is quite short-lived. While, as Polanski shows us here, deep understanding of human psyche and psychology is much imprinting for a film, as classic novels are. In short, Polanski only knows how to make classics.",The Ninth Gate
172,thomasmitilis1995,THERE'S NOTHING MORE RELIABLE THAN A MAN WHOSE LOYALTY CAN BE BOUGHT FOR HARD CASH...,8,18 June 2020,"PROS:
~The Ninth Gate is a slow burn and atmospheric thriller about the journey of a man towards his darker side. Dean Corso is a selfish and careless human being but at the same time he is intelligent and a seeker of knowledge making him the perfect match for the Devil. He doesn't commit all the sins at once like the other characters but embraces them methodically through his desire and obsession to complete his mission. He starts his quest because of greed at first but doesn't resist in commiting the rest of them later when is needed (he even kills).
~Frank Langella plays Boris Balkan, a intimidating and determined man who wants to solve the riddle and summon the devil inside him. The difference between him and Corso is that the first looses control in his desire to summon the darkness in contrast to the second one who eventually achieves a higher level of enlightenment. Lena Olin is the sexy and seductive Liana Telfer and represents all the stupid people who attempt with their money to approach Lucifer although he is all the time in front of them.
~Emanuelle Seigner as the Girl is in reality the incarnation of Lucifer (or at least his servant). She is mysterious and alluring but also unnoticeable. She wears daily clothes and dirthy green sneakers but there is an underlying sense of evilness in her face. She guides and assists Corso , showing up the most crucial moments and giving him informations that he isn't able to find by himself. For example, she gives him the family name of Liana Telfer and tells him where to find the last ingravation. The film provides obvious hints to the viewer that she has an evil identity because she is the only one with supernatural abilities, her eyes are unnaturally green and her sex scene in the end reveal her deviousness.
~The mystery of the film with the three books that share the same name is very interesting. If you pay attention more carefully, you will notice that Corso isn't chosen accidentally by Lucifer and is actually the only one who follows the instructions of the riddle. In other worlds, his mission is secret (to travel in silence), he deals with difficulties but persists (by a long and circuitous route), accepts his death of his friend (to brave the arrows of misfortune), shows no panic with the death of the two collectors who own the other books (and fear neither noose nor fire), commits to his mission until the end (to play the greatest of all games), spares his money immoderately by giving always bribes and tips wherever he goes (and win, foregoing no expense), is determined to succeed by winning the other candidates (is to mock the vicissitudes of Fate), finds the last illustration that was forged and led Balkan to death (and gain at last the key) and as result embrace the Devil (that will unlock the Ninth Gate).
~The slow pace is the device that allows the viewer to savor the richness of the film. Kilar's soundtrack is mesmerising and gives a magnetic feel. Furthermore, the cinematography and the European locations are beautiful.CONS:
~The fight scenes are poorly executed and unrealistic. It looks like the actors don't even try and sometimes overact. Olin's biting and screaming is a little laughable and Seigner moves too slowly.
~The whole mystical organisation could be explored better. In the end they look like a bunch of morons. Sure, this is the point of the movie but they could be more intimidating for the protagonist.",The Ninth Gate

175,Dkish,The Ninth Gate is one of Polanski's greatest films...with a couple flaws,8,8 March 2000,"The Ninth Gate By Dean Kish	Acclaimed French director Roman Polanski returns to the horror genre with the Ninth Gate, or does he? 	The Ninth Gate follows the life of bookworm Dean Corso (played by an always impressive Johnny Depp) as he tries to find the last two remaining copies of an extremely rare book called, `The Book of the Nine Doors to the Kingdom of Darkness'. The book is mythically spoken as a text written by an insane man who claimed that `The Devil' wrote the book through his hand. A disbeliever Corso continues his quest to unlock the authenticity of the other copies and what he finds even shocks Corso. 	The Ninth Gate is one of Polanski's greatest films as it doesn't try to conjure up the horror but instead goes for the intelligence. The intelligence in this film reminded me a lot of Polanski's all-time greatest film, `Rosemary's Baby'. Rosemary's Baby is a horror classic because it was so intelligent and we didn't need to see the gore or even the baby to know what evil men were doing. And to bring it full circle that's exactly what this film is intelligent and has no gore but intrigue.	What I enjoyed about the film is that it wasn't in a rush to convey any of the pieces of the puzzle but instead brought us into the mystery and made us curious what the right sequence and or pages were the ones to unlock the Devil's secret. As each piece to the grand puzzle was revealed Depp was faced with a new hurdle and through that kind of plot revelation I was reminded of `film noir'. The mystery and its unveiling is very similar to a those great dark mysteries of the thirties and forties. Another great strength was another great performance by Johnny Depp who proves once more that he is becoming one of our greatest actors. From the first twenty minutes, I wondered if this bookworm was to boring to follow around on his quest. But when the plot deepened and the myth was slowly revealed he captivated me in a way that Indiana Jones captured me when he watched that burst of sunlight unlock the `Well of the Souls' in `Raiders of the Lost Ark'. As for faults, Ninth Gate is great as a mystery and relic seeking type film but its supernatural finale and the French-Angel chick made me scratch my head. Was she an angel? Was the Ninth Gate really what the people thought? Did that evil consume our hero or did it satisfy his curiosity? The Ninth Gate needed a more satisfactory ending but not done over the top. What I mean is an ending similar to `Raiders of the Lost Ark' where the real power is revealed and man has no hope in hell of harnessing it. Let's see a little of that power these people craved so much. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",The Ninth Gate
176,william_blake,underrated,9,24 July 2002,"roman polanski's great work 'the ninth gate' is a great thrilling mystery with great actors, great camera work, directing and music all together creating an unique atmosphere.so, what more do you want? i'm really surprised of the low rating, but i sort of understand it also. movies that have something to do with religion are always sort of on/off movies for most of the viewers. i however have no religious beliefs whatsoever, and i found this movie doesn't try to make the viewer a believer, religion is just used well as the method to make good horror. there's nothing really showing 'proof of supernatural' for the main character in the plot.at best it's almost like a lynch movie with mysterious scenes and characters, at worst it's too predictable (the mystery of the book for example was WAY too easy to figure out) and has some goof-ups, too, like language mistakes, which is very surprising.but towards the ending, again, it went more mysterious and i started liking it more again and making the little flaws invisible and irrelevant to me. the movie was scary but a great movie nevertheless, or because.",The Ninth Gate

178,dave fitz,brilliant thriller,8,4 September 2000,"The Ninth Gate is an intense, exciting & well-acted thriller with great direction and cinematography. The story concerns a man named Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who collects books relating to Satan. He hires Dean Corso (Johnny Depp in another great performance), a rare book dealer, to track down copies of the book ""Nine Gates of The Shadow Kingdom"". 3 are known to exist: Balkan's and 2 others owned by collectors in Europe. He wants Corso to seek them out and compare them to see which, if any, are authentic. The book is said to have the power to conjure Satan. As Corso goes about his mission, the movie engrosses you with its suspenseful and spooky story and the beautiful European scenery. Lena Olin plays a woman whose husband owned a copy of the book, which he sold to Balkan before commiting suicide in the film's opening scene. She is trying desperately to get it back. Emmanuelle Seigner, director Roman Polanski's striking wife, appears from time to time to aid Corso and saves his life several times. I don't want to give too much away, but I was truly stunned reading comments on this film by how few people really understood it. I thought it was easy to follow and by the end, we knew, at least I did, what was going on and what the Seigner character's purpose in the film was. The final scene has been roundly criticized on here. I thought it was a great ending. I had never seen a Polanski film before, but now I plan to see some of his others, like Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown which I've never seen but heard alot about.",The Ninth Gate
179,AppleBlossom,Slightly disappointing,6,12 March 2004,"Johnny Depp performed amicably as the book dealer who becomes ensnared in a quest to prove the authenticity of 3 books supposing to be written by Satan. The sharp cinematography was good, made the film all the more enjoyable to watch and the storyline was an excellent concept . Unfortunately, I didn't feel as though the director conveyed the plot to the maximum extent as he could have, the opportunity was certainly there! At first, the curiosity and intrigue were prevalent and then it started to slowly decline throughout the film. The final scenes were quite a let down, it was somewhat difficult to fathom the whole film's basis from the beginning right through to the unsatisfactory ending. Mainly because the conclusion doesn't logically interweave with what is being expressed or seen in the film. One has to question the purpose of the 3 books???  So this is why I feel the plot was somewhat misleading (whether or not this was intentional, I'm not sure?). Despite the few negative aspects, it still remains an interesting film.  A vote of 7/10",The Ninth Gate
180,montferrato,A Great Movie for People with a Brain,10,20 May 2010,"This is the seventh time I have watched this movie and I like it more and more. I was not surprised by the high number of negative comments. In fact, I was pleased to know that most people negatively valued this movie. This made me laugh, because it reinforced what I already knew: this excellent movie can not be properly appreciated if you do not have imagination, some culture, a brain and an open mind. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), many people lack the above mentioned requirements. It is indeed a movie for a minority. 1. The Main Character is great: Here, we have a cynical and immoral book dealer (Johnny Depp), who starts the movie as a money-hungry materialistic mercenary, and ends up being a spiritual believer ready to risk his life in an uncertain adventure with an even more uncertain ending. The man who Boris Balkan trusts at the beginning of the movie because he can be bought with cash, ends up telling his boss Balkan that the Engravings are worth much more than money. The one who undertakes a journey of transformation from the material to the spiritual is Dean Corso. He is the chosen one, aided by fate (and green eyes, of course). He crosses indeed all the gates and lives a truly amazing rite of passage that leads to freedom and the acceptation of the supernatural. 2. The support Characters are impressive: - The ambiguous Spanish twin brothers, the Ceniza Brothers, are magnificent. The apparently harmless brothers, always sarcastic and mysterious, convey very well the feeling that they do know something that you don't (it proves to be true in the end). They are deliciously and childishly malevolent and mischievous. - Victor Fargas, the Old Portuguese collector, is a great example of decadence, an old dinosaur who knows there is no place for him in this world, very much similar to the decadent intellectuals described by Edgar Allan Poe in his novels. He is very much like Roderick Usher. - Boris Balkan is the fanatical believer, utterly convinced that he is the only one, the chosen one to decipher the mystery and take ""the road that leads to equality with god"". He stops at nothing to get what he wants and is a constant and menacing presence and influence. - Liana Telfer/Saint Martin is great. Attractive, seductive, fishy, evil, immoral, manipulative bitch. - The Baroness Frieda Kessler, aristocratic, eccentric, probably lesbian, infatuated with the devil - Green Eyes, the beautiful Emmanuelle Seignier, is a profoundly disturbing character. She is the incarnation of Johnny Depp's fate, and incarnation of the devil, a beautiful succubus who aids Depp in his journey of self-discovery , change and transformation and actually chooses him to be her ""partner"". The scene in which they make love in front of the burning castle is amazing. She is so beautiful, mysterious and captivating that the movie is worth watching only for her presence. It is wonderful when she watches and enjoys herself with a mischievous smile when Depp violently kills the black albino.The end of the movie is good, as it is an open end, suggestive and full of possibilities. When we see the light in the castle, we know that Depp is going to accomplish what Balkan failed. What did he accomplish? Well, he is going to take the road that leads to equality what god. No less¡¡¡¡¡ This end is wonderful, because it leaves all to our imagination. Therefore, those lacking imagination will hate it, because they will not see anything at all but frustration. This end is an intellectual end, an open end for those able to appreciate the full extent and implications of the movie. So, what's this movie about? This movie is about the transformation of an upper middle class materialistic person into an adventurer and spiritual believer. Johny Depp ends up being very much like his hated boss, Boris Balkan. The only difference is that Balkan was always a believer and a fanatical adept. But the devil clearly prefers those who are converted. What is more attractive? A man who has always been a Saint (or a devil), or a man who is a sinner and ends up being a Saint (or a devil) after a process of self transformation and a leap of faith? Clearly, the devil preferred Depp, the materialistic unbeliever that quickly transforms himself, and crosses all the gates. In a very short time, Dean Corso, the materialistic unbeliever who sleeps out of boredom at a conference about the devil and can be bought with cash and that only believes in his percentage grows accustomed with the supernatural and accepts it(green eyes), murders two people not for material profit but for spiritual knowledge and ends up daring to risk his life(just like Balkan) in a very uncertain but hauntingly beautiful end. Finally, it was him who dared to take the road that leads to equality with god. And after seeing the dazzling light in the castle, at the final scene, I daresay he accomplished what Balkan failed. This movie is a movie about inverse moral. We are used to see in movies bad guys who in the end turn up to be the good guys. However, here, the process is more complicated and malevolent. This is an inverse process of conversion. We have watched without knowing it what for the devil would be the process of choosing, grooming and rewarding a promising new adept, and rewarding him with the ultimate reward: equality with god. No less. This is a movie for intelligent people. By the way, the devil was always in plain sight, which is an irony: it was the girl, and she chose to reward Depp instead of Balkan. Balkan was already a believer, and Depp wasn't at first. And you know, all women prefer something they do not have, even if they are the incarnation of the devil¡¡¡¡",The Ninth Gate

Of course within the film there is a 'closure' of story facts - Rosemary gives birth to Satan, the prime minister has ties with the CIA etc.... - but something else is unsolved and left for you to explore. Usually this is something of a secret, an esoteric mystery... Polanski creates that atmosphere of secrecy by purely film-technical means; music, mis-en-scenes, camera positions, color, etc.... Never by real information. So in his soul he has access to this sacred grounds but in his films he stops at the ending.....Ninth Gate for sure has a bad ending. No clue why.

186,tom-darwin,What's Scarier Than a Polanski Film About the Devil?,7,13 May 2006,"Answer: a Polanski film about the Devil starring Johnny Depp, the toughest pretty-boy in film history. In fact, the pairing of the brilliant, Francophile Depp & the exiled genius seems so natural that it's a wonder it never happened before. Clever, mercenary rare book expert Dean Corso (""a double-dealing, money-grubbing bastard"" according to his best friend) is hired by zillionaire publisher & demonology collector Boris Balkan (Langella) to research Balkan's newest & most prized acquisition: one of 3 copies of the ""Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows,"" a book written by the most flagrant Satanist of the Inquisition period, allegedly in concert with Lucifer himself. Cursory examination of the book indicates it's original, but Balkan professes to be unsure & will pay Corso a fortune to examine it with the other two: one in Spain & one in Paris. Corso can't even get out of Manhattan without realizing there's a lot more to it than that. Two women bedevil Corso's journey: French aristocrat Lianna Telfer (Olin), the widow of the book's former owner, who will do ANYTHING to get it back, and a beautiful, shabby, enigmatic blonde (Seigner) who appears whenever Corso needs a guardian angel. But why would an angel protect a scumbag like Corso? Polanski's adaptation of the cool, dark, intelligent Spanish novel ""Club Dumas"" is very European, with just enough violence to keep a Yank from rigor mortis but dripping with temptation, sex, intrigue & pure, Roman Catholic evil. Like the book, this film is the opposite of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" which is about puzzles & devices. The characters, not the story, are Polanski's puzzles. They don't come off as well as they might. Corso doesn't really have any redeeming qualities, no underlying goodness, only modest reserves of courage, no end to cynicism. Yet he's neither ambitious enough nor evil enough to avoid being the tool of his betters. Olin, fine but a stereotyped femdemon, is a bit too effective as the devilish widow, leaving little to the imagination, least of all that toned body. Had the role more closely followed the book, Nicole Kidman or even Reese Witherspoon might have found it a worthy challenge. The supporting cast is above average, notably Langella as the hulking, mild-mannered intellectual who effortlessly matches limitless finance to the glories of Hell, Jefford as the crippled aristocrat with a girlish crush on the Prince of Darkness & Taylor (another American exile) as sad, shabby Portuguese nobleman Fargas. Of the three overt devices Polanski insists on using, one--the never-ending smoking of cigarettes--is annoying, confusing & contrived since most of the characters are supposed to be the quill of rare book experts. The second, the book & its drawings, contrive a puzzle just hard enough to keep our interest when Johnny needs a break. The third device, Seigner's mystery girl, is far more satisfying, never really letting us know whether she's out to save Corso's soul as well as his butt until the very end. But it's Depp's show & he overcomes the pedantry of Corso with a nuanced portrayal of cynicism, greed, fear, awe, frustration & determination, a performance that never lags, never fails to fascinate. Could any other actor still be a believable sleuth who persists despite being regularly pummeled by women? Khondji's masterful cinematography & Kilar's dark score round out Polanski's quiet but stylishly sable tale of classic, Old-World devilry. There's little blood-drinking (and that little is sexy), no flesh burned or curdled, no metamorphoses, no crosses warding off evil energy. ""The Ninth Gate"" cuts to the chase: the chase for our souls, for Polanski, Depp & company make this supernatural tale human enough to put us in fear of the Fallen One. It's a necessary addition to any Halloween collection or a fine, dark thrill any time.",The Ninth Gate
187,rtrnt,"Rich, enticing material but mismanaged by a woeful script",6,10 May 2020,"I wonder how much worse this film would have been without Johnny Depp's crisp performance. He carries the film most of the way. In fact, one would argue he should even be having a bit more fun. He's a book researcher who is asked to authenticate a rare text from a wealthy client. Along the way, he discovers how dangerous his task is and what circles he is rubbing shoulders with. A lot of acting talent is minimally used in this film. Frank Langella has very little screen-time as a megalomaniacal scholar/benefactor whose ownership of an important text is at the heart of the story. Lena Olin is a sultry, ravishing presence in this film, but she too wallows in a relatively smallish role.Only the film's amusing, ending slightly makes up for the script's silly lapses. But even then, I wouldn't give this a passing grade. Why, oh why did Polanski choose to go with such a flawed script with so many holes and risible moments? It might be a question that never gets answered. Not recommended.",The Ninth Gate

He builds and builds, but never really releases. Show us the devil, damn it. Do something!! Instead of letting us sit there in the dark thinking ""Oh well"".Johnny Depp is great in this film, as he has been, in every film he's been cast for.

The man whos scared at first can suddenly witness the most horrific things and just go about his day like it's another walk in the park. They donthis multiple times throughout the whole movie.

193,Global_Marketing_Pros,"Revelations of artwork, interpretation of a pagan occult practice",7,25 June 2007,"The Ninth Gate is a very entertaining movie which makes the pagan occult of un-holy communes a spectacle. The sound selection seemed adequate and not overly done. I think the major roles of each character were well laid within the plot as the story was un-told. The plot of having a book detective investigate authentic claims of publication is unique. I think Johnny Dep plays a fairly good role.I am trying to understand the role of illustrations with-in the plot, un-less to reveal a second story as the ending may infer as the book detective walks into the rising sun of the East. Visual cues are a definite link to the great entertainment of audio-visual works of art. The ancient Greeks used masks with auditory megaphones to help communicate to the audience. The details of any great work of art are in the details as well. Which can be said for painting, drawings, etc.Personally I would like to see a sequel of how Middle Eastern thought may be involved with the concept of paper illustrations. The Sun itself is a religious icon in the Middle East, which coincides with the power of heat and light over darkness. As singular thought to re-recognize true natural power is the essence of society. To master one-self and co-ordinate others to harness the power of nature seems the object of how the sequel should continue this story.In retrospect the use of fire and natural lighting is very play-full right up to the very end, or climax. I think the passion of the human spirit as portrayed as a natural energy for the quest for authentic knowledge was also done with very good artistic ability in this film, The Ninth Gate. As for the natural power of pagan occult practices with use of gender the differences between male and female seem obvious. This is a curious facet as compared with the use of symbols where the pentagram is primarily used instead of a waning or waxing phase of the moon.",The Ninth Gate
194,Jeddia,"Beautiful and stylish, but no closure (when it was due...)",6,12 August 2000,"This film was beautifully shot and the musical score was one of the best I've heard.  The cast was superb but the script lacked in spots - some bad dialogue...*cringes.  It kept me rather mesmerized for about 80 minutes, then it kind of came tumbling down.  Blatant shots of supernatural elements (such as The Girl floating around and kicking people...) that just weren't ever explained.  It's not so bad to tell a story with no closure at the end except when you spend too much time filling the screen with unexplainable elements.  For the movie's length and pace, and for it's subject matter, I simply felt that the audience deserved more from the conclusion.  Color me ignorant, but the scene with Depp and the girl at the end seemed a bit forced into the script (nice scene though...).  All in all, I give it a 6 out of 10.  Worth the rental.",The Ninth Gate
195,Fredichi,Tries to be smart but ends up being really really really stupid.,1,8 August 2000,"Polanski spends all of it's time being an almost B-Genre horror suspense movie then decides to try tag on a philosophical tinge at the end with the ambiguous ending.The ending really is pitiful. I have seen movies that leave things up to the viewer, that are based on individual interpretation but this is just weak.The whole movie is a rather simple mystery but you go along because you expect something else. You wait for it to get complicated or throw you a new twist. But it doesn't. You know everything five minutes before it happens.
The performances and the beautiful photography keep it going...barely.
But the movie is obvious and just plain adolescent. It doesn't explore any kind of religious ideas. It doesn't offer anything scary and it sure doesn't give you anything new as a suspense film.It only offers an interesting lead character and that's it.You wait and you wait for an explanation of why everything is so simple and obvious. It never comes.And the more you think about the ending the more it seems like the screenplay was written by two high school kids. Or worse two grade schoolers.Could of been good. Should of been good.Polanski has done some great films. And some really bad ones. (""Pirates"" anyone?) This is probably his laziest film.Why on earth did everyone involved agree to do this after reading the abysmal story is just as puzzling as the ending.Oh yeah and Dubois did some horrible CGI work on this. I've seen better special effects on Star Trek.If the fake backgrounds while driving were an homage to Hitchcock then he should of done them with a bad bluescreen instead of expensive CGI.Ugh...what a waste. Hopefully someone will see all theses bad reviews and save themselves two hours and watch something else.You were warned.",The Ninth Gate
196,bob_gilmore1,Best to watch it 9 times.....,10,10 October 2007,"Time has been good to ""The Ninth Gate."" Generally panned upon release as a ""would be"" international sensation it has generated quite a cult (go figure) following and rewards patient viewing. Like the great noir films (""The Big Sleep"", ""Murder My Sweet"" etc) the joy is found not at the end of the film when everything ""is tied up with pink ribbons on it"" but rather in the quest itself. Many of the film's defenders (who were actually surprised by the flood of negative reviews) go to great lenghts to justify it's plotting, lighting, music, etc. but the real defense of the film is that it is one of the best film noirs made since, you guessed it, Chinatown.Much of the film's technical qualities have been widely praised in this entry but to see such a convergence of fine film making technique all at once is quite a bit of fun. At any point in the film you can focus on the set-ups, framing and what not and can certainly tell the difference between this and the routine collection of hack jobs that show up at the multiplexes weekly.It would not be until the release of ""The Pianist"" two years later that Polanksi would get the majority of critics squarely back in his camp.

It had some elements of the occult, enough to add to mysticism to this mundane world of ours. Johnny Depp's performance was excellent.The movie is over 2 hrs long, yet it seemed as though they just rushed over everything.  It left me wondering what had happened, especially the ending (although I would not expect a sequel).  For example, who exactly is the girl?  A demon?  An angel?  The devil?  Sure she's associated with Johnny's task, but to what degree?  One cannot exactly tell based upon the engraving shown to us.In some respects, I found that this movie and ""In the Mouth of Madness"" share some common roots, although the two movies are still quite different.",The Ninth Gate

There is a great cast of occultist characters who are way over the top and enjoyable all the way. Frank Langella as a giant, power hungry cult leader and Lena Olin as an evil she-devil woman are superb. The script is perfect, and every line has meaning and resonance. The director does a good job at allowing the viewer to experience the mystery contained in those old books first-hand. I think the filmmaker had a vision, didn't compromise and made the exact film he wanted to make.

It must be the perfect amount, and blended into the rest of the spices.
Not enough, or too much - and the meal is ruined.

This film is painfully slow to watch. You know where it's going long before any of the characters do.Depp is very good as an immoral book dealer, but he can't save this movie.

203,Vassago,A stylish masterpiece: no wonder so many dullards dislike it.,10,29 December 2003,"Certainly the best and most stylish horror of the 1990s, it placed Roman Polanski back at his roots, allowing him to once again explore the dark depths of the occult and the human psyche, and providing the viewers with the pleasure of following the new protagonist on a thrilling journey in search of... ah, no, see the film and find out what it is that Corso wants and what he ultimately discovers. Having seen and loving this masterpiece, I immediately expected hordes of dullwitted mouthbreathers throughout the world to loathe it for its elegance, stylishness, unconventionality and darkness - and they did not disappoint me. I quickly saw them attack the film, complaining (their complaints always badly misspelled, with horrendous syntax, third-grade lexicon and short, monotonous sentences, regardless of the language used) that the movie was ""confusing"" (please stick to your level of entertainment, an X-Men cartoon), that ""nothing happened"" in it (nothing certainly ever happens in their heads; as for the film, the fate of the world being chosen and sealed was but one of the things that happened), that it was ""too slow"" (no, my ""dears"" - *you* are), or that ""the acting was bad"" (compared to their favorite pearls of cinematic performance, such as ""Scream 3"" or ""Jason goes to Hell""), or that there ""wasn't enough action""... ...and with this complaint of theirs, we arrive at the real reason why the dullards disliked ""The Ninth Gate"" (other than the fact that they were unable to understand it) - it did not have enough explosions! Not enough Marilyn Manson! Not enough kung-fu fights in slow motion! Not enough Sarah Michelle Gellar! Not enough clone syrup! Well, ""dears"", sorry - this is a thinking person's film. Not *your* kind of movie, but ours. Now leave us in peace, allow us to enjoy Roman Polanski's vision again, and feel free to go see an Adam Sandler ""comedy"" or ""Charlie's Angels 2"" - flicks of this kind should certainly match your ""intellectual level"" and provide you with enough infantile ""entertainment"" to last you the whole afternoon.",The Ninth Gate

206,buzzerbill,Exceptional!,9,8 January 2011,"I am not in general particularly fond of Roman Polanski as a directer. In The Ninth Gate, however, he accomplishes something rather special--a genuinely unnerving and haunting intellectual thriller, and one of the very few films that treats the occult with intelligence and respect.Inevitably, the comparison to Rosemary's Baby has to be made. Let's start with the source material. Ira Levin's novel is a well-made pot-boiler; Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas, on which The Ninth Gate is based (the novel is quite different in certain respects) is a first-rate intellectual thriller, and, frankly, a much superior novel. Rosemary's Baby is more a nightmare of a really, really bad pregnancy than a supernatural film. In addition, it stars two of the most annoying fingernails-on-the-blackboard actresses imaginable--Ruth Gordon and Mia Farrow. It's a chick flick with pretensions.The Ninth Gate is superior in every way. Superficially, it's a detective story with occult content and a Faustian subplot. But how many films deal with the world of rare books-accurately? This film does not insult the viewer's intelligence.The script is well written and literate. Boris Balkan, a book collector obsessed with rare books about the devil, commissions rare book dealer Gregory Corso with an unusual task. Balkan has just obtained one of three copies extant of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows""--a book printed in 1666 and purportedly based on an actual text by the devil himself. (The author was burned at the stake for heresy). Balkan wants to verify the authenticity of his copy by comparing it with the other two. This quest becomes more and more perilous as it becomes evident that some sort of singular significance attachs to variations between the three copies in the nine engravings. Balkan attempts to use the nine engravings to summon Lucifer--and fails. But there is something about the ninth engraving.....The casting is just about perfect--the only actor who somewhat falls below the mark is Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl--manifestly Satan's minion in this demonic Pilgrim's Progress. A former model, Ms. Seigner is beautiful--but boring. Apparently Polanski directed her to play the role flat--but except for the occasional special effect with her eyes, we really do not feel a demonic presence. Fail of direction, or actress? Probably a bit of both. Johnny Depp does a notable job as Gregory Corso, a book dealer without a conscience; Lena Olin does another turn on her standard over-sexed villain persona as Liana Telfer; Frank Langella is appropriately menacing as Boris Balkan, an arrogant book collector who longs for union with Satan.What makes this film work so well is that overused term atmosphere. There are few films indeed where atmosphere plays so important a role--a just comparison is to another notable supernatural film, one of the very few really frightening ghost stories on film--Robert Wise's The Haunting. In The Ninth Gate, as in The Haunting, the surrounding are critical characters. Corso, Balkan, and other inhabit spaces that are frequently strangely empty of other living beings. The barriers between the world we know and a numinous world of seductive promise and evil threaten to dissolve at any moment. This is a genuinely beautiful film--beautiful to look at and to listen to (the score is also first rate)--beautiful, seductive, and menacing.Many commentators has disliked the ending--and yet it is the only possible one. Corso, having obtained (or has he?) the secret of The Ninth Gate, enters the castle shown in the final engraving, which then dissolves into yellow light. Apotheosis? Transcendence? Damnation? Impossible to say. Anything more definite would be a disappointment. The ending is chilling--in the best way.This is not a film for the literal-minded. There are few comparable films--The Devil Rides Out, for one, and perhaps Dead of Night. I doubt if Polanski has ever done anything better--and the The Ninth Gate is one of the very few films about the supernatural that does not insult the intelligence. A singular and worthwhile experience indeed.",The Ninth Gate
207,spazmodeus,Excellent!,9,18 March 2002,"A very well done movie, that treats what has become a cliche subject matter with classic Polanski originality and care. This is one of those ""freaky"" movies that even the very smart and cynical can enjoy, because it doesn't leave plot and dialog gaps at all the usual places. I wrote a review because I was shocked by how underrated it is in the IMDB. Don't be deterred by the whines of the kiddies who would have preferred chainsaws, axes and monsters.

I realize not his most popular but this is a highlight of his abilities.José López Rodero and Willy Holt, both non-actors, reveal that talent is talent and also reveal the master at work, how he draws these performances out of these remarkable people is astonishing, it is magic.The casting is so well done that I should go on and on about each actor but will close with saying that both Emmanuelle Seigner and Lena Olin are electric.The sets, the scenery, it is all a remarkably crafted film, I love it and watch it from time to time.

You start out thinking Depp's character is bad and disliking him, then you start liking him as he gets worse. But the ending is inconsistent with the development, and therefore a non sequitur rather than a surprise.

211,erostew,Understated Excellence,10,19 July 2008,"To be honest I can't think of a single thing wrong with this film. It's not my favourite film of all time, but I can certainly appreciate excellence when I see it. If you're a big fan of Hollywood horror films you might just hate it. I would call it more of a thriller than a horror film, but even that isn't quite correct. It's almost like a Bergman film that transcends genres. The film is the story and the story is the film.Roman Polanski has created a film about devil worshipers that has almost no blood and the violence is not at all excessive. There are no teenagers and there are no slashers. There aren't even any traditional villains or heroes really. The villains aren't the usual caricatures that we have become used to and the protagonist is certainly less than heroic. And the demons don't look any different from us.The action is slow and evenly paced over a long movie and it leaves us wanting more at the finish. Which is what a movie should do. Polanski does not wrap every thing up in a neatly tied Hollywood conclusion. We are left with unanswered questions. Since most Hollywood endings are disappointing to at least some viewers, that's a good thing.Very well directed and excellent performances from all of the actors. Emmanuelle Seigner gives a very understated performance and effective performance. Johnny Depp is excellent as always.Cinematography is perfectly suited to the story and the editing doesn't miss a beat. Music and sound are both very good. Special effects are very minimal and used very effectively. And the locations are perfect.I've been a Johnny Depp fan for years, but I somehow missed this film.

213,jason-210,Atmospheric satanic conspiracy thriller,8,9 April 2005,"An interesting film with a lot more to it than first meets the eye. Polanski described this film as a ""cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby' though I felt more of Rosemary's baby than the other, and much more than that also. Shortly after the start, we are taken along with the protagonist into a world pervaded by an inevitable, supernatural doom, and a down-ending is sensed. Corso, and we along with him, are soon separated from ordinary reality and exposed instead to a Roman Polanski world of conspiring evil closing in.Corso is not a likable character early on in the film, and one get's the feeling that his come-uppance is due. I wondered if he would suffer a horrible fate, or change into a better person and help defeat evil, when it came down to it. I couldn't predict how the plot would unfold, as unexpected turns kept occurring. As the film developed I grew to like Corso more. Although his actions seemed to grow worse, We empathise with him more and more as his motives change from money to the need to know. We are with him, and we need to know also.The photography and details are excellent; and the slow pace, mood and settings combine to make this a really scary film. The whole riddle of the engravings in the books, and the puzzlement of their intriguing differences, helps create a very frightening atmosphere.The performances are on the whole very good and the occult characters convincing. Balkan (Frank Langella) in particular is frightening, powerful, possessive. One real horrible scene is where he strangles one of the key characters and the pushes her away in disgust by placing his foot on her back and sliding her across a polished floor with one swift kick. The real bad guys in this film are the devil-worshipers Lena Olin, Balkan and others. Corso's female aide Emmanuelle Seigner, who is obviously some kind of supernatural being, seemed very unevil in comparison. The result of this film to my mind is that it questions our ideas, expectations and attitudes about the nature of good and evil.The final scene left me with an impression not of horror; but with a sense of justice. It was and 'up' ending. It made me wonder at what Polanski wanted to convey about the nature of 'Lucifer'",The Ninth Gate

This means Depp having to goto the location of the other 2 known nine gate books, which are located in Spain and France to compare there appearancs.From the start of his journey to the very end there is murder, betrayal, suspense and a hint of supernatural goings on that seem to get in Depps way. There is nothing really new here in this kind of film, but its the way the film developes through the aid of some Polanski magic that makes it a class apart from most supernatural thrillers.

215,Adam Frisch,Best Polanski in years...,10,29 November 1999,"Granted, I'm slightly biased since I happen to love Mr. Polanski's work, but this film was really good. It kind of built in a slow, very menacing way and had an intelligent plot, only fully concluded until you're out of the cinema. As usual with the demanding master, the performances are first class, specially Langella and Depp. Here comes a brief summary of the highlights in my opinion:Brilliant cinematography by the talented Darius Khondji (of Se7en fame).The most original title sequence I've seen this side of Bond.Also listen closely to Wojchiech Kilars (of Dracula fame) absolutely brilliant score. So light, and yet so heavy and menacing. Very un-Hollywood.It definetly puts Polanski back into the game again.

217,pete-murphy97,An Exceptional Occult Thriller,10,16 January 2018,"'The Ninth Gate' is an instant classic, a tasteful, idiosyncratic, and tactfully executed film on the occult knowledge so many know nothing of, a film of powerful symbology.
This film is an ode to the uninitiated, demonstrating how the occult world and its knowledge is more commonplace and 'real' than we might believe, it surrounds us, it is us.At all times, 'The Ninth Gate' makes the viewer question its directions and motives, even the lead character, Corso (Johnny Depp), cannot be trusted, everything is expendable, with a lingeringly somber feeling of danger and fragility at every twist and turn. 
Corso comes from the Latin 'cursus' meaning 'course'; the events that unfold become a prophesy that Corso is on a 'course' to fulfill from the very start, this is a reference to the left and right hand paths and how our choices affect everything, Corso chose marriage with the covenant of Satan, The Girl (Emmanuelle Seigner), the antilight.
9 is the number of Satan, the number of base consciousness, the ego.In the Satanic Rituals (THE UNKNOWN KNOWN) Anton LaVey speaks ambiguously and enigmatically about the number 9 being the main number of which to identify with Satan and the ego. ""Despite other's attempts to identify a certain number with Satan (meaning 666), It will be known that Nine is his number. Nine is the number of the Ego, for it always returns to itself. No matter what is done through the most complex multiplication of Nine by any other number, in the final equation nine alone will stand forth."" - Anton LaVey, The Satanic RitualsThe number 9 also refers to Yesod node of the tree of life, Yesod channels, the feminine Malkuth receives (sex act, as in the film). In turn, it is through Malkuth that the earth is able to interact with the divinity. This may be what is portrayed in the events detailed in the film.'The Ninth Gate' is one of Roman Polanski's greatest works, threading together an engaging psychological thriller with a philosophical and theological backing that keeps the whole piece held in an air of mystery and suspense.The sets are Gothic and gloomy, the music is aptly fitting, the acting and scripts even more so; nothing breaks the persistent, unshakable scene and tone that is set by Polanski, who has obviously taken into careful consideration every possible factor to create a deeply immersive, memorable experience for the viewer.9.7/10",The Ninth Gate

219,Nahret,Not easily understood. 8 of 10.,8,8 July 2002,"There is something beautifully refreshing about movies where you actually have to think while you watch. And to be honest, the ending takes so much figuring out, that the more people you ask, the more opinions you'll get.The mood for the film is set right from the start. We first meet our hero, Dean Corso, an antique books dealer, as he swindles a hapless couples out of a priceless first edition of Cervantes' Don Quixote. Mr. Polanski is taking a bit of a chance by presenting his protagonist as a rather reprehensible creature, who's clearly in it for he money. But this portrayal is necessary, as it is important to understand that Corso does not believe in the supernatural in any way, nor is he especially fond of books. Again, it's all for the cash. The ever evil Frank Langella may at first be mistaken for Satan himself. But his character, the driving force behind Corso's quest, and a dangerous man to displease, is merely a devout disciple, and, as such, a firm believer, thus representing the other end of the spectrum.Minor spoilers.In spite of our initial misgivings, our empathy with Johnny Depp's character is established after about the second time someone tries to kill him. It won't be the last time, either, so luckily he is assigned a guardian angel, who might also be something else. And he's not the only one in danger; as Corso progresses on his quest to secure the copies of the fabled book, the people who own them, die. Those deaths (did he have a hand in them?), the ever deepening mystery and his beautiful angel, work the necessary transformation. Having forgotten about the money, Corso now carries on out of his very own... curiosity? Obsession? He has long been turned into a believer when he undertakes a final journey. Looking for the Devil, it seems, is like looking into the abyss; He might also be looking for you.",The Ninth Gate
220,AS-69,Much too tame.,4,16 December 2003,"SpoilersThe ""Ninth Gate"" is an undistinguished and unspectacular movie. If it had not been directed by Roman Polanski and had not featured Johnny Depp, it would have passed completely unnoticed and received ratings between 3 and 5. Of course, you can see that the movie had some budget and was realized by a competent director, but the rest is an old hat. The plot evolves around an antique book about the devil, and most of the people related to it get killed (mostly in unspectacular ways). The mystery is quickly resolved: Already when Johnny Depp studies the book the first time in a library, you can see a woodcut depicting a woman resembling very much Emmanuelle Seigner (so she is related to the devil). The fact that she turns into a guardian ""angel"" for Johnny Depp makes it clear that he is a ""chosen one"" of some kind. When Johnny Depp examines the second copy of the book, he discovers the main secret about the woodcuts, and then we do not hear anything new about them until at the end Frank Langella briefly summarizes the meaning of each one. The devil is also the same as usual: He comes in a beautiful guise (Emmanuelle Seigner, bright light), but at the end he betrays those worshipping him. The main problem about this movie is that it is filmed completely without passion. It never becomes exciting or even shocking. The spectator remains as unaffected by the events as Johnny Depp (who keeps the same ice cold uninterested expression during the whole movie). For a film about the devil and hell, this is particularly strange. If you want to watch a movie where hell really breaks loose, I recommend Lucio Fulci's ""The Beyond"". In my opinion, Polanski made this movie without any personal involvement, just for earning some money.",The Ninth Gate

Well it could have been, but what might have been the main selling points turn out to be the film's downfall. Johnny Depp is one of those actors who seems ideally suited to some roles but totally out of his depth in others. Sadly this falls into the latter category. Depp is unconvincing and wooden, though that isn't the film's main problem. For the most part of this film it all seemed to be going somewhere interesting, with the holes in the plot and the sense of confusion not causing any worry as it trundled along in tried and tested supernatural thriller territory (satanic rich people, levitating women - that sort of thing). The major disappointment is the ending. The film leads you along for a couple of hours and just when you think it may be leading to a satisfying conclusion, it all falls down with a hopeless ending. Did they run out of money? Was Polanski making it up as he went along? Who knows. Not really a film that justifies repeat viewings.",The Ninth Gate
222,iF....,Polanski returns to the macabre,7,12 March 2000,"I have seen every single Roman Polanski feature film ever made. I can strongly say that he is definitely one of the greatest masters of contemporary cinema. He is a director that doesn't follow one path of filmmaking. He specializes in thrillers, but he proved with Chinatown and Tess that he is capable of masterpiece filmmaking. Personally I prefer him as a cult status director. The subjects of his films are based on the macabre; this reputation has caused him to become one of the greatest and most controversial directors ever. As any Polanski connoisseur knows he fled to France and has reside there ever since. His last film was Death and the Maiden. A project he took because he needed the money. Nevertheless it was a good movie. Afterwards he disappeared from the face of the earth until he began filming a project based on the genre he was familiar with, a supernatural thriller based on the occult. This project is called The Ninth Gate. I was very eager to see this movie mainly because I love Polanski's movies. Now that it has finally been released here in the US I am happy yet sad. I went to see it opening night, which was this Friday, March 10th.  I left the theater somewhat disappointed. It seems that Polanski has spent those years off partying in France. His style has somewhat been lost; his emphasis on creating a psychological thriller is not there. Instead we have a slow paced film which ends up looking rather silly. Some guy said that there were fighting scenes that resembled The Matrix's fighting scenes, I'm not sure which film he saw but there was nothing of the sort. There was however a shot where you seen Polanski's beautiful wife Emmanuelle Seigner fly, and kick some guy's butt. I don't know but I felt that was quite silly. The burning castle sex scene, which everyone keeps complaining about, is quite pointless although it does serve a purpose within the story. I really wanted to like this movie, unfortunately I couldn't find a good reason to, except that it's A Roman Polanski Film. The film had a lot of potential of being something great but it failed.

224,cheshire551225800,Found a Few More clues,10,11 January 2009,"SPOILERS - - - - - - -- I just watched this movie again and there are a few comments I would like to add to the general ideas. Firstly, my impression of THE GIRL was that she was like a Valkyrie of Norse Myth, she chose who would make it to Valhalla, or Hell in this case. But she could be the devil herself certainly. Although this movie was about choosing one person to be enlightened (as they said ""Thus let the light shine"" on the front engraving) or if you insist on being terribly judeo-Christian-Islamic about it, de-enlightened, this could have been only one of many through the ages as De Torquia himself must have been chosen, for example. Also, The actual 9th plate engraving shows a 7 headed beast which may be the 7 deadly sins, however, it shows the beast harnessed and being ridden by the girl reading a book, meaning she had overcome the pull of the sins and tamed them by education.Also, the 2nd time Corso visits the shop of the brothers Ceneza, the two guys there (workmen) were played by the same one guy who played both Cenesa brothers. I checked the credits to be sure. Plus, the same child's voice on both visits says, ""Si, Si Mama!"" suggesting that the shop exists outside of ""real"" time.To eat from the tree of the KNOWLEDGE of good and evil is to understand duality thus the serpent could be seen as the bringer of enlightenment not death. the first two times Corso sees dead bodies (Bernie and Vargas) he says Jesus Christ or God Almight, thus signaling the god as he is generally understood is the bringer of death, not life.The girl is overlooked because she appears poor, badly dressed and unwashed. Telfer and Balkan would never have spoken to her, even though she is the way to what they claim to seek. They can never ""see"" her. Balkan wears thick glasses and Corso's glasses get broken symbolizing that what is commonly accepted as a way to see really hinders actual ""seeing"".The Baroness ""saw"" the devil when she was 15 and sought him ever since but she also fell by the wayside by distraction. Balkan, by sending Corso to do the work (even though it was his idea to compare the books) shows he is not worthy. Corso did things he never thought he would do. He went through streams, begged rides, rode with animals and walked to get to the tower. He may have followed those who forged the way, but HE was willing to see her and personally do what it took. I think any of those people could have been chosen if they had ""seen"" and done the work themselves. Instead they all got rich and lazy while Corso is described as ""lean and hungry"". Just some ideas I got from this great great work of art. I'm going to read the nove on which it was based.",The Ninth Gate

The Ninth Gate is a movie directed by Roman Polanski and it has Johnny Depp and Frank Langella in its casting. The movie's source material loosely based on Arturo Perez-Reverte's Dumas Club. I didn't read the book so I won't compare it to book version. In the story our protagonist Dean Corso portrayed by Johnny deep is a kind of book detective and He was hired to find certain ancient books for collectors. A collector offers a lot of money to Corso to find last two copies a demon text The Ninth Gate. Then, our protagonist find himself in a danger and tries to find a way to get himself out of this condition. In first half of the movie was interesting for me, mysteries revealed us the audience slowly while Corso learning a new things at the same time we learn this mysteries. When we are closing to ending of the movie, the story's mysteries revealed us and all the movies good sides were lost at the same time. Although, I liked Deep's performance it is an a mediocre movie for me.",The Ninth Gate

I also wondered was the girl the devil the whole time and simply musing for it's entertainment with foolish mortals who wished to worship him/her. My theory is that she was the ninth gate... if you recall the ninth drawing is a woman and a beast. The significance of the end is he's going to be with her. She was totally hot.. btw.

227,aschachte,The seventh worst movie of the 1990's,1,25 November 2006,"Heavy spoiler action here.Great premise for a really good movie. Maybe someone should actually make it next time. This movie was not scary at all. Not even creepy. Every time the ""hero"" gets close to the truth, he gets beaned in the back of the head and almost killed as the building burns down while he regains consciousness. He's not smart enough to buy a helmet. And what the heck happened at the end? Couldn't they make something scary happen somewhere in this movie? Of course not. Take The Haunting, delete all the freaky special effects, the old lady talking about how there will be nobody from town to come and help in the middle of the night, and replace the sexy Catherine Zeta Jones with a toothless hobo. You would still have 10 times the horror movie the Ninth Gate was. At the end of the movie, the bad guy puts all the 9 pictures together to form the ""spell"" that will grant him ultimate power. The jerk had one of the wrong pictures and the spell kills him. Then the ""hero"" finds the right picture, does the spell, and presumably gets the power. But I didn't see how the spell was any different using the right pictures. I suppose what I would really like is for someone to pick up the ball here and try running for the other goal line this time. It's truly a sad thing. This one had a lot of potential, but only at the conceptual level. It's like hearing a 5-year-old mess up a joke and laughing at the joke your mind rearranges from the idea he gave you. To make this movie good, you would have to start over with a blank piece of paper, and maybe keep the bad guy and those weird devil drawings. An actual appearance by the devil (or at least see the clawed foot of an underling demon) would have at least added some fear of the consequences of this foolish undertaking they attempted to portray in the Ninth Gate.",The Ninth Gate
228,threeJane,I went to *The Ninth Gate* to escape [work].,4,28 March 2003,"By Roman Polanski and with Johnny Depp, promising terror and the supernatural, I thought it would be the perfect distraction.The opening credits were promising enough.  The camera gliding wraith-like through great old stone and wood doors, opening into vast deserts of darkened rooms in which hung the credits, mid-air; gliding across the sandy floors, speeding towards the gleaming credits, through them just as they'd become legible then leaving them far behind for another heavy gate, heralding some supreme evil at the end of them all.I do like a good set of credits.  But beyond the credits there wasn't a lot to be found.  There is a neat storyline in this film, a sort of riddle which ties itself up nicely in the end, but this could have been done as well, if not better, in a short film.*The Ninth Gate* could have done without the shonky action shots, the horribly cliched script and the ordinary casting [few of the characters work].  Depp [who as far as I'm concerned has had his last chance] never really came out from behind his hard-nosed grifter veneer [there's a reason, but it's not apparent until the end].

Depp going around France makes for some nice scenery but was a bit dull and after the first owner of a copy was bumped off you could see what was coming.

230,suffer-smart-magnet,Lots Of Potential (But The Ending Misses The Mark),6,21 January 2006,"What starts out as a promising thriller from veteran director/writer Roman Polanski (""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968), ends up getting tangled in a spider's web of technical miffs, poor editing, and weak score.Starting off strong, we learn about Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), an unscrupulous book dealer who is willing to deceive in order to get a deal on a rare copy of ""Don Quixote"". One of his regular customers, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), calls on him to verify the authenticity of his rare book ""The Nine Gates"" by comparing it to the only other two copies in existence. But Balkan is too insistent and suspiciously generous in his offers, already promising to double the money before Corso even starts. But Corso (apparently not being as smart as us viewers) doesn't really question this. Additionally, Balkan offhandedly entrusts the $1,000,000 book to Corso without hesitation or contract, despite its enormous value.As Corso tracks down the other two books (he gets on an airplane - Balkan has already told him of their European locations) and people around him start to die, he learns that the book (derived from a book by Lucifer) somehow holds the key to opening a portal called the ninth gate.Corso, examining the differences in the nine illustrations between his and Victor Fargas' copy, finds some of the illustrations signed by LCF (for 'Lucifer'), and some by AT. Here the plot takes a major 'wrong turn', as the viewers can clearly see what Corso doesn't: that the nine LCF illustrations, distributed among the three copies of the book, must be brought together to solve the riddle and unleash the book's powers.As we wait for Corso to catch on to this mind-numbingly obvious fact, he continues on his quest, which instead of gaining intrigue, becomes plodding and familiar. The same goes for 'The Girl' (Emmanuelle Seigner), who mysteriously appears and disappears, occasionally gliding through the air, but we never learn much more about her (except she has a thick accent, never answers questions, and likes to have sex near burning buildings).Aside from Depp, who finally succumbs to sleep-walking through his part, most of the acting is B-rate. Seigner blurts our her lines at times, much to the dismay of viewers wanting something more substantial. Langella, for the most part, does well until the climax of the film.Effects, even minor ones, could be troublesome. A wire to tip over a podium during a fight scene was glaring. The CG in the opening titles was poorly done, though mostly forgivable. Driving and flying scenes were obviously rear projections, if only they hadn't been so thoroughly abused.Then there are things that defy explanation. Corso, in hot pursuit of Balkan, stops in the middle of a stream (where he supposedly got stuck). A car, trying to hit Corso, manages to miss by swerving in the opposite direction. In an attempt to surreptitiously follow an unsuspecting target, Corso and The Girl choose a loud, high-revving red Dodge Viper. And the film must get at least a mention for having one of the most distracting mustaches (Pedro Ceniza) ever to be projected on a silver screen.The weak score from Wojciech Kilar was often more fitting for a comedy than a thriller. As Corso walks down an alley on his way to a book dealer, we hear a kind of 'adventure' music, similar to what you'd hear in a comedy during the setup of a physical joke (I was half-expecting to see Depp pushing a circus elephant into the back of a convertible). Occasional mismatches between the action and the musical peaks don't help. During the same alley walk scene, the 'adventure' music starts in the previous scene, before we even get to see Corso walking, and it is jarring when the visuals finally catch up.At 133 minutes, this film was nearly an hour too long, plodding its way through details that should have been thought better of. Why do we care if scaffolding suddenly comes tumbling down on Corso? It wasn't scary or mysterious, just out of place.I so much wanted this movie to take me to new and exciting places, and fulfill the promise of the opening minutes. But that was not to be. It is clear that a moderately bigger budget, a few better actors/actresses, and some retakes, could have put a completely new face on what ended up being, for the most part, substandard fare. In fact, just re-scoring the movie, along with some minor editing, would move the film up a few notches.I gave this film a 6 out of 10 as an indication of 'what could have been' and for Depp's characterization of Corso.",The Ninth Gate

You know, the pulp musings of Merrit, Lovecraft, Ashton Smith, et al (for that matter, most of American filmmakers can't seem to grasp it either). Or perhaps he chooses to ignore it. Such is our loss. I always enjoy stories about hidden mysteries and covert histories, but his effort here just doesn't present enough eerie juxtaposition between the mundane elements of modern life and the supposedly preternatural parallelism of the supernatural stream of forces hidden just below our grasp. Polanski's satanism is like a dull bureaucracy made up of silly regulations - take nine engravings and call me in the morning. ""Rosemary's Baby"" showed a little more quirkiness, but still gets bogged down in ritual... I guess it's all those centuries of feudalism in Europe. There is no awe and wonder in this movie - certainly not from Johnny Depp. He's done better elsewhere.Contrast this movie with something like ""The Resurrected"" and you will see what I mean - and not just for the bizarre shocks, of course they are there to pull in the ""correct"" audience of jaded young video gamers, but are limited and dispersed for story effect also. It's the same story of ordinary humans confronting a traditional and historical ""evil"" in the modern world with a considerably more cohesive effect.",The Ninth Gate

Revelation and Apocalypse) and satanism, the more you'll understand. The ending, for one, is a really good turn if you understand what happened. If you don't know about the origins and meanings of the symbols contained in the drawings, too bad... Since I'm not too religious/mystic/whatever, I caught a glimpse of the joke and spent the rest of the time watching a straight plot with moody pictures and good-looking actors.

But No. At first it was boring. Things happened too slow. Acting was beneath mediocre. Sing a song you love and listen to the melody. Here there was no melody at all in the dialog, it was just completely monotone. The actors didn't care. Just blab it out and get paid.
And the fights, totally ridiculous, the ending. Totally BS. It didn't end. 
As if I would want a sequel of this...
Watch if you must, but you surely have better things to do. Like mowing the lawn, or knit a sweater as a Christmas gift. Even paradise hotel is better than this (although i have never watched a single episode of that).

I'm hoping for the movie's sake that there were many symbols and themes I missed because of my limited knowledge of satanic lore, but have neither the interest nor the stomach for research into the Prince of Darkness.

243,adam-scrivner,Well worth a look!,8,2 August 2011,"***May contain spoilers and stuff*** I hadn't seen this film in several years when I chanced across it on the telly a couple of nights ago. And I have to be honest, it was a lot better than I remembered.Plot: It's all about the devil, books and witchcraft, with a bit of sex, violence and intrigue carefully mixed in for good measure. The film begins quite arrestingly, and then the plot slowly twists and turns, cleverly drawing you in.Acting and casting: Johnny Depp is very credible as the aloof, arrogant, back-stabbing and very unlikable rare-book specialist Dean Corso who would cheerfully sell his own grandmother had he clearly not already done so. Frank Langella brings his not inconsiderable screen presence to the role of Boris Balkan, who employs Corso to do some digging for him; Balkan comes across as utterly chilling and not a little bit deranged. Lena Olin plays the psychotic vamp Liana Telfer, who is hell bent on getting her hands on Corso's package, using a combination of beauty, tight clothing and ruthless violence. Good stuff so far. Emmanuelle Seigner also turns in a good performance as a mysterious young woman who seems to inexplicably turn up throughout the film (don't want to spoil it)...Music: Atmospheric, and very appropriate. Much better than in many lesser films of the genre, as one would expect of Polanski.Setting: Some excellent locations were used, adding to the atmosphere.Summary: If you are at all into suspense, mystery, horror or the supernatural then you will surely greatly enjoy this film.",The Ninth Gate
244,saska-3,average work from Polanski and Depp,6,2 August 2003,"Some readers may feel this review contains minor spoilers.THE NINTH GATE is in many ways a typical Roman Polanski film - an examination of flawed people with weaknesses of greed, whether that greed be for power or money.  The main character, Dean Corso, is a rare book dealer who knows his profession well, but seemingly out of necessity.  His behavior around the legendary and unique volumes he trafficks is careless to the point of making me cringe - smoking, reading a priceless text in train's a dining car with a glass of wine inches away.  This is perhaps the only subtle method in which his character is fleshed out - the rest of our opinion of him comes from exposition so unnecessary that he actually attempts to shush a client prattling on about his unscrupulous, cutthroat business practices, echoing my own feeling about the dialogue.Corso is sent to authenticate a Satanic text for a client who is one step ahead of him.  He finds his life in danger almost immediately, and makes a half-hearted attempt to back out - ultimately, another throwaway scene that does more to confuse our opinion of him than clarify it.I half expected the DVD of this film to contain the mysterious missing scenes that would make up the thrilling part of this thriller.  I have no complaints about the pacing of the film, which draws on Hitchcock and film noir as its influences; it is appropriate and used properly.  However, I never found myself invested in the journey of Dean Corso to the extent I should have been, and most of all, I felt as though the second act's manipulation of my opinion - making Corso a sympathetic character - was a wasted exercise.  What we do not see is the transformation into the Dean Corso at the end of the film, and if we are supposed to believe his final course of action, he should have remained a constant, or else we should have seen his revelation.  Instead, I was left at the end wondering when and how he changed his course and goal, though I saw clearly what it had become.In the featurette that accompanies the film on DVD, Depp talks about enjoying characters to whom the audience reacts with changing opinion.  He has a firm grasp of how the story should have progressed, but unfortunately, I feel that Polanski lacked that same perspective, and the film suffers for it.  6/10 for tremendous production values, a beautiful score, and strong performances of all the primary characters in a story that ultimately fails to satisfy.",The Ninth Gate
245,lucky_dice_mgt,Definitely a movie of dialog,5,2 September 2008,"This film could be considered more of a mystery mixed with a Satanic Easter egg hunt. Anyone viewing this film expecting to be scared or see horrifying images of gore, monsters, blood, etc, will be severely disappointed. The film is more interested in presenting dialog and sporadic evil ambience's. In many ways , this film could be compared with other films like the 1957 Curse of the Demon, where the directors decide its often better to not show the evils and let the viewers mind do the work{ not the films endless visuals } I can understand how many people would despise this film, because it really isn't a horror film , but I can also understand how others may love this type of slow burn, dialog filled production. Like many films that depend on mainly dialog and acting { instead of gore, sex, blood, monsters, etc} , this film may need to be watched a few times to get the feel for it. Then again,I can see how many viewers would have no desire to re-watch a film that bored them . If Polanski had added a few extra minutes of visual horror, into this film, it could have been a classic IMHO. Positives :solid acting solid dialog atmospheric soundtrack clever and eerie storylineNegatives: can be boring at times lacking visual horrors Satan is never fully presented in the horrific visual images we expect anti- climatic endingI would like to mention something that no one else seems to mention. Its very possible that Polanski also was trying to subtly reveal the evil secret society's and their rumored rituals . Groups like the Talmudists, FreeMasons, etc . Stanely Kubrick [ also Jewish, like Polanski} also touched upon the actions of these rumored sinful sects with his film ""Eyes Wide Shut"" . To put it simply, Most people who love Halloween or Friday the 13th will be bored by this film and probably rate it 3 or less.

The end has to be one of the most anti-climatic, poorly directed I´ve seen in many, many years.

Johnny Depp is a good actor but even he seemed a little stilted in spots.  I thought Lena Olin was good and really the acting was done well for the most part.

Everyone in the movie gives a great performance. But for what purpose? To what end? To an end that leaves the viewer confused, disappointed, and--after investing 2 plus hours in what was an intriguing movie--angry. It's as if the screenplay writer didn't know how to write the ending, so he just concocted some symbolic mind-twist that was neither clever, nor ironic, nor satisfying. And I absolutely reject the notion that, if only the viewer were a deeper thinker, then it would all make sense. Nonsense! Socrates, Aristotle and Plato or their modern movie-going equivalents couldn't have made sense of the way the film ended. Perhaps if you majored in Luciferic studies at Satan State University, perhaps--perhaps--you'd ""get"" what happened at the end of the Ninth Gate--but I doubt it.

253,Matt-162,"Flawed, but beautiful",9,13 March 2000,"This movie will very likely be one of those either loved or hated. It has its flaws to be sure, but I didn't feel them to be accidental. So many films (at least, in this country) concern themselves with witty dialogue...sometimes to the point the players look to be reading off prompters. Other movies are destroyed by an overkill ratio of effects to story and style. What most movies don't have is atmosphere and life. It's hard to point at exactly why, but after watching this movie I felt it had both. First of all, many critics have and will attack this movie on the basis of its length. I've never felt this was a valid criticism personally, and in this movie I think it was necessary to transform a simple detective tale into the dark and somewhat confusing story it finishes as. The movie moves slowly, but the sights and sounds along the way add momentum to the overall feel. Nevertheless, those requiring frequent stimulation doubtlessly will be annoyed with all of this. Secondly, much criticism has been devoted to certain cliche areas of the movie such as the black-robed coven and the sex scene by firelight. I think there was a bit of humor in both...however it didn't detract anything to me. At the point of the sex scene, most observant viewers will have likely drawn conclusions to the nature of Mrs. Seigner's character...it merely struck me as simple symbolism of Dean Corso's coupling with evil. Somewhat hokey perhaps, but intended. The movie never gave me the impression of seriousness; it is a fantasy piece after all. And finally, that the movie strays away from the religious I felt wise. The movie wasn't really about religion. It was about humanity and the darkness within...and overall, it was something of a ghost story type...like The Omen movies. If it had become bogged down in religious issues of good and evil, it would have become another boring story that has been done over and over again. (Read...Stigmata perhaps?)Overall, I felt the movie had a dark, yet fun feel to it. The visuals are outstanding. The acting is terrific. The music is well done. (Give me a break on the cliche music bit. James Horner made a career on it) If you're looking for some deep message here, avoid this. If you're attention span clocks out at an hour and a half, avoid this. If you're looking for a movie with a dark, mysterious life of its own give this one a look.

I say that because Polansky seems to switch again and again between making a serious movie about books, Satan, and myth to making a parody of the very same subject matter. In general, if you like mysterious stories about weird underworlds (i.e. European book collectors and Devil Worshippers) then you should find this an entertaining movie. I love Depp, and I think he gives a strong performance playing a book collector with very little soul who gets embroiled in a job. His job is to authenticate an edition of the Ninth Gate, one of 3 existing. The owner thinks he has a fake, but in actuality the links between the 3 editions become much more complex. There is a mysterious woman who helps him along the way, I've always had my theories on who/what she represents but I wont spoil the movie for the rest of you. Shot well, acted well, and fairly captivating, the only negatives are the occasionally weird scenes that don't fit the underlying themes of cerebral, mysterious, and unknowing story lines. At times it seems Roman kinda just breezed through a scene or two, thats my only problem with the movie. Over all its definitely underrated, largely because it never received Hollywood's stamp of approval. Go see it.",The Ninth Gate

And how can we forget Johnny Depp's acting ability accompanied by necessary support by rest of the crew. I am not European but i love Europe and live in there. If you are a lover of history shrouded with mystery, middle ages , Gothic mansions, stoned roads , slow paced life then you will taste the background set of this movie to the fullest. In the beginning I said it is almost a perfect movie, the doubt is in its ending. I thought it could be better if we could know the identity of Emmanuelle Seigner as the mystery girl, is she the devil herself or a keeper of the ninth gate or the book, why did she help Johnny Depp? There are many questions and audience would be left in imagination. Also at some places I thought director could have created the tension a bit more like in the palace of St-Martin where Depp and the mystery girl broke in and were caught and the events that followed.

Rape, pillage, loot! Yeah! It contains engraving which are apparently of key importance, but none of it is really tied together meaningfully or convincingly.  Depp is badly miscast as a rare books dealer, he's too young and pretty. They give him facial hair and glasses, have him smoke and drink constantly, but it doesn't work. At first assigned to find these satanic volumes, he is later apparently self-motivated in his own quest for evil power. None of it is believable, or, if you are generous with your suspension of disbelief, interesting on the level of a thriller. Depp's acting is bad (sex scenes are ludicrous), but it's not his fault. It is entirely unclear what his motivation is supposed to be, and later in the movie, his behavior is so lacking in foreshadowing it makes sense only on the most superficial level.

Fails as mystery or thriller but it is OK when viewed as an adventure.,5,19 April 2017,"I have no idea how I'd have rated this had they indexed the movie with more attention.This movie basically is an adventure with a bit of comedy sprinkled along in it. It actually has more comedic elements in it than thriller. It promises for more and fails to deliver only because the single twist it's supposed to have, is no twist really. You just watch what you already know unfold in the wake of the plot.This is a nice movie to watch with perhaps some memorably funny moments. Its slow pacing isn't intended for suspense, it rather contributes to the movie's secretive atmosphere which is hard to find nowadays in adventure & mystery movies. Some scenes and settings look like they are taken straight out of a tale. Something Polanski has a knack for, I believe. These scenes that set the atmosphere of the movie are of course finely attuned to its overall beautifully crafted cinematography. I mean to say the mood is consistent throughout the movie and I deem this a success most of the time.I loved Langhella's performance. All the actors in this movie are really talented, except maybe Emanuelle Seigner. She is fine but with all the talented actors setting the bar high, her craft falls behind a bit. The twins were really fun to watch.The problem has to do with the content of the story rather than the storyline. In a movie with a secretive atmosphere like this where tension is slowly built up towards unraveling the unknown you also anticipate an elaboration on details that would render that ""unknown"" something worthy of knowing. You expect the discovery to be something worth your while, and when it ends up in a revelation you thought the director already made in the first half of the movie, because it fails to meet the expectation this secretive atmosphere has evoked in you so as to imply there is more to it, you realize the rest of the story was maybe supposed to be an adventure and you failed to recognize it and it disappoints you. Either that, or, Polanski failed to meet the demand he himself had created by giving clues early on. Since I am the audience, I consider the latter to be the case.This is not a drawback.

It doesn't explain any of the tense, suspenseful situations the protagonist found himself in during the rest of the movie. There's no sense of the last puzzle piece fitting in with the rest of a jigsaw puzzle; there's no closure. In fact, it's when the credits start rolling that you are sure that you've been had; you've sat through all this drivel for nothing. There is no payoff, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.For example, the movie begins with a wealthy, elderly gentleman writing a suicide note and then hanging himself. We are never told why. Later, the protagonist is warned that his journey may be dangerous; moments later, he is nearly killed by an enormous scaffolding collapsing. We never find out why it collapsed, or who might have been behind it. Later, the men who warned the protagonist of danger have disappeared, with no explanation or elaboration offered.

Unfortunately - like so many have remarked - the last 10 minutes didn't really work out, and this affected the impression of the entire movie which sort of fell apart in retrospect.On the plus side, there were some striking images - like Frank Langella's fire scene, or the wheelchair/fire scene - that only a first-rate filmmaker like Polanski could come up with. Like other viewers I thought about ""Eyes Wide Shut"" during some scenes, but that was a much more serious and developed movie. I liked Johnny Depp's performance, though his character was unsympathetic and he wasn't as focused as in ""Donnie Brasco"" for instance.Someone called this a ""lazy"" movie by Polanski, and I guess that's a good description - you can see the talent and the fun he had, but there was no real commitment.

Even the room sets looked smoke-filled. I kept panicking for the damage everyone was doing to their exceedingly rare and mega-expensive rare book collections! Ruined forever probably.It just wouldn't happen. All this amateur hour marketing totally spoiled this movie experience for me, and I had to dump it. So a crap rating in response to the cheap marketing tricks. Its not the only movie to do this. In the late 90s the tobacco industry was fighting back the clean air lobby by trying to ""normalise"" smoking again. Fortunately the arrival of Vaping put a stop to this blatant hyping of a product form, except for the Bond films where it was done tongue in cheek as a characteristic of the genre. But yes, here it really did distract from the story line, and spoiled the smooth build up of this movie.",The Ninth Gate
268,James B.,Confusing and disappointing.,4,5 October 2000,"I have a bachelor's degree in history, yet I couldn't make heads or tails of ""The Ninth Gate"".  The plot is somewhat interesting for the first hour, despite some obvious cliches.  In the last half-hour, the movie falls apart. I was really disappointed because I like Johnny Depp a lot and was hoping for a good movie on this interesting subject.My take on what went wrong with this film is that Polanski tried to make a mainstream movie, with the requisite amount of sex and violence, about a subject which is unconventional.  We didn't need the over-the-top scenes of hellfire and burning buildings toward the end, but someone must have thought we did.The plot was also ridiculously complicated for the last half-hour.  Two of the main characters (Frank Langella and Lena Olin) are betrayed, as act completely uncharacteristically in order to serve the convoluted and histrionic final scenes.  Don't bother with this poor film. 4/10.",The Ninth Gate

The locations were gorgeously shot and gave a real sense that the action was taking place in France, Spain etc. and not some back lot in the Hollywood Hills.Frank Langella's performance as Boris Balkan was interesting, he looked nothing like himself. If not for his voice I would have had trouble knowing it was him. I hope that he was heavily padded and made-up as if not then he has aged horribly (sorry Frank).My only warning would be this - if you hate those kind of endings that don't offer any type of conclusion then avoid this film at all costs.

The book is a terrific read that really shouldn't be spoiled by watching the film.That said, the film does seem to try to be a faithful adaptation of the book, and I rented it just to see how Polanski would realize it visually. For the most part, he made sensible decisions about how to streamline the story for the screen.  And having been to Europe, I must say that watching the film really gave me serious flashbacks; the guy certainly knows how to put you in a crowded Paris street, or on a back road in the middle of nowhere in Spain.  ""The girl"" (Polanski's wife!! u b*****d!!) is absolutely perfect for the job, although I do wish more of the conversations between her and Corso (Johnny Depp's character) had been included as they give the premise a bit more substance and were some of the most interesting parts of the story.

The movie entertainingly drops you into a world of antique books and satanism, our hero (Johnny Depp) gets entangled deeper and deeper into what seems like an 'Eyes Wide Shut' lite plot. I can't really tell if Depp is awesome or terrible, he plays the same type of character in every movie, he's watchable, but he comes off as a bit of a lightweight in the acting stakes when you see him in the scenes with Frank Langella, it's almost as if he's trying to hide the fact that he can't act by lighting cigarettes and overdoing the quirks. Langella is convincing as the baddie, even his voice on the phone is menacing. Polanski's wife makes an appearance as 'the girl', she randomly appears at various points to help Johnny, it's pretty obvious who she is meant to be. Polanski keeps the action moving, you don't even notice the long running time, actually, I don't think I've ever seen a bad Polanski movie.

273,NED-10,An ironic black comedy by Roman Polanski.,8,11 March 2000,"The Ninth Gate  ***This film, directed by Roman Polanski, would best be described as an ironic black comedy. . The the comedy is subtle, the sarcasm is also subtle but pervasive. It combines a peculiar world reminiscent of H.P. Lovecraft with a modern world of supernatural conspiracy.  The movie stars Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, an amoral, atheistic rare book dealer who is commissioned by a millionaire to investigate the authenticity of a medieval Satanist's book, ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows"" (written in 1666), by comparing it to the only two other known copies in existence.The movie looks really good, and presents us with interesting and eccentric characters. It takes us into a fascinating world of rare book dealers and collectors, and occultists.  Corso investigates the previous owner of his client's book and the two other owners the book.  Each of these people has their own obsession to the exclusion of virtually all else in their lives, one with his wife, one with his collection of books, and one with the study of the occult. As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Polanski is poking fun at the genre of Satanist movies that was popular in the late 60s and early 70s. He also blanatly mocking the idle and the rich, who dabble in the occult as an 'excuse to satisfy their deviant sexual urges'. Not suprising, as his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered by amateur occultists in the 1960s. Sometimes the 'poking' is anything but subtle, and the audience did pick up on most of the laughs. At first Corso's ""arch"" character has an atheistic approach to the investigation of the book. Several people are fighting for the secret of the books.  Gradually it becomes clear that the book is choosing its own master, and will not be chosen.  Polanski teases us with a conventional ending that we have seen uncountable times in these satanic ritual movies, and then interrupts it in what is the least subtle, but funniest plot twist in the movie.   The ending doesn't have the payoff that we expect. It becomes clear that the book is more about a self-actualizing journey, rather than some occultist secret. It teaches us a lesson, that we don't need to go in search of evil, that it already lies within human nature, and will find us if we choose not to resist it.",The Ninth Gate
274,-88,What was Polanski up to?,3,12 March 2000,"People threw things at the screen at the showing I attended;  I didn't blame them, although I thought it deserved just a little better than that.  The question ""The Ninth Gate"" left me with was:  what was Polanski up to?  He directed this impersonal piece as if he had little interest in it (although he had a producer credit), and it wasn't any fun to watch -- it didn't seem as though he was having a wicked good time.  This film never gets on its feet, and the cast performs dispassionately (although Frank Langella gets a good bit in when he passes his hand through a flame while shouting ""Behold!"").  3/10",The Ninth Gate

Johnny Depp here is our brother in spirit, although (or because??) it seems that he doesn't know much about books. The movie can`t answer the question, why this unable (but likable!) man is one of the best ""book-hunters"". For instance, in the beginning he has to ask the ""Toledo Twins"", if it would have been difficult to fake antiquities like these satanic verses. That's poor... but relieving! After all, it's one of the Polanskis you'll forget soon. He can't handle this x-files-like-mystifying sujet for a long time. The scenes at the castle, on the satanic feast of high-society, are embarrassing and terrible, if you remember the morbid touch of ""Dance of the Vampires"".",The Ninth Gate

To start with, the book called ""Club Dumas"" (Arturo Perez-Reverte) is much more varied in its storyline, since there are many threads and investigations in the story, including the parallel with Alexandre Dumas' ""Three Musqueteers"", the ""Ninth Gate"" and the characters themselves. The movie centres around only one story and I am disappointed in this. Otherwise, the cast is good, Depp excellent, Olin fantastic, and it doesn't look or feel like an Hollywood movie at all, which is its strength. On that note, I'd say, see the movie, and read the book afterwards.",The Ninth Gate

I really enjoyed how the film differentiated between bogus Satanism and what would more likely be the case if Lucifer were to make his presence known. Johnny Depp is brilliantly cast as the shady rare books dealer and Frank Langella gives his best performance as the millionaire Satanist intent on finding the final page of a spell that was reportedly written by The Dark One himself.

Was the plot a wee bit obvious? You bet. Think rubber mallet to the forehead obvious. When Frank Langella (as book publisher/collector Boris Balkan (the Balkans, get it?...Dracula?) punches ""6-6-6"" into his private elevator codepad, you just know that's significant, somehow.

The Ninth Gate, however, is better than Bitter Moon and Death and the Maiden. Polanski has found his wonderful atmosphere (which we fans can notice) again in this dark tale of destiny and fatalism. The important thing is that The Ninth Gate is more than just entertainment. It raises a lot of questions - to which we have to find the answers by ourselves. It has deeper meanings.

Depp did quite a good job, though the rest of the cast were rather lack-lustre (except perhaps Langella, who played his stock ""persona"").

All in all a respectable film, but nothing special.",The Ninth Gate
282,abrooke1,Where was the ending?!,3,31 January 2001,"What the hell was THAT?This could have been a great film. The acting, cinematography, music, and the general look of the film are all above average. There are more than a few interesting scenes, and some interesting effects.What kills this movie are the plot, direction and pacing, in the same way that another one of Depp's films, The Astronaut's Wife, was also ruined. The first hour or so is quite intriguing - we are drawn slowly and mysteriously into a world of ancient books, Satan, strangers and murder, with Europe as a beautiful and exotic backdrop for most of the film.Then something happens - the film just completely runs out of steam. The plot grinds mostly to a halt and the film just drags on and on. It's as though Polanski was writing the script as he shot it. The pacing is completely erratic to say the least. At least 30-45 minutes should have been cut from the film's excessive 2 1/4 hour length.I see many complaints here about the ending, and I agree they are all justified. What is particularly frustrating about it is that for much the film, the scenes are extremely drawn out, but contain no plot. Then, suddenly, near the end, in about the last 30 seconds of the film, we are exposed to about 90% of the plot! There should have been far less of the laborious scenes, with virtually no plot development, and much more of the final developments.(Minor spoilers)And what are we supposed to make of that ending? Does Corso (Depp) become one of Satan's agents? Why? Was he seeking power? And who exactly was the girl?Examples of films with great twist endings include 12 Monkeys, The Sixth Sense, and Angel Heart. This last film, made in 1987 and starring Mickey Rourke, is probably the most appropriate one with which to compare Ninth Gate, because they both deal with Satan and involve a long, drawn out odyssey. But Angel Heart, unlike Ninth Gate, has ending that is not just ""satisfying"" but has an incredible and shocking twist, and makes the entire plot fall into place. Ninth Gate's ending is too short, too quick and feels as though it was slapped on at the last minute, when Polanski finally realized he had better come up with SOME sort of ending.I think a much more satisfying ending would have been that the girl was one of Satan's agents sent by Satan to become pregnant with Corso's child, for the purposes of giving birth to Satan in human form, so he could take over the world. The rituals described in the book would also be necessary for Satan to be born. Corso could have been revealed to have be the ""chosen one"", the one who had been selected by Satan to be the father. The girl would therefore have been using Corso and the others to gather the books together in order to bring about Satan. The final scene would have shown Corso entering the ninth gate out of lust and longing, in order to be with the girl for eternity. When he final understands how he has played a part in bringing about Satan, there could have been on of two final endings: - a look of horror on his face with the realization that he can do nothing, as darkness descends on the world (European ending!) - he is able to somehow kill the girl and the Satan child using hidden instructions in the book (Hollywood ending!)In either case, at least most of the loose ends would have been tied up.If anyone has any other ideas for a better ending, or if you think my ideas stink, I'd love to hear from you! Post them here or email me and we'll compare notes. The bigger the twist, the better!andrew_brooke@i2.com",The Ninth Gate
283,Bloodfordracula,A Great Film - Highly Underrated,10,31 July 2003,The Ninth Gate is a great film and one of Roman Polanski's most underrated films. Twenty years from now people will give this film the respect it deserves and hail it to be the great film that it is. Fist of all The Ninth Gate is not an action film. It's a slow-paced psychological thriller very similar in tone and style to Polanski's earlier films Chinatown and Frantic. Johnny Depp and Frank Langella both give great performances. Darius Khondji's photography is amazing and it has an even more amazing score by Kilar. The majority of the film was shot on location and is like a guided tour through Europe.Ignore the negative reviews and comments from people who've been brainwashed and blinded by the current Hollywood fast-food style of film making with the intention of only appealing to the lowest common denominator. A review doesn't make a good film better or a bad film worse. A superb film. Rating 10 out of 10.,The Ninth Gate
284,faalfi,What a Hell !,5,19 June 2021,"Banal and predictable movie, betraying the novel in many ways. Everybody miscasted. Seigner is a Beauty with just one expression, also while ""flying"". Depp seems to be interested more in his CV (acting with RP) than in the production itself. Langella and Olin look as grotesque caricatures of their characters.

287,Tachikoma-2,Devilishly Clever.,9,25 August 2008,"I have to admit, when I first saw this movie a few years a go I didn't get it. (I'm not sure I still get it.) But I was still captivated by it. The atmosphere and the slow pacing just kept me interested. Cinematography is great and every scene and shot is a joy to look at. The acting is brilliant, Lena Olin especially gives a very good performance. The ominous score and the eerie atmosphere will glue you in.I don't wish to spoil the plot too much, but let's just say that Corso's mission is to authenticate a book that was supposedly written by the Devil himself. This simple mission starts a journey or rather a descent, into a corrupted and bizarre world. Corso himself is not a very noble man either. It's interesting to see just how far he is willing to go, as his journey gets more and more dangerous. His employer promises more money as the journey gets ever more dangerous and bizarre. People are reluctant to help Corso and he has to resort to dubious means to obtain information. Corso is a very intriguing character. Depp plays him well of course and it's quite fascinating to watch Corso's descent. Emmanuelle Seigner is very creepy and sexy. Fine performance from her too.The only negative thing is that dumb ""Shell"" product placement. It really took me out of the movie. Maybe this movie is a bit too clever as well for it's own good. It took me quite a while to understand the ending. Other than that Ninth Gate is a masterpiece.",The Ninth Gate

The characters succeed in getting the viewer involved with the story. You want to go around the next corner, flip the next page and learn more to reveal the mystery side by side with the antagonist.I really enjoyed this movie, and had to re-watch it a couple of times to notice and focus on the small details that are easy to miss, but is in itself still interesting to investigate.I cant really say who would like this movie. Most people that like these kind of movies already seen it or will find it due to curiosity. I know that people looking for a fast pace and a clear ending, or those who looking for a big revelation, wont like this movie. I myself loved it and give it a very high rating.

289,draftyrafters,What A Burn,4,12 March 2000,"There are a lot of reasons why I went to see The Ninth Gate.  Perhaps top on the list is because the director, Roman Polanski, is the man responsible for the highly disturbing, yet artistically sound Rosemary's Baby.  But it's also because of the movie's subject matter, i.e. Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies, Lucifer, and Mr. Boogedymanwhatever you choose to call him. Satan.You can take a look at the past, oh, twenty-five years, and it's amazing how Satan's popularity fluctuates in pop culture.  With movies like Dracula, Rosemary's Baby, Prophecy I & II, and End of Days forming the backdrop of our modern experience, it seems like today's society finds the subject fascinating, if not ""cool.""  Satan movies are all the rage.  So I went to The Ninth Gate to see if the subject matter gets the same distressing treatment found in End of Days-to see if Polanski didn't sacrifice plausibility for pizzazz.He did.The flick follows book dealer/con artist Dean Corso as he attempts to verify the authenticity of a book for book collector/Satan-lover Boris Balkan (who is also filthy rich).  The book is called The Ninth Gate, and it was supposedly written by the devil, who even drew the cute little pictures found in the pages.  The theory is that if you get all the pictures together and speak some rudimentary Latin, the Dark Angel himself will pop up and shoot the breeze with you for a while.  In a twist of what I suppose is irony, the motto of the book found on the title page reads:  ""Thus let the light shine.""  That nutty Satan!  He's all into irony.What is redeeming about this film?  Two things.  The tone, for one, is good. Polanski didn't rush himself, and so he reproduces the same eerily hushed quality found in Rosemary's Baby.  Johnny Depp, playing Corso, delivers a well-measured performance in sync with the movie's atmosphere. Unfortunately the tone of the movie demands substance.  This film has none. It relies so much on the weight of its subject matter that the audience members are left essentially clueless on some basic plot points.A lot of reviewers are going to harp on the ""artistic integrity"" of this film, and to its credit, the cinematography and editing are excellent.  But good timing and restraint are not workable substitutes for a decent story. Depp's character starts the movie with the type of noncommittal attitude necessary for the plot, but by the end, his indifference is reflected by the audience.  Polanski mistook confusion for art.  When there's not a strong story to guide the mood, even the best craftsmanship becomes meandering nonsense (see Eyes Wide Shut).However, even with the mish-mash of supernatural gumbo, even with the unfortunate and undecipherable ending, and even with the cartoonish side characters more fitting for a Sandman comic book, the movie at least doesn' t TOTALLY glorify Satanism.  I'm all for dissing the devil's fan club.  Most worshippers of the devil, it seems to say, are self-indulgent whiners who just need an excuse to hold orgies.  What a burn.But that's one brief, fleeting moment in the film.  It's an instance of inflated self-awareness that loses steam fast.  Polanski gets his jabs in on the devil's followers, but the conclusion of the film makes him seem sympathetic toward the devil himself.  As if his acceptance of Satan wasn't enough to distance the movie from the typical non-evil-promoting viewer, that very acceptance is so clouded in distraction and ""artistic integrity"" that the only thing getting burned when the credits roll is the audience.",The Ninth Gate

291,bloodbathcat,Lamentable,4,4 October 2008,I guess I can start with the only redeeming quality of the movie : Johnny Deep's performance. I'm not a great fan of him but I think that here he gives one of his best effort. Oh but are those efforts wasted ! Emanuelle Seigner is so beautiful it's almost distracting. But I guess distraction is what we are craving for watching this sluggish borefest. Even simple actions scenes are weakly filmed with bad editing and laughable dialogs ( like when Seigner is impressed by Deep smashing of a guy's head : I didn't know you had it in you... ). Polanski co-wrote the script but there's not one ounce of originality in this contrived piece. Some scenes are also inexplicably long like when Deep crash his car in a river and takes forever just to find a gun. And I don't know if Polanski tries to demonstrate something by his overuse of blue screens but it gives the whole movie a tacky feel that doesn't help us enjoy it more. I guess with The Ninth Gate he tried to regain his former glory by delving in the genre that made him famous with his masterpiece Rosemary's Baby ( judging by the camera work it's clear that he attempts to create something powerful and engrossing ) Well he failed and you would do well to avoid it.

I can say the same of director - Roman Polanski. For a start, the plot is just about strong enough for a 30 minute bed-time story, not a 130 min+ Hollywood production. Secondly, is fails to scare, anyone, anywhere nearly enough. Thirdly... oh, no need to go on. Suffice to say that I guess Johnny tried his best but Roman failed to deliver. If you like the idea of watching Johnny smoking his way through a weakly satanic-hinting story that never delivers, then fine - watch it. In fact I always advise everyone to watch every movie because that way you appreciate the better ones more. This movie really helped me appreciate many others.Oh, and if anyone can explain to me how you can pour gasoline over yourself from a 5 gallon container and ignite yourself from flames one meter away without any gasoline reaching the remote flames or even wetting the floor where your standing, please let me know.

However, it's nice to know we are not the ONLY people who couldn't figure out what the ending meant!I also would like input from anyone that is more insightful than I am as to what the scene with Depp and the woman outside the burning building was about, and what the last picture signified and what do they think was going to happen as a result (ie, the ending).

297,bladerunnerdek,Wasted Potential,6,2 January 2001,"With so much danger revolving around this mysterious volume of devilish protocol, it's amazing that Johnny Depp's character makes it past the middle of the film , but then if he didn't , there wouldn't be a film right ? And this , as every single person within a fingertip of him comes to an untimely death . But aside from the gaping plot flaws , this film is still watchable because of Depp . While you find yourself rooting for him , you never quite believe in his ethics , and his real motives are always in doubt . Frank Langella's role is deliciously dark at first but dissolves in a befuddling ending sequence where his great mastery of his faculties inexplicably falls apart . There is so much potential in this film that it's hard not to be disappointed at the finished result , and I believe Polanski has tried here to be too thoughtful and mysterious instead of quickening the storyline and expanding the characters which he could have done. It seems to apply to many movies lately but...........oh what could have been! Mjc",The Ninth Gate
298,terencesherwoodofficial,Good Mystery Movie,7,26 July 2020,"With this film work, Roman Polanski creates an ingenious and unique atmosphere of the mysterious and brutal, occasionally crazy mood. Maybe not a big thriller, but a successful film about pure satanism.
This film definitely shows a Johnny Depp in his prime of his career. Depp manages to initially not feel his character as personable. The more the film runs, the more you learn to like Corso, although in the end you should actually hate him more than at the beginning. Johnny Depp has his own way of acting. Great performance.
You can think of the open end what you want. I liked it. You get hints distributed in the film, which you can interpret for the end.

Again I find myself wondering if they saw the same film I did.This is a good all round supernatural thriller that never goes over the top. Some of the imagery is superb (the chateaux at night surrounded by flaming torches in particular). Frank Langella was magnificent almost resembling Christopher Lee at times. All the cast were excellent (don't mess with Lena Olin) but the jewel in the crown was the score. Forgive my spelling but Wojciech Kilar's music is genius. His 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' was one of the finest soundtracks ever and this came very close.There is always something great about films concerning the devil. They carry an atmosphere that can never be replicated in other genre movies. Rosemary's Baby had it, Angel Heart had it, The Omen had it and I'm glad to say The Ninth Gate has it.Now all we need is a damn good remake of The Devil Rides Out.",The Ninth Gate

This movie is no exception... his portrayal as a book dealer/appraiser (scrupulous, to say the least) was very convincing, maybe cept for the part about the smoking.... I really don't believe that any REAL collector of rare books would let anyone NEAR their most rare books while smoking, dropping ashes on the pages, etc....

Filled with cliches of Europeans and unrealistic scenes (at one point he sits in a cafe for three hours watching as a stalker stares at him from across the street, then leaves and gets caught by him thirty seconds later; in another he sneaks his way into the office of a wealthy Parisian aristocratic bookseller by...waiting until her secretary goes to lunch). Felt like it was going to lead to something interesting but just kind of peters out at the end (although there are a couple concluding plot twists, such as finding out that Depp's characters has...demons of his own? But it's not enough.)(Ultimately felt like a da Vinci Code-like attempt by the director Polanski to say that because the devil is a woman, he himself is not a sexual criminal. I know the movie predates Dan Brown's work; perhaps the modern world is so bereft of moral certainty that its directors can't resist the urge to endlessly regurgitate films with medieval storylines and visuals?)",The Ninth Gate

But the movie is actually quite enjoyable, especially with Depp as a well-known ""book detective"" and Seigner as his mysterious ""guardian angel.""A specific criticism I read was that the movie was too vague, and the ending doesn't really tell you exactly what happened. This is from the same people that worship 2001 A Space Odyssey - there vagueness was ok because it was ""an experience."" It really annoys me when a character on the screen explains something that the audience has already figured out. If you're of the same opinion, then this should not be a concern for you. The movie explains what it wants and leaves the rest as a cool mystery.

I am amazed that this is considered one of Polanski's worst efforts and does not get the recognition it deserves.One of the great things about this film is it changes with every viewing. Every time you watch it, you discover something new, some rare subtlety hidden that proves my case that Polanski is a genius in film making.For example, when Corso is in the lecture room, the very first time we see the Girl, concurrently we have Balkan talking about 'Our perceptions of evil.' Another thing I loved was this film keeps you guessing until the end. There are so many twists and turns, that we because just as intrigued and desperate as Corso to find out the mystery of the Ninth Gate. How many of you were able to guess the ending? I certainly wasn't, but after a second and third viewing you are able to see all the clues Polanski lays out.The casting was brilliant, Johnny Depp did a fantastic job portraying a hero who, to be honest, isn't a very nice guy, but the audience find themselves empathising with him as the film moves on.I advise you to go see this film.

309,dr. gonzo,not a straight-forward supernatural thriller but rather showcases Polanski in a darkly humourous mood as he plays around with the conventions of this genre.,8,10 May 2000,"Critical and commercial reaction to Roman Polanski's films has always been mixed at best. To say that his films are an acquired taste is an understatement. The Ninth Gate is no exception. Despite what the film's trailer would have you believe, Polanski's film is not a straight-forward supernatural thriller but rather showcases the auteur in a darkly humourous mood as he plays around with the conventions of this genre. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is an unscrupulous book dealer whose motivation is purely for financial gain. He swindles a naïve couple from a set of rare and priceless books in an amusing scene that sets up his character beautifully. A very rich book collector (Frank Langella) who owns a copy of The Ninth Gate (a book reputedly co-written by Satan) hires Corso to validate the two other existing copies in the world. It seems like a simple enough task but as Corso soon finds out, someone doesn't want him to complete the job. He crosses paths with an odd assortment of characters, from a mysterious woman (Emmanuelle Seigner) who seems to help him in his quest, to another, more obviously evil, woman (Lena Olin) intent on impeding his progress and quite possibly killing him. While this rather standard, cliché-ridden story coupled with slow, deliberate pacing has turned off many, I felt that there was a method to Polanski's madness. The gradual pacing drew me into this engaging world. Perhaps it was the European setting but the film has an otherworldly atmosphere that I really enjoyed. The attention to detail and Darius Khondji's richly textured cinematography is exquisite and contributes a lot the overall mood of this vivid world. However, The Ninth Gate doesn't just have atmosphere going for it. Johnny Depp adds yet another intriguing character to his roster of unconventional roles. Corso is an unethical cheat who would do anything to make a buck. He really doesn't care about others and yet, despite all of his reprehensible qualities, Depp's natural charisma and charm makes him kind of endearing character that you care more about as he delves deeper into dangerous waters. As for the cliché aspects of the film, I was less concerned at anticipating plot twists and predictable elements in favour of simply enjoying the ride. I get the impression that Polanski was aware of this and decided to have fun with them. Balkan's ""666"" password, Corso's perchance for getting the crap kicked out of him, and the one-armed woman book dealer all contributed to a playful mood that punctuated the film whenever it ran dangerously close to getting pretentious or self-important. The Ninth Gate is a refreshing change from the trend of mundane Hollywood supernatural schlock (i.e. The Bone Collector, Stigmata, End of Days, et al.) that takes itself way too seriously and tries too hard. Unlike those films, The Ninth Gate never falls into that trap. It contains some truly vintage Polanski black humour that, alas, North American audiences don't seem to appreciate. They seem to want meat and potatoes filmmaking, which he has always resisted in favour of subversive thrills and following his own muse come hell or high water.",The Ninth Gate
310,Acetylcholine,A Discreet Movie,7,21 March 2000,"A very vague and secretive film, throwing portentious signs all through its noir mystery formula and developing none of them.

311,TheFilmGuru,"Roman Polanski's ""Book"" of Magical Realism :",8,28 September 2000,"THE NINTH GATE (: ""of the Kingdom of Shadows"") is the famous director's European cinematic adaptation of a wonderful Spanish novel where the Gothic and the Mystery genres are 'interwoven', in a postmodern mode.Arturo Perez-Reverte's EL CLUB DUMAS is definitely NOT to be found in the form of any 'very faithful adaptation' in this French-Spanish co-production, financed by Artisan Films. Polanski's much ""more literal"" interpretation - just as his own decisions led to the prior unsuccessful rendering of another fine & very ""postmodern"" award-winning play, so replete with star-studded cast of Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley, in his previous movie : DEATH AND THE MAIDEN - here fails, likewise, to fully satisfy even his most literal-minded target audience. That is, at least, without the much fuller artist's commentary and critical references to the great book it was based on; which the director wisely saw as being quite necessary to provide in his lengthy ""Special Features"" supplement to the DVD release.What might have saved Polanski's different attempt to conjoin ""the supernatural"" to the ""romanticism"" of ""the detective story,"" and thus to avoid the widely reported audience-disappointing 'abrupt ending' -  that is, of course, without actually remaining more faithful to the postmodernist/post-metaphysical ironies of the novel, which just ""sort of dissolves,"" as he puts it - would surely have been to retain at least one element from those so ""complex and convoluted,"" ""very erudite,"" ""two main plots and many subplots,"" in his own ""kind of a fairy tale for adults."" The element in question being, Perez-Reverte's subtle references to a French medieval novella, THE DEVIL IN LOVE !Given that Roman is presumably ""in love"" with his (the) ""Girl"" (wife, Emmanuelle Seigner), who is, after all, ""the Devil"" of  both film and book (""or at least His messenger""), this editorial / directorial omission proves to be a great disservice to himself, even within the limited and limiting context of his de-postmodernizing of the ironic ambiguity of the fine novel.Critically, perhaps something central to the media-philosophical nature of cinema ?!?   The so-called ""Latin"" genre of ""magical realism"" in Literature might provide texts that are, as Polanski says, ""unadaptable"" to film, up until now !But this single lapse in Polanski's otherwise sharp sense of ""irony"" and his, at least partial, careful attention to about one half of the ""book"" (in his ""movie about a book"") is very unfortunate indeed !-- TheFilmGuru",The Ninth Gate
312,mcdgames,Another Literary Book versus Motion Picture Bout,7,2 August 2006,"First of all I really enjoyed this movie. The first time I saw it I didn't care for it too much; it took a couple more subsequent viewings to actually appreciate what Polanksi was driving. I can't say that I'm a Polanski fan, I think the only other movie I've enjoyed to any degree was ""The Fearless Vampire Hunters"". I am a so-so Johnny Depp fan, even with the PotC movies of late. I have far more respect for Frank Langella.Then, suddenly, this movie appealed. I began to understand the Machiavellian application to it; forget ""Satanism"", Satanism is merely a religion/philosophy which teaches its followers to indulge in their every whim. Overindulge without restraint; this leads to chaos.The Ninth Gate is Satanic only in the way it dares to challenge status quo and the Firmament. Can Man equate with God? It appears that if he contemplates the cryptic but profound lessons of the Nine Gates (in Numerology, 9 is symbolic with God) he may become one with Divinity. The other lesson about touring the Nine Gates? He has to be ruthless and not distracted; therefore you cannot overindulge yourself. Hence, the work is not akin to the doctrines of Satanism.The book, Reverte's ""The Club Dumas"" was literary and enjoyable in parts, but lacked Polanksi's more direct approach. The book merely hinted about Satanism and the equation of Divinity and Man. I felt that Reverte wanted to say something, but like an alchemist looking for the Philosopher's Stone, he had trouble locating the right formula.Polanski redoes the work and makes it more streamlined. The movie is much more frightening in what it supposes than ""The Da Vinci Code""; Nine Gates actually makes Man God.",The Ninth Gate

If you watch this movie carefully and turn your brain cells on, instead of waiting for the movie to chew and digest itself for you, you will understand everything. Who is the girl? You can get a pretty good idea. Why did it not work for Boris Balkan and how did he not feel the fire for the first several moments? Even if it was not explained (and it was) it would be obvious. What happened to Johnny Depp's character in the end? Again as plain as a day. You cannot expect of every Polanski's occult movie to have everything laid out in front of you. Sometimes, the charm of a movie is in its ability to leave something to speculations. This is one of those movies.

There is strong acting by Depp (does he ever have off days?), Frank Langella and was impressed reading about José López Rodero as Pablo Ceniza and Pedro Ceniza, and 1st and 2nd workmen.Not sadistic but love watching how Langella's character dies in the end. He drops from total conviction of his invulnerability to fire to an agonizing, scream-filled death. I'm one of those who expected a ""guest"" appearance by the devil or (at least) a demon. Was also unsure of Emmanuelle Seigner's role as the unnamed girl. What was she at the end, a guardian or sorts for Depp's character or some evil force that was complicit in the various killings?

Get it?Bad jokes aside, there seems to be some very polarized opinions on this movie. On one side are those that love it, claiming it to be a ""masterpiece,"" worthy of intense discussion and intellectual debate. They cite the symbolism inherent in the picture, and draw analogies between different characters and the strata of hell, or Dean Korso's representation of the 7 deadly sins, (greed, envy, lust, sloth, gluttony, pride, wrath) which I'm not so sure about.On the other side are those that hate it, citing it's anticlimactic ending, slow plot, and most of all, the fact that we never get to see a showdown with Satan, (The blonde haired, green eyed, flying demon women may or may not be the Prince of Darkness) & Johnny Depp never really enters the ""Shadow Kingdom"" or hell.Yeah, yeah. I admit I was disappointed too that the movie ended without Johnny Depp's head exploding after receiving too much knowledge from The Nine Gates of the Shadow Kingdom a la Raiders of the Lost Ark, or that he didn't have a change of heart and turn out to be a Hero in a villain's cloak, send Satan back to the fiery gates of hell, and live happily ever after with green eyes (the storybook/Hollywood convention of love-will-conquer-the-darkness.) He simply walks up to the 17th century castle, just as the sun is setting over the parapets, bringing to life the final engraving of the book, end scene, the movie is done.In the words of Roger Ebert, what??But, I suppose what the film is really about, (I have to search for some redeeming quality to the movie, I just have to) is human nature. (Artsy, right?) What this film is saying by this very ANTICLIMACTIC ending is that man's search for the truth is so fundamental and powerful, that it overrides our pursuit of pleasure and fear of death. This is Korso's journey, and this is what unlocks ""the ninth gate.""If you don't believe me, think about how disappointed you were by never actually witnessing the unlocking of the ninth gate on film.

It has solid atmosphere, interesting characters, and an intriguing plot.  The first hour keeps you very interested, than it slows down for an hour before the fascinating ending scenes.  Though most critics disapproved of the final shot where the screen fades to white, I found it a great way to end the film.  We didn't have to see exactly where Johnny Depp's Character was going to and we didn't have to find out the truth behind the mysterious lady.

In particular, ""The Trouble With Harry.""  There is plenty of morbid fascination in the Hitchcock tradition.  The score sometimes contradicts the expected mood for a given scene.  Like in a Hitchcock film, this reminds you of your own morbid fascination, your ability to be entertained by death and peril.Depp is perfect.  He plays a supremely confident intellectual, or intellectual wannabe.  He is either a fraud or a genius in his line of work: finding, authenticating and collecting rare books.  The character is akin to Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) in ""Chinatown"" in its consistent portrayal of a questionable character who stumbles through the plot for perhaps the wrong reasons.

Depp plays a rare book dealer that is sent on a mission by a rich Satanic book finatic and on his trip to Europe to find the devils work he ends up working right along side the devil and doesn't even notice. Depps acting was a plus but for everyone else they put on a fair showing. This seemed to be a low budget film with small or no name actors and actresses to play key rolls in the film. The plot was fairly elementary for someone of Polanski's stature. Seemed to me the idea probably came from a pre-wicken, highschool kid. It really didn't give me the feeling that this movie could almost be believable and just wasn't worth the time to watch it. If the movie itself isn't a let down then the ending will be.

I won't give away anything in regards to plot/spoilers but I will say that the beautiful woodcuts in the film bear more attention than the camera gives them. For me The Ninth Gate is Polanski's love letter to the occult, far superior than his other films that dip a toe in those waters and are somehow held in much higher regard. Depp is so superb throughout I could almost forgive him for that Jack Sparrow nonsense (how many though, really?). The supporting cast are all on the money & the score by Wojciech Kilar (Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Pianist) is one to seek out in isolation.

324,bobbymeizer,Probably not for fans of the book,8,20 May 2009,"If you are a big fan of ""El Club Dumas"", the novel on which this film is somewhat based, you will probably be very disappointed by it. In the book, there are two simultaneous plots going on, one dealing with the Nine Gates book and Boris Balkan's desire to obtain what one might call a ""working"" copy, and the other dealing with an autograph chapter apparently from the lost manuscript of Alexander Dumas' ""The Three Musketeers"". The protagonist of the book spends much of his time trying to figure out how the two plots are intertwined and, in fact, thinks he has it figured out at various times, but in the end we discover that the plots were indeed separate and unrelated all along. Though this is an ingenious and potentially powerful literary device, for me at least, it didn't work very well and left me quite disappointed with the ending (which is unusual for a Perez Reverte novel, the others that I've read had very strong endings, though this one is still worth the time as his writing is always gripping and thought-provoking). Polanski made the decision when he made this movie to eliminate the Dumas plot line and make the story entirely about the Nine Gates book. That involved considerable rewriting and changes of events and characters. So someone who is expecting a faithful rendition of the novel will be quite annoyed. However, I think Polanski made the right choice because the ending of the film is far stronger and more satisfying than the book. The only thing he could have done better would have been to make a film of Perez Reverte's ""The Nautical Chart"" or ""The Flanders Panel"" instead!",The Ninth Gate

Instead, all we get is a rather interesting buildup of Johnny Depp trying to figure out which copy of a book is real, figuring out the roles of the various sinister players, and being rescued by a mysterious woman. Unfortunately, once he figures out the mystery, nothing happens. I am not exaggerating here. I do not mean to say, ""not much happens."" I mean, NOTHING happens.

If he was able to check if it is genuine or not with only photocopy, why does he carry the original copy with him in thr midst of whole danger. If you consumed all the valuable production and you have nothing else worth watching, it could be watched or in the case of, you randomly downloaded this movie onto your device, when you are offline.

Roman Polanski is a master storyteller, and in this wonderful film he takes us on a beautifully crafted journey through passion, obsession, the occult, the paranormal, and on into that ultimate end to which we all succumb... or do we? What if there was a way to cheat it? What if an ancient book about the Devil had the power to...
From the monogrammed slippers in the opening suicide scene, via the mysterious 'girl', to the serpent tattoo on Lianna's thigh, the framed photograph on the wall next to Balkan as he tells Corso of his 'hobby', the same image on the postcard, the number Balkan presses in the lift to get to his personal floor, the number he keys into the door lock to his occult book collection... everything is important, everything is planned, everything is part of the great 'whole' that finally shows its face in the final moments of the film.I believe there will come a time when people will rate this film among the very best of its genre. It has to be (along with the wonderful 'Ed Wood') Depp's best film. And Arturo Perez-Reverte's 'El Club Dumas' is improved upon and moulded into fabulous cinema.

The worst thing is that it comes so close!  I would go so far as to say I liked it right to the scene where Balkan immolates himself.  All of a sudden, Frank Langella forgets how to act!  After a brief looksee through the internet I did not see anybody mention how Corso just happens to witness or be a part of a scene in the movie that depicts every one of the engravings.  The ending was the thing that really did this movie in for me.  1) Why does Corso need the darn piece of paper if he made the scene that was portrayed in the engraving?  Why is the representation more important than the reality?  2)Why did the spanish brothers take the page out of the book?  If they were goody goodies they could have destroyed it.  3) Why don't we see any kind of triumph on the part of Corso?  It was all so anticlimactic to me.  Not to say that the movie was all bad.  Depp IS a damn fine actor.  The flick was suspenseful. I thought that the cinematography was fantastic.  The special effects were annoyingly bad though.

The book also claim to have a sort of black magic and has the powers to bring the prince of darkness to earth.Despite appearances, the movie isn't so much about the devil but more about the rarity and mystic of the book.

This would be a mild case when I see that Roman Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"" gets an average vote of 6.6 from over 25,000 reviews. Granted, that is closer to a 7 than a 6, but COME ON. Are you kidding?! This is when garbage like ""Batman Begins"", ""The Departed"", and ""The Matrix 2"" all rank in the top 250 in all of the movie reviews on here. There really is a definite lack of genuine movie appreciation when a gem of a film like this only warrants a 6.6. Well, the only thing I can do is rate it a 10 and say a few words. The cinematography is mesmerizing, the acting is more than good, and the plot? A story about the power of obsession over a book that reportedly can conjure up Satan is more than enough to hook me!

337,bob-lambert,"Requires concentration and some thinking, but well worth it...",10,5 June 2012,"Let's start by addressing the negative reviews of this film. It is clear that many of the reviewers were expecting a five minute prologue to introduce some simplistic characters, followed by 90 minutes with a host of winged, clawed, fire-breathing demons, with lots of slashing and blood, ending with a huge climactic conclusion with ten minutes of implausible fighting, and they were disappointed. What they weren't expecting was to have to concentrate, to follow and understand the plot, to work out the clues, and to ..... think for themselves a bit and use their imaginations while enjoying the journey!So, if you only like films where you don't have to think, and where the bad guys all have European accents and obvious world domination motives, and where every small detail of the plot is laid out for you verbally and in simple sentences by the characters, and there's lots of blood / gore / explosions, then don't watch this - just head straight for re- runs of Die Hard (which, for clarity, I also like, but in a completely different way from this film).If, on the other hand, you enjoy clever films with an interesting story, where the plot develops and twists and turns gently to keep you on your toes, and where you are never quite sure who are the good guys and the bad guys, or where all of the protagonists are decidedly ambiguous, then this is for you.The scenery and cinematography are perfect and absorbing, the dialogue is credible and realistic. The acting is generally excellent, with only a couple of small parts of scenes where the performances are a bit flat. The ending isn't simply tacked on (as others have said), but is a sensible and interesting conclusion to a compelling story, tying together the rest of the plot in a way that makes logical sense of all of the twists and turns and clues. I don't want to say more and spoil the ending, but I will say that it isn't a huge, ten minute, edge of your seat epic struggle. It is an appropriate, relatively low-key finish, where you are left to imagine the obvious details, but that in no way detracts from the ending - it simply relies on you being vaguely intelligent, and doesn't insult that intelligence by spoon-feeding you.I have a couple of minor gripes with this film. I can't believe that a rare book dealer would smoke and drink while examining the books (he actually smokes and drinks OVER the books), or would treat them with such lack of care (wrapping his copy in a cloth instead of packing it more robustly, leaving it in all sorts of strange places, allowing someone the opportunity to switch the book, forcing the pages flat so as to break the spine, etc.). I also struggle to believe that he didn't make better notes when comparing the books (I don't want to say any more.....!). A Rolls Royce wouldn't stop just because it was being driven through a ford in a river - it might stall, but it's a 2.3 ton car so its momentum would keep it rolling. The matte work and effects on the castle looks a little crude, even for 1999. However, none of this detracts from an excellent and very enjoyable film.",The Ninth Gate
338,kmoss55,Evil through books,8,16 August 2002,"I think the film contains good suspense and tension overall. Yet I could not help but noticing similarities with the movie The Name of the Rose, with Sean Connery (1986). 666666 ""Minor spoilers ahead"" 666666 Incidently both of them are more or less detective stories with a focus on a book connected with evil and danger. They also share a plot in which the characters who develop a close interest in the book die one after another. Besides, the two movies contain numerous references to black magic, supernatural and mystery (secret places, sudden fires, burning books...).Considering the quality of the plot, the directing and acting in The Name of the Rose or other thrillers (Hitchcock, Clouzot), I realise that although enjoyable the Ninth Gate has flaws, like a lack of attention to details and too much vagueness. However,it avoids becoming corny by leaving some freedom to the imagination (like at the end, by not showing you-know-who).",The Ninth Gate

Yes, he isn't the devil in the movie, he will be after he cross the nineth gate. As in the starting credits who watch the movie cross the gates until the light of the final one. When the guy who hired Corso made the ritual he clearly didn't expect to meet the devil but 2 b him, he thought the fire won't hurt him. Of course Polansky is working from a Christian background, but the devil in Quran can b any Jenn or man, who also can be good if they choose. I also don't understand the Christian sensibility that make Corsos action of killing the black man in self defense as evil, if he didn't finish him, he may come after them and kill them. Nor do I understand his attempt to save the widows life as good, but the girl preventing him from doing so as evil that confirms she's the devil, after all the widow was the one who gave the black guard the order 2 kill them.

I thought this was pretty clever of Polanski because it might not occur to the audience unless they were paying close attention.Just because a film doesn't spell out all the details for you doesn't make it bad.

351,mjbridges82,Not for the uninitiated.,6,27 April 2005,"The last two entries on my notepad after watching The Ninth Gate (1999) were ""What?"" and ""WHAT?"" It seemed I'd either somehow overlooked some intrinsically vital plot element, or the conclusion actually was that vague and unresolved. On further rumination, I've decided I didn't miss anything of importance; I was just looking in the wrong places.The Ninth Gate was Roman Polanski's first film since 1994's Death and the Maiden and as such was keenly anticipated. The fact that the promotional material, and Polanski himself, were intimating some kind of Rosemary's Baby (1968) / Chinatown (1974) blend, two of his most celebrated films, only added to the expectations. Far from the Hollywood starred (Johnny Depp), Hollywood horror thriller that many were expecting, despite Polanski's fugitive status from the US, The Ninth Gate more closely resembles a cross between Le Locataire (The Tenant,1976) and Frantic (1988), two of the directors far less appreciated films. The dispossessed, unresolved, hotels and taxis, wild goose chasery of Frantic and the deadly dark humour of Le Locataire make this film a difficult one for the uninitiated or poorly advised.The source material is a thread pared from Arturo Pérez-Reverte's multifaceted novel El Club Dumas, adapted by previous Polanski collaborator John Brownjohn. Mercenary, whiskey quaffing, chimney smoking antique book dealer Corso (Depp) is enlisted by wealthy Satan aficionado Balkan (Frank Langella) to compare one of his rare satanic volumes with the only other two known copies, ostensibly to confirm or disprove it's authenticity. This leads him across Europe and the paths of a cast of pleasingly eccentric bibliophiles, Satanists and, well, whatever it is that the insipid Emmanuelle Seigner (Mrs Polanski) is supposed to be 'acting' as. The puzzle solving inclined will find an ever accumulating in volume, though not necessarily in significance, number of hints, symbols, allegories and clues to chew on. The less intellectually energetic are best served sitting back and enjoying Depp's effortlessly cool and deeply knowing performance. In fact, the key to enjoying The Ninth Gate is not taking it seriously, not trying to piece together the clues, and just observing Polanski's craft. His only goal here is enjoyable escapism.In a film where three books collaboratively penned by the devil are the centre of attention, there is no sense of fear, no atmosphere of dread, no cloven hooves. We know from films like the darkly disturbing Repulsion (1965), and the urban alienation allegory Rosemary's Baby, that Polanski is more than capable of making his audience squirm in terror, and Chinatown shows he can hold together an elaborate mystery. The Ninth Gate seems more concerned with tipping it's hat to noir thrillers of past eras, and indeed Polanski's own films, to particularly care what the audience is feeling. Those who don't mind the journey being more important than the destination, fans of Depp, and Polanski aficionados, will find a couple of hours of entertainment here. Those hoping to scared or compelled will find themselves confounded.",The Ninth Gate

The story line itself is what is captivating, and it is a terrific vehicle for Depp. Flaws surface with Depp's character, though, because at times he seems completely callous and uncaring about both his clients, his contacts, and even the supernatural nature of his mission, and at other times, he seems keenly interested, right up to the ending that offers no reason why he ends up where he does, other than perhaps to solve the puzzle once and for all.Emmanuelle Seigner's role as ""The Girl"" seems to change directions and it is never explained, even out of hand, what motivates her actions. Is she angel or demon? Are we to ask if there is a difference? The pacing of the film is slow at times -- unnecessarily so -- but it seems to pick up just as it begins to drag.

The plot, preposterous as it seems, does fascinate the viewer, as long as one ignores the illogical sequence of events. The movie opens with a book collector hanging himself in his library, and then introduces Depp as an amoral book appraiser and ""detective."" After swindling an incapacitated collector, Depp is summoned by an enigmatic and powerful collector. Depp's task is to authenticate a rare and sinister demonic text. The chase is then on! Depp's sometimes partner is ritualistically murdered for a mysterious purpose, and Depp then heads to Europe. On the way, Depp bumps into a passionate, dark haired woman; an other wordly attractive blonde; a host of other strange book collecting characters. At this point it becomes difficult to discuss the movie in familiar terms of storyline and climax, and one has to start deconstructing sub-text and symbolism. In other words, this movie fails to deliver as a movie, and has to resort to literary tricks and intellectual subterfuge. Slowly, the viewer comes to the horrifying realization that this movie has functioned mainly as a vehicle for Depp and provides further proof of Polanski's cinematic irrelevance.

The direction and camera angles were excellent.  Johnny Depp does a great job as the rare book expert.  Now for the flaws:  This film was PAINFULLY long.  I am glad that it wasn't geared for instant gratification, however, many of the scenes took so long to develop that I was glad when the end of the movie was coming. I kept telling myself, when I make it to the end I will be rewarded.  NOT!!! There was a questionable sex scene and then the credits start rolling up the screen.  You're sitting in your seat going ""Hey wait, not yet! I waited two and a half freaking hours for something to happen!""  It never does.  There are times when a film will end and leave you guessing.  That's fine. There are two problems with that here.  One is that the movie does not drop enough substance in your lap for you to conclude ""Okay this happened and then I think this happened here and so on"" and then feel satisfied with the result. I could have stayed home and surmised what happened in the movie from what I saw the trailer, and even THAT would have been more satisfying than the ending.  Bringing me to point two which is this empty feeling of non-fulfilment is even more acute when you wait two and a half hours for a nothing-but-whatever-you-fill-in ending.The film has a very interesting story, and the directing and acting are so good as to make it a passable work even with the non-ending. If there is a major clue I missed in the film, to be fair, please send it to me. Judging from the other reviews, I didn't miss anything -- it just wasn't there. This could have been great, but was fair. 6/10",The Ninth Gate

Or allow them to be so crassly flipped through. Or have their seams mashed. Or set their spill-prone beverages precariously close to them. Or have the pages touched by hands not wearing gloves so they don't leave acidic oils on the pages.

360,M Brucia,Poor and cliched,3,28 November 2000,"The comments here seem to come from two camps, one of which supports Polanski and the other of which uses movies like the Matrix as a barometer of quality.  The truth is, this movie is poor, not because a lack of action scenes or explosions, but because it has nothing new to offer.  Action movies are entertaining in their own right, as intellectual and explorative movies are in theirs.  However, this movie manages to avoid both.  The initial concept of a book authenticator being protagonist was promising, but what follows is the staid ""Assemble the pieces of the puzzle that allow one to summon Satan"" formula.  There is nothing to engage either the mind or the adrenaline glands in this movie.  The ""floating"" effect of the nameless female character destroys any possibility of reading the story as being one of true supernatural elements versus collective delusion.  Instead we are left with the most cookie cutter version of the Summoning genre, devoid of both visceral and intellectual value.  If Polanski's name were not on this film, it would be universally panned, and it is only his presence that makes it viable for pseudo-intellectuals to willingly embrace.",The Ninth Gate

You are engaged from the outset as a participant in the adventure.  Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, and Emmanuelle Seigner successfully portray flawed characters who communicate better with the audience than they do with each other. The cinematography is restrained and effective and adds to the mystery rather than detracting from it. The story raises many questions which remain with the viewer long after the film is over.  The satisfaction is long-lasting.  I will see this movie again, as there are many implications I am sure that I missed the first time.",The Ninth Gate

And who is better at unfolding a story before your eyes than Roman Polanski?From the very first scene, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I found the whole experience hypnotic and unmissable. While I can understand other users comments about a vague ending and meandering plot, I believe every detail you need is there in the film, but you have to watch closely to reap every reward. Fortunately, the whole thing is so compelling, I had no trouble watching closely!Depp is fantastic, playing a shady, understated character with considerable skill. Similarly, Langella brings a brooding sinister air to the proceedings, even when his character is only heard over the phone! Seigner is great as the mysterious companion (I have my own theories about her true identity, but I'll leave that to the individual!), and Olin takes an excellent supporting role too. Can't fault the cast at all, even the incidental characters add colour and life to the whole thing.If you enjoyed the creepy air in The Sixth Sense, like watching a story unfold gradually, but with pace and skill (kind of like The Usual Suspects), and like to actually engage your brain while taking in a movie, then see this immediately. I honestly believe the only moviegoers that would complain about this superior supernatural thriller would be the Nightmare on Elm Street/Friday the 13th generation. This is a beautiful film with a heart and soul, and the power to draw you in absolutely.Watch it in a quiet room, nicely darkened, and instead of dismissing the ending, think about it for a while - you won't regret it!",The Ninth Gate
363,teegz,So Close...,6,10 January 2001,"The Ninth Gate has been dubbed a thriller, but thankfully the film for the most part does not revert to cliches associated with the genre. Far from a horror movie or thriller, The Ninth Gate is a mystery and an adventure, with the feel of a dark Indiana Jones picture, without the one-liners. Director Roman Polanski comes close to making a great movie, but three quarters of the way into the film The Ninth Gate loses itself, and the audience.Adapted from the novel The Club Dumas by Arturo Pérez-Reverte, The Ninth Gate revolves around Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a rare book finder who sells his discoveries to the highest bidder. He is contacted by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a wealthy publisher with his own rare book collection, all relating to the Devil. His most precious is titled The Nine Gates, one of only three copies in existence. A legend states the book was co-authored by Satan, and that the nine etchings contained within can conjure up the man himself. Balkan wants Corso to compare his book to the other two copies for authenticity, and to bring the real book back by any means necessary. `Any means necessary sounds illegal', Corso replies wryly. A large cheque quickly convinces him, and Corso heads to Europe. Soon things begin to go awry and death follows Corso wherever he goes, as well as a mysterious woman (Emmanuelle Seigner) who acts as a guardian. Faces of people in the etchings begin to look remarkably like people Corso meets in Europe, adding to the eeriness. (minor spoiler) Upon comparing Balkan's book with the others he notices the etchings are slightly different, and that some are signed LCF (Lucifer). A race for the Devil's etchings ensues, and the power they contain, with Corso in the middle.What is most intriguing about the movie are the books it focuses on. The audience is brought into the world of bibliophiles, collectors of rare books, and soon their passion becomes our own. Scenes of books being removed from shelves, carefully opened, and delicately looked through evoke feelings of mystery and discovery not easily forgotten. Memories of going into attics, tingling with excitement at the hope of some discovery are what The Ninth Gate brings back.The cinematography in the Ninth Gate is amazing, courtesy Darius Khondji. Close-ups of Corso's fingers running across 400 year old pages lets the audience feel them as well. The movie was filmed on location in Spain, France, and Portugal, and scenes at twilight amid castles and the countryside are breathtaking. Even the colors of the film are noticeable; dark, rich shades are prominent and it seems everything is dimmed without being gloomy. Rounding out the look and feel of the picture is Wojciech Kilar's perfectly matched music, setting the mood without being overly menacing.The acting in The Ninth Gate, and the casting, is top notch. Depp really fits the role of Corso, if not from just a physical standpoint. With his librarian glasses, dark clothes, and mustache with goatee, Corso looks both educated and mysterious. As for his acting, Depp begins with a stock character; Corso is a mercenary without conscience and lives for profit no matter who is in his way. Thankfully, throughout the movie Depp adds enough wrinkles to the character to keep the audience confused as to Corso's true intentions. Corso's alcohol intake increases with every scene, and he unravels, forming an obsession surrounding the book rivaling Balkan's. Frank Langella is simply perfect as Balkan. He takes on a character that could easily be done in an over the top fashion, but he remains reserved, creating a complex and frightening character.The pace of the film is a treat, but with a running time of over two hours the Ninth Gate loses its power towards the end. The search for the truth about the book is given time to develop instead of being forced upon the audience, but this doesn't justify the length of the movie. Adding to the problem are the unnecessary twists in the last 30 minutes of the picture. Just when a resolution seems near, a new fold appears, and Corso must follow along. The plot twists simply appear, without letting the audience take part in their development. Finally, when making a film with an epic storyline such as raising the Devil, the director has to decide how far to take the story. The Ninth Gate is foremost about the search, and Polanski leaves the rest to the imagination. This is probably for the best, but the viewer still leaves the theatre feeling a little cheated by the ending.Under any other director but Polanski, The Ninth Gate could have degenerated into standard thriller/horror fare. Instead we are presented with a movie focused on mystery instead of fright. Polanski though can't seem to pull the film together, and near the end the tingly feeling of wonder in the back of the viewer's neck disappears.",The Ninth Gate
364,Keith I Price,Polanski? Depp? What were they thinking? simply boring and wierd!,3,12 May 2001,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, it looked exciting.  Maybe liike, Indiana Jones only in the form of a thriller.  Well, Thrilling it was not. Depp spends the first two thirds of the film reading books and so if you have managed to stay awake for the remaining third then you see all kinds of satanic ritualistic trash.  I wasn't scared, I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't interested and I couldn't believe I'd spent £3.50 hiring this!  Some films are for the cinema, some films are for video and some films are for TV... this sadly is for the dustbin!  Polanski although competent in his direction, has made a bad movie and Depp has chosen yet another film which wastes his talents. Disapointing.",The Ninth Gate
365,CinemaNaut,Uninspired Hollywood B-thriller,4,17 December 2007,"Looks promosing with it's occult theme and the names of Polanski and Depp on the cover. But it doesn't live up to the expectations. I'd say this is a low point in both their careers. Both the acting and directing is very stale and uninspired, the characters are totally one dimensional and unoriginal. The dense atmosphere you'd want from a mystery movie like this is completely lacking, instead everything feels rather light hearted and weird. The overall execution is just lame. For instance - take a look at one of the fight scenes and try not to laugh...It's not really that horrible, it's quite watchable, but compared to what you'd expect it's very tired and mediocre.",The Ninth Gate
366,The CyberHippie,The Ninth Hour,2,18 July 2019,"I thought this movie would never end. I watched this movie a long time ago but must have blocked it out and after having watched it again recently I can understand why. Johnny Depp didn't look the part, in fact he looked like a middle aged College freshman, and his acting throughout the movie was lackluster. Much of the plot was predictable, most of plot scenarios seemed very contrived, and the movie was incredibly repetitive. I somehow managed to stay awake to the end and yes, I got it, but after nearly 2 and a half hours of watching Johnny drink, smoke, drive, and get clobbered over the head over and over, I just didn't care. This movie was a stupidly long cigarette ad.
The basic premise of this movie had such potential, but that potential was never reached. Emmanuelle Seigner and Frank Langella played their roles well, but it was not nearly enough to save this turkey. Roman Polanski has made some stellar movies, but this by no means can be considered one of them. I would recommend this movie as a good non-addictive sedative for those with insomnia, but that's it. I gave this movie 2 out of 10 because I docked extra point for missed potential.",The Ninth Gate
367,boccaccio6,origins,6,5 March 2010,"When films come out of novels always the same debate arises: which is better, is it faithful, why the changes and so on. Let's take for example Hillcoat's adaptation of The Road; rarely seen a more humble and plain translation from the word to the image. In The Ninth Gate something very different happened. At one end we have Arturo Perez Reverte's novel The Club Dumas, a nice well built story with thrill, adventure, kind of romance, strong hints to supernatural, blood, twists, nothing missing for a good screenplay and a box office hit. On the opposite end Polanski adaptation, where everybody and everything is twisted, painted with the most evil (thus confused)colors. Surely happy are the satanists with their unending arguments about who is what, how Hell is furnished and the color of Satan's tie. If you mess with the Devil you get a mess, and there may be a touch of art in it. The reason of the twisting may be found in the terrible past of Polanski, the war, the murder of his wife. So, i guess, having read that robust and effective novel the director went on a trip of his own into the darkest unknown.",The Ninth Gate
368,dprb23,very artistic...,8,25 December 2002,"IMDB total rating of 6.4 Why?There are movies that are entertaining and there are some that are artistic. If you can combine the two, you have a legendary movie. The Ninth Gate was more artistic than entertaining and that's probably why it has a low rating. Unfortunately, I believe a 7.8 is more appropriate.I believe that most viewers were looking for a simple investigative thriller and did not comprehend the view of the director. One of the greatest directors, Roman Polanski, creates movies that are full of art that real movie buffs can appreciate. He is not going to present you with a predictable Morgan Freeman thriller. I admit that the story wasn't that extraordinary: but you have to look beyond it and put yourself in the director's shoes.The movie is rather clever. You have the three characters, not including the frenchman, who are obsessed with the devil and have studied many ancient books related to him. There are three very valuable books in the world that may be the strongest link to reaching him. Corso, who cares very little about the situation, makes a journey to find the link for Balkan simply because he is getting well paid. Balkan, the baroness, and Liana devote their lives to finding the devil but they fail. Corso doesn't. Why? Because the link to the devil lies in the journey. The girl is the devil and she gives him an invitation rather than the other three because of the journey he made. Cool idea.Also, you have to respect Johnny Depp's performance. He is so incredibly talented and he never lets us down. He chooses incredibly challenging roles and plays them to near perfection every time.

Something drew me in..and I am glad it did!Maybe someone else already came to this conclusion, but here is mine:In the beginning of the movie there was a lecture about witches, among other things. I think thus was the explanation of the rest of the movie. ""We"" always learned that the devil was evil..and we always assumed he is male.I think the devil was never evil in person. It was just the opposite of God. And if God is good..the Devil must be evil.In my mind both can not exist without the other..Yin/yang. There can not be good without evil..and vice-versa. But most importent: there is something good in evil and something evil in goodSo...the devil is not evil him/her self. Never was, never will be.Like I said; the lecture on witches and then te professor said that witches had a pact with the devil..mainly because they did not believe in the regions at the time. They were strong, intelligent medicine women. But that was dangerous for the church: if you got sick; God's punishment, if you got better; God forgeve you..great way to keep the people believing! Result: all the witches were killed..sometimes only proving they were wrongfully acused by dying..In this movie Polanski took all of this and ran with it. The devil (the girl) (and maybe she is God as well) shows something that is not pure evil or good..a woman..who is straight tot the point, fair..sometimes gorgeous, sometimes a bit scary..pretty much who I would have thought the devil and God should be like..Resume: the devil is not only evil like God is not only good....and both could just as well be a woman..and maybe even be the same entity..",The Ninth Gate
372,maggot_brain,Interesting premise breaks apart,5,24 November 2011,"The Ninth Gate starts promisingly - an immoral, unscrupulous book dealer is tasked with uncovering the secrets behind a middle-age occult novel which was purportedly written in conjunction with Lucifer himself.Roman Polanski is excellent at portraying cities - from the skyscrapers of New York through to its dinghy rare book stores and rain-flecked streets. Likewise, Paris and surrounding Europe gets fine treatment as with his previous flicks. Most of the acting jobs here are done well, especially Johnny Depp who portrays the nonchalant, cynical protagonist with measured calculation (""All I care about is my percentage...""). The first half of the film unfolds slowly and methodically, with a subtle sense of dread underlying proceedings.It's a shame, then, that the movie takes its atmosphere and characterisation and squanders it in its final third. We are treated to over-the-top occult psychobabble, some silly fight scenes, and somewhat cheap special effects. Some reviewers championing this film have complained that people may not 'get' the film. I think most do understand its underlying concept and twist, and are complaining (validly, in my view) that it's carried off in such a haphazard, glaring and abrupt way that it ruins the atmosphere which Polanski spent the first hour of the film building up.If you want a good psychological, occult-themed thriller with twice the atmosphere, better performances, and a ending that's half as half-baked (went there), check out Angel Heart instead.",The Ninth Gate

The Ninth Gate isn't horror so much as it is humor.  Beautifully filmed, the movie takes you right into Europe, but the cinematography and sets are about the only things taken seriously in this film. Satanic camp, if such a thing exists, is probably the category I would put it in.  The Ninth Gate is a long movie - almost three hours - and there are no crashing, banging, booming special effects, but if you don't mind that, you will have a great time.

It is too long, redundant in plot, visually uninteresting, and annoying in its factual inaccuracies.Now I don't want to seem picky, but if a story's protagonist is a bibliophile and the premise is his search for certain illustrated recondite texts, then perhaps it would be a good idea to do one's research on the topics, but this is not the case with ""The Ninth Gate.""  First, the book-illustrations are referred to repeatedly as ""engravings"" (which involves cutting into a metal plate, usually zinc), although a rudimentary knowledge of printmaking-technique shows them to be woodcuts (cutting into a wood block).  But then again, engravings/woodcuts, they're all the same, right?  Second, Polanski dates these ""engravings"" to the 17th-century, although an equally rudimentary knowledge of the history of style in printmaking shows them to belong to the late 15th-century, specifically in the manner of the German master Albrecht Duerer.  But then again, what's a couple of hundred years here or there?  And third, in an early scene (when Depp's character examines a small private collection of rare books up for sale), he refers to (or tries to refer to) a landmark in the history of early illustrated texts, Franceso Colonna's ""Hypnertomachia Poliphilo"" (Venice, 1499).  Sorry, that's ""Poliphili,"" which means ""of Poliphilo,"" Colonna's hero.  Depp's line renders the title nonsensical.Well, okay, perhaps I really am being picky here, but it seems to me that such seemingly minor errors of fact reveal something about ""The Ninth Gate"" generally:  it's just slapped together.

Johnny Depp (whom I have always rated very highly) puts in a great performance as the chain-smoking, money-driven book dealer who becomes more and more embroiled in the mystery of the book he is paid to authenticate.
Polanski has directed and produced this film masterfully. The locations are rich and well displayed, although I think sometimes computer-enhanced. The camera work is great, the story is great, and there's even a completely gratuitous sex scene to mull over. And, on another note, I thought the title sequence was excellent, and the music absolutely topped the icing with a little cherry.The only complaint I can have about this film has been made before by other people, and I will make it again - the ending is a bit rushed, and doesn't really do the rest of the film justice. I won't spoil it here, but just make sure you judge the film as a whole, and not on a slightly flimsy ending.But overall a great piece of film, both intriguing and intelligent.

A film that tries to be smart, but can't seem to be intense and interesting enough to please you. Still, it has certain interesting concepts and it is not so bad, but it is also not good.
The initial idea of the film is exciting, a Book Dealer has to put together 3 books that were probably written with the help of the devil to reveal the secret that holds immense power, being able to face a cult of devil worshipers; Looks Good!But it's bad! The main character has no history, no charisma and no development (Depp's performance does not save), Emmanuelle Seigner's character is absurd and you cannot understand her motivations. When people die in this movie, it doesn't matter, because whoever is watching has nothing to connect with them. The film comes down to seeing Johnny Depp walking and making a confused face while reading some book.The good part of this movie? it's a beautiful film visually, it has a soundtrack OK, the scenes at the end of the film are cool and fun, the scenes with Boris Balkan are the best, he is the most interesting character in the film, with a sure performance by Frank Langella. Although I don't think the director wanted him to play it that way, it was probably for him to be scary, but it ends with him being Based and funny for not giving a damn about it.People here trying to convince that this film is underestimated, trying to put together theories about what the film means, since Polanski wisely left a lot of symbolism in the film to try to explain its absurdities, this is good, honestly, it is better than the film itself.(if you cut scenes where Johnny Depp is walking or reading, it would save an hour of film)The music at the end of the film ""Vocalise"" by Wojciech Kilar is really beautiful and is the best thing about this film.",The Ninth Gate

Everybody is perfectly cast (I can admit though, as many have stated before me, that ""The Girl"" could have been played by someone else). Polanski's style is very comfortable to watch. Kilar's Soundtrack is mesmerizing, soothing and gives that mystical feel that few movies have. Repetitive, yes -- But beautiful never the less.Depp as the antihero Corso is unforgettable. He's no saint, but we feel for him and understand his choices. Langella portrays Balkan perfectly, and gives the movie the edge it needs. And let's not forget Olin, who makes a solid role as Mrs Telfer.I have watched this movie once a year for the last three years, and at each viewing, raised my rating for it by one point. Starting at 7/10, I now believe that it at least deserves 9/10. This movie really takes its time with each plot point, which is rare these days.

Two out of three isn't enough.Combine that with sub-standard (and oddly placed) special effects shots (I've seen better in Japanese monster movies), cheesy character hooks (Balkan's code is 666 -- please!), and a bad script (why did Corso take a personal interest in the books?), and you're left wondering where your eight bucks went and pining over the near three hours of your life that you'll never get back.The score sounds like my four year old niece pounding randomly on the piano keys.  On top of that, the music clearly telescopes with it's 'danger music', neatly removing any tension that might have once existed.The direction feels like a first year film student trying to make an 'art' film.  The resulting product firmly places Roman Polanski in the crowded niche of under-talented, self-important directors who appeal to crowds who believe, 'if it doesn't make sense, it's art.'Unfortunately, the otherwise talented cast is dragged down by the incompetent direction.Flush eight bucks down the toilet.

396,JJJJf,WARNING,1,26 March 2000,"CONTAINS SPOILERSSo my parents and I went out to see a movie last night.  I was not in the mood to see something deep and tear-jerking on my first day of Spring Break, so we decided we would see the Ninth Gate, figuring that my dad would like stuff that got blown up, and my mom and I could sit there and drool over Johnny Depp.The first major hint of the evening was that these people were cutting in front of us in line.  My dad made sort of a deal about it, and the people were surly and not very forgiving.  It wasn't until after the movie that we realized these people were trying to tell us something, like guardian angels or whatnot.So the movie starts out, and yummy there's Johnny Depp, and he's looking for some books about Satan.  And then he looks for the books some more.  And then some people die because supposedly someone else wants these books.  As the audience and I sat there for what seemed like at least one full term of pregnancy, only more painful, the movie started revealing that someone had dropped something on the script and that all the major plot points had been destroyed.So finally, we find out there's something to do with the pictures in this book, and if somebody puts all the pictures together and says some Satanic incantation, then he or she gets invincibility or some such nonsense.  So this guy steals all the pictures, and Johnny Depp finds him in a castle saying the incantation, and then the guy sets himself on fire, and he dies. Um, okay.  After that, Depp steals all the pictures, then goes outside while the castle is on fire, and has sex with this demon/angel girl on the lawn. (This girl pops in and out of the movie, but nothing ever explains why.)Here's the kicker, and I have no qualms about telling you the ending because none of you will ever see this movie if you value your sanity, your health, or your $9.50.  The people writing the script got to a challenging point, that point being that there was absolutely nowhere left to go since all the main characters except Depp and this girl had been killed off.  Someone obviously said, ""How are we going to end this movie?""  And someone else said, ""Let's just end it.""  Thus, Depp is riding along in the car with this chick, and he says, ""Why did the guy not become invincible?""  And the girl says, ""Because one of his pictures is a forgery.""  And he says, ""Where's the other one?""  The girl says, ""At this place in Spain.""  Depp says, ""Okay,"" and goes there.Depp is in this place in Spain.  He doesn't look for the picture, because it falls of a bookshelf at his feet.  He picks it up.  Then goes back to the castle.  The castle has a lot of light inside.  He goes inside the castle.END OF MOVIE, CREDITS START ROLLING""NO!"" screamed the audience.  ""NO!  YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  WE SAT THROUGH THIS ENTIRE MOVIE, HALF OF THE AUDIENCE NOW HAS BEARDS, AND THAT'S THE END? NOOOOOO!!!!""I seriously want to hurt someone.  Maybe Roman Polanski who directed it. Who thought this movie was a good idea?  My favorite part, I must say, is that this angel/demon girl has no explanation for being in the movie. Somebody said, ""Hey, dude!  Let's have this chick, and she's sort of an angel or something, and she can be pretty, and like, dude, at the end!  She can have sex with Johnny Depp while this castle is on fire!  Heh, heh! Fire!  Fire!  Sex!  Destruction!  Heh, heh!""This movie gets 7 out of 10 Picnics at Hanging Rock.  The movie was fine up until it just ended out of nowhere, only because I was expecting some big finish.  Also, yummmm, Johnny Depp.",The Ninth Gate
397,FrankTG,A great Thriller,9,30 April 2000,"I love Polanski movies, and this one didn't disappoint me. Albeit a bit over-long, I really was mesmerized by Johnny Depp's convincing portrayal of a sleazy book dealer who is hired by an eccentric occult book collector to find two copies of a same book, supposedly written by a devil worshiper (what else?).The most fascinating about this movie is the camera work and the dialog. The story telling is really well done, one simply is grabbed by the intrigue in which Depp is immersed while searching for the books, and the riddle they seem to form.I give this movie four-and a-half stars, out of five, for the fine performances, the story and the fine direction.",The Ninth Gate
398,liverboyjoe179,Interesting and boring at the same time,2,1 April 2000,"I went to see The Ninth Gate about a week ago, thinking it would be something like Tecmo's Deception where some guy is trying to revive Satan and ends up killing people in the process.  The previews and commercials made this movie look so much more exciting than it truly was.  I sat there in the theater, waiting for something ""exciting"" to happen.  Nothing happened.  Oh wait, there was a whole lot of talking and traveling, if you consider that something.  However, the movie had some intriguing points. But, it was not enough to hold my interest.  This is the only movie I've seen in theaters that made me say ""Thank God"" when it was over.  Not even Primary Colors or Deep Impact or even Godzilla for that matter have ever made me say that.  My opinion, just get the novel, it's probably way better.",The Ninth Gate
399,jayjia,Too Deep??,5,3 April 2000,"Some people have commented that The Ninth Gate had a deeper message than just in the movie it's self, that the ending is not ambiguous but really meaningful. I guess I'm a little skeptical because that was the same gig that the marketing department of American Beauty uses. ""look deeper"" and ""If you don't get it, you will"". The idea that there is so much depth in both of the movies is like selling the emperors new clothes. We, the emperor is too self concious to admit that we don't see anything deeper so sometimes we just praise movies that tell us there is something deeper, even if we don't know what.I liked the ninth gate. The idea is intriguing, although I would have liked to learn more about the making of the book, which simply fascinated me. it's not action nor a thriller, I was not surprised by anything. The girl left a lot to be desired. Why did she keep leaving, could she not have stayed? Why does she wear different color socks, why can't she just dress like everyone else?? I understand she looks a lot like the girl in the missing picture, but why?  She was the biggest disappointment in a movie that could have survived better without her.I see it as a passage to capture Johnny's soul. He does not worship the devil as the others in the movie, but it's through the process he goes through to get what he's paid to do that he is admitted through the ninth gate. His soul corrupt through out this movie.Mr. Polanski, if you can hear this, you could have made a much better movie without putting your wife in it.  It would have made it shorter (since it was rather slow at time when she was around and she didn't talk since she really isn't essential) and you could have developed Johnnys character since it's his descent into hell that we are interested in. Please think with your head and not with other parts of the body when directing your next movie.",The Ninth Gate
400,TheKurgan65,132 minutes and 50 seconds of greatness,6,14 June 2005,"I'd have given this film an 8.5 out of 10 for the first 132 minutes and 50 seconds of its 133 minutes. Langella is creepily brilliant as Balkan, the macabre demon wannabe who doesn't get it. Depp is equally adept at being the greedy ass sonufabitch who really wants to be the devil. Depp going from French guy to high society lady to Balkan searching for the copies of the book to decode the secret for becoming Faust is an inspired touch. The movie's look is great, too. All grays and browns. It almost looks like the interior of a coffee house trying to be chic.Even when the succubus comes to Depp's aid, you can admire Polanski's vision and style. Even when Langella is standing there asking Depp if he can feel it (shortly before his unfortunate and messy demise), you can marvel at the character interplay.However, all of this was thrown away by the worst imaginable copout ending. Having teased us with creepiness all throughout (and with plenty of violence, both hinted at and shown), Polanski cops out with a ""you figure it out"" ending. I HATE ""you figure it out"" endings. They bring no closure, offer no denouement to the story, and ultimately, leave you with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see a special effects phantasmagoria with Depp's head splitting open and horns sprouting and all of that crap. Instead of walking into that stupid light ""shades of Poltergeist and ""DON'T GO TOWARD THE LIGHT!,"""" Depp should do something subtle, such as walk forward with the camera on his face (instead of over his left shoulder), and have the light from a flicker of flame caress his face. That would be subtle, but leave the viewer with a sense of finality.The only way the present ending makes sense is if Polanski were going to do a sequel where Depp comes back from the depths of hell and wreaks havoc on the world as a sort of Librarian Screwtape. So far, after six years, there is no sequel.So, in all, Ninth Gate was a very good movie made merely average by Polanski's fear of completing the transformation of his hero into Faust.",The Ninth Gate

This movie was one of the best building movies I have seen in a long time, it moved very slowly in an effort to prepare you for the ending. Unfortunatly the impression I recived was that there was not enough time to continue building to an excellent ending so the speed up the last 10 mins. of the film and cut the final scene which explained everything.My suggestion ""Don't bother seeing this movie.

Johnny Depp satisfactorily acted his part in this movie, and the movie demonstrates an intelligent portrayal of rare books collectors.  Thats all the good points I can possible come up with this flick.The plot unsuccessfully used platonic devices to reveal the archaic implications of the ninth gate.

404,samnitebc,Not as bad as I thought but still needs work,7,2 June 2013,"Not the worst offering by Polanksi, but there are unanswered questions that I'll attempt to answer in this review. Please understand mine is but one of many interpretations on ""The Ninth Gate"".So, let's get the first mystery out of the way: Why did Andrew Telfer hang himself? Polanski doesn't feel the need to reveal the ""why"" behind Telfer's suicide. However, he does provide a not-so-obvious clue by using the character of Baroness Kessler to state, ""If he (Telfer) ever finds out what his wife gets up to in these gatherings, he'll probably kill himself."" This quote needs an explanation to make more sense: Andrew Telfer's wife, Liana Telfer, is the leader of a secret witches' coven known as ""The Order of the Silver Serpent"". This coven was formed back in the 1600s and its purpose was to read from the book and worship the Prince of Darkness. But in the present, ""they've degenerated into a social club for bored millionaires and celebrities who use its meetings as an excuse to indulge their jaded sexual appetites."" On top of that, there's also the ""possibility"" Andrew Telfer found out that his wife only married him for his money, so she could buy a copy of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"" and have her family's château restored for Satanic meetings. In the end, I feel the truth was too much for Andrew to deal with.Corso visits an antiquarian bookshop owned by the Ceniza Brothers. The Ceniza's are two old guys who happen to be twins. Just as a side note, in mythologies from various cultures twins are seen as a sign that something bad is going to happen in the future. Anyway, the twins tell Corso that only six of the nine engravings were signed by Torchia, the other three by Lucifer. They then go on to interpret an engraving for Corso. This engraving clearly shows one of the twins as an angelic archer holding a bow and arrow ready to shoot. One of the twins explains its meaning and says, ""Venture too far and danger will descend on you from above."" Notice how the twins live up to their myth by indirectly warning Corso of the dangers that lie ahead if he continues on his journey.In my opinion, Polanski is using the twins as cherubs who've been sent by God as messengers to warn Corso that he's reached a fork in the road, so to speak. He can go left and choose the path of Satan or go right and stay on the path of the righteous. By the way, in the Western occult tradition, the left-hand path is the path followed by Satanists and those who believe in Black magic. Obviously, Corso didn't get the message, which reminds me of Milton's ""Paradise Lost"" where Satan says, ""Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven"".The biggest mystery of all is, who is that blond woman? As far as I can tell and based on what I've seen and what I read in the screenplay, she's the Devil. Yes, that woman is Satan himself. And what's up with all the flying and martial arts, you might ask? Well, I think Polanksi needed a way to make Lucifer's presence on Earth not so obvious to Corso. Let's face it, having the blond woman wave her hand to kill a person would reveal too much. So, making her a into a decent martial artist allowed Polanski to get around this problem. What about the flying scenes? Polanski stated in an interview that he wanted the Corso character to question his sanity. Did he see the blond fly down from the ledge or did he imagine it? This is where Polanski tries to be clever by using these cheap tricks. I guess you will have to decide.Another clue to the identity of the blond woman is found in the screenplay. Corso bumps into the blond at the hotel lounge. This is their conversation:""THE GIRL: Are you on a business trip? (indicates his shoulder bag) Is that why you always carry that thing around?CORSO doesn't answer, adjusts his glasses. inquiringly at her book.THE GIRL hands it to him. We see the title: 'The Devil in Love' by Jacques Cazotte.CORSO: Been traveling long?THE GIRL: Ages.""Here we have the clue of the title of the book which identifies the blond and her amorous intentions for Corso. Also, the fact that she's been traveling for ""Ages"" pretty much leaves you with one conclusion. If that's not enough, here's another quote by The Girl, ""I'm a bit of a devil myself..."" I rest my case.As I mentioned above, the Devil has the hots for Corso so we know why she's helping him and leading him down that wicked road to sin. Before I continue, Angels like Satan are pure spirit with no gender and usually take on the form of a human male when visiting Earth. But in this instance, Satan took on the form of a human female. So, for those who think this is some kind of ""homosexuality"" by proxy, you're wrong.To continue, there's more to their relationship when you think about it from a scriptural point of view. Satan had a chance to destroy Job, God's servant, but he failed miserably in the end. Perhaps Corso is his second chance to get back at God. To laugh in his face once again.What about the scene where the blonde marks Corso's forehead and nose with her own blood? I think that's her way of literally ""marking"" her man. As if she's saying, ""You belong to me and no other woman."" If you notice the marking, it looks very similar to a trident, or in this case, the Devil's Pitchfork.",The Ninth Gate
405,bluebrace,Terrible just terrible..,1,13 September 2006,"What a terrible film, please do not watch this with any expectation of being remotely entertained. It's slow from start to finish with wooden acting and old plot ideas, no direct or depth of story or character. The basic plot idea of the film was good and could have been a excellent film but perhaps the transition to the screen simply didn't work. The Ending - If you can call it that was hugely disappointing but still not surprising as it merely continued on the tone which the rest of the film had set. Perhaps it was badly edited to keep it from hitting the 3hr mark I don't know.

The acting was average to bad, especially bad Emmanuelle Seigner who couldn't act her way out of a four door box.  The plot sounded promising, but never really developed into anything.  Johnny Depp's character, a book dealer, spends the movie looking for some books and comparing them to each other.  There's a couple of rather bland action scenes and a tiny bit of completely gratuitous sex, but none of these scenes are worth watching.The storyline, the types of characters, the subject matter all seemed like movie cliches.  Even the soundtrack seemed to be lifted from Ghostbusters.The ultimate purpose of the books Depp is looking for and the reason for the existence of most of the characters is never actually explained.

Johnny Depp (who I normally like) doesn't have much to do except smoke incessantly and seem massively detached. His love scenes are totally devoid of passion and any involvement. Frank Langella I hope (like other members of the cast) is embarrassed by the silly role he was asked to portray. He is a fine actor who has done some great work, such as ""Frost/Nixon"".

Not challenging at all for the viewer, not in the slightest bit creepy and maybe it is Polanski's style but it looks amateurish. Maybe it is in the field of the Italian Giallo style and I am doing it a dis-service but it really was Hammer meets Tin Tin and then add on another half an hour just to try and make it epic but it then just becomes bloated and boring after at least giving you some laughs early on, the scene when Liana Telfer visits and seduces then attacks Jonny Depp is pure comedy, the Girl was identified as the devil when she appears on the other side of the library shelves to Depp in another cheesy scene and those two Spanish book dealers, are they twins and in fact the same actor ? was straight out of Tin Tin. Really, if you want to see how these kind of films can be done just go to the Hammer series of films especially the ones based on Dennis Wheatley films. It is also sloppy as it is never too clear what the Ninth Gate is for, is it to bring out the divil or for someone to enter and the characters and acting (other than Depp) are 2 dimensional and you have no empathy for them.

I appreciate all the users' comments that attempted to explain this movie to me, but in the end I have to agree with the protests of those who found fault with the ending (or really, the lack thereof), thin plot, tediously slow story development, and some pretty glaring gaps in the logic. Some strange and esoteric movies have captivated me in the past, but this one either went over my head or died crossing the street.

That's all well and good, and in fact there are some decent visuals. But there's much more that was very poorly conceived and executed.First, the visuals, since that seems to be the most important thing in movies now.  There are some nice sets and scenery in Ninth Gate.  The castle at the end was quite a nice set, for instance.  That's not enough, however. The special effects are atrocious all the way through, from the poorly rendered, choppy CGI opening credits, to the obvious computer trickery for the ""twin"" booksellers, to the horrible, horrible job with the duchess' hand, culminating in some pretty lame fire they CGI'd so they wouldn't have to burn their pretty castle.  Really, if you can't do your special effects better than this, then do without!It's getting hard to believe anyone in Hollywood cares anymore, but the story is rifled with holes and flaws as well.  Maybe if enough VIEWERS cared, Hollywood would start caring again as well!  I know, I'm too optimistic.Anyway, if you know nothing about solving puzzles, this movie won't help you learn.  You may in fact find the premise somewhat interesting, though hard to follow.  On the other hand, if you DO know a bit about puzzles, you'll be yawning your way through most of this film, as the stars slowly, slowly, sloooowly piece together the rather simple challenge.  In fact, when they give the first clue (the first comparison of the engravings), I thought to myself ""this might get interesting!""  An hour and a half later, as the movie was drawing to a close, and they put together the same facts that any puzzle solver saw much earlier, I realized that that was the extent of the puzzle, and all my patience had been for nothing.  Then, just to be ornery, they cheat near the end and make sure there was no way to solve the puzzle unless the powers-that-be decided you should have the answer, at which point they just come out and tell you.  This isn't a spoiler; if you know anything about puzzles, you'll agree easily with the above, otherwise you probably tuned out on this paragraph, and more power to you.And no, there's no deep meaning in that ending.  Yes, there is a meaning, and I found it quite clear, thank you, just not deep.  Sorry.

414,jake-81,Wonderful contemporary thriller...,9,12 March 2000,"As with many of Polanski's films, ""The Ninth Gate"" includes beautiful settings, great orchestration, and intriguing characters. He was able to put together a talented cast, including several from the largely untapped European community. These include Jose Lopez Rodero, giving a short but humorous and witty performance, and the striking Emmanuelle Seigner, who plays her part with the perfect subtlety (no doubt due in part to Polanski's influence). Johnny Depp (playing the bibliophile anti-hero) gives another adept performance and the musical score is expertly composed. The only negatives I noticed were that the movie was at times too slow paced and that the ending left something to the imagination.

Doesn't anyone like symbolism, subtlety, and smart dialogue anymore?  If you think the plot was boring, then the meaning of the film went over your head.  It may not be the best film on the subject of Hell, evil, and Satan, but The Ninth Gate was much better than most have given it credit for.",The Ninth Gate
416,LarryB-5,A tragically under-appreciated work of art,10,22 March 2000,"CONTAINS SPOILERSAt first, I thought it would be best not to say too much about this movie. It is so good that I didn't want to give any of it away. However, now that I've read the overwhelmingly negative reviews, I'd like to say a few things in the movie's defense.The Ninth Gate is not a horror movie, not a thriller, not a campy comedy, not a drama. If you force the movie in any of these categories and judge it by the category's standards, the movie will be doomed to fail. What is the Ninth Gate, then? I'd say it's a character-based exploration of good and evil that also entertains us by poking fun at the representation of good and evil in popular culture. At the same time that the film plays with and laughs at cinematic conventions related to Satanism, heros, and villains, it offers us a very serious view of the nature of evil in contemporary life. This view crystallises at the very end of the film, when the ninth gate explodes with light. Insane psychopaths who spend all their time and money trying to wake the devil are not what the devil wants, this film tells us. The devil wants those millions of lukewarm types--people who are centered around their own survival and comfort, without strong feelings of morality, love, or hatred. To win these people over to the side of hell by offering them knowledge, power, and pleasure would be to win a great battle against God.The charge that the movie is ambiguous is preposterous. Some say that the unnamed girl could be an angel, a demon, or a good but flawed person. Which should we choose? Well, anyone who watches the movie closely and sees how she reacts to various murders should have no trouble choosing. Others say that the ending is either heavenly or hellish and that it's impossible to say which. Again, anyone who pays attention and notices that the castle is the ninth gate, that there is a shadowy figure standing in the window when it fills with light, and that Depp is the very man depicted in the book that he reads should easily realise that the ending is utterly hellish. The film does leave open the question of whether hell is actually a reprehensible place, I think, but this is not ambiguity; this is a disturbingly open question that the film raises with intellectual mastery. Evil does have its attractions; that's why it's so prevalent throughout the world.There is so much more to say about this movie, so many little details that deserve praise. Take Depp's ride in a truck filled with sheep--this is the birth of an antichrist. This time the devil wins with his/her temptations. Take the resemblance of the figures in the film to the figures in the books--clear but not at first obvious. There's so much here, so much. This is an exceptional film.",The Ninth Gate
417,AlfaOmega,Horror or Jokes ?,2,7 January 2000,"The last movie of Roman Polanski ( Nine Gate ) is bad movie.I save Depp, Seigner for performance, but Polanski disappoint, for various reasons. Many are the errors of screenplay,one for all : ""The police where is?""The story  starts well, but after some minutes we imagine all that will happen. The final is very ridiculous, about me could finish 10 min before have would better. The scene with Depp & Seigner in the car seems that be make by a beginner,( the super car seems a slow car) and on the combat scene ( that near the bridge) I prefer put a pitying voile ( seem that Polanski want copy Matrix scenes with terrible results). The horror scenes make a great laugh. The sexy final scene  want remember us that the Seigner is always a beautiful girl. But a thought jump in my mind; we are speaking about Polanski, author of great movies, therefore I have a doubtful :  ""If Roman Polanski has wanted make a Jokes to all ? "".",The Ninth Gate
418,blacksheza,Monochromatic and perfectly Polanski.,9,11 March 2000,"Having no suspense, action, or surprises, this perfectly Polanski mystery is filmed in dark tones and complex sets.  The expert development of Johnny Depp's character is as monochromatic as the film itself, with intense interest provided by his ""girl"" helper actress Emmanuelle Seigner.  The part of Balkan (Frank Langella) seemed miscast.  Still a must, but subject matter plods no new ground.",The Ninth Gate
419,Laura Organa Solo,Another Great for Johnny Depp and Roman Polanski,10,27 May 2000,"I saw this film shortly after I had seen Roman Polanski's biography and not long before I became enamored with Johnny Depp as a person and his tremendous ability to really make a movie real.I, too, am surprised the critics didn't complain about this movie. It seems like it would be another one that people would avoid because the critics didn't like, and yet I never heard anything very negative about it. Perhaps the loose ending might bother some people but I think it lets the view draw their own conclusion as to just what Dean Corso does in the end.Lena Olin's character and the ""young black man with platinum blond hair"" really kept me guessing. Was she an angel? An agent of good? What is the deal with this guy that keeps following Corso? it makes for an excellent mystery.Last, but not least, were some of those one-liner bits of humor. It gave some comic relief to this otherwise ominous movie. Johnny Depp wearing his glasses even though they barely stay on his face after they're broken, the baroness's secretary, the sheep in ""voolve's clothing"" bit, the TV dinner, and my favorite reply of ""I thought I just did."" If you've seen the movie, you'll know which part I'm talking about. ;o)All in all, I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy a good thriller or horror or mystery movie or especially if you enjoy Johnny Depp. He really gives slimy, greedy Dean Corso life and he does it with his usual style and sensuality.",The Ninth Gate
420,Pavliko,Messing around with books.,5,20 June 2000,"It's a pity really, you leave the cinema feeling it could have been so much more.  Johnny Depp is in his moody persona, Frank Langella is domineering, Lena Olin is sizzling and Emmanuelle Seigner is mysterious but all are seriously underused.  The movie has a kind of Hammer Horror tinge to it but you feel Polanski could do infinitely better.  Is the movie meant to be fast paced or slow?  Are the actors really used or just presented in some scenes for effect?  The ""angel"" bit in the Paris fight scene is hilarious.",The Ninth Gate
421,ccmerlot,That lovely smooth face of Depp's remains expressionless...,5,6 December 2002,"As much as i like to look at Johnny Depp, i have to say that what is wrong with this movie is, sadly, his performance. Wooden and stilted delivery and bad make-up (grey hair surrounds an otherwise very youthful face) conspire with lack of depth to make the ending the perplexing anti-climax commented on by others above. Depp really doesn't show the viewer any change in the character's motive, and he just looks comically silly near the end, stuck in the floor boards like that!",The Ninth Gate
422,Mr. Hand-6,View it with the right expectations,7,29 December 2000,"I viewed it with wrong expectations. I expected a horror movie. Also didn't pay much attention. So I joyfully waited for Gothic atmosphere and cool monsters. When it had ended, something like ""Well, I think I didn't understand this."" drifted slowly through my mind. Only one or to days later it dawned on me that I had expected the wrong thing. This is not a horror movie but a movie that tries to make you think. It is about a riddle and it is a riddle itself, full of clues and meanings. Viewed this way, it makes a lot of sense. I found myself thinking about it again and again.To me the main question while I watched was: Who is the girl?SPOILER WARNING *** SPOILERS IN NEXT PARAGRAPHLike it is written in some of the other comments (without spoiler warning though), I think that the girl who appears again and again but refuses to tell her name is Lucifer. With that idea everything seems to fall into place. I don't know much about these things but a quick lock into my etymological dictionary told me that Lucifer means light bringer and is also a name for the planet Venus and that Lucifer is said to be a fallen angel. It is very clear that the girl must be some kind of angel, at least the hero's guardian angel. The only supernatural things which are shown in the film (and with fine, quiet understatement) are done by her and also she seems to be the only one who knows what it is all about. But this is not simply the answer to the riddle but leads to other interesting questions, the most important being: Is Lucifer in truth a good person? Not the devil, the source of all evil, but perhaps only said to be by the church because he has turned his back to god? The girl does never do anything bad in the story and the picture of somebody walking into light is often used for entering into heaven. Or is it all deception to seduce the hero to evil? But then why doesn't the devil reward the bad guy who is willing to worship him? During the hero's final fight with the bad guy the wooden floor breaks under him. He clings helplessly to the rim of the hole, afraid to fall through, and you automatically expect some ghastly pit or a long drop to be underneath. His enemy exults. Then more wood breaks and he falls through but discovers that there is neat and save ground close beneath. There are even stairs and he can easily walk out again from under the wooden ceiling, find his lost gun and overcome his enemy. This is a fine metaphor for what happens to the hero in the whole story. I don't think I'm wrong, it fits to well.END OF SPOILERSWhen I saw The Ninth Gate I thought the story was containing pretty much chliché and implausible elements. But now I think that more of it has a meaning than I first thought. In other comments it is said that the careless handling of the precious books books throughout the movie is some kind of joke. That is probably true. It is so obvious, it must be intentional. I could say much more but I won't because this comment has already gotten pretty long.If you like to watch a movie that gives you something to think about and perhaps discuss it with some friends afterwards, this is a good choice. My rating is 8.",The Ninth Gate

This film was OK. it wasn't anything spectacular and the story is hardly implied. The ending was a bit unusual, the score for the film was completely terrible and did not match the scenes the scores where composed for. Dialog is vague at times and the acting was a bit mediocre.

They should have just had us wishing "" Leave the book and run"" Most of all how many times have we seen a villain with visions of gradure get foiled in the end because of a snafu in his master plan for world domination. And I think that the girl was all too mysterious. She never once answered any questions or shed ed any in-site in what she knew about anything. Yes I think she might have been the devil.

People were telling me that it was bad, but I was like, ""How could it be bad if Johnny Depp is in it?"" OK...now I know what they were talking about.

428,blitzkrieg1701,A movie about books that's only good on paper,1,18 February 2004,"The Ninth Gate ought to be a good movie. It boasts a famed director, some very accomplished actors, truly elegant locations, and a story overflowing with possibilities. Yet, for some reason, the film simply refuses to take these ingredients and make something interesting out of them. Quite frankly, this film is DULL. Not in a `there-not-enough-fighting-and-guts' way, but a `why-am-I-supposed-to-even-remotely-care-about-these-people?' way. For one the cast's performances are uniformly dull. In fact, whether they are supposed to be excited, angry, frightened, or dieing, everyone seems downright BORED. Things aren't helped much by the clichéd, unnatural dialogue either. Truly artless direction, surprisingly enough, is the final nail in the coffin. Somehow, poor Mr. Polanski has found a way to suck what little energy might have been generated out of the film through a plain, painfully unimaginative, job that occasionally borders on amateur (the Peter Pan-like wire work during the  obviously over-rehearsed `fight' scene is especially embarrassing). Ultimately, The Ninth Gate recalls the campy B-movie relics of the fifties (the ones we keep around to make fun of, not the ones that actually stand the test of time) in a very bad way. There are simply too many obvious and inexcusable flaws to take it as anything other than an example of how even promising ingredients can fail to survive the trip from the page to the screen.",The Ninth Gate

Supernatural themes are always the scariest to me, and to be honest, I'm just too old to lose sleep over a scary movie. Well, I decided to suck it up and be a big girl. After all, it was one of the few Johnny Depp movies that I had not seen- I was on a quest to see them all! I was pleasantly surprised to find that despite the advertising, Ninth Gate was not terrifying in the least, but rather psychological and somewhat smart. Intriguing story, not the greatest, but unlike anything I had ever seen before. All in all I could have enjoyed this movie (aside from the fact that it came to an abrupt halt...as if they ran out of money or film)had it not been for the horrible soundtrack. It was completely distracting, and did not fit the mood of the scenes it should have been enhancing. One suspenseful scene was backed by what sounded like a sit-com track. If you decide to watch this one, either turn down the sound when no one is speaking, or turn it up to discover how a soundtrack does affect the whole experience.",The Ninth Gate

The action of the movie is poor to say the least and character development is non existent apart from johnny depp. The long length might have provided twists, but there are none, i worked out the ending after the first 15mins. And to mention that the ending is the worst of any movie i have ever seen. Its almost as if its been building up to nothing and he reached god or something, when in reality its been all about the devil.

For a horror/thriller, it was pseudo intellectual, and eminently watchable, without being drowned in special affects (except for the weirdness that was the female companion floating around). The style was reminiscent of Denis Wheatley fiction at his perverse best.But the downside is that the movie was hollow, and disappointing. The signs were all broadcast so obviously, the ending was uncharacteristically thoughtless and sudden.Overall? I have watched it a few times, marveling in the almost brilliance of it all.

In fact, the problem is that the ending is so understated and anti-climatic after a long slog through a slow moving and ultimately fairly pointless tale.  I adore horror (of the classic variety) and Polanski but this film really does miss some final revelation to make it more than just good.  The ends are not wrapped up, the ending does not call for imagination, there is less here than meets the eye.  A film that seems to be full of meaningless portentious detail and imagery, in fact isn't.  It plays like a studious RACE WITH THE DEVIL without the ending.  The most shocking thing about the film is you come away thinking how dull it all was and what a waste it was.  For Polanski, that is an astounding reaction to one of his films and you get the feeling the makers and studios knew this before it came out.  Thinking about it, my goodness, it's like a modern version of Hammer's generally woeful and similarly anticlimatic TO THE DEVIL A DAUGHTER.

Depp's acting is good, I'm afraid some of the other actors in the movie do not reach the same high level.Visually the film is very beautiful, wonderful colors and landscapes and a sexy Lena Olin (but hey, that's easy).Not a bad one to see on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but do not expect fast paced action and spooky effects.

447,bobc-14,not favorable,2,19 August 2000,"What a stinker!  An unintelligent script with one guessable cliché after another. In Polanski's commentary on the DVD he mentions a foot stool that the camera focuses on in the opening scene.   He says this is to get the viewer wondering.  Well, you see a distraught elderly gentleman in his well appointed library, sitting at his desk writing a note.  Gee, I wonder what the note could be and what will he do next?  If you can't guess that one, maybe you should see this film.The best part of this film for me was what appears to be an homage (though Polanski makes no mention of it in his commentary) to Pixar's Geri's Game, the great award winning short subject of an old man playing chess with himself.  In the Ninth Gate, the Depp character visits two old twins (actually one actor with special effects) who have a rare book store in Spain.  They're made up to look like ""Geri"" and do a credible imitation, down to the cackling laugh.If you like Lena Olin, she looks great for 44, even for 34.  You get a brief look at her bare breasts in a laughable pointless sex scene towards the end of the film  (if you can stay with it that long).I watched part of the DVD commentary by Polanski, hoping for some insight.

448,Roger-141,"Some people don't know what ""thriller"" means...",7,12 October 2000,"I was quite taken aback by some of the highly negative comments about this excellent supernatural thriller. After a bit of reflection, I noticed they seemed to fall into two groups:1. People who thought that a ""thriller"" is a similar genre to an ""action movie"". This movie contains no explosions, only three on-screen deaths, and only one high speed chase which lasts all of about 10 seconds because the chasee gets away. It does have sex, mystery in a very Sam Spade-esque sense, unusual camera techniques to heighten tension, plausible levels of violence, and a very spooky supernatural element. That last deserves some amplification too: with modern CGI, you might be expecting some breathtaking ""apparition"" effects. And you'd probably be thinking, ""Nice CGI, but it's really kind of cheesy"". Not in this movie; the supernatural element is so subtle it nearly makes your skin crawl. In fact at quite a few points you nearly start thinking they're all just crackpots and nothing is really happening, but then Seigner's ""thing"" happens again and makes it clear that All Is Not Well.2. Some people were annoyed by the lack of an explanatory ending. I admit I am not sure what happened, but I've a couple of theories and enjoyed discussing them with others after the movie. What's wrong with that, for heaven's sake? It's a bit of a sad indictment that people feel cheated if they don't get everything spelled out for them. For those who want my theory, MILD SPOILER ALERTIt's not shown because it's irrelevant. The film is about Corso's journey of discovery and seduction; he is transformed from faithless and selfish to openly embracing evil. Does he gain what he seeks? The question is unimportant, what mattered was his decision, for one way or another he is now surely lost.END OF SPOILERMy only gripe: I was actually kind of interested in the puzzle, but they never showed it clearly enough or long enough to get to grips with it.

A cast of excellent actors, Depp, Langella and Olin to name just three, certainly not a mainstream film that was going to break any box office records but a good psychologically addictive film exploring the occult. If history, books and the darker side of human nature interest you then you will find this film fascinating. Depp plays the part of a very focused, self serving and amoral loner hired by the owner of a book said to be co written by the Devil himself.

This is one of the movies that honestly makes me wonder why Depp has been degraded to a drunken pirate, while he could've become the new Anthony Hopkins or Sean Connery of his generation.The movie itself was conflicting for me personally, as a book lover; you don't smoke a cigarette above an ancient book, nor do you even touch it with your bare hands! Those personal frustrations aside, the movie builds up nicely and I loved the ending when all the pieces of the puzzle came together.I think it's easily one of Depp's best works.",The Ninth Gate

It seems to me that Depp really wanted to work with Polanski and got stuck with this crap. Nobody will be talking about this film in 20 years, I'm sorry to break it to you for fans of the film. Many parts of the plot are ridiculous. Depp runs out of a burning building in broad daylight and passes the secretary (who knows who he is) and isn't arrested? The hotel lets a strange woman in his room? The fight scene at where he ends up stuck in the floor is a very poor plot device. The use of special effects every time the girl appears on the screen to give her a demonic appearance are naff.

The acting was second rate, Depp has done better, its obvious he didn't like the movie either, he was probably forced to take this role. It starts out interesting and you expect more, but it never comes. There's no climax, except literally, the plot is lousy, the general mood of the movie puts you to sleep faster than you can say pentagram.

Polanski has done some awful clunkers, but I was hoping this would be of the quality of The Pianist (whis is, IMO, a masterpiece).It started off intriguingly, with the opening credits and the U.S.-based scenes which set the plot up nicely.But as soon as the action shifted to Europe, the wheels came off.Suddenly we were plunged into what looked like a cross between ""The DaVinci Code"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (two truly awful films in their own right), filtered through an old episode of ""The Avengers"", and done as a Hammer horror spoof. Only if Hammer had done it, they'd have made a better job of it (Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt would have been ideal in their heyday).By the time of the closing scenes in the castle, the missus and I were laughing out loud, it was that bad. Still, things could be worse, it could have been an adaptation of the God-awful ""The Shadow Of The Wind"" (oh no, I said it, now it WILL happen!!!)

The plot line is ridiculous and doesn't make sense, and you will never figure out who the inhuman girl is because, well because no-one knows, including the producers. There is not one redeeming feature in this movie. Depp produces an average performance in a poorly-chosen project for him. He probably realised halfway through that the script was awful. A half-mad chase for an evil, hellish book is a strange one to embark on, and it is never explained why Depp's character chooses to do this. The plot just twists round and round, eventually ending up in someone trying to summon an evil spirit, and only succeeding in burning themselves. Who knows how that happened?

If I were to go far I would even say that this movie is a deep catholic religious movie, perhaps even financed by the Vatican.

However, I was thoroughly disappointed at the actual movie. Although Johnny Depp provided a decent performance, most of the acting was hammy & poor, and the dialogue (especially after the halfway mark) was absurd.

I must say that I am a fan of Johnny Depp for some time now. Mainly because I like the kind of roles he plays and this movie is no exception to that. I was surprised by Emmanuele Seigner because I had not yet heard of her, and now I think that is a terrible waste of my time. I also liked the scenes in the movies from dusty Spanish towns to medieval castles of gothic architecture. And I certainly liked the music of Kilar. But at some points of the movie I could just cry. The movie seemed to be directed by an amateur if you watch the errors, mistakes and the cheap montage. Also the appearing of some satanic, sexual order was a kind of disillusioning part of the movie.

Depp delivers a convincing Corso, but something is missing from his performance that makes him look flat: this may work for the Corso portrayed in the novel, but for a supernatural script, a little bit more character would have been in order.On the bright side, I think this was masterfully directed with a pretty good cinematography, good pace and an excellent plot overall. Even the ending becomes significant once the movie is seen a couple of times. I believe the main point of the movie would be to illustrate the consequences of knowledge, and how we all have a choice when it comes to it.

The plot summarised is a book collector (Depp) stumbles upon some copy of an ancient manuscript fabled to be the entrance to the gates of hell.  He soon realises the pieces don't fit so the rest of the film is spent trying to locate the original text.  I know on the movie box it says something like 'Jonny Depp discovers the Gateway to Hell' but I don't think that ever actually happens.

Depp is an immensely talented actor, but he also has about as much charisma as the character of the spider-chewing Renfield in a ""Dracula"" movie.They say that the Devil is in the details, and THE NINTH GATE certainly proves it, in spades (or Hanged Men, if you want to use Tarot cards).",The Ninth Gate

I find its atmosphere, mood, and pacing just right for me to get back every two or three years.The film has a certain odd and mysterious atmosphere from the start. The opening scene sets the film up nicely before we are introduced to the main cast and start to unravel the story. The feel of the film seems to carry throughout, and it has a slightly dreamlike quality or that something's just a bit off. For me, this suits the subject matter of the occult that the film deals with. The movie also has a suitably devilish sense of humor to it, with the dry quips from Depp and strange comments or behavior of other characters, as well as a dark sense of humor permeating the entire story.While it is not a flashy film visually, there are no massive plot twists that will shock you, or really anything else to make it truly stand out, it is a very well made and entertaining mystery thriller.

491,mikect,Typical Polanski,8,8 August 2003,"A typical Polanski film: dark, intelligent, good casting, and good storytelling.  What struck me the most was Polanski's use of certain characters that were either comical or were perfect casts.  For instance, Depp does a wonderful job at playing hopeless wimps.  He is no macho man, and rarely is cast as one.  This movie was a wonderful precursor to his performances in Sleepy Hollow and From Hell.  Another example of a comical character were the ""brothers"" who ran the rare book shop in Spain (I didn't realize it at the time but they were played by the same man, AND later when the brothers ""shut down operations,"" the workmen tearing down the store were also the same person as the person who played both brothers).   The ever-beautiful Lena Olin played her part well, a nasty bad-tempered woman who got what she wanted.  Nepotism never impresses me, but I have to admit that Polanski's use of Seigner, his wife 36 years his junior (Polanski still loves 'em young) was a very good cast.  Seigner, with her rare beauty, played a perfect ""Devil.""  Her face and eyes can really put a man into a daze, even without the special effects.  Finally, Polanski always tells a compelling story, which in this case was the story of three mysterious prints of a book, which were ""almost"" identical to one another (you will have to see the film to learn what I mean by ""almost"" -- this storyline made the film).

(spoiler) It doesn't, it just doesn't. It reminded me of The Omen, the way it unfolds more and more about Satan and his followers but then it turns into a lame Eyes Wide Shut with no orgy. Eyes Wide Shut may have came out after it or around the same time so I don't know who ripped off who, or if it was a coincidence but this film sucks, to put it bluntly. It also contains one of the worst fight scenes ever, I am not a director or film student or anything like that but I wish I could have worked on this film as a producer or whatever, there are some watchable bits in this film, not much though. I would do a complete rewrite on the ending and last scenes because they stunk. Maybe they didn't have a good budget or something and that's why the films so weak, like the effects on the fire in baronesses flat and the final final minutes of the movie which are horrendous. Time spent watching this is time wasted.",The Ninth Gate
495,Future-Movie-Director,Johnny Depp explores the supernatural occult!,7,26 January 2012,"Johnny Depp stars in this dark, supernatural thriller about a high priced book dealer that specializes in rare and obscure books. He is hired by a rich book collector, played by Frank Langella, to research and authenticate his rare book that is said to have been written by the devil himself. Only 3 copies are known to exist. With one of the copies in his hands, he travels overseas to Europe to research the other two books and to verify they are the same. However, Depp runs into a dead end when he finds that books are exactly the same with one exception that he nearly misses. He becomes involved in an international religious cult that seems to be stalking him at every move. An overall decent film helmed by master director Roman Polanski.",The Ninth Gate

There was subtlety in this film, which requires the viewer to pay attention to the film in order to get the full benefit (not a mindless, predictable, or strictly action-oriented film, but nicely layered). Yet, I and those I viewed the film with did not find it taxing or confusing; it is merely an intelligent film.I found The Ninth Gate to be well-constructed with a decent flow and story which was carried well. Definitely not the basic formulaic Hollywood drivel. I will be adding this film to my DVD collection.",The Ninth Gate

It aches of the substance we miss so much in modern cinema:- Story along with intrigue and characters we love to hate. We all know what's going to happen in 'The Maltese Falcon' but we are still compelled as the story unfolds each time we watch it. The Ninth Gate has this quality in abundance. Some of the rolls aren't particularly well acted , Polanski's (Director) wife for instance but she is none the less absorbing. In the end ,like all, this film will come down to a matter of taste as to whether you like it or not. It will be too light hearted for some and the humor will be lost on others but if you like this film you'll probably love it.",The Ninth Gate

The film wrapped up so quickly with really poor edits that I spent the last 5 minutes thinking ""what just happened here?"" Plus there was some very cheesy special effects and music which spoiled the tension, making this film fairly laughable at the moments that were probably supposed to be the most dramatic.

501,mnjacks,What Corso represents (a theory about the last engraving),10,26 April 2006,"This is not so much a movie review (those are done well elsewhere), but a theory about the ending of the movie and who Corso really represents.SPOILER ALERT**** I too have enjoyed reading the posts and have come up with something that I just wanted to throw out there. Corso is a biblical figure--he is the serpent in the ninth engraving. After all Corso experiences each of the engravings on his quest, so logically he would have to experience the ninth engraving as well. Since the woman in the ninth engraving is ""The Girl""--who presumably is the Whore of Bablyon (a case will be made later on that the whore=Lucifer), the only person that Corso could be is the beast---which is a subtle but powerful point of the film/book.The beast in the engraving has 7 heads which could conceivably represent the seven deadly sins--(i) pride (ii) envy (iii) gluttony (iv) lust (v) wrath (vi) greed (vii) sloth--throughout the film Corso commits each one of these sins, but it is done gradually. The point being that while everyone is on the lookout for a ""beast"" or other terrible creature it could actually just be humanity falling victim to the sins. When Corso kills the man in the cellar the girl exclaims ""I didn't think you had it in you."" This is what sealed his fate as her chosen one.Just like ""The girl"" Polanski puts Corso right out there in front of everyone to see, but we tend to ignore him and focus on the evils committed by Boris and Liana. But those people are not who the devil is interested in, the devil wants people who are consistent and gradual with their sinning. Corso is perfect as this ""everyman."" Incidentally this is why I think ""The Girl"" represents Lucifer, because she is out there for everyone to see. All the idiots are busy trying to summon the Devil but she is right there for everyone to see. (refer to diana 51's post somewhere here for more on this, she does a great job as do many others). Just like people are always looking for the sign of the beast or his return--and tend to lose the forest from the trees (i.e. their own sins) Incidentally the ""whore of Babylon"" symbolism is apt because, just as a whore is a servant, she can become a master. just like the girl in the movie--she ""served"" Corso at many points but she also made it clear who was boss (i.e. when she twisted his arm after he grabbed her in the hotel lobby and when she held him back from saving Liana from Boris).More generally Whores are there to offer immediate gratification, but many men have fallen victim to manipulation and have ruined their lives in pursuit of a whore. (This argument is not meant to limit whore to just male/female, a whore presumably offers immediate gratification, thus it is more beneficial to think of a whore as anyone who offers the quick fix--which is the Devil for all intents and purposes). However in order to obtain that quick fix how many of the seven deadly sins must a person commit?Chances are that a few transgressions would normally be in order.The reason that ""The girl""/Lucifer picks Corso out of all the other evil people is because he doesn't commit the sins all at once for the quick fix. He starts out his quest purely for greed, and a long the way commits each sin as he sees fit or just for the hell of it (i.e. sleeping with Liana even though he had no intention of giving her the book; accepting another ""zero"" to the paycheck even though a friend of his was killed; not caring about getting paid by Boris at the end--he wants the engravings). Finally when he realizes the power that is at stake he is willing to make the ultimate jump to wrath (first he kills the guy in the cellar and then he kills Balkan when on fire). BUT both times he didn't need to kill those people, he could have left Liana's helper knocked out and he could have let Boris burn to death, but he just wanted to kill them out of anger (contrast this to Boris who killed for the pages in the book--and killed Liana so that she would stop bothering him). Gradual decent into evil and darkness is what endeared Corso to Lucifer/""The Girl"" and that is why he came to Corso in the form of a woman and helped him along his path. Ultimately you become one with the devil when you commit all seven deadly sins because that is the power that humans have--to choose between good and evil. That is symbolized by the ninth engraving with the woman ""riding"" the seven deadly sins--and thus unlocking the gate into the Kingdom of Shadows.(Because the word limit is set at a 1000 for comments, this post is not able to discuss some other interesting points that are brought up by others. There are some who believe that Corso is not evil at all, or rather that he has no choice in his path (i.e. he attempted to save Liana and he shot Boris out of compassion). I attempt to give my take on that in a post located at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142688/board/nest/41792586 (May 4, 2006 @ 11:04), but it's meant to be a complement to this post).

His investigation, will take him from New York to Lisbon and from there to Paris, in a path full of enigmatic females and unexplained murders...Just like Alan Parker has done before, Roman Polanski with this on screen version of ""The Club Dumas"" book by Arturo Perez-Reverte, attempts to tell a story of metaphysical terror, with terms more aesthetic rather than philological ones, that are unleashed through an intense flirt with the codes of operation of ""film noire"" (vonurable detective - stalking horse , femme fatal-es of unknown origin, faceless persecutors , all moving within a temperament of uncertainty and pendency, illustrated with expressionistic precision)All fans of the once utmost, unique Polish stylist, wont be able to resist the unique humor, erroneous eroticism and hair-raising atmosphere of some clearly ""polanskic"" scenes.The truth is, although, the man has gotten old, is tired and.. unendurably bored.

I was chagrined to see everyone smoking and drinking over the supposed priceless tomes. There must have been a reason for it and I feel a bit dim for not knowing why Polanski would have the book restorer in Spain drop ashes on the cover and then... rub it into the leather! Anyway that is irrelevant. Love Depp's reaction to LCF. Love the general subject and the atmospheric locales used, as I have worked in a few large estates such as depicted as well as having been involved in the book industry and the restoration of vintage books.

Polanski pays homage to Hitchcock's ""Marnie"" and Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" with two darkly comic scenes. The Hitchcock take occurs during the scene of the secretary's lunch-break (I know I had seen that tongue before). The nod to Kubrick may be a bit of a stretch since ""The Ninth Gate"" was released so shortly after ""Eyes"", but it involves a cultish orgy-like scene.

At times you feel like you have to help poor Johnny Depp, because he obviously is a bit on the slow side. His acting performance is very poor, simply because there is nothing to act. The script makes him behave like every other human being would behave in his place, without caracterizing him any further. The same goes for every other caracter in the film, they are just present to fulfill a function rather than give us the impression of a human being made of flesh and blood (in most of the cases anyway). This film is the exact opposite of ""Rosemary's Baby"", no ambiguity about the subject and the events, just pure what you see is what you get.

Anyway, whoever told my girlfriend that renting the movie was a good idea is probably laughing their head off right now.Indeed, the plot did sound rather intriguing.  I usually find movies with a religious theme interesting, but this one was so poorly done I could hardly believe it.  The only element of the plot that held any ""suspense"" was Johnny Depp's (I didn't feel enough connection with the character to bother remembering his name) quest to compare the three books, and although the solution became painfully obvious about halfway through the movie there was still another hour or so spent on the subject.Even the rather slow and hard-to-believe plot line could have been partially saved by an interesting ending.  Unfortunately, I would have to say that the film had one of the lamest endings I've ever seen, being far too simplistic and answering virtually none of the questions which were raised.

The movie covers only one of the two storylines contained in the book, which is a shame. The reader is unaware of the double storyline until the end, and in the book, the moment when Corso realizes that the college girl who has fallen in love with him and who keeps re-reading the French play The Devil in Love is *actually* the Devil is IMO one of the most OMG moments in all of literature.

The ninth gate is a great detective thriller, a kind of combo of Polanski's 2 best movies: Rosemarys Baby & Chinatown.Johnny Depp is excellent as the mercenary, sleazy Raymond chandler-esquire detective and Frank Langella also gives a great performance as the collector who hires Depp to authenticate his book which can supposedly summon the devil.The film moves along with a good pace with many characters and has everything that you expect from a Polanski film; dark humour, great dialogue, immaculate cinematography and of course beautiful women(including Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner & Lena Olin as the femme fatale).The film is much better than the novel on which it's based(the Dumas club) although the film is not Polanski's best(lets face it Rosemary's baby & Chinatown are pretty hard to top) it's still a great film with great music, this is one of the best thrillers of recent years.",The Ninth Gate

Not surprisingly, it is commonly misunderstood. Johnny Depp is a ""private dick""--albeit of the ""book detective"" variety. There is a femme fatale, of course, played by Emmanuelle Seigner. Depp is oftentimes hilarious in the role of Corso, who despite surface appearances, is probably the most moral character in the film. The scenes are beautiful and it plays like the reading of a great mystery story. The soundtrack is a masterpiece as well. If you like Hitchcock, you should love this movie.

I was never sure what was the focus of the movie: was it the characters and their morals and beliefs, and was I supposed to be scared?

He forced them to say stupidly preposterous lines. And poor Frank Langella tries to do the impossible (I can't feel a thing!) - in closeup. I was very prepared to like the film, enjoyed the ride most of the way but in the end I felt deceived and that I wasted my time, No satisfying resolution here.

I did and I wish I did not. This film left me with nothing but indifference to its characters, plot, and direction. Do not believe the 9 & 10 reviews. The viewer is given no reason to care about the characters or the quest of the protagonist. The overall tone is flat.The best films provide the viewer an experience and that is how they should be assessed. For example, other reviewers denigrate modern Hollywood action and flash movies, but those have the virtue of providing some excitement and entertaining scenarios. Some claim this is a ""psychological thriller"" and I must say there is nothing thrilling about it. It does not have twists and turns and lends itself to a total lack of investment by the audience. There is no payoff moment. The film does not suck you into the experience of the protagonist which is essential for psychological thrillers. It's redeeming feature is that the acting is good and the dialogue is well written.Compare this to actual psychological thrillers like Memento and the difference is clear.

In whole of the movie and especially by its end I was crying and yelling that yes! girl is the Satan himself. And, just read the comment by Diana, I independently observed all that she had said and reached the same conclusion. If you see movie carefully some of the scenes (like that of dog in the street after baroness dies, the naked lady in the last scene with serpent guarding the hell(hence meaning that girl is the Satan himself),the scene of Barnie suspended inverted etc) resemble the true woodcuts signed by LCF. Thus telling that the way to reach Satan and the ninth gate wasn't just to collect the woodcuts and perform some rituals, but to experience them in succession, in real time.

But to be more of use for those who wants to know what I thought of it more thoroughly, I will certainly give my best shot.First of all I just think that Polanski did an amazing job with ""The Girl"". She was so beautiful, but yet she seemed so evil some how. You can tell that Polanski wanted ""The Girl"" to be mysterious and for the audience to have a little mystery of their own, ""Who is this Girl?"" ""Does she work for him, or maybe even for her...?"". I think that was what made me really enjoy this film, to really think. But if you really think about it, it was quite easy in the end to see who she really was. When they are having sex in front of the castle that where in flames, her eyes really turned evil and as one before me already have said she always and only showed up when Lucifer was the topic in the conversation, she WAS ""Lucifer"".And the acting, Jhonny Depp is with out questioning one of the best actors out there, and Emmanuelle Seigner fit perfectly in the role as ""The Girl"".

I like Johnny Depp and respect the work of Roman Polanski so I was curious to see what the movie was like. Well, it was well-paced, well-acted, had a great score, had a lot of humor, and did not disappoint. The story involves the search for old mysterious books and the ""supernatural"" side of the story actually takes second place to this action. I actually picked up on the identity of ""the girl"" about halfway through the movie but the clues were obvious. She floated on several occasions and so I realized that she was not ""human"". Even so, I was anxious to find out how Corso finally made out with his endeavor. To compare this to ""Rosemary's Baby"" is just silly.

545,baragon21,Highly overrated,5,4 September 2005,"High production values? Give me a break. With all the little going on in this film, it could have been direct to video. With such a flat performance, they might as well have gotten a nobody in for Depp. The so-called remarkable score is pretty much non-existent. Furthermore, poor matte shots and hilariously bad fight scenes don't help things either.This film is made out to be some kind of masterpiece by pseudo-geniuses but the film's intelligence and wit is about on par with an episode of the Outer Limits. Don't be fooled; this is your standard, over-the-top cheese-fest of an occult mystery with the pacing slowed down to a crawl and a purposely anticlimactic ending which must be intellectually stimulating for those with an IQ of under 100.Granted, I found the film interesting for what it was. But its sheer simplicity is a major turn-off considering that it's supposed to be deep. If you honestly had to watch this film more than once to understand it, I can understand why you'd feel it is such a work of art, because you're quite simply unsophisticated. This movie, in every way, resembles the work of an amateur director who shows promise working with a low-budget. Nothing more.",The Ninth Gate

Of all the talented directors Roman P. is the only one who is obsessed with horror and specifically with the devil. Why ? Look at Rosemary's Baby, The Fearless Vampire Killers, etc. The story line is fascinating, to be on a level with God while on earth. No one in the history of man has Lucifer ever giving anything to us except horror. Lucifer, once God's best friend, tempted by Bilal to realize himself more, turn out to be God's great enemy.

549,joynsyde,"Wonderful artistry, disappointing message",3,11 May 2009,"There are many splendid aspects of this film. As a musician, I noticed the prevalence of tritones in the score; the tritone was considered during Medieval times to be the musical interval of the devil! A clever detail. The photography, acting, dialogue, effects, pace, scenery, and suspense were all masterfully executed. However, I think that good artistry + bad message always= bad art, no matter how well done it is. Anyone with even the weakest moral compass should have been offended by the message of this film, which we do not fully receive until the very end.The cast is full of despicable characters; there is nary a kind selfless person who plays a main role. The protagonist (Depp's character), whom we are led to empathize with through the film, is at first solely motivated by money. However, he finally contracts the obsession of the other main characters: to pass through the ""ninth gate"" and behold Satan, himself. As the plot develops, we realize that Corso is unknowingly the only one worthy (worthy for an unknown reason--he is certainly no better a person than the others, just poorer) to achieve this goal. At the end, after we see how Satan has mercilessly and cruelly destroyed the lives of his devotees, we expect the protagonist to receive the same torture and betrayal the others received from their master. Yet we see him walking into a brilliant light, almost heavenly in its hue. Admittedly, the ending is somewhat ambiguous, but the style of the film leads us to feel a sense of relief and triumph that Corso finally attained the treasure at the end of the hunt-- and that is purported to be a blessing. I enjoyed this film until the end, when I realized that it truly is a devil-promoting film, even while cautioning us about his destructive evil power. As if being ""worthy"" to see Satan himself is something we should aspire to! This is a message I cannot see any reasonable person swallowing, even when candy-coated with good acting, good directing, good effects, and the like.To my mind, this film displays a lot of fabulous talent gone to waste.",The Ninth Gate

The lack of any true suspense, a weak plot line, and amateurish special effects make this long and drawn out film one to stay away from. Polanski had the opportunity to create a seat squirmer had he drawn the audience closer to the dark side, but we see little Evidence of a malevolent presence other than fleeting references To Medieval characterizations clumsily portrayed in the books. Langella is a good actor who unfortunately takes on a role that renders him laughable in the final Scene. No character has a true connection to the demonic, which audiences Crave in a script such as this, but can only resort to overacting to try to Create this effect.

So that lots of peopletook the film as boring sheet. But that is even better for those intelligent - you fill that you are involved in mystery, intrusted to the secret.

559,Tardis_phone_home,The movie is a riddle too,9,23 August 2005,"Roman Polanski's movies aren't about shooting and destruction like so many other movies these days, his movies are about people and their remarkable adventures. The Ninth Gate is supposed to be a thriller or horror movie but it is neither. The Ninth Gate is an occult movie and that is a whole different ballpark.spoilers ahead!'You have before you the mystery of which men have dreamed throughout the centuries. Thousands have died an agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what you're about to see!' Those words are spoken by Boris Balkan, moments before he sets himself on fire in an attempt to raise the devil. The Ninth Gate is not only a movie about occultism, it is an occult movie by itself. First there is of course the obvious story that most people find quite disappointing BUT under the surface there is the real story that is only understood by those who are fairly familiar with symbolism and occultism. Although The Ninth gate is based on just a part of the book El Club Dumas, it is nevertheless a clever story of its own. The movie is about a riddle that is supposed to be hidden in three books, in the end that riddle is solved by Dean Corso. The movie itself contains a riddle and that riddle is to be solved by us. Besides the engravings, lots of symbolism and hints will help us understand the meaning of several strange events and eventually the meaning of what the story is all about and what happened to Balkan and Corso. The plot is created around a joke, a joke that is based on a misunderstanding. This makes a movie that one needs to see more than once, I bought the DVD and saw it over twenty times. The story gets better every time you watch it, pay attention to even the smallest details like the color of the mysterious girl's socks, there is a good reason why Corso has a shoulder bag and an overcoat he never seems to part from, until the 'notorious' very last scene; shoulder bag and overcoat are gone... Aren't you curious about the meaning of broken glasses in combination of a mark between the eyes? Search the internet for the answers to the questions you have. It's fun if you like to solve riddles, I had a great time.",The Ninth Gate
560,bethsl14,rewatch!,7,20 April 2013,"I also thought this movie was rather boring when I first saw it. I don't really understand the confusion about who the woman is, doesn't the sex scene make it more than obvious? For those who claim she might just be a servant, that may be the case but I don't really think so because of the details...such as when they are driving to the villa to get the book back from Lena Olin's character and she pretends to be an Arab man with headress ....Satan was another term for ""sultan"", in case no one knew that. Also, the fact her hair is blonde ...and Lucifer is the bringer of light. And then the demonic eyes, esp in the sex scene with Corso. Clearly Satan controls who gets into the kingdom, why would he/she want competition? Or perhaps evil is not what most think it to be (a major theme of the movie....as Balkan states , he is trying to gain ""absolute power to determine his destiny"" which is not something most would traditionally think of as the definition of evil. THen again, perhaps most don't understand its true nature. However, this could also be thought of as Balkan's delusion: that anyone can achieve power over their destiny. Perhaps it is this illusion that makes him fail, and why Satan personally controls whomever gets entrance into his /her kingdom or not.If Balkan really thought that Satan would allow equality with herself, or that getting into ""hell"" would give him equality with God, that also was another illusion. There are many ways to think about this film. I do think the ending could have been a bit less obvious for my taste, but I think there is still plenty to think about (what is hell, what is the nature of evil, what is Corso really gainig entrance to etc)",The Ninth Gate

No pointless gratuitous violence or sex. everything shown to the viewer has value. It really puts the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist Johnny depp. Great suspense and thoughtful dialogue.

It never gets old, and I never get tired of the plot. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a psychological thriller. It is not supposed to be a horror flick or action movie. It is a film that demands audience engagement. In fact, I finally read the book The Ninth Gate was based on, entitled The Club Dumas. I have gained a new appreciation for the creative artistry Polanski brought to this story. Johnny Depp plays a role perfectly suited for his looks and personality. All the co-starts and supporting case were expertly chosen. Ignore the complaints, and watch the film. If you are a book lover or collector like myself, this is the ultimate thriller for you.SPOILERS BELOW So, with a little research, I discovered the inspiration of ""The Girl"" character. In 1772, occultist Jacques Cazotte published a novel called The Devil in Love. Wikipedia states the plot: Alvaro, an arrogant young man invokes Satan. Upon seeing the young Alvaro, Satan falls in love with him, and assumes the appearance of a young woman and follows him as his page. In the journey that unfolds, Satan disguised as a woman tries to seduce Alvaro, who rejects his advances lest of losing his precious virginity.Cazotte was mentioned in The Club Dumas. This author was deeply involved in French mysticism circles during the time of the French Revolution and was beheaded for his ""mystical monarchist"" beliefs. Cazotte's fictional story, of Satan assuming the form of a woman and serving as an assistant to the protagonist, is adapted for The Club Dumas/The Night Gate. It is a clever allusion to Cazotte's The Devil in Love. Hope this helps to clear things up.",The Ninth Gate

The character of Boris was actually merged with another one: Varo Borja. This, I believed it was done with the intention of actually ""simplyfying"" the plot. And the whole idea of the DUMAS Club so present in the book was apparently left behind to focus in the main, more attractive, side of the story. Yes, maybe it ""hollywoodized"" the book, yet it cut the whole sub-plot that kept us so immerse in the pages of The Dumas Club. Great work from Polanski... understood and underrated, yet hopefully valued by true enthusiasts of Roman's work.In any case, just enjoyed both: the movie and the book.",The Ninth Gate
567,zachdc-44461,"Spoiler... Spectacular film, that ending though",10,9 August 2015,"The Ninth Gate is a masterpiece, it deserves nothing less. The film captures you from start to finish as Corso (Jonny Depp) evolves from money hungry book dealer to Lucifers chosen. As a believer in God myself (And as someone who will always have hope that there are ancient, other-worldly, supernatural things in this world) I found this film to be not only fascinating and thought gripping, but also dark and terrifying. For example, when Corso gives ""the girl"" (Emmanuelle Seigner) some ice for her neck after the confrontation by the water and she takes off his glasses, Corso looks deeply into her eyes and notices for the first time something that could be considered other worldly or supernatural (he doesn't see her float down the steps during the fight). After re-watching the film over again with Polanskis commentary, I can see why that scene was his favorite. There is something remarkably sexy and terrifying about Emmanuelles character as her eyes glow, and as she places her blood on his forehead you can't help but realize thats she's marking Corso for something greater. During the course of the film it is slowly made apparent that Corsos strange companion ""the girl"" is the incarnation of Lucifer himself, or at least his servant. This is only made more apparent during the sex scene in front of the burning castle, for you see her face constantly shift from that of a stunningly beautiful woman to the frightening smile of something dark and malevolent. One reviewer on here wrote something I really liked (I apologize ahead of time for not remembering anyone that I mentions name, but you know who you are and I thank you for being awesome!). They wrote about ""the girl"" being the whore of Babylon which is who I thought she was the first time around (and still do). They equated the WoB to Lucifer himself, which made a lot of sense when you consider the fact that often times whores (male or female) are in charge, manipulating and calling the shots from behind the curtain so to speak. Another reviewer wrote something about the twin brothers who had the real ninth engraving in their workshop and how the place where they reside may exist outside of time and space, and that they may be in cahoots with Lucifer as well. This makes sense when you go back and see that the only other person around is a small child who says the same thing in both instances ""Si Si mama!"" also both sets of brothers are more or less the same, not to mention the second set of ""hermanos"" basically set Corso up to receive the authentic ninth engraving. I thought the ending was great, almost a ""decide for yourselves type of ending, but I wanted it to be slightly different for purely selfish reasons. When Corso looks into the last real engraving and begins his walk through the ninth gate, I wanted there to be a moment where he pauses, the music shifts to something foreboding like a dark choir, and looks forward to see the Whore of Babylon, as terrifying as she is beautiful, atop the beast with seven heads in all its terrible splendor. The camera would show a few of the heads, each snarling and howling with its eyes aglow. Then the camera would shoot over to the WoB, and focuses on her face which has found a balance between angelic and horrifying. Corso would then continue his walk towards the beast, the girl, and the gate into beautiful madness. (Someone else on here made the point that Corso is the man in the book and also the seven headed beast (which I agree with)), I just would have loved to watch that scene,Im a sucker for monsters...And beautiful blond women",The Ninth Gate
568,cjberry-05907,so boring I nearly died from yawning,1,19 April 2016,"Utterly boring . This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen.

569,three_point_o,About the ending...,10,27 August 2006,"The ending seems to inspire a lot of confusion to a great many people, and I myself have heard the ridiculous idea that ""it looks like Polanski ran out of money"". The point is missed entirely.This film, is above all else EXTREMELY SATANIC, in the sense that much of its narrative conforms to a Nietzchean-LaVeyan ethic steeped on the concept of meritocracy. The audience could not be permitted the same reward as Corso because they had not earned it, and ignoring that fact would have resigned us to the same fate as Balkan--destroyed by counterproductive pride. Corso earned the right to conjure and meet the devil himself and thus was the only one able to do so.There is no mystery, only merit.",The Ninth Gate
570,rek-82429,One of Roman Polanski's Finest Fims,10,30 September 2018,"I enjoyed it. Much like Mulholland Drive, it took another viewing to appreciate the clues and figure the story out. Someone on another forum posted his thoughts of which I'll paste here. Not as long as that Salon article on Mulholland Dr.:) #1. 
Towards the end of the film, Balkan solves the enigma of the Nine Gates by reuniting all of the Lucifer engravings, and reads the riddle to himself (and a watching Corso). The riddle (as far as I would make out) is 'To travel in silence; by a long a secretous (confusing?) path; to brave the arrows of misfortune; and fear neither noose nor fire; to play the greatest game and win; foregoing all expense; is to make a (something?) of faith; and gain at last the key; that will unlock the ninth gate.' If you watch the film closely, you will find that Corso does indeed, albeit unknowingly, follow the instructions in the riddle. He travels discretely; the path certainly is confusing; he had many misfortunes, but persists; when confronted with his dead friend (on the noose), and in several places fire, he is not afraid; he certainly played the game of looking for (and getting) the engravings; he spared no expense, notice the bribes and tips that he passes around; and at the Baroness's library he proclaimed his failing faith. Perhaps Balkan had also done similar deeds, but since the last engraving was a forgery, and gave the wrong instructions, he failed to open the Gate. Who made the forgery? Obviously the Ceniza brothers. When Corso met them, they showed ample knowledge of what was required to forge a book like the Nine Gates. Their solution was to forge only a single sheet in the book. Being specialists in antique bookbinding, they could very well have replaced the page. You can make up your own mind why they did it. Was it because they knew the power of the book and wanted to make sure that anybody who tried to open the Gate would fail, or were they agents of Lucifer who wanted to be able to choose whom (s)he allowed to access the Gate? 
What was behind the Ninth Gate? What do _you_ think? Hell, heaven, ultimate power, ultimate suffering? It's whatever you think it is. You don't have to be told, just decide what it is yourself. Why wasn't Corso arrested for murder? Who actually saw him at the murder scenes? In New York it was the taxi driver who would probably not find out about the murder anyway. In Portugal, Fargas lived by himself and probably didn't tell anyone that Corso was visiting him. In France there were two witnesses, but they only caught a glimpse of Corso fleeing the scene, and even if they did recognize him, the police still had to find him, and he skipped town pretty soon after. 
All in all, I think that there are answers for just about any questions you could ask about the film. But you must, as the Ceniza brothers would say, 'think!' --------------------------------------------- 
#2: 
Many people have expressed a lot of confusion over The Girl, but they're missing the point of the film entirely. *She* is Lucifer. First of all, as it's been noted elsewhere, she is the only character that exhibits supernatural powers in the whole movie, in spite of the fact that there's more satanists than you could throw a rock at. Throughout the film she guides and assists Johnny Depp's character Corso, showing up at the most opportune moments, giving him information he'd never be able to get otherwise (like the girl's last name, St. Martin, and the location of the last page). 
But the most crucial element here, and one I haven't seen mentioned before, is that SHE is the ""Ninth Gate"". It's the mirror image of divine grace. Corso is chosen by Lucifer herself, tempted by her, and led to the final realization of what's been going on all this time. She tempted him and he accepted. He was already somewhat sleazy to begin with, his soul already tainted, which was symbolized by his indulgence in so many vices. This is not a guy you can count on to ""do the right thing."" Witness the way he bashed the satanist's head in with the butt of the gun and then didn't seem too upset about it. In fact he hardly registered it at all--The Girl was more moved by the murder than he was. 
Absolutely no one could have told Corso where the last page of the gate engravings was except Lucifer. Corso was hand-picked. I mean, would you give Ultimate Power to just any bozo? Of course not. That was the whole idea behind the puzzle of the nine pages in the first place. It weeded out idiots like Boris Balkan. He thought he could get power by figuring out the puzzle but he was as ridiculous as the robed and cowled satanists that he derided at the chateau. 
All in all, I think many people missed the entire point of this movie which is somewhat disheartening. When you see The Girl's picture on the last page it should all come together for you. --------------------------------- 
#3: The first engraving (I) seen is of a Knight on horseback riding towards the castle with the inscription 'SI.VM E.T AV.AM' which is translated be the character Boris Balkan to read 'Silence is Golden'. The significance being the number of towers within the castle de Purvert in southern France featured in the final scene of the movie. All the important engraving baring the engravers mark of ""LCF"" (Lucifer) as adapted from the Delamonicon The second engraving (VI) to be seen in the movie is of the Man hung by one leg that scene Bernie Orsteen is found murdered by Corso as to being demonically crucified symbolized by the crossing of the legs. The third engraving (III) in the film is of the Archer, which indeed does resemble the Ceniza brothers. The significance is of course the scaffolding falling like arrow from the skies. The fourth engraving (II) in the film is of the hermit representing the character of Victor Fargess. From him Corso is given the ""Key to unlocking the secret of the book. His is now able to compare the engravings and discover their deviation... Here now he has the key to enter the game represented by the labyrinth, and of course the fool represents him. This is depicted in the fifth engraving (IIII). When Corso goes to see Barrenness Kessler, he shows her the two engravings (I & VII) key (the variations within the engravings) thus the pupil outshines the master; Kessler being the master (King) and Corso being the pupil (peasant) playing chess (VII) The sixth engraving (VIII) seen in the movie is the Franciscan monk and the knight holding a mace. This represents Corso being struck from behind while studying Barrenness Kessler's copy of the Nine Gates in her library. Note: the halo represents the ""albino man"" as seen at the beginning of the fight sequence along the river Seine. The Great Dane seen after the burning Barrenness Kessler's library probably represents either Lucifer or the ""The Girl"" In regards to the ""The Girl"" represents a witch acting as a sentinel guarding the Ninth Gate. The statements make by Boris Balkan during his lecture on witchcraft. He states that: ""...A witch is a person who though cognizant of the laws of God, endeavor to act through the medium of a pact with the devil..."" She appears to be an oracle for her Master, as she orchestrates the course events by casting spells that determine Corso's fate... One may assume that once entering the Ninth Gate Corso has reached the next level or another ethereal plane. And it may be consider the next level of the game. The fifth engraving (V) (not shown in the film) is of an old bearded man sitting, and counting a sack of coins. He is in the presence of a hooded skeletal figure that holds in one hand an hourglass and in the other holds a pitchfork. This probably represents Liana Telfer/ St. Martin and Andrew Telfer. For it was Mr. Telfer whose money was used to restore his wife's chateau and to purchase the ""Nine Gates"" for her. The elements of the engraving are symbolized by the hourglass being of ones time on earth and the pitchfork, the harvesting of a soul or ones fortune. The final engraving(s) (VIIII) one is of the sentinel sitting on the back seven headed serpent, and flames rising from the castle in the background. The Ceniza brothers forged this engraving; then Corso discovered the authentic ninth engraving upon his return to their abandoned bookstore. The second ninth engraving depicts the sentinel/witch pointing the way towards an unearthly/ethereal emanating from within the castle. The Solution to Ninth Gate Enigma: (According to Boris Balkan) I. TO TRAVEL IN SILENCE, 
IIII. BY A LONG AND CIGURITOUS ROUTE. III. TO BRAVE THE ARROWS OF MISFORTUNE, VI. AND FEAR NIETHER NOOSE NOR FIRE. VII. TO PLAY THE GREATEST OF ALL GAMES AND WIN. V. FORGOING NO EXPENSE... VIII. IS TO MOCK THE FLISITUDES OF FATE, II. AND GAIN, AT LAST THE KEY IX. THAT WILL UNLOCK THE NINTH GATE Here is my take on the symbolic meaning of the last scene of the Ninth Gate... Dean Corso is allow to continue ""The Game"", and as Balkan put it "" I am (now Corso) entering uncharted territory, taking road that leads to equality with God."" Dean Corso is the first worthy opponent in three and a half centuries to play the Devil's Game.

572,saamio-1,Synergistic effect of Johny Depp and Roman Polanski !,10,6 November 2005,"Wow! I was prepared for an usual Devil (Satanism) finding movie. But it turned out to be something else. Obviously some thing else in positive sense. What a combination of Horror, thriller, suspense movie! Johny Depp was at his best as Dean Corso. Movie fans those know both Johny Depp and Roman Polanski can imagine the synergistic effect of them. Yes! thats right! It is actually more than a synergistic effect. The movies starts with some usual incidents but as time passes scenery changes dramatically. According to me it is one of the best movies of recent time. Roman Polanski knows how to portray a simple character with such an diversified manner. People who loves horror, suspense and thriller should watch the outstanding combination of those in the Ninth Gate. It has some supernatural aspects but that is the plus point of the story. Emmanuelle Seigner was also in great form as the mysterious girl who helped Depp in some supernatural way. The story moves around Depp and his adventure through Madrid and Paris. He was appointed for a 'sounds to be simple' job but it turned out to be a 'full of risk' mission. As time passed to many aspects of that risk were revealed. Depp was to go through that not for the sake of his job but to satisfy his curiosity. The movie is not only full of mystery and suspense but it also ends in a dramatic way! In a word it is a must-see movie for all the suspense, thriller lovers! According to me both Depp and Polanski deserves awards for this masterpiece.",The Ninth Gate
573,pickavance,Meandering pap that squanders it's potential.,2,4 February 2006,"I started off with high hopes for this one. Quirky, reluctant book-detective Depp becomes mired in the world of the occult when he accepts a lucrative contract to locate the literal Satanice Verses - a promising noirish potboiler seemed ready to unfold. Tension rises when (SPOILER) Depp's pal meets a grisly end portented in the iniquitous text. Thus begins a jaunt across continental europe, which unfortunately descends rapidly into sub B-movie dross. Hammy acting, wooden characters and a risibly incongruous score means that by the time the woeful end comes you're left relieved (phew.. thought it would never end) and frustrated in equal measures (is that it???? what happens next?). When Depp eventually confronts the eponymous gate what are we given for suffering through the plodding plot: the sterile directorial cop out ...fade to credits. To add insult to injury, we're left none the wiser about that silly French bint who floats about (sometimes literally) during the movie. Note to directors: enigma and suggestion can be very effective in film (cf. Blade Runner) - half baked ideas about throwing in some ill-thought through 'eerie' character, whom you give the audience no raison d'etre for are just annoying and lazy.",The Ninth Gate

575,SequiturBlue,A Great Movie with a Not-So-Great Ending,6,29 April 2006,"When a movie contains a surprising twist coupled with a deep statement, the entire setup of the scene must be carefully handled. If the ""statement"" takes upwards of half an hour to realize, the entire point is lost, and that part of the movie runs the risk of becoming somewhat comical. This, my friends, is the greatest flaw of The Ninth Gate.The Ninth Gate, for the most part, is a stylishly done movie, as is to be expected with Mr. Polanski. The cinematography is excellent, and most of the visual effects are stirring yet subtle. The acting, for the most part, is also effective. Johnny Depp is convincing as the sleazy ""book detective"", yet the Dean Corso character remains relatable enough for the audience to refrain from completely hating him. The supporting actors are interesting and add to the movie itself, rather than just stay in the background as wallpaper. The only problem as far as the acting goes is Emmanuelle Seigner, who as ""The Girl"" is a strange combination of overacting and over blinking, who seems to be unable to decide whether she is passionate and confident, or simply completely insane. Again, if this character had been handled more carefully, she would not have come off as such a overdone character.The movie rides along quite nicely until the last fifteen minutes, where the plot takes a backseat to shock value. The problems begin with the strange kinky sex scene, taking place in what looks like either Hell or someone's old basement. This odd view suddenly switches to riding in a car. The end, while probably supposedly deep and powerful, comes across as almost comical, with ridiculous neon lights leaking from an otherwise malevolent-looking castle.So, that's it. This movie is not horrible, but if you're willing to suspend belief for an outlandish ending, give The Ninth Gate a try.",The Ninth Gate
576,beattie_robin,Ridiculous,7,30 January 2006,"I agree that the DP knew what he or she was doing, and I do wonder what the underlying meaning was of Johnny Depp walking through the movie like a zombie. It's not that he didn't act well, but there were so many absurd premises to the entire thing. Why did he keep on going? Why didn't he question the girl more? Was he on heavy medication? The bottom line is that I stayed up way too late to finish watching it, so I guess it must have been compelling. Lena Olin is just delicious as someone you want to see get her eyes gouged out. I had never heard of this film and caught it by accident and I can't believe that Roman Polanski directed it, but yet I can. I will watch Johnny Depp do just about anything, like breathe, so if you have nothing to do some Saturday night, rent this horrifically ridiculous movie.",The Ninth Gate
577,joshbrobin2385,Pretty Decent Movie Overall,8,26 June 2006,"I tend to look at these comment areas for movies in an effort to better understand what a movie is about, or at the very least some rough outline of what to expect going into a movie. I'll try to keep it as unspecific as possible, I promise! Basically Depp's character is a rare book ""detective,"" for lack of a better word. He's an expert in the field, and instead of collecting many such books for himself, he instead tracks them down and sets up sales for potential buyers and collectors. He takes a job having to do with a specific book on the occult said to be able to summon Satan himself. Understandably, this is a pretty rare book, having only three copies intact, as most of the other copies were burned along with the author some four hundred years before during the Spanish Inquisition. So, he is given the task by his client (Langella's character) to track down the other two copies of the book and see which is the original, as he believes two of the three to be copies. That is basically the plot outline in a nutshell, as vaguely as can be described without giving too much away.Having some small background in rare books and a fledgling interest in the occult myself, I found the movie to be very interesting. However, if you watch this expecting to see a ""Devil's Advocate"" or a ""Stigmata"" or some other action-packed religious-undertoned film, think again. I mean, the religious undertones are there, but you kind of have to appreciate the bigger picture with this film; they're not all out in the open and in your face like in the aforementioned titles. From the viewpoint of a student of literature, this is a good film. From someone wanting to see the devil incarnate blow stuff up and a righteous hero come in to save the day, it's probably not for you. However, again, I'd recommend it to anyone willing to sit through it in an attempt to appreciate the subtle undertones presented therein.Although they didn't dissuade me from enjoying the film overall, I did notice a couple of small foibles. The book(s) in question (as well as others that are seen throughout the film) are supposed to be ultra-rare and extremely old, but they are presented in almost brand new condition, which is utterly impossible even if they had been kept in immaculate condition ever since they were printed. Such paper naturally grows brittle and yellow over time, and the bindings, although made of sturdy leather, will inevitably over time begin to crack and break. Also, none of the extensive collections presented in the film were pampered nearly enough in accordance with their respective worths; they were kept in almost direct sunlight, unshelved in some cases, and open to regular air, and yet if ancient books were actually kept under such circumstances, it would greatly reduce their respective lifespans. Finally, throughout the film, Depp's character does not handle the books in the way any real self-respecting rare book expert would. He constantly manhandles the books with his bare hands (natural acid from human hands will only help to erode pages in ancient books that much faster) when he should have been using a pair of clean white gloves and by all rights a page-turner (basically a small spade-like tool). He also smokes constantly around the old texts, which again is a big no-no. It does nothing but destroy the lifespan and lower the resell value.Anyway, sorry for the side-tracked tangent! It was a good flick overall, if you can overlook some small problems in vocational portrayal.",The Ninth Gate
