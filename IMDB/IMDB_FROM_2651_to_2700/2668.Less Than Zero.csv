0,bkoganbing,Degenerated soul,7,18 May 2017,"I guess that we all know about Robert Downey, Jr.'s struggle with substance abuse in real life that nearly cost him his career. I guess that gave him a unique insight into the mind of his character in Less Than Zero.Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz, and Downey are all friends from high school and Gertz has romantic history with both of them. When his freshman year at college concludes, McCarthy gets an anxious summons from Gertz concerning Downey, but she's kind of cryptic about it. When McCarthy gets home he sees enough for himself.What he sees and we see is a harrowing portrait of a totally degenerated soul due to the drugs he's doing. All the lies and promises to kick the habit, the way he keeps coming back for more, even trying to con drug money on the pretense of a business loan. Downey with a jones is a pretty frightening fellow.Also in the cast is another brat packer of note James Spader who usually in his salad days was a nice kid. Not here, Spader has gone into the drug trade big time and he's quite ruthless as I guess you have to be. What he has Downey doing for his fix in lieu of cash is pretty scary.Thank God for Robert Downey, Jr. in real life it worked out far better than it does for his character here.Less Than Zero is a pretty frightening portrayal of addiction and degeneracy, not for family viewing, but a great film.",Less Than Zero
1,SnoopyStyle,80s decadence,7,13 November 2015,"Clay Easton (Andrew McCarthy), Blair (Jami Gertz) and Julian Wells (Robert Downey Jr.) are best friends graduating from high school. Julian uses his daddy's money to start a record company. Blair abandons her plans for college with Clay and sleeps with Julian. Six months later, Julian returns home from college for Christmas. Blair convinces Clay to help Julian who is in trouble. Julian lost all of the money and had to borrow from drug dealing school acquaintance Rip (James Spader).This captures a certain superficial 80s L.A. decadence. Robert Downey Jr. delivers a big-time performance as a druggie mess. It is probably a bit of real life imitating art. James Spader has the perfect creepy sleaziness. McCarthy is still in the full bloom of his boyish charm. His problem is that he's a bit inferior for the part. He's not quite the leading man this role calls for. Jami Gertz does functional girlfriend acting. Downey is the key and he's great.",Less Than Zero
2,gavin6942,Not the Ellis Classic,6,17 March 2017,"A college freshman (Andrew McCarthy) returns to L.A. for the holidays at his ex-girlfriend (Jami Gertz)'s request, but discovers that his former best friend (Robert Downey) has an out-of-control drug habit.Writer Bret Easton Ellis hated the film initially but his view of it later softened. He insists that the film bears no resemblance to his novel and felt that it was miscast with the exceptions of Downey and James Spader. There really is no argument that Downey as a drug addict was a great piece of casting and this film somewhat foreshadows his downfall in the late 1980s / early 1990s.Hearing the production stories, it's interesting the film was pulled off at all. New scenes had to be shot, some scenes were cut. It seems like the crew was switched out part-way through. The finished product is far from a masterpiece, but it is still a good film, and has an even better pedigree now (2017) given the success of its main actors.",Less Than Zero
3,moonspinner55,Glossy visuals and a hot soundtrack do not a movie make...,4,7 May 2005,"I'm always amazed when people tell me ""Less Than Zero"" is a touchstone movie for them (I hope for a moment they mean that in an nostalgic or perhaps tongue-in-cheek way). The film is on the same level as ""Showgirls""; it continually seems embarrassed over itself, with the young actors shouting as if the whole world has gone deaf. Maybe a veteran director might have seen through the plastic din and gaudy art direction (like an MTV video) and brought something substantial out of this flimsy screenplay. Andrew McCarthy plays another in his stable of smug preppies, this time coming home from college during the holidays and finding his high school pals have gone to ruin. This basic plot mechanism would be highly recognizable to us if the characters themselves weren't so off-putting, and every time McCarthy gets ""passionate"", it's like watching a worm in love. *1/2 from ****",Less Than Zero
4,Quinoa1984,"it probably isn't faithful to the source, and it isn't anything great, but it has its moments and 80s vibe",7,24 August 2008,"Less Than Zero takes a fairly critical eye on the coke scene in LA in the late 80s, trying (and probably succeeding for two minutes) to de-glamorize one of the most notorious of all substances of its time, particularly for those who could afford it. The crux of the story is that Julian (Robert Downey Jr) is a f***-up who burned his bridges with his wealthy father, drifted into a non-existent record producing career and spent up 50 grand on a drug connection (James Spader), and now needs his high school friends (Andrew McCarthy and Jamie Gertz) to bail him out and get him clean. At the least it does portray the total dregs of coke addiction on a wretched level late in the picture as Downey's character goes through terrible, cold-sweat/vomiting withdrawal, the likes of which, at the least, wouldn't be seen in a common after school special. Morale of the story: kids, don't go to LA and act like a f***-up! I can't say for sure how faithful the picture is to Bret Easton Ellis's book (his first one), and from all accounts I've read it's at best loosely based. This doesn't necessarily mean it might have been better or worse if it were more faithful; Rules of Attraction may be totally true to the book but it's own ambitions- however more ambitious than Less Than Zero- are its undoing. Suffice to say in the spectrum of current Ellis adaptations it rests between the masterpiece American Psycho and the mixed bag of 'Attraction.' Aside from clichés in the story presented here the biggest problem lies in casting: McCarthy and Gertz, however pretty together, are only OK cat best and at worst are what they appear: pretty people who can't act very well (I almost though McCarthy and Spader could've switched places and made for an interesting change-up). Spader is very good, if maybe predictably slimy after seeing him play the kind of role a lot. And the music by the usually great Thomas Newman is soap-operaish.Why recommend it then, aside from those who can't get enough of 80s coke movies? First, Robert Downey Jr. I'm reminded here of his most recent turn in Tropic Thunder where he relays the theory on ""Full Retard/Half-Retard"" and how actors get completely acclaimed if they go halfway but if they overshoot it it's too much. On that quasi-scale Downey goes at about Three-Quarters Addict in Less Than Zero, which is to say that it's a perfect breakthrough performance; this is an actor who reveals himself and goes naked emotionally and occasionally goes so for broke it's genuinely frightening, and he's even amusing in little slivers to boot when not appearing as fatalistic as he is (and, as well, a mature performance, which at 21 or 22 is also extraordinary). The second reason, which may vary depending on the viewer, is the wonderful capturing of the 80s club scenes, where the music wasn't just New-Wave or Heavy Metal, but a variety of whatever there could be to dance to, and this is presented with great verve and song choices that blend and meld together.So, Downey Jr and soundtrack/80s LA scene: terrific. Everything else ranges from levels of good to mediocrity and once in a while ham-fisted cinematic gesture (such as a death scene I won't mention here).",Less Than Zero
5,wes-connors,Going Down the Cocaine Drain,6,2 December 2010,"Finally graduating from Beverly Hills High School (""class of '87""), bratty well-heeled Andrew McCarthy (as Clay Easton) goes off to college while his friends back home go off the deep end. Also making it through the twelfth grade (at last) are Mr. McCarthy's sexy girlfriend Jami Gertz (as Blair) and fun-loving pal Robert Downey Jr. (as Julian Wells) - but these two are not college-bound; she decides to work on her modeling career and he wants to start a business. The three are reunited when McCarthy comes home for Christmas. But, partying becomes a downer when McCarthy discovers his friends have become fiendish cokeheads...Can McCarthy save his friends in time? With attractive young stars, semi-MTV quality, and decent soundtrack - propelled by The Bangles' great cover of the old Simon & Garfunkel chestnut ""Hazy Shade of Winter"" - this film was a big hit with those saw it as representative of a decadent, pre-AIDS lifestyle. And, ""Less Than Zero"" certainly looks and feels like the 1980s. It's thesis seems to be: Pitiful rich kids, who lack parental guidance, could get bitten by the drug bug. But, this was based on a much more reflective story, by Bret Easton Ellis.Critics singled out Downey for praise, hence the video synopsis: ""In a spellbinding dramatic performance, Robert Downey Jr. portrays Julian, a Beverly Hills brat who has it all: looks, charm, smarts, a rich father - and a drug habit. His friend and girlfriend (Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz) are trying to help, but Julian's world is crumbling so fast, he might take them out with him. The result is a powerful and compelling story of three kids who started out with everything and are about to wind up with 'Less than Zero'.""Apparently, a little eyeliner goes a long way.Downey would have been even better in the ""Rip Millar"" role as it was originally written; this isn't meant to suggest either he or James Spader (as Rip) are inadequate; as far as this film takes them, they're fine. But, the male prostitution angle just isn't believable when you compare it to the book; and, it's way off balance. Worse, the original novel's bisexuality is neutered to extinction. A subtler performance is given by Gertz; with less to go on, she fills up her portrayal of a beautiful model on cocaine.****** Less Than Zero (11/6/87) Marek Kanievska ~ Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader",Less Than Zero
6,michaelRokeefe,Easy to enter...hard to leave.,5,20 December 2003,"This is deep, dark and often hard to watch. Sobriety is lost somewhere in reality.

Outstanding cast featuring: Robert Downey, Jr., Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz and James Spader. The onset of depression is available.",Less Than Zero
7,Scarecrow-88,Less Than Zero,9,11 February 2011,"I have always found drug movies a bit difficult to sit through because watching someone fall prey to addiction and debt, with no where left to turn and a future uncertain, isn't easy. Decadence in wealthy Los Angeles, cocaine the major drug of choice for the 80s generation, along with parties, clubs, high priced cars and fashion. Andrew MCarthy is off to college probably at an elite private school while Downey has wasted away a promising recording industry career and savings, now an addict with no options for life advancement. Jamie Gertz is a model with a coke problem. Gertz was McCarthy's girl until he left for college, her ending up in bed with Downey. She beckons him to return because Downey owes drug/smut dealer James Spader(a more lavish version)and is doomed unless he gets help--question is can Downey make it out of his current state? Better yet, how can McCarthy rescue him when Gertz herself is often high on coke? McCarthy and Gertz do rekindle their relationship, sexually and otherwise, while attempting to save their pal from Spader's grip. Downey exhausts all methods for getting out of $50,000 that belongs to Spader, a lot of dope the young man has went through over the course of 6 months, and, to be honest, his dealer has been cooperative regarding lack of payment. So Spader wants Downey to hook for him, agreeing to substitute the work for his drug debt. So the viewer is treated to an unflattering look at life of the affluent youth when they are out at night. Downey's downfall is all too credible and harrowing, his fate unfortunate, suffering through one of those excruciating experiences where he must ""get clean"", absolutely overcome with ""the sickness"". Downey was forbidden by his fed-up father to come home, finding himself sleeping on park benches. Watching him deteriorate, helpless as his own two friends, we are treated to his decline. With lush cinematography to compliment the beautiful people who populate the LA scene, masking the real ugliness of it all. ""Rusty pipes"" says it all. Film is loaded with a number of great rock and pop songs.",Less Than Zero
8,preppy-3,Zero is right!,1,16 April 2007,"College freshman Clay Easton (Andrew McCarthy) flies home to L.A. for Christmas. He discovers his ex-girlfriend Blair (Jami Gertz) is now with his best friend Julian (Robert Downey Jr.)--but Julian has a huge drug addiction problem. Clay tries to help him stop but slimy drug pusher Rip (James Spader) isn't happy with that.**DEFINITE SPOILERS** Dreadful adaptation of Ellis' harrowing novel. In the book Clay is bisexual and hooked on drugs like everybody else--including Blair. Julian is also having sex with men to support his drug addiction. At one point Clay numbly watches while Julian has sex with a guy. The book ends with nothing solved and Clay going back to college--still hooked on drugs and bisexual.This movie whitewashes the book to a degree that is truly astounding. Clay is not bisexual, he's not hooked on drugs and he stops Julian before he starts sleeping with men. Also Blair just simply stops doing drugs in a unintentionally hilarious scene--she makes it look like you can stop doing drugs easily. Julian dies here of the drugs--he was alive and still hooked by the end of the book. Also Blair goes to college with Clay (!!!). Basically this destroys any message that the book had.The acting by McCarthy and (especially) Gertz is terrible. Only Downey, Spader and Nicholas Pryor (as Julian's dad) give good performances. As an adaptation of Ellis' book it's worthless. On its own terms it's dull, stupid and whitewashes drug addiction. This is bad enough to make you wish there were no anti-drug movies. The title of this film is very apt. Avoid.",Less Than Zero

His former girlfriend, Blair, is now involved with his ex-best-friend, Julian. She warns Clay that Julian needs help: he is using a lot of cocaine and has huge debts....Anything to with the Eighties, and I'm already sold, as you may know if you read my other reviews. Bret Easton Ellis novels are difficult to turn into movies, but I've loved everyone that has been produced (even the Informers).And this is no exception.It's a film about greed and excess, and spoilt little rich kids getting into trouble and not getting their parents health.As expected, Downey Jr. Is the best thing about this, totally believable as the young man living the high life, only depending on being high to live it. Eye make up and barking attributes are the order of the day for him, and he excels.The same cannot be said though for Gertz and McCarthy, they are pretty terrible in this, just spending the film looking worried or a little bit distant, this may be trying to be cool and reckless, but they just looked moronic and boorish.But funnily enough, they are not the pivotal part of the movie, yes they get back together and try to conquer the excess of the eighties for love, but its the Julian and Rip relationship that is the movies core and heart.It looks good, a typical eighties movie where people stand on expensive looking balconies trying to find themselves, with a great soundtrack, and good looking people.Shame about Gertz and McCarthy though.",Less Than Zero
10,Wuchakk,The downside of 80's partying,5,11 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Marek Kanievska, ""Less than Zero"" is a drama about a trio of rich 18 year-olds from Los Angeles. After graduation, one goes off to college (Andrew McCarthy), but returns for Christmas break wherein he finds his ex-girlfriend (Jami Gertz) and, especially, his buddy (Robert Downey Jr.) struggling with drug addiction in the Beverly Hills fast lane. James Spader plays a smug high society dealer.This is the furthest thing from typical 80's youth flicks, like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""The Karate Kid,"" ""Valley Girl,"" ""Footloose"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (where there's, admittedly, a lot of range). ""Less than Zero"" has the epic, artsy style of Francis Ford Coppola films like ""The Outsiders"" and ""Rumble Fish"" (both from 1983) meshed with the chic melancholy of ""Poison Ivy"" (1992). My main issue is that it takes too long to get absorbed into the characters and their story. The filmmaking is gorgeous, however, which is ironic because this is a really downbeat movie. Gertz is fine, but she never did anything for me, while McCarthy is serviceable as the main protagonist, yet rather bland in a goody-goody way. Both Downey Jr. and Spader, however, de-shine in their roles (in a good way). If you favor arty, glum movies you might like this better than me, but it's nowhere near as effective as ""Poison Ivy,"" a similar artsy, gloomy flick. The movie runs 1 hour 38 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area, including Malibu. WRITERS: Bret Easton Ellis (novel) and Harley Peyton (screenplay) GRADE: C+",Less Than Zero
11,Mr-Fusion,Less than stellar,5,11 March 2017,"""Less Than Zero"" is a frustrating one. Its best moments are in the opening, with the three main characters at the peak of youthful happiness; and I think the filmmakers knew this, seeing as that snapshot bookends the movie. Then again, you can't count out the film's two best players. James Spader is operating at maximum villainy here, while Robert Downey Jr. brings a real-life facet to the drug scenes, all of which hit very close to home.What's exasperating is that, for all of the hard-hitting junkie subject matter and seeming importance, this is an empty film. I think the idea of self-destruction against the backdrop of decadence is a good one, especially in the '80s. But there was a lot more substance to these characters in that opening scene than at any point in the rest of the film. It was a little bit like ""St. Elmo's Fire"" in that regard (although far less irritating) with characters I can't latch onto dealing with heavy issues. That's why the drug scenes are the most affecting - the effects on the human body are startling, but these are also awful people.Meh.5/10",Less Than Zero

13,Smells_Like_Cheese,Another DARE commercial waiting to happen,6,27 September 2006,"Less than Zero is about some rich kids who just get bored and decide to destroy everything they have by doing drugs as usual. My only problem with this movie is the fact that I'm not sure if it was like a DARE movie or just another drug drama flick.But I will not doubt it, there are some great performances in here. Ironically enough more from Robert Downey, Jr. Gee, I wonder where he gets the inspiration from. Over all, Less than Zero is a pretty decent film, it is very dark though, not for kids at all. I'm not entirely sure how some scenes were worked in the film or even if Andrew and Jamie even had a story together.Realistic enough to be a DARE movie, but not enough where you're brutally scared into not doing drugs. Over all though, I can see how this was popular in the 80's.6/10",Less Than Zero
14,=G=,Brad Pitt? I didn't see no Brad Pitt!,5,2 September 2003,"""Less Than Zero"" does little to distinguish itself with the only good performance coming from Downey who plays a rich kid who spends his coulda-been-college years doing coke until best friends Gertz and McCarthy have to come to his rescue. Everything about this flick is too pat, too commercial, too obvious, and too Hollywood. There are zero atmospherics and art; the screenplay is soap quality; the story hackneyed and bland; the characters are stereotypes; etc, etc. For whatever reason the critics gave ""Less Than Zero"" better marks than the public (Four stars from Ebert, go figure) according to IMDB.com stats which average a paltry 5.4 after 1500 votes. Recommended only as a nostalgic look back at some ""brat packers"". (C)",Less Than Zero
15,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Different from the book, a little bit better than the book, but equally good",8,24 April 2011,"""Less Than Zero"" is an adaptation from the book of same name written by Bret Easton Ellis in 1985, a drug journey through hell that looks like paradise because the drug addicts are rich teenagers whose lives are so perfect that they need something more to run away from it, through parties, drinks, cocaine, prostitution, money and more. While Ellis's book was like seeing an Altman film with multiple characters completely tuned on drugs and MTV, an electrifying but repetitive and endless story (looks like there's a sequel in development), the film changes drastically this point of view by changing facts, characteristics of characters and giving some moralistic lessons that could work better in another similar film. The advantage of the film is a more coherent storyline instead of a mosaic of characters that almost goes nowhere.Clay (Andrew McCarthy) takes a break from college by visiting his friends in L.A., the now drug addicted Julian (Robert Downey Jr.) and Blair (Jami Gertz), the latter who wants to help Julian to get out of his present situation of eternally owing money to Rip (James Spader), a guy who makes of Julian a male whore because he needs his money back and he needs it fast. The world of drugs is glamorously presented here with most of the characters having fun at parties all the time; this is pretty close to the book except that Clay, a more wrong doing type of guy gets transformed in the film version into a cool guy, who doesn't take drugs and is very helpful to everyone. ""Less Than Zero"" is a good film, simply because it knows how to impress its audience on a difficult subject; it shows how low wealthy kids can reach to get money, drugs, and the portrayal of Julian's addiction is very convincible, nervous, a warning to make people stay out of narcotics. But, on the other hand the movie covers things that are more impressive, more shocking and better executed in films like ""Christiane F."" (1983) or ""Bright Lights, Big City"" (1988) for example, which makes it difficult to someone really relate with everything that was showed in this film. Let's say, while ""Christiane F."" frightens you about the drugs problem, ""Less Than Zero"" might give you a light aspect about drugs, something more colorful, more appealing and less negative.Composed of a good soundtrack (but not as much as the book, if you read it Ellis really puts music references in his works), the 1980's great visual style, and average performances from the cast, here's a watchable film, not as bad as people say, totally easy to follow and with many good things to offer. Even that is different from the written work is quite good, though both materials are very regular. I've read better books and I've seen better films on the issue. 8/10",Less Than Zero
16,jzappa,"Nothing Without Downey, Jr.",7,26 August 2008,"There is unapplied ambiance in Bret Easton Ellis's dark story of a college freshman who returns home to LA for Christmas and finds things not to be quite as he left them, to say the least. His ex-girlfriend has been having sex with his friend from high school, the heroin- addicted Robert Downey, Jr., who is being hassled by his dealer, James Spader in a typical performance of vicious self-importance, for the money he owes. What follows is the homecoming collegian's effort to help clean Downey, Jr. up.Downey, Jr. is terrific in an early landmark performance, but he could've been matched by the actors around him, and the production values. With the exception of Spader, the remaining cast is without the charisma and feeling that he embodies in his tortured character. The direction, too, is static, at least compared to what it could have been. This is a story that should not be given democratically. Like American Psycho and The Rules of Attraction, Less Than Zero needs a production team willing to take risks, plunge into their own subterranean perceptions of the film. The Rules of Attraction, for instance, has a twisted subreality brought to its technical aspects by Roger Avary, a filmmaker with a penchant for numbingly gloomy subjects, as he had previously made clear with his contribution to Pulp Fiction and his first directorial effort, the dismal, brutalizing bank robbery film Killing Zoe. Less Than Zero is directed with commercial sensibilities.",Less Than Zero
17,videorama-759-859391,"Not a bad late 80's drama, with Downey at his most downest",8,6 February 2014,"Less Than Zero almost seems like a film that came too late, if only for a couple of years earlier, during the Brat Pack era. While it isn't John Hughes, it's an interesting drama thanks to it's performances, especially Downey's, this role hitting a bit too close to home, and James Spader, as an oily drug supplier, while McCarthy basically just has to look sharp, smile and not say much, while I almost don't know what Gertz has to do, but just look independent. When graduating at the start, McCarthy had gone away for a while, and now he's back, only to find friend, Julian (Downey) at his worst with his drug habit, spiralling into a darker hell as referred to the movie's title, while Gertz is overly concerned. All three are from privileged families, Downey's father disowning him cause of his addiction. Downey shows some powerfully acted moments, too convincing you might say, like when he's really strung out, his supplier Spader, a really bad influence, ha ha, (different Spader movie reference) acting as a kind of pimp, when funds are short or due, making him do some weird stuff. Less Than Zero is a flashy energetic drama, all the more conflict driven, in Downey's character refusing to be helped. Based on Brett E Ellis, novel, Gertz uses the same line regarding snorting coke, as Jessica Biel does in 2003's Rules Of Attraction, based on another novel by Ellis. The film does have some messy areas, and it's ending, tragic for one, is thought provoking, but if you want John Hughes, go somewhere else.",Less Than Zero

Bright Lights, Big City was another one, which like LTZ also came out, later in 1988, and again was also set around the drug community. One feels (if I am being too harsh here, let me know) that the film could of been a bit better. The film centers around three college friends, McCarthy, Gertz, and the incredibly effective Downey, who have a tying bond to each other, and obviously all grew up together. They don't need anyone else. At the start, we see em' graduate, then are hurtled six months later, where McCarthy's absence is urgently called upon by ex girlfriend, Gertz, the catalyst, that being RDJ's character, a promising record producer, who after that deal and dream fell through, has rapidly spiraled into an abyss of despair, where the answer is only a pill popping handout away. Downey, is much in debt to a silky smooth supplier (Spader) in a truly memorable, and nasty bad guy performance, his baddest best, if you don't count The Blacklist. It was good to see Spader playing this kind of role, after playing too nice guys, discounting that nasty revenge flick, Striking Back of course, a little earlier. I don't need to impress upon, how good Downey is, but it was Spader, who I really liked here. McCarthy gets by on charm, dress style, mannerisms. I really did like his performance, and the way he adapted his likeable character, which really should bewatched and appreciative with a second take. With Gertz, I really found her beyond a rock and hard place, not just McCarthy's. There are some unnecessary sex scenes. Those couple of sepia flashback scenes near the start, really worked wonderfully in that lapsed 6 months time frame, and I really liked the style with how this film has been utilized, and it's story told, although again, I felt there were missing parts that should of been in it. The instrumental music score, another high point liked, which hauntingly reminded me of a much similar score, from another movie (Warlock 2) where here, the tune then goes in another direction. The climax is quite affecting, and again, could make addicts, think about their next fix, well until their next fix. I wouldn't really say it's an important film, but definitely deserves recommended viewing, so there. See if you can recognized a very familiar line about coke snorting, which is in Rules Of Attraction, involving piping.",Less Than Zero

Aw yes the decadent 80's. If you grew up during this time then you will have a special appreciation for this movie.

His former girlfriend (Jami Gertz) is now involved with his best friend Julian (Downey) and both of them are in trouble.

Now only Clay and Blair might save him from his drug problems.Directed by Marek Kanievska (Where the Money is) made an interesting, although very flawed film about life, money, friendship and drugs in the late 1980's. Downey, Jr. gives an strong performance and Spader is certainly creepy in his role as a low-life drug dealer. Although McCarthy and Gertz do their best, they just feel wrong for that type of picture. ""Less Than Zero"" has become an cult movie over the years. Since it is based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho, The Rules of Attraction). The novelist truly hated this film at film until he changed his mind about it over the years. He loved Downey, Jr. and Spader roles but he felt the leads were miscast and the premise was very far from his book.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 4.0 Surround Sound. DVD special features are the original theatrical trailers and t.v. spots. ""Less than Zero"" is a good film but isn't for everybody.

Andrew McCarthy, who later in his career manages to encompass empathy, (witness his performance in ""Mulholland Falls"") seems simpering and strident at the same time.It is difficult, Mr. Ellis, for most audiences to sympathize with kids who party in Palm Springs with their parents Porsches. This is simply a fact. He perhaps realized this, and thereby wrote the later ""American Psycho"" (which was quite well done), parodying and degrading the yuppie lifestyle. It needs to be done with finesse or candor, neither of which is evident in ""Less Than Zero"". It takes itself too seriously.Nicholas Pryor, a decent veteran actor, is wasted as Julian's (Morton Downey Jr's) enabling father, a man who finally sees the eminent demise of his son and wants nothing to do with it.Overall, there is an interesting theme here, but it does not convey well on screen. Watch ""American Psycho"" (Christian Bale and Chloe Sevigny in excellent performances), for a brutal but real portrayal of what people are capable of. 7/10.",Less Than Zero
22,caspian1978,Less than Zero = A Negative,7,4 December 2020,"Hands down the driving force of this movie is Robert Downey Jr's tour d force performance as Julian. HIs Brando quality on screen mirrors no rival. In his shadow, is a great performance by James Spader as Rip but it is lost with Downey's dominance throughout the movie. The abundance of awesome 80's visuals of neon lights and cocaine haze, Less than Zero offers its viewer a taste of American Psycho privilege that is the Beverly Hill's emptiness of rick kids with rick kid problems. Although Less than Zero focuses its main issue of drug addition, it also nibbles on the matter of the ambivalent sexuality of the four main characters. Some would argue that the 3 main male characters are all bi-sexual. Here lies the hidden beauty of Less than Zero. Not to take away from the issues of white privilege, broken family values and drug addict, but the decay of loss of moral values from the west coast lifestyle is pinnacle in the movie's plot. The musical score is equally significant as its style of direction and motif along the way. Most of the homes we witness are white, a pure void of any color or substance. Many of the scenes with Julian are located around water, the ocean and near pools. A symbol of the need to be clean, baptized again for his personal sins. The tennis court scene with Julian and his Father still hits home decades later as it remains s staple in reality with those dealing with drug addict within the family dynamic. The central characters are essential to the movie's message. All 3 are users one way or another and all 3 are fake in one way of another. Each is living a lie and hiding something from the other. It is this theory of them all being bi-sexual that adds tension to their love for one another and their friendship. Jamie Gertz is beyond beautiful but sticks out like a sore thumb for obvious reasons. She is a thorn in the sides of the two male leads who are fighting their need to be gay. The awkward / masculine sex scenes between Gertz and McCarthy are evidence of this. She is often dressed in black showcasing us she is mourning a death in more ways than one. Less then Zero is much deeper than your typical 80's drama. In time, generations will look back at this movie as nothing less than brilliant.",Less Than Zero

24,vertigo_14,A movie about people who exist in perpetual uselessness. (spoilers for the novel and movie),2,26 June 2004,"'Less Than Zero' was a good book, but a horrible adaptation. The movie plays out like an anti-drug drama while the book explores California's wealthy socialites who exist in a state of perpetual uselessness. With vicious characters similar to Igby Goes Down, and the unbearable and disgusting apathy of The River's Edge, the novel portrays a dark reality of over-privileged city sleaze with too way much money.The novel is narrated by Clay, an eighteen year old who returns home from his New Hampshire college for the winter holiday. Rightly characterized as a modern Holden Caufield, Clay just seems to watch his surreal existence among the wealthy Califorian socialites with disgust. It is like the ""Roaring '20s"" of The Great Gatsby, only much harsher. The characters have no emotional connection to one another, neither to family or friends. When asked where her parents are for the Christmas vacation, one girl, Kim, replies that she read in Vogue that her mother was in London, or perhaps Honolulu. Everyone just seems to be content (or kidding themselves that they are) in their meaningless rituals. Meeting at one club after another, doing endless amounts of coke, engaging in casual sex. These characters are, what Sandra Bullock's character in 'Murder By Numbers' refers to as the 'orphans.' Kids with too much money and no place to go, nothing to do. Their lifestyles have turned them into the most disgusting creatures who don't seem to acknowledge their state of uselessness. They consider it the good life. In fact, Clay does seem to be the only one to realize it. Though Blair may've once been his girlfriend and Julian may've once been his best friend in school, they don't seem to matter anymore as they get carried away with this lifestyle. Everyone has turned into this sort of Il Conformiste (notice that all characters are described as blond and tanned). Any sort of connection Clay might've had with his friends or family is lost. New Hampshire, I suppose, is his only escape from perhaps, fantasies of suicide. (Notice how he states at the end that he half-wished he could take Blair back with him). The movie is a ridiculous adaptation of the book. Important characters like Rip and Trent, the most disgustingly apathetic of the characters in the book (notice how they react when the twelve year old girl is hogtied to the bed at their friend's house or when they discover a dead body behind a club), are made trivial in the movie. And largely because the theme: these useless characters made so by their money and by the city life (the same themes of the 20s and 30s) becomes only secondary to the anti-drug story. In fact, another 80s drug-themed movie of the decade, 'Big Lights, Bright City' with Michael J. Fox and Kiefer Sutherland (aside from the drug theme) does a better job at illustrating the type of sickening cycle of useless people Ellis was describing in his own novel. 'Less Than Zero' is one of a few of Ellis's novels that have come to be adapted to the screen. The same cast of characters, those rich useless kids of the city who delude themselves in a world of zero emotion or care, return in 'American Psycho,' 'The Rules of Attraction', and now 'Glitterama.' Although, I suppose 'The Rules of Attraction' is much closer to the novel 'Less Than Zero' in that one character comes to realize how pathetic that cycle is, and desperately seeks to escape it in the end.So, I'd say, the novel is good. The movie was not. I suppose the only saving grace of the movie is that yes, it was an 80s movie with the hot young stars of the decade (particularly Gertz and Spader who are always interesting to see). That, and the anti-drug message can't be totally disregarded, especially considering the decade. Although, then if that were all the filmmakers were looking for, then: 1) it was done better the following year ('Bright Lights, Big City'; Clean and Sober), and 2) they didn't need an adaptation of a novel to create that kind of story. The movie is alright just by itself. But as an adaptation, the novel fares much better.Moreover, for those interested in reading the novel, this narrative makes an interesting comparison to the 1979 Terry Davis novel, 'Vision Quest,' which was also poorly adapted into film in the early 80s. Anyways, these are two very different books that would be quite interesting to read consecutively.",Less Than Zero
25,triple8,packs quite a powerful punch.,8,11 April 2004,"I did see this back in the eighties. I think I actually saw it in the theatre. I liked it then and I think it can stand the test of time despite the 80's feel to it. I don't understand at all, how one can think this is not  a serious movie. Granted, I have not read the book, as have many others but I did not and do not, think this film glorifies drug use at all. I have known people like the people depicted in this movie. I think anybody who has lived a life, or known others that lived a life, like, or at all similiar, to these characters, knows this film does not glorify drug use. Rather the opposite.I think this movie had pure realism to it and is quite underated.The film was not a morality tale either. I think it just told a story of these characters. It put out  a picture ,  bluntly and matter of factly, of the ramifications of living a certain lifestyle.  Could have been the ""leaving las vegas"" of the 80's....I've seen many 80's and 90's antidrug movies(Bright lights, big city, Firstborn, The boost and of coarse the more recent leaving las vegas.)Less then zero holds up against any of them-80's kids, trying to find their way against the backdrop of outward glamor and glitz. What's not realistic about that? Many saw it, many lived it, many fell victim to it. Good movie. Check it out if you haven't.",Less Than Zero
26,Movie-ManDan,A Glamorous Nightmare.,8,12 April 2020,"Long before becoming Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr. turned in one of his best performances ever, second to only his dead-on portrayal of Charlie Chaplin. One reason he is so good in this was because it mirrored his real-life substance abuse problems.'Less Than Zero' is based on the book by Bret Easton Ellis. Ellis' best-known novel is 'American Psycho,' another great book about the yuppie culture spinning out of control. Ellis initially was not a fan of this film because it did not follow his work closely. He grew to like it because he could not deny the great performances, mainly RDJ.'Less Than Zero' is about a trio of LA college-aged yuppies: Clay (Andrew McCarthy), Blair (Jami Gertz) and Julian (Robert Downey Jr.). Clay just returned home from college where ex-girlfriend, Blair, is dating former best friend, Julian. Blair is desperate for Clay to help her get Julian out of his drug habits, especially since he's been tangling with Rip (James Spader). Clay is reluctant to help, but not helping could cost Julian his life.This movie features heavy glitz and glam that could only be found in the 80s. At first, it seems that Julian is having fun. All bad habits are fun until they're not.Perhaps the biggest flaw in the film is that Julian, who is the most interesting character, is not the protagonist. The majority of the film deals with Clay and Blair. The movie is energetic and powerful, but hinging the movie on Julian would have made this a timeless classic.One film that I could easily compare this to is 'Goodfellas.' Both are about people that live the lap of luxury, get twisted in drugs, and both feature an extremely hard-hitting last act that will shock the viewer. With 'Less Than Zero,' it is this last half hour or 45 minutes that give the movie its edge and bring Julian into the foreground.This may be a depressing film, but the performance by RDJ is one to behold, and it is one of the best anti-drug pictures ever made.3.5/4",Less Than Zero
27,gangstahippie,Much different from the book but still a good movie,8,19 August 2007,"Rated R for Language,Sexuality,Drug Use and Brief Violence. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A(should be 14A)Less Than Zero was the debut novel of author Bret Easton Ellis who is one of my favorite authors.He wrote the novel ""Less Than Zero"" while he was in college.The book doesn't have much of a plot and its basically about a bunch of drug-addicted bi-sexuals living in Los Angelas.The film is much different from this.Bret Easton Ellis was said to dislike the film.I read the book before watching the movie.While it wasn't his best work, it was a good novel.I wanted to see the movie so I bought the DVD.You might have heard that the book was much different from the film and it is.Here are the differences.The book featured the character Julian only a little though in both the book and the film he is a drug addicted prostitute.Rip is Julian's dealer and pimp in this film yet in the book it was another person and Rip was one of Clay's friends.Also in the book, Clay and Blair were not trying to help Julian and also Julian was never Blair's girlfriend.I can go on and on like this but the point is, the book and the movie are two different things.When you watch this movie, forget everything about the book and watch it.The film is about Clay a young man who returns to Los Angelas for the Christmas holidays.While he is there, he meets up with his ex-girlfriend Blair who cheated on him with his friend Julian.They are happy to see each other but they are worried about Julian.Julian has become a crack-addict who owes money to Rip, a dealer.When Julian cannot pay Rip back, he asks Julian to be a male-prostitute in order to pay him back.Julian refuses and tries to quit crack with the help of Clay and Blair who are now boyfriend and girlfriend again, but Rip catches up with him and gives him crack.Then Clay and Blair get into a fight with Rip and escape with Julian.After this comes the conclusion which I will not spoil here.Robert Downey JR and James Spader play great roles in this film, however the two leads Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz are not so great as actors.The film has a great 1980's soundtrack featuring rap and pop music.Anyway Less Than Zero is a good movie but much different from the book.",Less Than Zero

Apparently, there's a message here in the film version of a book I didn't bother reading (and a movie I didn't bother seeing, that is, until I had a viral thingy a few days ago).The movie came out 30 years ago when I was 29 and too old to connect with brat-pack angst. The story is about some spoiled little rich kidlets snorting and emoting and looking painfully happy when the darlins are a'sufferin' inside. If the movie had any coherency or powerful performances, I may have almost cared about what happened. Since it didn't, I didn't either.

29,baumer,Wanna try Cocaine? Check this film out first!,10,3 January 2000,"There have been some good films that deal with the anti-drug issue.  Films that take that issue and show it's seedy side are important because a lot of what you see in Hollywood simply glorifies drugs.  And I don't mean things like pot and weed and grass and such, those drugs, to me, are harmless if they are done moderately.  But what is harmful is something as potent as cocaine.  Less Than Zero is a film that takes that notion and runs with it. There is nothing subliminal about it, nothing questionable and nothing really left to wonder what to think about heavy drugs and the affect they can have on a person.  Less Than Zero has been accused of glorifying drugs and making them look trendy and fun and popular.  But that is as far from the truth as saying that Angel Heart is a movie about a missing person. Less Than Zero does not glorify drug use in here, it treats it like it is an abomination.There are three main characters in this film.  Andrew McCarthy plays Clay, Jami Gertz is Blair and Robert Downey Jr. plays Julian.  All three are incredibly wealthy kids.  So wealthy are they that upon graduation Julien's dad gets him into the recording indsutry and Clay goes to an Ivey League school in the east leaving behind his girlfriend.  By thanksgiving Blair and Julien are sleeping together and doing lots of cocaine and by Christmas Blair is calling Clay and begging him to come home and get Julien clean. Julien is out of control and not only have drugs taken control of his life but he has lost everything that his dad has given him.  He has lost the recording studio, he has spent all of his money and his father has kicked him out of the house.  He is broke and now he owes his drug dealer in excess of fifty thousand dollars.  Played by James Spader, Rip, the drug dealer is actually not a bad guy.  He has given Julien many chances and lets his debt slide for longer than he should in the name of friendship.  As he tells Clay, "" I'm not the problem, Julien is.""  If this was another person that Julien owed money to, he may have been dead by now.  But these are friends that are dealing with each other so there is a grace period.  The end of the film is actually a bit of a shock as we are not quite ready to see the ultimate fate for Julien.  Even though we can see what road he is travelling, we are quite sure that somehow, someway Clay is going to get him through this.  But perhaps as in real life with a person that is controlled by any substance as dangerous and addictive as cocaine, fairytale endings are just that----fairytales.This film is powerful because of the performances, the subject and the direction, but what separates it from a typical film about drug abuse ( and this is probably why people say that drugs are glorified in the film ) is how it is photographed.  Hollywood is shot as though it was a music video. Here we are introduced to clubs that open at midnight and are decorated with beautiful people that look like they are all models.  The cars are fast and expensive, people's clothing are Armani suits, Ralph Lauren polo shirts, Calvin Klein jeans and any other assortment of expensive threads.  Every house and even certain nightclubs have huge pools with aqua-marine water, there are ceilings that are littered with televisions that show constant music videos and Sunset Boulevard looks like it is the most happening place in the world.  But all of this is a disguise for the lure and appearance of pleasure.  Because what lies beneath all of this glitz and glamour and fame and parties is nothing but a troublesome addiction that ends up destroying a young man's life.  Less Than Zero will make you want to think twice about ever getting into that scene.  It may look glamorous but it is a dead end road.  This was one of the best films to come out of 1987 and Robert Downey Jr. really should have won best supporting actor that year.  His outing as the drug addicted Julien was something that legends are made of.  Many people have passed on this film over the years because many people heard that it did nothing but show drugs as being a positive in a young person's life. Well if losing your fortune, beoming a prostitute, sleeping on the beach, puking every day, going through withdrawls, having your family disown you and ultimately suffer the worst of fates is a way to glorify cocaine then this does that.  I happen to think otherwise, and if you could ask any one of the three main characters that same question, I think they would agree with me.",Less Than Zero
30,gftbiloxi,Aptly Titled,1,9 May 2005,"Although his style had its detractors, Bret Easton Ellis painted an intriguing and extremely disturbing portrait of wealthy Los Angeles youths leading drug-laced lives of ennui--and who casually sleep around with both sexes, watch snuff films, and abandon long-standing friends without much more than batting an eye. Hollywood was eager to buy the rights to this best-selling novel, but Hollywood was also too chicken to actually film it... so they ran the novel through a wringer, and what came out on the other side is a formula story of two friends (Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz) who try to stop a third friend (Robert Downey Jr.) from taking a drug-fueled elevator straight to hell. And director Marek Kanievska even manages to foul that up, too.The really frustrating thing about this film is how good the cast is--or rather, how could it COULD have been if absolutely anything about this sorry waste of time and money had been worth a damn. This is a really, truly shabby bit of hyped-up commercialism without any substance to it at all, badly written, directed, and filmed, and the only other title to which I can compare it is the abominable Didi Conn film YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE. I would dearly love to give this movie a less than zero rating, because that is precisely what it deserves, and if you think otherwise, guys, you're just buying into the marketing machine that told you this piece of trash was good to begin with.Gary F.

As such it is pretty intriguing to watch at times. After a while the whole thing seems a bit anemic, though. The numbing score, Rick Rubin's aimless selection of songs by such different artists as Jimi Hendrix, Poison, Slayer, The Bangles and Roy Orbison, the half-baked acting...""Less Than Zero"" is no masterpiece, but it takes you into a certain time and milieu like few other movies do.

36,jay4stein79-1,I would if I could but I cannot...,1,19 March 2006,"That is, I wish I could give this film a score less than zero. It deserves it. Why? Mostly because it's atrocious on every conceivable level. Except, of course, James Spader and Robert Downey Jr have wonderful roles as an absolute scumbag and an absolute trainwreck, respectively. Spader might have been acting, but given Downey's later exploits I'm reasonably sure they let him get coked up and let the cameras role. Nevertheless, he's an extremely convincing addict and, just like Downey, totally ingratiating. In spite of the sore on his lip (does he have the herpes? I do and my sores NEVER look like that), you can't help but root for him. Pity that he dies and agonizingly unattractive desert in the California desert with only Jamie Gertz and Andrew McCarthy at his sides. I cannot, in fact, think of two people I would want further away from me when I kick the bucket. Anyway, it's really not a very good movie. McCarthy and Gertz are as unappealing as you can get with zero chemistry and zero charisma. I had to laugh at their ""doing it"" against a trellis, but I don't think I was supposed to be amused. Truth be told, I suppose a movie needed to be made about the coked out excess of 1980s LA, but did it need to be this, I dunno, cartoonish? Whereas BE Ellis's novel was told in an eminently flat but readable voice, which underscored the ennui of these youngsters, the film is brash, bright, and loud. The simplicity of Ellis's prose replaced for glitz and glamor. Or something like that. I didn't love the novel Less than Zero lest you think that's why I don't like this movie (for all his skill in creating interesting wasted youths in his novels he cannot yet compose a coherent or involving novel length plot; this is why Rules of Attraction was a passable read--it wasn't plotted so much as strung together).

The novel 'Less Than Zero' was written by Bret Easton Ellis when he was 22 and made him an overnight literary celebrity while still in college. He became a voice of a generation, writing what is arguably one of THE coming-of-age novels of the 80's. So of course they had to rush out a cheap lazy adaptation to capitalize on that. They take an affecting indictment of the shallowness and vapidness of L.A. delivered in cold, blank, removed, amoral tones and change it to your basic ""Drugs are bad, m'kay?"" TV after-school special. They of course had to change the ending - in the movie version, Julian (Robert Downey Jr.) dies (because of course the druggie has to be punished in this watered-down morality tale) - whereas he survives in the novel (he is violently killed by Rip's guys in the sequel novel ""Imperial Bedrooms""), and Clay is portrayed as the ""good guy"" (in the novel he does care about his friend, but is overall more morally ambiguous and himself frequently partakes in drug abuse, sleeping with everyone (male and female) and being as shallow and vapid as the rest of the rich L.A. denizens around him) while the novel ends with Clay, at this point not caring, walking out on a 12 year old girl getting *ahem* ""violated"" by a group of men.

I have seen 16 films of her (and except for ""The Lost Boys"" this is her best). I have read that Bret Easton Ellis did not like this adaptation of his book.

41,marbleann,Downey's acting is the only reason to waste 1:30 out of your life,3,5 October 2005,"I saw this movie when it first came out. I thought it was all over the place and I still do. But there is one thing about this movie that cannot be denied and the only reason I would recommend that anyone waste their time watching it. And that is Robert Downey's performance as the hope to die junkie Julian. His role was comparable to John Travolta's breath taking performance in Saturday Night Fever which was a very good movie. If Less Then Zero was even a halfway decent movie Downey would have gotten a Oscar nomination and the same accolades Travolta got for SNF. It is a tragedy such a great performance is wasted on such a bad movie. I saw the movie last night on the Fox channel and I feel even more stronger about his performance then I did 17 years ago. It was like watching his future in retrospect. Spader was very good playing James Spader, a role he still plays to this day on TV. Jamie Gertz and Andrew McCarthy might as well stayed home because they are just bland and pitiful. MacCarthy comes home for the summer from College and acts like he just landed from Mars. In my experience going to private schools and having friends in which money is not a problem, they just don't mesmerize into party going druggies with nothing to do but spend money over night. Now I am not going to implicate myself, but this partying starts way before getting out of high school. It starts mainly when we got our cars or had friends who had cars. 10th grade for the most part. Also remember it was legal to drink at 18 back then so hanging out at 15 was not a unusual. Where was MacCarthy's at during high school...AlF the Alien would of been a better choice for this part Then we have the Jaimie Gertz character. I am not buying she is a model, I'm not buying it one bit. Why is she still living in LA hanging out with her high school crowd? I mean it might be summer break for the college crowd but it shouldn't be for her, she should be at work! Plus I think she was not the right actress for the role. One of the Bratz Dolls would of done better. I did like Julians father's character though. At least there was a parent in the movie who took notice of his child. He wasn't just fed up with his son and I liked that he was not just letting him do what he was doing. Believe it or not every rich kid doesn't have parents who don't care for them. The movie is like looking at a big MTV video when they played videos. I never read the book so I cannot compare it to the book. But the movie stinks. I have to think if the two leads were not so unsuited for the roles it might have been a little better. But if not for Downey's performance this movie would be forgotten and never seen again except in the 99 cent bin at the local 99 cent store.",Less Than Zero
42,ijonesiii,An Underground classic...,7,20 December 2005,"Time has not been good to LESS THAN ZERO, the 1987 drama about privileged California teens descending into a world of constant partying, drug, and alcohol; however, this film has obtained a sort of cult status among film buffs as one of those guilty pleasures that a lot of filmgoers might take pleasure at giggling at; however, I do not find a lot amusing about this film at all, unless you're talking about the wooden performances of Andrew McCarthy and Jamie Gertz as 2/3 of the star trio. LESS THAN ZERO will always be remembered because of the mesmerizing performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as Julian, a definite foreshadowing of his future and a role he played a little too well. Downey perfectly conveyed what cocaine addiction can do to a person. Julian eventually realizes there is no line he won't cross in an effort to get high, including prostituting himself with men in order to get his drugs. Downey is sad, tragic, heartbreaking, and terrifying all at once in the showiest role of his career that he completely lost himself in. Julian is so real it's scary, whether he is horrified at McCarthy learning he is prostituting himself or begging his father (Nicholas Pryor) to let him come home because he would like to wake up somewhere and know where he is...just once.

This makes for a strong, cautionary tail of drug addiction. However, the casting, aside from RDJ and Spader is a real issue. Andrew McCarthy in particular is a big problem. Not only does this former Brat-Packer lack the acting chops to play lead in a film like this. He's just too boyish and whiny-voiced, he's like a wimpy, preppy do-gooder and he's nothing like the Clay character in the book. This character is poorly developed in the film. Btw, what happened to McCarthy's career after this film?Jami Gertz was a weak casting choice as well. She's not a strong actor in a role that calls for one.

It's competently directed and as a warning against drugs it's quite hard hitting, but it's highly exaggerated.Basically, someone in the movie died, because he did drugs constantly, for what must've been eighteen months. I've done hard drugs since I was 15, I'm 40 and I was a cocaine addict for five years, so I can tell you that is totally untrue.

46,alexcomputerkid,It is a close to flawless movie with to the heartfelt message that never gives up on what it is trying to say.,9,18 January 2015,"I wouldn't be the first to say drugs are in and a problem throughout American society. With the legalization of the pot in Washington, Oregon, and soon to be Alaska in 2015, drugs can be political and are often talked around my high school; for example ""If weed should be legal or not"". I will also say high school is where sadly I am most exposed to drugs. You know who the drug dealers are, who's been arrested over it and I can't tell you how times in my study hour I have overheard a story about a local party involving the drugs and alcohol.Yes, there are stoner films but films that have a plot of a person dealing with a drug addiction are not that common. It is hard to an find audience for these films which have a depressing atmosphere. The one film that should always to mind with drug addiction though is Less then ZeroBlair (Jami Gertz), Clay Eaton (Andrew McCarthy) and Julian Wells (Rober Downey Jr.) are all college age kids during Christmas time in affluent Los Angeles. Blair and Clay are a former couple who's relationship faltered after Blair cheated on him with Julian leaving all three friends in a awkward stance. During this Christmas break, we learn that Julian now has a severe drug problem and sometimes sleeps on a cliff on a beach due to the fact that's his parents kicked him out of the house. Julian also can't pay off his drug debt to drug dealer Rip (James Spader). It is part drug film, part relationship film.Truthfully, these are somewhat simple lead characters. These are characters who are trying their best to get away from high school problems and are trying to get a foot in the real world. It is the Downey character who is the most interesting. Director Marek Kanievska does a good job of making you feel like you have already known Julian. With some great acting by Downey, you are truly frustrated with his antics and you have no confidence that he is going to stop buying drugs like says he will. You do want him to get better because you miss that cocky, smart-ass character that briefly appears before he becomes stoned and strung out. It is hard to like Blair because of the cheating and she could possibly go down the same road as Julian but she eventually does find herself. The McCarthy character doesn't have much substance compared to the others and he is truly the only character with a clean record and you do have respect for how he tries to save his friend. Released in 1987, we do see the 80's fashion/style, and 1980's Los Angeles culture is a major theme in the film. These are all kids who parents never had money troubles, who think it is normal to wear suits and dresses every day and drive flashy cars. This rich culture is presented to us in a way that fits very nicely into the drug plot.Less Than Zero won't seem to be a stand-out film. It is mostly remembered for being an 80's film and some of it's cast and an ironically Downey had severe drugs problems afterwards in the 90's but we should remember Less Than Zero more for how well it is made.

Unfortunately this film was in production during the very height of the ""just say no to drugs"" Nancy Reagan campaign. I remember reading in the L.A. Times how the producers were stating that they changed the character Clay to an avid anti-drug crusading hero instead of the bisexual, morally confused coked-out protagonist Ellis' novel made him out to be.What a waste. This movie is ridiculous, containing absolutely none of the ambience of the novel. Instead we get stupid visuals (a party with 20 TVs all stacked up on one another, an idiotic fight at a party in Palm Springs with beautiful coked-out people looking on), that lend little to promote the plot. Essential characters from the novel (like Trent) that could have helped explain the relationships are missing.

51,dennis_chiu1,"""Less Than Zero"" - One of the Seminal Films of the 20th Century",10,18 July 2007,"""Less Than Zero"" is one of the seminal films of its era. Director Marek Kanievska and cinematographer Ed Lachman created a masterpiece of form and style, unlike any other film in the 1980s. ""Less Than Zero"" visual style was the first to blend the high style glossy fashion ad look of Los Angeles and Palm Springs with the first MTV generation energy of music videos.For example, one of the establishing scenes of the movie is the intro credits with Clay, portrayed by Andrew McCarthy in his finest role, arriving home to sunny L.A during Christmas Vacation. A yellow filter is placed over the lens so that L.A. glows. There is no dialog, but only the booming singing of The Bangles' rock cover of Simon & Garfunkels ""Hazy Shade of Winter"". The palm trees go by as Clay's taxi floats into one of Beverly Hill's affluent neighborhoods. The music dies down as Clay enters his empty modern impersonal family home and plays the message machine, only to learn that both his parents could not be present to welcome him home.The foreshadowing is all there in that establishing scene with the credits - the lack of familial love, the emptiness and detachment of the main character that matches the hollow environment.The first party is a lavish F. Scott Fitzgerald ""Great Gatsbyesqe"" 1989 party filled with dozens of television playing video images timed to rock musics. There are theme winter wonderland rooms, where the fake snow on the floors represent the white cocaine being blown up the rich teen's noses.The plot of the film is loosely based on the brilliant first novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Mr. Ellis' novel stands as one of the most significant literary works of the late 20th Century.Many amateur ""film"" critics have criticized the film for not doing justice to Mr. Ellis' literary creation. Fortunately, I do not suffer from the misconception that a film must be judged by how exact it matches its literary inspiration, rather than judging the film on its own merit.Screenwriter Harley Peyton, who was rumored to produce a first draft closely following the novel, modified his script into a lean script that could be transformed into a brilliant motion picture. The essence of isolation, friendship, drug-addition, and lost youth remains. I would argue that a closer adaptation of Mr. Ellis' novel would not have made a good film, because rarely on screen is it successful to portray a main character without emotion. Mr. Peyton needed to create character arcs, where the characters start one place and over the course of the film has some change, whether positive or negative. Robert Downey Jr. gives the performance of his life (literally) portraying the drug addict that he was to become and which almost ruined his career.One of my favorite shots in film is the second to last shot. Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr. and Jami Gertz sit mourning in Clay's classic Corvette which sits on a lonely road in the middle of the desert surrounded by Joshua trees. A flyover shot of the desert closes in for a close-up on the Corvette and the devastated main characters. The shot is breathtaking.Taken in context of film history of the 1980s, this is a clearly darker take on youth, than the John Hughe's stories of the time, like ""Pretty in Pink"" (1984) and ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985). ""Less Than Zero"" - the film and the novel should be a must see film and must read novel for every serious film viewer and reader.",Less Than Zero
52,Skeptic459,They turned Ellis's book into a 'just say no' anti-drug ad.,3,29 December 2003,"'Spare me the morality!' This is a statement that Robert Downey Jr shouts at Andrew McCarthy. If only this is what the film did. I swear by the time the end credits rolled around I was expecting Nancy Reagan and Robert Evans to show up. Then there would be all those singing children and 'just say no' slogans everywhere. Great... I feel flashbacks of Punky Brewster coming on...no...no...no!@%! I have not read the book. However, I do not think that Ellis would make a morality tale that is this heavy handed. The director almost literally tells you that if you take financial risks on something dodgy like the music business that you will lose all your money. It also says if you do drugs, cocaine in this movie, you will become a male prostitute that will be forced to service a very fruity looking James Spader. If you do drugs you will eventually die in a desert. However before that event you will also sleep in strange places and harass small children on swings. It is shown that if you are McCarthy's character, if you go to university, work hard and have a conventional life that you will be fine. There is certainly no way that you would end up as a man-whore who hangs out at spa pools with floating neon phones. FLOATING NEON PHONES!?!?! Boy did I laugh when I saw this. These things actually existed? HA!  This film has quite a bit of unintentional humor. I think it is because the director is a bit of a hack. Take the setting, this was almost too eighties for words! But hey, you have to have a Nam June Paik television set design when you film a party that is intended for 80's yuppies!
 McCarthy was part of the 80's brat pack and I am glad he is pretty much off the mainstream acting radar. Wasn't he in the atrocious, 'weekend at Bernie's?' He just does not have much talent and gets on your nerves fairly early. Jamie Gertz brings absolutely nothing to the role. Her acting goes from terrible to bearable. However it isn't much of a role and she just seems to be there to hold Roberts head as he vomits. Robert Downey Jr shines here though, his performance actually shows some talent.  However this is not hard as all the other performances range from camp to awful. Also this role is so close to the truth for him, maybe he did not click that he was actually in a film...What was funny was when he he was led inside and started to impersonate Frankenstein has he headed to the toilet too vomit.
 The film is also predictable because right from the start you know Julian is going to die. He has to because he sniffs that evil white powder and he also slept with McCarthy's girl. That is another thing. If you were an up and coming businessman. One of those power tie wearing individuals who says things like 'lunch is for wimps!' Or 'if you want a friend buy a dog!' Would you then start up a relationship with a former girlfriend who not only has a serious drug problem but also has cheated on you with your best friend? My god! It sounds like a Jerry Springer episode and is testing the story's credibility on a massive scale. The other thing is James Spader. Now I like Spader, I like him when he plays weirdo's like the main character from David Cronenberg's absolutely abnormal 'Crash.' But here he plays a pimp, drug dealer who seems to have watched Spartacus one to many times. His hair has the sought of 80's gel perfection that would make you cross the road if you saw him on the street. Every time I saw him on the screen I laughed. He even wears a coat! Obviously this makes him a pervert! This is what the director is trying to get across with all of the the subtlety of a sledgehammer! I own a large black coat and  every time I wear it people either think I am going to kill a bunch of people. Or try and sell them drugs, or maybe flash them. Long coats are out! In fact Spader's character sums up the whole movie when he declares that everyone here is an a**hole. Not a more truer word has been said about these yuppie idiots. I give this a 3/10. 1 for Julian's expression just before he vomits. 1 for the floating neon phone. 1 for Spader's hair.",Less Than Zero

Perhapsthey thought they had to 'clean it up' for the movies, although themovie tries so hard to wallow in the shallow vapidity of the eightiesanyway that one is left wondering why- why alter a fine book at all?Everyone gamely tries, but few succeed. The performances that work thebest are, of course, the 'bad guys'- James Spader and Robert DowneyJunior, in a role that has him doing most of the things he's recentlybeen arrested for, and doing them very well. It's a little eerie towatch, a bit like watching 'Manhattan' now, knowing that Woody Allenended up essentially marrying his step child who is 40 years youngerthan he is. Does that stop the enjoyment of the film? No, but it informsit in a disturbing way. Less Than Zero has a bouncy sound track, acatchy ""Bangles"" song (remember them?) and a lot of posing, which wasessential to the book but when you put it in a film it doesn't hold yourattention as well. It's like the difference between HEARING about aperson who was pretty but vacant that your friend saw at a party, andactually SEEING that person at the party, just standing and trying tolook cool. I'd much rather hear about it than be forced to watch it.Andrew McCarthy puts in probably his best performance, but the role isso underwritten and uninteresting that he's left looking for Spader orDowney Junior to help him get through his scenes alive. Jami Gertz seemsvery nice but totally miscast in this role. Once again there is one ofthose 'keep the sheets up so that it covers your privates' love scenesthat make us all boo the screen and run to get popcorn. Actually, thisone made me think why is it that our culture is so hung up about nudity?Hung up to the point that when we show a love scene, it's done in themost unrealistic way possible? It makes no sense. But I digress. TonyBill is the 'adult', who is mostly absent, and he's well cast and does afine job. Everyone does a fine job, it's just that the whole doesn't addup. The parts must have looked very interesting when this film was beingmade, but it just didn't add up. The director apparently came fromcommercials and it shows- he puts a gloss and a shine on the pools andthe houses and the parties, but deep down you get the feeling he'strying to sell you something you don't really need or want.

I went to the big clubs in LA. Studio One was THE hot place for many years. I went to my share of parties in Beverly Hills where coke was abundant. I never had to buy it. It was just everywhere.

It looked like someone had dumped a box of baking soda on the table.Having just watched this movie again for the first time in 20 years, I can objectively assess this as being an amazingly precise snapshot of the times. The only aspect of the film that could have been a bit more fun style-wise is the music. Yet, it might have been a bit too brat packish if it turned into a pop soundtrack movie like ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Breakfast Club"" or ""Weird Science"", etc. This story was not all about goofiness and teen angst. It was more adult and there really were a lot of people who got into trouble with coke and crystal in those days. They were easy to spot when you stood back. I also found it easy to stop myself from going too far by maintaining high awareness of my own situation. People into the fitness craze like me found it easier to resist going overboard because we always had our gym thing which required a clear head to keep it up. That whole scene really was mostly weekend partiers.I enjoyed watching this movie and going back in time. The film has its continuity flaws but I just couldn't see them. I was seeing too many memories to notice. I remember a Spring Break in Palm Springs where I ran into Arnold Schwartzenager at a Robinson's Dept. Store on Palm Canyon Drive. I was trying on a pair of shorts in a men's department dressing room and when I stepped out of the stall to look in the mirror Arnold stepped out of the stall next to mine wearing the exact same shorts as me. He looked me up and down and grinned at me and said, ""Dey look betta on you den day look on me."" We both started laughing. I bought the shorts. Those were the days.",Less Than Zero
65,vortexrider,Average as an 80s movie and as a drug movie,6,8 January 2007,"There are old movies we watch today either because we like eighties' movies, or because we are interested in the actors, or because we are interested in the subject. Less Than Zero has it all. Its a story of friends whose lives are threatened by drugs and other life problems like search for money and education. This takes place in a very eighties' like setting. You see all the fashions and style that you will immediately associate with the decade. I feel, however, that the captured eighties' feel here is not the kind that you would associate with glamorous ""new wave"" music, or fads like rubic's cube or pacman. Less Than Zero does present a pretty grim picture of a drug world that can destroy lives and make people very desperate. This could have become made it a very good movie, but there are just too many distracting scenes and irrelevant dialog that made it hard to watch.I don't get the point of inserting two graphic sex scenes that have nothing to do with the main plot. Its very annoying. Then there are these non-credible parties that everyone has access too, even though they have just graduated high school. I know these kids are rich, but I have trouble believing someone could simply ask their dad for 50k for no apparent reason and stuff like that.This movie gets a six out of ten.

I recently saw this film after completing the book, and realized to my dismay that the film is not faithful to the book whatsoever.  Not that this neccessarily means that a film will be bad if it strays from the book on which it's based, but in this case, they screwed up. Bad.The only redeeming element of this film is, of course, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.One of the main points of the book was that the main character, Clay, was extremely disillusioned and apathetic towards the LA lifestyle and his relationship with Blair.  The Julian character was only in about ten percent of the book, and James Spader's character wasn't quite as much of an antagonist.Granted, the book didn't have too much of a conventional plot, so I can see why they decided to change it, but good Lord, do Bret Easton Ellis some justice!

After watching it, I would definitely agree that it is nothing like the book, but I did like it for what it was.Clay (McCarthy) is coming back to Los Angeles for the Holidays. He meets up with his old Girlfriend, Blair (Gertz) and Best Friend, Julian (Downey). Clay last caught them in bed together during a Thanksgiving visit. It seems that for the past few months, Julian has developed a serious cocaine addiction that has put him $50,000 in debt with his vicious Coke Dealer, Rip (Spader).So what can I say? The film looks terrific. The Cinematography by Edward Lachman is amazing, and it is also highlighted by Thomas Newman's haunting score. The performances are great, particularly Robert Downey Jr as Julian (Who I think plays the part pretty accurately as his counterpart from the book), and although Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz get a lot of bashing for their performances, I think they're both quite effective. And Also worth noting is James Spader as Rip, who seems almost like an even slimier version of ""Stef"" from ""Pretty in Pink"".Although it has its critics and it isn't an adaptation of the book, I personally love this movie and think that it deserves more credit than it gets.",Less Than Zero

For example, it is just not possible for a commercial film to depict a major character acting in a kiddie porn to work off drug debts, as happens in the book.The movie stands on its own and it is very solid. It has a form and style that is rare among commercial films and you really don't have to have a serious interest in the subject to enjoy this film, reminiscent of New Wave cinema. James Spader's character is diabolical, and entertaining. The film has a semi-voyeuristic feel to it, and none of the performances distract from this. It is absurd and pedestrian to expect movies to imitate books. A movie is a movie and a book is a book. The dramatic form has completely different limitations and strengths than does prose.

And Jamie Gertz isn't much better.I missed this in the 80's and tried it yesterday out of sheer pandemic boredom. I'm glad I did if only for the fact that I can now argue with others who seem to be under the delusion that this is some nostalgic gem.

The 3 friends come from wealthy families and live in LA. They graduate high school and go their separate ways when Clay attends college on the east coast and Blair and Julian stay in LA. We think they will have great futures ahead of them: Clay attends college, Blair embarks on a modeling career and Julian will open up his own night club. When Clay returns to LA for Christmas, we see how wrong we were....His friends are drowning in drugs, sex and all the trappings of having too much too soon.  We see how wealth and youth are incompatible. Julian and Blair have become cocaine addicts. Blair's modeling career hasnt taken off, she does small jobs as a hand model. Julian's club is closed and he owes a huge amount of money to a drug dealer named Rip. He has borrowed money from his father and friends but still uses all the money to support his habit instead of getting a job and getting off drugs. He soon becomes alienated from his family and cut off financially. Then Rip is constantly after Julian about the money. Clay tries to help Julian but it's obvious that Julian needs more help than Clay can give. We know that it will all end badly for Julian, but we are shocked at how his life spirals out of control and that he does nothing to stop it. A startling wake-up call to people of all ages that drug addiction is a dangerous thing. You can lose your friends, family, money, dignity and so much more. Utterly brilliant.",Less Than Zero

The conversion from book to film are really badly done in most cases, but with Ellis they are completely ruined in translation.

It is a wonderful example of his emotional explosiveness, and depth-- particularly in the scenes dealing with his father. The film may get slack for being coincidental with Downey's real-life drug problems, but we're judging a movie, not someone's personal life... James Spader is at his slimy best-- he seems to have been born to play suave, manipulative characters that may be evil but never without charm! The two characters I was most disappointed with: Andrew McCarthy's ""Clay"", who seems too straight-laced to have ever been best friends with Downey's character; nor is it believable that he would command the respect that his character receives in the party scenes.

We only meet him a couple times before we realize from many vague clues that he might be dead. In the film, we see his friends really trying to help him. In the end, I have to stick up for this movie. I don't know what it is about this film but it just works for me.

It does hold a strong sense of realism, but is not overly engaging and the writing is subpar, but entertaining enough to be worth a watch.It is a time capsule back to the 80's drug scene of Los Angeles, with a gritty portrayal of drugs. I have not read the novel which the movie is based on, so as far as the adaptation, I cannot speak confidently on that aspect.

Both of their performances are really out-of-step with the story and their characters' types from the book.I remembered how much I disliked the character of Rip, played by James Spader.  Watching it again, I have realized that his was the only worthy performance of the entire film.  Even some of the extras were nervous or awkward when the camera pointed in their direction.The screenplay is mostly in-line with the book except for the level of Julian's involvement in male prostitution.  The screenplay, as well as the book, is very simplistic and the characters are poorly developed. Although the story only spans four days, we get to know very little about the characters and aren't really given much information about the falling out between Clay and Blair except that it has something to do with Julian.The movie's style is the only residual value of the film.  It is a testament to the sloth & greed of the 80s, but also the high style and the beginnings of the retro movement.The moral of the story is all too common, but it is amazing that it was lost on Robert Downey, Jr.  I used to think so much of him as an actor and only hope that he can overcome his addictions to contribute once again.",Less Than Zero

It was beautiful, and ugly, all at the same time. Then I pop this baby in and watch the rape of an amazing book! Wow, they completely missed the point! Not to mention: half of the characters, almost all the really shocking scenes, and just about the whole damn plot. What they did replace it with was a pile of drivel that focused on a more secondary character which was fairly half-assed and uninteresting. The acting was bad, the music was fairly bad, and the story was really really horrible. I'd say the only thing that somewhat paid off this hour and a half of trite attempt at adaptation was the half-way decent cinematography. Some scenes, if you didn't look at what was going on, you could get lost in the semi-interesting lighting, or the juxtaposition of off-beat objects. Maybe the director just didn't give a crap about what story was being told and just wanted to show some pretty pictures! Either way, it's not good enough as a visual piece (go check out a Fellini film for god sakes!) and the story is pretty damn horrible, especially in comparison to Bret Easton Ellis's beautiful book.

I was rather shocked the first time I saw it back in the 80s. As I am 47, it is a familiar title, but when I watched it again recently focusing more in depth on its story and scale, I realized the central point imbued. It is primarily a revelation to ALL baby-boomers of the 1980s the sheer dangers and pitfalls of drug use. Although so many of us in that time were unaware of its inevitable consequences, a few of us such as myself knew it could kill when abused. I never was a partaker of this generation's failure to understand the conflict of drug use, but if everyone both then & today would concentrate on what this film is trying, it is basically the same concrete statement that was often hammered back then, ""don't do drugs!""This film, in its own way, subtly displayed the outward beauty everyone thought there was in social drug interaction, only with quickly, additionally revealing its often horrible outcome!!!",Less Than Zero

Andrew McCarthy does well with the character created by the screenwriters, but that character lacks depth. If you've read Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name and are expecting the apathetic, drug-addled, jerk narrator, step back 'cause you won't be getting it here. It's no surprise the author was only happy with RDJ and James Spader, their characters are the only ones who even vaguely resemble those of the novel. The novel is shocking to the point of being nauseating and down right disturbing. The film is not. It's a beautiful, vapid montage of 80s that sometimes drags. The soundtrack is killer, especially LLCoolJ's Going' Back to Cali and the Bangles cover of Hazy Shade of Winter. But back to the acting- a few times in the film, Jamie Gertz hits on something real and heart-wrenching, but it's fleeting and before you can sigh with relief, it's gone. Much of her performance is pretty wooden and her performance in the last scene is positively painful. The sex scenes are very realistic, though.

Clay's subdued yet conscious driven character is written for the screen as a vehicle to guide us through this weird world of endless excess. He is there so we can have someone to sympathize with while we try to absorb everything around us.This is a grave miscalculation.Rarely do I critique movies on how they were changed from their original work, but the screenwriters have done the novel an injustice. Clay, as he was written in the novel, should be just as disaffected as his friends. He is no better or worse, he is just alive enough to notice what is going on around him after coming home from three months abroad. He also has a terrible cocaine problem of his own. The brilliance in the novel is, just like Nick in the Great Gatsby, Clay is an unreliable narrator. He is able to live as a real character, have good and bad things happen to him, and still have no control of the outcome in the story. He is powerless because he is completely indifferent. Things only change in his perceptions of how they actually happen. This is almost vital to the story in that it opens with the premise that things can't possibly get worse, yet by the end, they don't get any better. Sure, a reliable storytelling method works for the movie. It is an easy way out though, and Ellis' critically objective ""think for yourself"" method turns into a preachy sympathy play where morals are instructed rather than figured out with attention to style and detail.The second change, one that must have stirred up much controversy, is the rampant moral righteousness, even in material as seemingly morally depraved as this. Again, these are not simple, ""I wish they had done this"" gripes, they are critiques on events that truly deter from the message of the original material. As for the latent amount of sexual ambiguity that is missing from the movie, I believe it was viewed as too ""delicate"" of a subject. A reason the novel is so shocking is because it was published in a time when drugs and homosexuality were not discussed in terms of adolescents who could ""do it and get away with it."" However, It is important to note that the characters should not be viewed as ""bisexual,"" but rather sexually indifferent. The children were never taught the difference between right and wrong. They have no sense of moral decency and no concept of sensitivity or the meaning of love.They do whatever gives them instant pleasure.We realize early on that Clay cannot save Julian. However, it is all the more powerful and dreadful for Julian to be left alive in his human hell hole with Clay indifferent as he is in the end of the novel than to have Julian die in the car with Clay hugging Blair. At the time, these subjects must have been of some concern to the producers. They obviously wanted viewers to take the film seriously and not as satirical as the book is presented. Still, while Julian's death is a sad scene, nothing can be worse than being stuck in this moral wasteland.While the film focuses on having everything and losing it all, the brilliance of the novel is being unable to lose any of it. That's real hell.",Less Than Zero

Whether you were one of the cocaine users, or drinkers, or school students, this movie really takes a picture. I was 18 and just graduating high school when this movie came out and for me the drug life was just beginning. The thing i like about this movie also is that it doesn't trivialize or glamorize drug use. It shows both sides of it. The great heights, the stunning lows. Its honest. And most of all it is realistic with everything it shows you. I give it a 9, a nearly perfect movie.I'm not sure why you have to have ten lines in your comments but I am writing thi sending to accomplish that goal. Enjoy.",Less Than Zero

The man - James Spader.James Spader gives an extraordinary performance as drug dealer Rip.  This performance is as eye-popping and show-stopping as fellow Californian Hulk Hogan's performance in the 1989 epic ""No Holds Barred"", also as a character named Rip.  As for the other actors, well, Andrew McCarthy looks genuinely confused throughout the movie.  In fact, Andrew McCarthy looks confused in every movie he is in.  Check out the horrendous ""St. Elmo's Fire"" for more proof of this.  However, him and Spader seem to steal the show together much like they did in Pretty in Pink.  Check out the scene where Spader informs McCarthy that ""this isn't recess"" for proof of there great on-screen chemistry.  Jami Gertz isn't much of an actress, but she looks pretty good here.  Her make out scenes with McCarthy were quite convincing The other actor in this movie is Robert Downey, Jr.  Although it is not much of a stretch for Mr. Downey to play a down and out drug addict, I must admit he does a terrific job here.  Very convincing. Going into this movie I expected to hate it and call it awful.  However, I can't hate any movie with the great thespian James Spader in it as a rule. Therefore, I give the movie 2 and 1/2 stars.  James Spader is so kettle that his core is showing.  I hope this review was as Russo-booked as I hoped it would be.

100,ZaStaR,What have YOU done with YOUR life?,6,15 May 2001,"A movie centered around emptiness and failure.  Such a despairing premise usually leaves its audience uncomfortable and inching their way out of the room right away.  At times, I found myself seriously considering changing the channel to escape and get myself back to thinking about the trivial jokes of Seinfeld or the happy pastels of the Simpsons.  But the somehow the swirl of downward events just captivated me.It begins with a graduation, with nothing but bright futures ahead of the three characters - a club owner, a model and a college bound kid.  But a snapshot picture is taken there and a skillful change of music tells you that this is not to be a happy film - it is a tragedy.  The rest of the film is just a string of depressing events that leads to the ultimate demise.What made me watch this?  Well, it's for anyone who's ever experienced failure (all of us).  Compare the graduation with the mark of hope, an opening for wishful thinking.  At graduation it's easy to say you're going to do something, to make something more of yourself because all your options are open.  But, in reality it's more likely you would fail, get sidetracked, or just end up doing something else.  Despite all the opportunities that come up throughout the film (the rehab, the $50,000, the friendship) we already know how it will end.The end, with the scene of the empty plains furthers the idea of desolation. The road they were on was the road of their life, the promise of the future.  Julian cannot go further down that road and his fate should not be surprising.""Less than Zero"" is yet another of those somewhat philosophical movies that will not satisfy you with answers but leave you questions about your own life and what you have done with it.

Robert Downey Jr. performance is simply wonderful playing a junkie (and it seems he became inspired by this story) and if you know someone who is addicted watching this movie you'll be able to understand and even help those you really care. The story is very well done and it shows the awful truth about this underworld and in my opinion is the best movie about it far better than The Basketball Diaries with Di Caprio, Traffic (a blockbuster movie with a lot of merchandise only) and even Christiane F. (the book in this case is better). You become involved with Julian (R.Downey Jr.) problems. He suffer a lot and it's very sad how he lose his friends, his family, his beliefs, his dignity and he even need to become a prostitute to pay his never ending debt with the drug dealers. He could be your friend, your brother or even your friend.

104,MrDarcys,"Sounds, Photography, Emotion",9,1 July 2020,"There's a scene by the pool at Clay's ( Andrew McCarthy ) parents home, high in the LA hills, where it all starts to unravel.The scene is washed with melancholic pastels that herald change. It's the wash of pink colour shimmering on the back wall near the pool and Thomas Newman's soundtrack filling the scene that suddenly causes these characters to burst out of their so far known perfect rich lives. It's visually beautiful. Here we are, at the top of the Helter Skelter.Whilst McCarthy's ( Clay ) emotion cuts through the screen ( doesn't it always? ) and brings this Clay to life, his character is hugely sanitised. Sure, it may not be Easton Ellis' Clay, but I'm sure the studio didn't want Blane (McCarthy) from Pretty in Pink on screen messing about with dudes. Equally sanitised is Blair, ( Jami Gertz ), fresh from The Lost Boys, able to convey an innocent despair that's full of sadness and longing. It's said that in test viewings, in the scene where Blair ( Gertz ) discards cocaine down a sink at a party, the audience cheered.This is ""Just Say No"" and AIDS America after all, which in itself reflects Less Than Zero filtered for the masses, unable to completely transfer text to celluloid due to the social attitudes of the day? There's a simmering underside, ready to implode. It's something I always remember when watching this. Overall, it explains the sanitation of character traits for an audience freshly satiated from gorging on the likes of Bop and Smash Hits magazines! Note: I was one of those 80's kids and yes, I read Bop. Robert Downey Jr is tragically raw as Julian, potentially portraying any lost child of the 80's. Downey Jr plays rich kid going down the spiral of doom fast and furious superbly well. I know Easton Ellis didn't like the film but has said he's warmed to it over the years. Remember, it's not the book. McCarthy, Gertz and Downey Jr are front and centre, creating their own characters based on Clay, Blair and Julian. James Spader cuts an insidious figure as Rip and as mentioned, Thomas Newman's score is pure cinemotional sound. That Paired with Edward Lachman's photography makes it look and sound lovely. 9/10",Less Than Zero

I could see how someone who's never read the book could find this movie watchable, and perhaps even enjoyable. This, however, is not the case for me (or anyone else who's read the book, I imagine).The film reduces major characters (e.g. Kim & Alana) to what practically equals extras, and destroys the fabric of the original narrative. Clay goes from a hopeless junkie to a good guy, who's only trying to help his friend who's a hopeless junkie. The title of the novel refers to ALL of the characters, while the film title seems concerned only with Julian (who's not even in the first half of the novel).All in all, I'd say it's watchable if you've never read Ellis' masterpiece, but if you have, I'd say avoid this tripe at all costs!",Less Than Zero
106,unrideable,"Read the book, avoid the movie",5,25 October 2008,"Bret Easton Ellis is a great writer. His stories, however, seem to have a hard time doing well on the silver screen. Less Than Zero was written in 1987 and Hollywood quickly obtained the rights to adapt this novel into a movie. The movie, however, poorly reflects what the book is actually about.Ellis' intent in the novel is to show how empty everyone's lives truly are. Hollywod intended to make a strong anti-drug message and failed miserably as the movie was a box-office bomb.Ellis originally despised this movie, but his views have softened up recently. He is writing a sequel to the novel (don't be surprised if it eventually comes into theaters, his 4th novel, The Informers will be in theaters next year) and keeping the same intent as he has with the book. The best film Hollywood has made from an Ellis novel is American Psycho",Less Than Zero
107,CaptainJuska,Disappear here.,1,10 January 2006,"If you've read Ellis' cynical debut ""Less Than Zero,"" it would be best to ignore the morbid urge to watch this shoddy adaptation. The movie takes Ellis' wild, rapid decent through the disillusionment of drug-addled, high class LA teens and warps it into some sort of half-hearted anti-drug flick. Clay, the main character, goes from being an sometimes participant, sometimes observer of the seedy network of coke, sex, power, money and beauty to some sort of moral compass, honorably struggling to fight his friends' addictions and help them get their lives back on track. The movie feels contrived, dishonest and flat-out cheesy, where the book feels unabashedly honest and sickeningly eye-opening. Yes, it is very colorful and shiny, but this is only to distract from the fact that the plot has been horribly convoluted and substance has been compromised for flash and cheap 80s gimmicks. And the music is nowhere near as good as described in the book. In the book, the mid-80s music/club scene is a constant underlying part of every surreal scene. The book has X playing at the Roxy, Blondie on the radio and unending references to the big new wave and punk groups at the time. The movie has Cheap Trick playing at a party. How many coke addicts danced to Cheap Trick?James Spader does fine as Rip. It's not his fault that his character was an awkward combination of very different people from the novel. As for Robert Downey Jr.... he does just fine, but honestly, playing a drug addict in the 80s isn't exactly a stretch for him. Andrew McCarthy's performance as Clay is very, very forgettable, and downright disappointing to anyone who's expecting to see the direct reflection of Ellis that Clay represents in the novel. Even if you haven't read the book, this one just really isn't worth renting unless you can talk someone else into paying for it. And even then, you'll lose an irreplaceable hour and a half of your life to this drivel.",Less Than Zero

Robert Downey JR. plays the role of his life and to see him acting is a way of shocking - it goes under the skin! And, as an ""extra"", looking back, the movie is very much ""80s-styled"".

It tells the story of a complete waster with masses of talent and ideas who falls victim to cocaine/drug addiction and all that surrounds it. It seems extremely ironic that the waster is played by Robert Downey Jr whose own drugs hell has been very public (funnily enough he played a similar character in 1969!). We also see the lengths that his true friends are prepared to go to to try to help him.I personally believe this is one of the best films I've ever seen. It has everything you could ever want from a film, especially when you're depressed. It helps one to see that, in most cases, other people's lives can be so much worse!There is some fairly wooden acting, especially that from McCarthy and Gertz. Downey however is superb, as is James Spader as the slimy drug-dealer Rip.The film also contains one of the best soundtracks I've heard with music from the likes of Jimi Hendrix (Fire) and Kiss (? - Rock and Roll all Night).

Absolutely everything is off key. Watching this movie was like a form of punishment. Than there's the fact that the whole tone of voice the book took on is non-existent in the film. So many characters were left out. So many dubious choices were taking in adapting the story for film. The term 'loosely based on' doesn't even begin to fit the bill. Somebody better have been slapped for this horrible piece of memorabilia back in the '80's. Robert Downey Jr. gave away a decent enough performance, true. James Spader did a good job, sure.

115,DirectorOfActors,If Anything... Watch It For Robert Downey Jr.,7,3 August 2007,"Well, I am going to start with the bad parts (which there are a lot of so bear with me.)The script is very cheesy and shallow. It seemed they saved all the good dialogue for Downey's character. Many lines just made me writh in my seat such as, ""but do I look good?"" As someone mentioned before, it does almost read as an hour and a half long anti-drug commercial, but it does realistically display the effects of drug use. This movie should be shown to high-school students around the world!The acting (apart from Downey) was horrendous. Spader wasn't that bad, but I wasn't blown away and I forgot him as soon as the movie ended. The rest of the cast (primarily Gertz) was just... bad! I found them not believable, I was watching them ""act"" instead of what an actor should do, which is become the character. The script didn't help them, and if they had some better lines, I might have liked them better.I haven't read the book, but from what I've read, it wasn't an accurate adaptation. If it was accurate, I would have wondered why they made such a bad book into a film. But I will have to hunt down the book, because I'm sure it's better than this movie.Well I think that's enough negative for one review and I shall now proceed to Robert Downey Jr. I was captivated by every moment that he was on the screen. I could name so many scenes from this movie that blew me away and made me bawl like a little baby (I will name a few later). He is the sole redeeming feature of this movie, and if I were to watch this again (which I know I will) it will be to see him work his magic again. His performance is so moving and powerful, it will hit you like a sack of bricks. He was truly given all the best lines. The funny ones and the heart-wrenching ones. Here are a few of my favorite scenes from this film:1. When Julian asks Clay for the 50 thousand dollars to get him out of debt with his dealer, Rip. The desperation that Downey portrays is simply heart-breaking.2. When Blair and Clay find Julian on the stairs and they look after him, is very hard to watch, yet you can't take your eyes off Downey. I was crying because I was shocked by the realism of it all. 3. The look on Julian's face when he first comes out the hotel room. Need I say more?4. The scene when Julian talks to his dad in the tennis court. When Downey cried, I cried. OK, to sum up this insanely long review with the reasons to see this movie (even if it's only once.) 1. Robert Downey Jr is simply phenomenal. 2. It will convince you that drugs are bad. 3. You will cry more than Ben Affleck in all of his movies combined. 4.

117,Robbieknob,Its a teen movie with adult themes! And is truely magnificent,10,20 July 2003,"Less than Zero has to be my ultime favorite 80's movie. Every time that I watch this movie I learn something new. This movie as many people know is Robert Downey Jr.'s break out film and boy, did he do a wonderful job. I think Robert did the most amazing depiction of a drug abusive young adult that anyone of his age or stature could even try to imitate. He was just amazing! You know, that someone is amazing in a movie when you can't see any other actor portraying his or her role and that's how I know Robert did an amazing job because i can't see any other actor at that time or even now who could portray the complexity of the character,Julian Wells, justice. The movie also includes Andrew Mccarthy, Jamie Gertz and James Spader, but clearly after watching Less than Zero all your left thinking about is Robert's performance. Don't get me wrong it was a perefectly casted cast as you know Andrew being the preppy college student and Jamie being the model/girlfriend and Spader being the villian/drug dealer but all you can think about is Julian and how everything in his life, no matter how hard he tried, just kept falling apart which therefore left him with no choice but to result to drugs. Even the director who hasn't directed many films is phenominal he gives a visonary to the audience the is just exceptional. And even the music in this movie is just great your left feeling the emotions as you listen to the music and I just find that completely rare now a days. As you can see i really do hold high regard to this movie and I actually do believe that if you took the time to watch it you would learn something from it and can apply it to your own life. And if there are any Robert Downey Jr., fans out there this movie would make you like Robert far beyond his irrestiable, amazing, gorgeous looks but it would make you look even further beyond that and have you respect him even more as an actor and as human-being, and even if you are not a huge Robert Downey Jr., fan this movie will convert you into one as soon as the credits start to roll. Again this is an Amazing movie both visually and physically (performance by Robert Downey Jr.,) so if your looking for a great movie to really leave you with something to think about rather, apply to your own life than this movie is for you and I can say this because I too have learned alot from it and I thank Robert from the bottom of my heart for making it!",Less Than Zero
118,bbey2,Less Than Zero; An excellent look at an age.,10,18 August 2007,"I first viewed this movie in 1988 not long after it's release. Less Than Zero encapsulates the nations obsession with the runaway ""greed is good"", ""voodoo economics"" era of the 1980's. The move is highly stylized, and slick. It's Maimi Vice meets ""The Breakfast Club"". I state this because it has elements of the now (unfortuneatly) defunct ""Brat Pack"" However, the depiction of Julian (played by Robert Downey Jr.)seems to be the embodiment of the age as it relates to cocaine, and crack-cocaine use, and the effect it had and in many cases still has on the lives of families friends, and love ones. For this reason as a baby boomer who lived through that era. I find the movie disturbing for its sheer view into the reality of lifestyle crashing into reality. I always try not to watch this movie. Sadly, I'm drawn into it like a moth to a flame. I think its a ""scared straight"" movie for the rich; or really any one that thinks that drugs are cool, glamorous, and harmless. From a directing, and acting standpoint its excellent. Marek Kaniveska did an excellent job setting the scene and style of Los Angeles high-life. Cars, money and clothes was what it was all about. Within that vein Kaniveska has put that portion of L.A. 80's lifestyle in the history books in this writers opinion Its really too bad the main characters are not as exposed as they once were in the industry.

119,rhi-everall,Definitely worth a watch,8,26 November 2013,"I rated this film 8/10, and here's why: Whilst this film has it's fair share of bad, it has a bundle of good to go with it. It's like a game of 50/50. Half the cast are good, half bad. Half the scenes are good, half bad etc. The real clincher in this film has to be Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of drug addict, Julian. Never have I been so moved, to the point of tears (and I never cry). The film is about 3 friends: Clay (Andrew McCarthy), Blair (Jami Gertz), and Julian (Robert Downey Jr). They have just left High School and are all off to enter the real world. Clay goes to University, Julian tries to fund a record project, and Blair gets into modelling. After a year apart, things have changed. Clay comes home at Blairs request due to her concerns about Julian after his record project falls apart, he gets into debt, and heavily involved in drugs. The remainder of the film explores the struggles between the three friends being reunited and seeing how each one has changed. Whilst Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz give very poor acting, very little emotion, it is Robert Downey Jr and James Spader (Who plays Rip) who steal the show and make the film worth while. The film has a very rustic 80's feel to it along with a fantastic soundtrack in-fitting with the films story. The film is supposed to based on the book Less Than Zero by Brett Easton, but is only very loosely based. If you are a fan of the book i'd watch it with caution. Other than that, i'd recommend you all watch it just to see RDJ's captivating performance. Go on, give it a try!",Less Than Zero

So read the book and enjoy it and see the movie and try to enjoy it for what it is, not what it isn't. I think that this is above average for movies, not the greatest of all but certainly not the worst. I do a lot of reading and see a lot of movies. When a book that I really liked is made into a movie, I don't go to it to see the book. I go to it to see someone's interpretation of it.

Sure, it is set in 80's L.A. , it uses some characters and even takes lines and situations from the book (Julian gives great head) but the story goes another direction. No bisexuality, less characters and slightly less dark.Above things work well in a book, or -with the knowledge of today- in a 10-episode Netflix season, when there is time to introduce characters, but it does not work in a 98 minutes movie from the 80's.Would camp 2 have accepted the movie better with another name and a note saying 'inspired by Bret Easton Ellis' Less than Zero'? Probably. Even Bret himself admitted that the film bears no resemblance to his novel but that 'it captured a certain youth culture during that decade that no other movie caught'.
I agree with this.The movie is an 80's gem. The emptiness of the neon-lighted city of L.A. , seen through the eyes of spoiled and rich, drug-addicted adolescents is terrific. The acting of Andrew McCarthy and Jamie Gertz fits perfectly in this 80's era movie, but James Spader and especially Robert Downey Jr. are incredible.The story builds up slowly to a climax and in the end you can see the realization of the new situation and feel the emotion and connection of the remainers.The amazing soundtrack by Thomas Newman tops it off.A masterpiece!",Less Than Zero
123,beyond_strange,"If I could give this movie a score that was less than zero, I would",3,10 December 2002,"I am a film student and had to watch this film for class.  I would have to say this is the worse out of all the drug films we watched and that includes ""Reefer Madness.""The acting was terrible.  Some of it seemed real, but most of it came off as very fake and grating.  Also, the movie never went anywhere.  There was some character development, but very little.  It followed a predictable pattern: our hero is frustrated, talks to girlfriend, talks to best friend about drugs, best friends says everything is under control, hero has sex with girlfriend, best friend cries, hero fights best friend's drug dealer, repeat.  This kept on repeating over and over again in the movie.  Also, if I have to hear one more Van Halen song....The cinematography had some high points though.  There were some amazing shots such as the driving scene at the end.  Still, they can not make up for a badly written script and bad acting.  I would never watch this movie for entertainment.  Of course, it is a teen movie and does teach the dangers of drugs and I never liked any teen movie (except for the wonderful ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off.""  I would avoid this one for fun.",Less Than Zero
124,Lorcansavo-1,"great acting, shame about the script",6,27 July 2009,"Its a shame the film-makers didn't have the guts (or studio permission) to stick closer to the book, the many shades of gray in the characters been cast into black and white and the more nihilistic edges in the story are dropped,reducing it to merely a 'dangers of drugs' story. This movie is well worth a watch for Robert Downeys star-making performance though and for the sheer 80's-ness of it. However as a fan of Bret Easton-Ellis(author of the book), I would suggest you watch 'The Rules of Attraction'(2002) instead. A much more faithful adaptation, directed by Tarintino collaborator Roger Avery, this shows the true dark heart and black humor of Ellis' work.'Sean's character is grimly fascinating, a non-homicidal psychopath in action played by the person you'd least suspect. Also worth noting that in the book Sean Bateman is the brother of Patrick, the preening serial killer/fantasist from Ellis's most successful and shocking work 'American Psycho'.",Less Than Zero
125,jdhillyard,"compelling movie, powerful performances",9,30 March 2010,"Although many of the reviewers seem to criticize this movie for being a poor adaptation of the novel, I can't really comment on that because I have not read the novel. Besides, I'm not quite sure how I feel about penalizing an otherwise solid movie just because it may not have been a 100% faithful reproduction of the plot as contained in the book. At the beginning of the movie, it says ""based on the novel by..."" and not ""an exact replication of the novel by..."" I understand that every reviewer has the right to form his/her own view of a movie, but in my opinion I believe that at some point a movie should be judged on its own merits irrespective of its level of congruency to the book from which it got its inspiration.For me, the bottom line is that the performances in this movie by the three main characters - Robert Downey Jr. (Julian), Andrew McCarthy (Clay), and Jami Gertz (Blair) - were all very powerful. As a result, the depth of the plot and themes were truly compelling, including the destructiveness of drug addiction, the loss of innocence, and the gifts and burdens of friendship. The closing image of the movie (the picture of the three best friends after their high school graduation) was an emotionally moving one for me and it brought me back almost ten years to the time of my own h.s. graduation when it felt like anything was possible and definitive/permanent happiness was merely waiting in the wings as I went off to college.This film is an interesting look at an era and a tragic story of temptation.",Less Than Zero
126,frankmerritt,Remarkable,10,3 June 2018,"Like many Hollywood ""adaptations"" there were many changes made for the film of the famous novel of the same name. However, this film stands on its own as an evocation of LA in the 80s, and a compelling story and characters, apart from what the novel was. A great film, in my opinion.",Less Than Zero
127,lonewolfpsg11028,Missed The Mark By Miles,6,23 May 2013,"To keep this review short, sweet and to the point, this film completely missed the point that the novel made. As a 25 year old, I consider the novel one of the defining works of my generation and I had hopes for the film adaptation to be remotely faithful to that. It wasn't. In all fairness to the plot, it has been a couple of years since I read the novel, but it is clear that much was discarded in translation with the intention to present the film in the light of an anti-drug piece. The novel however was far more nihilistic than that and focused on the banality life for the over privileged elite. As I recall, several elements were retained in the film from the novel, but it felt like two completely different stories. I'm generally kind to adaptations and remakes in regards to view them independently of the work in which they're based, but this one was such a let down that I had a hard time not yelling at the television. That said, the film itself, ignoring the novel as much as humanly possible, was pretty middle of the road. The storytelling was shallow and clear-cut with little left up to the imagination and aside from a young Robert Downey Jr and James Spader, acting performances were marginal. It would be interesting to see this film remade by a director (and screenplay writer) that actually retains the vision that Ellis painted so vividly in his novel, but until then take this film with a grain of salt and read the novel instead. I give it a very generous 6/10.",Less Than Zero
128,james5280,"Stylish and flawlessly filmed, but also extremely powerful",8,19 May 2013,"Having often watched this film in the past, I cannot recommend it more as a quintessential 80's film. Although not perfect by far, I believe the film has received an unwarranted amount of criticism from fans of the Bret Easton Ellis novel and from critics, though regard for it seems to have increased with age. It is now undoubtedly a cult classic, one that seems to look better on screen than it did in the 80's, and in retrospect to portray a famously decadent period in history beautifully. The film focuses on the experience of college student Clay (McCarthy) when he returns to LA from the East Coast for the Christmas holidays. He encounters his ex-girlfriend Blair and best friend Julian, whose lives have dramatically disintegrated in the drug-fuelled club culture of 80's LA. The three main leads play their roles with sensitivity and poise, and not even the worst detractor of the film could criticise Downey Jr's virtuoso performance as Julian Wells, one of the most harrowing and bleak depictions of a drug addict I've ever seen. The problem is that people need to stop comparing the film with the source novel, because it is indeed a radical departure from the book. The novel lacks a serious plot, aimlessly examining a succession of nihilistic rich teenagers, bouncing from one sordid vice to another. The narrator, Clay, is indifferent to much of what is around him, and most of the time is as depraved as everyone else. Although I'm a fan of the book, it never would have translated into a mainstream film, the characters needed to have some level of sympathy and heart. Although I admit Less Than Zero could be a little edgier and have maintained the dark, cynical tone of the book, it still is a very insightful and hard-hitting piece. The film does at times feel like a Reaganesque anti-drug commercial, but McCarthy's moralising is kept to a minimum and his portrayal still maintains an observant coldness loyal to the novel's Clay. Jami Gertz's Blair is likewise hugely different from the novel, she is the emotional heart of the movie, desperately trying to keep her triangular friendship group together, nostalgically clinging to the past. And James Spader once again plays the quintessential villain, this time in the form of drug dealer Rip, managing to combine likability with a sinister evil. One of the best features of the film is its visual appeal, it is so well filmed, lit and glamorously designed it instantly draws you into the affluent and decadent world of the characters. Their world is beautifully superficial and over the top, and you can easily relate to Clay's disorientation after returning from the East Coast, and the lack of reality all the characters seem to struggle with. The soundtrack also complements this surrealness, with a strange mix of hip-hop and rock and a powerful early score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty, The Shawshank Redemption,etc...)",Less Than Zero
129,f1988xyz,What screws up the movie somewhat is it's own internal time-line,6,10 July 2005,"Not a bad 80's retro movie - especially if you graduated in 1987 like the characters.What screws up the movie somewhat is it's own internal time-line. The whole thing takes place in a 6 month period - but the events and decline of the characters seems like it should have happened over a couple of years. Main to this is the absence/presence of Clay back home and how quick Julian falls apart. They graduate in June it seems, Clay hangs out with Blair all summer and Julian takes him to the airport in late August to go to college. Things seem fine at this point. Even at the grad. scene, Julian's Dad seems to be on good terms with him. The we see in the flashback scene that Clay came home for Thanksgiving (late November) and caught them together in bed. Then Clay come home again for Christmas (a mere 4 weeks later) and he and everyone acts like so much has changed since he's been gone - but he was just there a month before!!! Plus, the business failures by Julian and his debt seem like they accumulated over a longer period, like a couple of years at least.",Less Than Zero

But the success of the novel was the traumatizing things that happened to Clay and his friends, and if you censorship that in order to make a 'watchable' movie, you are going to fail.Let's remember that in the novel there are the rape of a twelve year old, a pimp injecting heroin into Julian's arm, and a dead boy of an overdose in an alley. You lose all that in the movie by censuring it. And I'm not defending the horrible things that happened in the book, I'm just saying that Less than zero was kinda of a morbid reading.Another thing they ignored (and it couldn't be because of censorship) was the ad that said 'DISSAPPEAR HERE', that constantly followed Clay through the city.",Less Than Zero

I liked it the first time, but now have even more of an appreciation for it. This movie was very well done as compared to some other movies of it's time period. The story was captivating and I thought Robert Downey Jr.s acting was excellent even if hard to watch at times. It's obvious to me that the director went to great lengths to make sure every shot was done right. The lighting was excellent, using color and giving feeling to a lot of the night shots and especially all the scenes in the convertible. I read an earlier comment from someone who thought the music didn't fit, however I disagree. I thought it added significantly to the mood and the feel in many of the scenes.
