0,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Horror Film,6,17 January 2020,"In a teenage party, a group of friends download the app Countdown that predicts when the user will die. The teenager Courtney (Anne Winters) sees that she has just a couple of hours to live and does not accept the ride of her drunken boyfriend Evan (Dillon Lane). She walks home but she is killed by a supernatural creature when the timer in her cellphone reaches zero. Meanwhile Evan crashes his car at the same time of her death and he goes to a hospital where the nurse Quinn Harris (Elizabeth Lail) works. Evan discloses that he is afraid to go into surgery since the app Countdown predicts that he will die at the same time of the surgery. The doctors and nurses of the hospital decide to download the app and Quinn learns that she has only three days of life. When Evan mysterious dies in an accident at the hospital, Quinn buys a new cellphone and finds that the app is also installed. When she meets Matt Monroe (Jordan Calloway) at the parking lot of the store, she learns that his death is predicted for a couple of hours before her and they team-up to look for a means to break the curse.""Countdown"" is an entertaining horror film for fans of ""Final Destination"". The plot and the acting are not bad and Quinn Harris is a pleasant character. There are silly and unnecessary subplots, like the harassment of Dr. Sullivan, the priest that likes to joke or the romance of Quinn and Matt, but in general the movie is worthwhile watching. My vote is six,Title (Brazil): ""A Hora da Sua Morte"" (""The Time of Your Death"")",Countdown
1,nogodnomasters,The Bible is the Ultimate Graphic Novel,6,4 December 2019,"Quinn (Elizabeth Lail) a nurse, downloads an app that tells people when they die. She got it from a patient who died when the app told him. If you attempt to avoid your fate, a demon haunts and kills you. Matt (Jordan Calloway) and her sister (Talitha Eliana Bateman) are also on a similar countdown as they try to change their fate.This was a film made fun by P.J. Byrne who plays a priest that is into demons and curses. I wish they could have worked more of him into the plot. Go flow. Decent plot.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Countdown
2,kosmasp,What if ...,7,29 October 2020,"The premise of the movie is not so far fetched ... well that's not right. The App itself is not something that doesn't exist. Luckily not in the form the movie portrays it of course. If you are on social media, you might have seen friends, relatives or acqauintances use an app or just a program that tells them (and you and everyone else entitled to it), how long they'll live ... and sometimes even how they'll die.The movie is very well made, has a Final Destination touch to it (not a bad thing), but more importantly has a Tom Segura in it. I wasn't sure if I was going to give it a 6 or 7, but in the end I thought, why not? Let's go for the higher rating. Sorry not sorry, as they say. You may disagree on those points and that's ok, because it is always a matter of taste and the movie is flawed - not techinically speaking and ""story""-wise it checks all the (horror) boxes. I guess it could have been a bit bloodier, but it is more out for the frights and it is not completely bloodless. More than a decent effort",Countdown
3,Sleepin_Dragon,Pretty good.,6,8 September 2020,"A Nurse downloads an app, which gives a real time countdown timer of the user's death. The app has a worrying success rate.I've seen a few films where a killer app is used as the thrustt of the horror, none of them has been great in terms of production or acting, what this one lacks in terms of originality, it makes up for with quality. It's very nicely put together, the acting is of a high standard, the scares are good.There is some real depth to the characters, they have a back story, and they have appeal. Elizabeth Lail is the real star of the show, Peter Facinelli is good, his character is a monster.Don't expect it to be brilliant, it's not, but it's is good, 6/10.",Countdown
4,jboothmillard,Countdown,4,4 November 2019,"Not to be confused with the gentle words and numbers teatime gameshow, imagine something like a cross between The Ring (you do something, then you know when you're gonna die) and Final Destination (you can't escape death, and a Grim Reaper figure is seen). Basically, at a party, teenager Courtney (Anne Winters) is convinced by her friends to download Countdown, an app that seemingly predicts how long a user has left to live. Courtney is startled that it says she has only 3 hours to live. After avoiding getting into a car with her drunk boyfriend Evan (Dillon Lane), Courtney receives a notification stating that she has broken the ""user agreement"". Returning home, an unseen entity attacks her, and she is killed as her timer reaches zero. At the same time, Evan crashes and a tree branch goes right through where Courtney would have been sat. Quinn Harris (Elizabeth Lail), a nurse that works at the hospital where an injured Evan is admitted, suffers frequent sexual harassment by her boss, Dr. Sullivan (Peter Facinelli), but fears speaking out as she has only just passed her exam to be a registered nurse. Evan wanders into a closed-off wing and tells Quinn about Courtney's death and his suspicions of the app. He reveals he also downloaded Countdown and that it states he is due to die at the time he is due to go into surgery. Quinn does not believe Evan's claims, and downloads the app herself, after her co-workers download it. She is horrified to learn that it says she has only three days left. Evan skips surgery and is informed that he has violated the user agreement of the app. The demonic apparition appears in the form of Courtney and he is killed. Quinn returns home and encounters her younger sister Jordan (Talitha Eliana Bateman), they have a strained relationship following the death of their mother. The next day, Quinn learns of Evan's death and cancels a plan to go out with Jordan and their father to their mother's grave. She is informed by the app that she has broken the user agreement and is then harassed yet again by Sullivan before fleeing. Quinn researches the app, learning of Courtney's death and that similar things have happened to other users, but they are regarded as fake. Quinn is startled by a vision of dead Evan, and Jordan sees on her phone that the app tells her she has only one day left. Panicked, Quinn buys a new phone but discovers the Countdown app has installed itself on the new phone. Outside the phone store, Quinn meets Matt Monroe (Jordan Calloway), who also downloaded the app, it states he will die a few hours before her. At the hospital, Quinn learns that Sullivan has tricked the staff into thinking that she sexually harassed him; as a result, Quinn is suspended. Matt is attacked by the entity taking the form of his younger brother who died of an illness years ago. Quinn and Matt decide that reading the user agreement may help them. Getting a stranger to download it, they find that the agreement is ""broken"" if the user tries to change their fate, they realise that they have cancelled plans, during which they would have died. They consult eccentric and knowledgeable priest Father John (Final Destination 3's P.J. Byrne) who states that the app's code may help them. Cell phone shop employee Derek (Tom Segura) helps them to hack into the app's code, and Quinn is shocked to find out that Jordan has also downloaded the app. Derek hacks the app to add more years onto their life spans. However, Quinn is attacked by the demon later that night and the countdowns revert back to their original times. Jordan is attacked by the demon who takes the form of her mother. Quinn, Matt and Jordan go to Father John, who identifies the demon name Ozhin and the cursed app before theorising that if someone dies before their countdown ends or they beat the countdown by one second the curse will be broken. They prepare a warding circle to protect them from the Ozhin's attacks, but Matt is lured out by the Ozhin taking the form of his brother. Matt ends up getting hit by a car and killed as his countdown expires. Quinn takes Jordan to the hospital after she is injured in an attack and learns that Sullivan is harassing other female staff members. Quinn decides to lure Sullivan into the closed-off wing to kill him and take the 57 years his Countdown app predicted for him. Quinn attacks Sullivan, but he is saved by the Ozhin who realises what she is doing. The demon hunts down Jordan as Quinn searches for Sullivan who escapes after Quinn is injured. The Ozhin prepares to kill Jordan as her timer runs out, but Quinn overdoses on drugs, sacrificing herself to destroy the demon. Jordan notices Quinn protected herself drawing a circle and the word ""Narcan"". Jordan revives her by syringe with Naloxone and the duo succeed as the countdown timers for them both stop. Later, Quinn, Jordan and their father visit their mother's grave, while Sullivan is reported to have been arrested, after other nurses came forward. Quinn discovers an update of the app Countdown 2.0 has downloaded itself onto her phone. Derek, who also downloaded the app, is on a Tinder date, he receives a notification that he has broken the user agreement, he is attacked by the unseen demon. Also starring Tichina Arnold as Nurse Amy, Lana McKissack as Rachel, Matt Letscher as Charlie, Valente Rodriguez as Father David and Louisa Abernathy as Mrs. Talbot. Lail is appealing as the leading protagonist, and Byrne is amusing as the kooky priest, it is a simple concept. It does have a good question in the tagline: ""If you could find out exactly when you're going to die... Would you want to know?"" It is a pretty basic concept, unexplained fatalities pinpointed to a mysterious app, those close to death have nasty apparitions, and when their time is up, they meet a grisly death, unfortunately it is not all that original or tense, the attempted jump scares are forced, and the violence is average, I knew it was likely to be naff, and I was right, a silly but sort of alright supernatural horror. Okay!",Countdown
5,BA_Harrison,"Hopefully, it'll be the final countdown (da da da da, da da da da da!).",4,9 October 2020,"A mobile phone app tells users how long they have left to live; those who try to avoid the inevitable are pursued by a demon that ensures all deadlines are kept (pun intended). Having downloaded the app, Nurse Quinn Harris (Elizabeth Lail) realises the horrible truth and tries to find a way to cheat death before her countdown clock reaches zero.I struggled with this film, its Final Destination-esque plot leading to some very lacklustre scares, the film not even benefiting from the type of inventive and gory death scenes that make the FD movies so much fun. Writer/director Justin Dec manages some moderately creepy moments when various people's countdowns approach zero and the demon comes a-calling, but with no decent payoffs, the film will no doubt disappoint avid horror fans. Furthermore, I imagine that the app-driven plot is destined to feel very dated very quickly as mobile technology advances - watching this ten years down the line will probably be more funny than scary.Lail does admirably with the material, but she cannot do much to help what has clearly been aimed at a younger horror audience. It's all so frustratingly tepid (even the sexual predator sub-plot), and, worse still, Rachel Riley is nowhere to be seen.",Countdown
6,CinemaSerf,There's an ap for everything...,5,23 July 2020,"So a bunch of youngsters download an ap that is supposed to tell them how long they have to live. They think it is all just a laugh, but when one of their number gets only a few hours and then promptly, dead on time, kicks the bucket - nurse ""Quinn Harris"" (Elizabeth Lail) starts to take it all very seriously. Together with fellow-fated Jordan Calloway (""Matt Monroe"") they desperately try to stop the inevitable clock from ticking down... The concept, once you get past why anyone would ever download such a thing in the first place, is quite good and Justin Dec manages to inject quite a bit of suspense into the latter half of this, but the acting is pretty ordinary and the dialogue tries to use hysteria to create tension and that really falls flat with an ending that is really quite poor. Pity, in more ambitious hands a lot more could have been done with the story.",Countdown
7,zardoz-13,Time Enough For Death,3,11 November 2019,"Jump scares alone do not a good horror movie make. Horror fearmongers love to make people jump, even when the monster isn't making them jump. Half the time horror movies make people jump just for the sake of jumping. A jump scare is a false alarm. Audiences are set-up for this hokum with atmospheric elements, like ominous situations, gloomy surroundings, and earsplitting music or sound effects. When these elements converge, something startling happens. Anticipating something alarming, audiences scream, laugh, and/or feel disgusted with themselves. Freshman filmmaker Justin Dec's ""Countdown"" concerns a creepy cell phone app. The years, days, hours, minutes and seconds left before you die are clocked. Getting lucky, some thrive into their 80s and 90s. Naturally, nothing happens to them. Those whose luck has abandoned them die in a matter of days. Mind you, this technophobia tingler isn't the first Hollywood fright film about a lethal app. Abel and Burlee Vang's imaginative chiller ""Bedeviled"" (2017) showed a murderous, supernatural prankster lurking within a smartphone app that stalks five frightened teens. Virtually a carbon copy of ""Bedeviled,"" ""Countdown"" lacks the coherence of the earlier film.Primarily, ""Countdown"" yearns to cash in on the success of ""Happy Death Day"" (2017). Instead, it qualifies as a low-budget, half-baked, mash-up of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Final Destination."" The rules that regulate the eponymous app are simple but effective. Once the app displays your death date, you cannot take evasive action without violating the app's terms and conditions. Bloodthirsty gorehounds may shrink from this sanitary PG-13 rated potboiler which makes both its homicides and hysterics appear immaculate. Some film critics have slammed the subplots as superfluous. Actually, the subplots are integrated seamlessly into the storyline. The most important subplot concerns a #MeToo sexual predator. Another involves a romance between our Caucasian heroine and an agile African American similarly distressed by the Countdown app. Ironically, for a film aimed at the 'under-twenty crowd,' the most interesting character is the dishonest, middle-aged cell phone tech. Unfortunately, the girls and guys menaced by this evil app are pretty bland.
""Countdown"" starts ticking when teens at a party hear about a provocative app and ponder its merits. Predictably, the lure of mortality arouses their curiosity. Several download the app. Some are assured of long life, while others are due to die sooner than later. When Courtney (Anne Winters of ""Fatal Instinct"") realizes she doesn't have long to live, she snubs her inebriated boyfriend, Evan (Dillon Lane of ""Boogeyman Pop""), when he offers her a ride home. Heading home alone on foot, she survives several false alarms with sinister strangers out strolling after dark, too. Eventually, she reaches home and drops her keys in a frenzy to get inside. Courtney cannot shake her paranoia. Suffice to say, when death comes, neither she nor we are prepared for her abrupt departure. Basically, Courtney condemned herself when she chose to walk instead of ride with Evan. She violated the terms and conditions of the app when she tried to outfox fate. Everybody who dies in ""Countdown"" makes Courtney's mistake. Mind you, the outlandish idea that a supernatural entity chronicles a person's fate by means of a cell phone app is utter nonsense.After this pathetic prologue, writer & director Justin Dec embarks on the main plot. Quinn Harris (Elizabeth Lail of TV's ""Once Upon a Time"") deals with the death of her mom, her younger sister's alienation, and her new duties as a hospital nurse. She also encounters a lecherous physician, Dr. Sullivan (Peter Facinelli of ""Twilight""), who cannot keep his hands off her. This subplot is woven into the main plot because the app guaranteed Sullivan a longer life. Later, Quinn loads the Countdown app on her phone after she befriends Courtney's depressed boyfriend Evan who is scheduled for surgery at the hospital. Now, she regrets adding the obnoxious app. Furthermore, its digital clock illuminates her phone with years, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and then a ghastly laugh ensues like an eerie witch's cackle. The infamous app allots her three days to live! Smashing her cell phone, Quinn goes out and buys a brand new one. The Countdown app pops up on it, too! Later, she pays an unscrupulous phone tech, Derek (Tom Segura of ""Instant Family""), to liquidate the app. Meantime, Quinn meets a young African American jock, Matt Monroe (Jordan Calloway of TV's ""Riverdale""), who has been suffering similar woes with the Countdown app on his phone. Like Courtney, he sees his dead brother during hallucinatory episodes. Back at the hospital, Quinn struggles to allay Evan's fears not only about the Countdown app but also about his surgery. Guess who inexplicably takes a swan dive into a stairwell against his will?If you crave horror movies, nothing about ""Countdown"" is bloodcurdling, despite its plethora of competently orchestrated jump scares. The demoniac influence behind the app that takes people down when they violate its bizarre user agreement resembles a man in a cheap Halloween costume. If ""Countdown"" contains a message, reviewing the user terms and conditions agreement before you commit might save you headaches. Inevitably, Quinn and Matt resort to a Catholic priest, Father John (P.J. Byrne of ""Rampage""), who is obsessed with demonology. Father John compares the evil in the app to a scroll of numbers entrusted to an ancient gypsy and contends the Devil forged it! Sprinkling salt in a pentagram at the church, they stand in its ring, but this elaborate ritual fails to neutralize the malevolence. Instead, they realize they must undermine the app according to its user agreement. The subplot involving Dr. Sullivan takes on greater relevance! Meantime, Father John provides some minimal comic relief with his geeky knowledge of demons, but his character lacks the pungency of the cell phone tech. Various demons and hallucinations appear with regularity throughout ""Countdown,"" but nothing in this gobbledygook should induce you to leave your lights on after dark.",Countdown

COUNTDOWN singles out America's ubiquitous Death Cult, which currently has the ""Final Say"" on anything bouncing around the USA's Injustice Branch of Government, as these perfidious Roman demons exercise a stranglehold with their SIX seats on the SCOTUS. This film COUNTDOWN presents ""Dr. Sullivan"" as a typically deplorable Pachyderm Party SCOTUS pick--a confident, self-assured, brash, brassy, brazen glib liar, secure in the knowledge that he can reduce each incident of his ACCE$$ H0LLYW00D-tape-style serial groping to a ""He said, she said"" farce no matter how many Coke cans he's despoiled with his Private Fiber.

9,view_and_review,Killer App,8,27 October 2019,"There are good apps, bad apps, and then there are killer apps. Now, a killer app among most people means that it is an extremely good app. In the movie Countdown the term killer app takes on a literal meaning.OK, that's not entirely true.The app called Countdown only gives you a countdown timer until your death--it doesn't actually do the killing. So, all it's doing is telling the lucky or fatally unlucky person the date and time of his/her death. If you happen to alter your course of action to avoid the death causing scenario (for instance you don't take that flight to Vegas because you're scheduled to die on that flight) then the app sends its demonic goon to take care of you.The movie gets right into nitty gritty which I appreciate. And they didn't just do an opening teaser with a long hiatus before returning to the action. From begin to end the characters were trying to outrun death. No one denied the seriousness of the app which made it more compelling to watch.I liked the blend of scares, humor, and drama. It was an established concept with the latest update. Perhaps if they all read the user agreement they could've avoided dealing with a demon.Who am I kidding, no one's going to start reading licensing agreements no matter what the consequences.",Countdown
10,neil-476,Quite nicely done,7,28 October 2019,"Young people are downloading an app called Countdown which purports to show how much life you have left (and counting). We find out early on that it actually works, and is driven by something sinister and supernatural. Newly qualified nurse Quinn downloads it, as does her angry teen sister, and she is horrified to see the two of them only have a couple of days to live, especially once she realises that the app works. Is there a way to avert their fate?The engine of this horror movie is similar to the Final Destination films - is it possible to avert a predetermined fate? - but is executed very differently.There isn't much in the way of graphic violence and gore, but there is a nicely constructed plot, some likeable characters, some backstory which informs the plot, and some genuinely creepy atmosphere.There is also some very welcome humour, centring around two characters in particular and, thankfully, the humour is character-related, and far from out of place.I can't say I was ever scared, but this was a good idea, well executed by writer/director Jestin Dec.",Countdown

But you also have alot of people that liked it, me included, as for me the movie has constant suspense, pretty good horror scenes, and the cast wasn't bad at all.

12,FeastMode,amazingly awesomely terrible... HILARIOCITY,1,10 May 2020,"I was laughing in the first 5 minutes of the movie. that's just ridiculous. how can you lose me that fast. i'm very lenient and open minded when i start a movie, i always give it the benefit of the doubt. but right away. it was BAD.the dialogue and editing were noticeably horrendous. IMMEDIATELY. there was so much to make fun of. IMMEDIATELY. I will name few that are not spoilers, all from the first 15 minutes of the movie. (1) a girl fills up water from the bathroom faucet in her home, and the water in the glass is completely foggy and looks disgusting. what? (2) the clock makes no sense, it jumped 7 seconds in 35 seconds of real time, i went back and checked. (3) a nurse is injecting a patient with an empty syringe. with an empty syringe. with an empty syringe. i was so astonished. worst part is, if it was completely empty you probably wouldn't notice, assuming it's a clear liquid. but there were a few drops in there, so you could clearly tell it was empty. just wow.most of the characters in this movie seemed like parodies of themselves. some of the most absurd moments come from this.there were two characters that were legitimately funny, and a few cool ideas, but there was too much dumbness for me to give this a 2/10. Hilariocity scale 8/10 (i'm including the intentional humor, i was going to give it a 7/10 because those moments weren't bad, but they made me laugh and added to my enjoyment of the rest of this mess) (1 viewing, 5/9/2020)",Countdown

16,cruise01,Similar to Final Destination with a technology spin on the concept.,6,23 January 2020,"Countdown (3 out of 5 stars).Countdown is a decent supernatural horror film that takes an interesting spin with the modern technology and death. Kind of reminds me of Final Destination on how death goes after the people who are suppose to be dead. Countdown adds the interesting spin of a countdown death app. Which people can download on their smart phones to see how long they would have to live. Some will live 80 or so years. While some will only have a day or two. When the countdown is up, some ghostly or death looking figure chases them down and kills them.The plot follows nurse Quinn (Elizabeth Lail) who downloaded the app. Only to find out, she has two days to live. Thinking it is some stupid app. She reads about it after a couple of teenagers have been reported dead after using the app. She starts experiencing supernatural delusions with some death figure that's watching her. She is trying to break the curse to stop the countdown and escape from this supernatural figure.The plot is decent. The plot messes with the idea that every character has a certain fate. And the countdown changes it to a different course. Either someone was suppose to be killed in an car accident but they avoided getting in the car. Which they will die in a different fate. Quinn is still struggling about loss within the family. Which her and her sister Jordan (Talitha Bateman) are in a struggling family drama. Quinn gets company who is facing the same conflict with the app, Matt (Jordan Calloway) who joins her in trying to break this curse.The direction does have a few creepy moments like being followed by some shadow figure. Or some jump at the screen scares. I did not find the movie to be at all scary. It was entertaining and thrilling but lacking the scares.The cast ensemble was okay as well. Elizabeth Lail gave it her best as a struggling nurse. After being threatened with her job cause the Doctor played by Peter Facinelli is upset that she does not want to sleep with him. So he filed a complaint about harassment against her. Jordan Calloway and Talitha Bateman were both okay as their characters. P.J. Byrne playing Father John was cheesy as the character. Who is trying to make the father character cool with his hip hop attitude and easily obsessed with the supernatural world.Overall, Countdown is an okay film. It is entertaining and thrilling. The plot is okay. The direction lacked scares and has the typical clichés for a horror film.",Countdown

21,jtindahouse,"A very flawed film, but I had trouble hating it",6,2 March 2020,"The opening scene in 'Countdown' is really good. The reason it is really good is because there is still a world of possibilities. Everything is still on the table. So we suspensefully wait to see what will become of this intriguing situation that has presented itself. After that the movie peters out quite profusely. 'Countdown' gave me 'Final Destination' vibes, but lacked the one thing that made 'Final Destination' so great which was the creativity in the deaths. If this film had gone more along that route it could have been something great. The demon route was the wrong path to take in my humble opinion.I can't tell you exactly why, but I didn't hate this film. I probably should've, but something about it kept me engaged and even though I knew it was highly flawed I was willing to forgive those things and just enjoy the ride. I think a big part of that came down to Elizabeth Lail. I really liked her in 'You' and now again here I find her a very likeable actress to watch. Also there were two side characters in the film, each who get a couple of scenes, that were genuinely hilarious. Humour in horror movies can take you out of the moment, but nothing in this movie was scary anyway so I was able just to appreciate the jokes.The thing that bothered me most about this movie was that it never even bothers to try and explain itself. There is just an app, that does what it does, accept it audience. Also I loved the addition to the film that the demon needed to scare/torment you up until you die because... movie has to movie I guess. As I said I had a hard time hating this film, but I'm also happy to state that it wasn't anywhere near as good as it could have been and for that reason is hard to recommend.",Countdown

23,stevendbeard,Descent Horror Film,6,28 October 2019,"I saw ""Countdown"", starring Elizabeth Lail-Once Upon a Time_tv, Unintended; Jordan Calloway-Riverdale_tv, Black Lightning_tv; P. J. Byrne-Big Little Lies_tv, Black Lightning_tv and Peter Facinelli-Supergirl_tv, Glee_tv.
This is a young adult horror movie about a phone app that predicts your exact time of death. The app is called 'Countdown' and once it is installed on your phone, it does not go away-it can't be deleted-until the countdown reaches zero. Elizabeth, a nurse, is at a party when she first hears about the app and of course, puts it on her phone, like everyone else at the party does. Most of the people are happy with their predictions, saying that they will live to be 80 or 90 years old, but not Elizabeth. Hers says she only has 3 days. Jordan is a fellow countdown app player and meets Elizabeth at a phone store-both are trying to get new phones but that doesn't work because the app just reappears on their new phones. Peter plays the chief doctor at Elizabeth's job and P. J. is a priest that Elizabeth & Jordan consult with about the countdown app when all else fails.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for terror, violence, bloody images, language and sexual situations-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.
It's a descent horror film with nice looking actors. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.",Countdown

It's not One Missed Call bad so it's got that going for it. The film was solid but some of the stupid things the characters did didn't make any sense. It's 2019 and writers should know better.

26,kluseba,An entertaining horror flick on the pulse of time,7,6 November 2019,"Countdown is an entertaining horror movie that is best enjoyed with some friends around Halloween. The film revolves around a cell phone application that predicts when a person is going to die. The story follows a young nurse who realizes she only has three days to live after downloading the application. She doesn't take the application seriously until one of her patients who had also downloaded it dies under mysterious circumstances. The young nurse starts investigating in order to bring the grisly series of deaths to an end.The movie convinces with some interesting plot elements on the pulse of time in form of the omnipresent impact of cell phones and its applications on our lives and a few sinister cases of sexual harassment in times of the Me Too movement. The film convinces with solid pace and entertains from start to finish without any unnecessary lengths. This flick has a few efficient jump scares in the middle section and convinces with an eventful finale.The film obviously also has some flaws most contemporary Hollywood movies suffer from. The story is shallow and simplistic. The characters are rather exchangeable and lack development and depth. The first third of the movie kicks off too smoothly and isn't truly scary. The film's predictable conclusion might be eventful but is ultimately everything but surprising. The film's final scene before the credits leaves room for a potential sequel in an extremely lazy way.You won't get profound cinema while watching Countdown but that couldn't have been expected anyway. What you will get however is a contemporary, entertaining and gripping horror movie. It's certainly better than Escape Room, Ready or Not and Truth or Dare. On the other side, it can't compete with more profound genre entries such as Mandy, The Wailing or Us. In the end, Countdown fulfills its expectations solidly but won't leave a deeper impression.",Countdown

A Communion Host chewing Demonologist uncovers a curse in source code but that's only the beginning of the struggle to defeat death.

It has an interesting concept, an app that can tell you when you'll die with unbelievable accuracy. That's fun, right? Unfortunately the concept, and the movie as a whole tends to fall apart if you look at it too hard.To its credit, I'm not sure how hard it's really trying. It at times seems to take itself seriously and then at other points not at all. The performances are all... There. Nothing really great to report. Oh, and there's a lesson about sexual harassment as well.At the end of the day, it's a blah horror flick.

It's true I would have liked a little more haunting/craziness to come into play to give you that true Halloween thriller you were looking for this late in the season. It's predictable tale, sort of hidden killer, and silliness that filed away the edge of the movie and thus takes away from the atmosphere they created. I felt that they could have just put this one onto a streaming site, but I'll give them props for trying to put their work out onto the screen. Yet, this film really boils down to being better suited at the home viewing then coming to theaters so hold out until the release if you can. As such, my scores are:Horror/Thriller: 6.0

While bleak, it was simply a cheap & fun way to scare your class mates with back in the day.But in this film, a popular Smart Phone App that has recently come onto the App Market, Countdown IS very real, & for those who only have days, hours or even minutes to live, their demises actually happen!!After a young nurse downloads the App she finds out she's only got 3 days to live! So with the help of other friends & a priest who specialises in demonic spirits, she tries to find a way to break the curse of the Killer App!I found the film to be quite dark & sinister! It really did remind me of Final Destination quite a lot. The deaths, while not gory or bloody, were sinister enough & the visuals of the Grim Reaper were also impressive. The film does lack in the body count department, but the edge-of-your-seat thriller plot makes up for that.The films concept is unique & really appeals to the youth of today in the digital age in finding new ways to scare you! This film also poses the question of what if? Or would you? Want to know when you're going to die? Or would you want to know how long you have to live? It's the kind of question we all wonder from time to time... like asking if there was a book about yourself, would you read to the end sort of thing...!Overall a Final Destination meets Unfriended type film!9/10",Countdown

[+33%],3,12 January 2020,"An uninteresting mish-mash of various horror flicks (such as Happy Death Day, The Final Destination, It Follows, and many more) is what Countdown turns out to be. It picks a contemporary setting, features an array of characters who feel guilty about the death of a family member, repetitive jump-scares, a sexual harassment angle (added for relevance), comedy that doesn't blend well with the storyline, and mediocre performances.The whole concept of an app ominously telling you when exactly you'd die is explored in the laziest way possible in Countdown. Even character development is pretty abysmal. For a film that only runs for 90 minutes, it honestly felt like a lot more. The climax is the bad cherry atop the tasteless cake. You can skip this movie and you wouldn't be missing out on much.",Countdown
38,Abdulxoxo,it's entertaining all right,7,24 December 2020,"Bit weak on the narrative front, but I don't think anyone was expecting award-winning material here. The concept, while it's derivative, it has a cool spin on it that makes it refreshing for a modem horror movie. The cast performances are good: Elizabeth Lail looks good and acted nicely in the lead role. The blending of comedy with horror works well. Tho, I'm not a fan of the subplot involving the doctor, it felt out of place and the movie relies on jump scares to deliver its scare but only few are actually effective.

The acting was good especially the actor who plays Quinn and I like all the characters: the nerdy priest who's very interested in demons, the cell phone guy, the sisters. It took a very unexpected turn for me. I didn't expect it to become a curse and a demon thing. The priest tried to save the man by gathering them within a pentagram drawn with salt but the demon was using the vision of their dead beloved ones to lure them and he died by getting stuck between a tree and a car. Quinn wanted to kill the rapist doctor in the closed wing of the hospital to break the curse but she couldn't so she injected morphine to herself to save her sister. Her sister saw the substance and where to inject it to revive her and did it accordingly (Fear Street anyone?) and she was alive again.

43,Stephen_A_Abell,A Horror Film To Remind You To ALWAYS Read The T&C's...,7,4 May 2020,"I honestly wasn't looking forward to watching this film. ""There's An App For That"" horror movies have been dire, to say the least. However, the trailer looked good and the story synopsis had piqued my curiosity. So, with a little trepidation, I sat down and hit play.I am so glad I did. ""Countdown"" gave me an hour and a half of tense enjoyment. Finally, a writer and director who can produce a ""Possessed App"" story. In truth, it's a cursed app, but, hey, there is a demon tormenting the souls of the soon to be departed... should they try to live past their death-date.Writer and director, Justin Dec, uses one of the most fundamental questions humans ponder. After the meaning of life (which is forty-two, by the way), our minds trip on about our inevitable death. Nobody wants to die too soon, most of us want to live a good long time - some even want to live forever (silly buggers). Periodically, our minds consider how and when you'll die. Now imagine an app that can answer one of those questions for you. Better yet, it gives you a countdown clock on your phone. Awesome, yeah? Now you can plan everything out to your supreme satisfaction. Unless the app states you only have a few hours or days left to live. What do you do then?In the case of this story, you panic and run around, like a chicken who knows its head is gonna be chopped off, trying to find a solution. A way to cheat death.Dec is creative with his story. He doesn't take the straightforward approach. He adds a particularly nice twist. An extra mythological fable of a Prince cursed by a Gypsy Woman. It's this tale that lays the basis for ""Countdown.""Dec's inventiveness doesn't halt at the story. No! He brings some wonderful ideas into the film. He is great at using natural light and shadow to build a tense and eerie atmosphere. There are times I could feel the goosebumps rising. One of my favourite sequences is the opening one. This drops the audience straight into the action and fills them with foreboding.Even as we watch a group of cheerful teens partying and having fun, one of them unwittingly downloads the Countdown app, you'll find you're already muttering, ""Don't install it... Don't do it... Don't open it..."" But of course, they do. Happy to find she'll have a long and prosperous life, she urges her friends to install the app. She even turns Countdown into a drinking game. Unfortunately, not everyone receives excellent news. Courtney only has a few hours left to live.At the end of the night, she refuses a lift from her drunk boyfriend. The app notifies her she's broken the agreement. From this moment on, things get eerier. She notes shadows getting darker. Strangers following her. And bizarre noises surround her. But the best bit is the Ominous form that appears before her. I saw the figure, and it was tall, dark, and scary... However, the shape is just a pile of discarded rubbish. I'd love to buy the person who created this ""body"" a drink. You give me hope for imagination. Thank you.Similar clever effects litter the film, all of which add to the storytelling and the power of the movie. Marvellous work.The acting too is above par. It's not stellar or out of this world, but the cast is enjoyable in their roles. Though everybody is equivalent in their acting skills, two characters stand out. This is because of their personas and the comedic element both possess. Tom Segura plays Deric and is perfect in the sarcastic tech-guy role. While P. J. Byrne adds a wonderful, over-joyful, and dagnabbit too happy Father John. This is one priest whose sermon we wouldn't fall asleep through.Thanks to Father John and Deric, I'll be enjoying this movie again... ""Countdown"" didn't land in my Guilty Pleasures list. But came close. If you're a horror fan and a techie, this film is for you. If you're a newbie to the horror genre, then this flick is a brilliant place to start. And if you're anybody in-between, then get a copy and enjoy. This film is worth at least one viewing, though you may go back to it later.Ratings:

46,hnt_dnl,"Entertaining ""Final Destination"" style horror",9,8 December 2020,"COUNTDOWN (2019) was in my queue of horror films to watch this year based on the trailer. I kind of forgot but got around to watching it recently and it was even better than I expected. Within a few minutes, I realized that it was a rehash of Final Destination, but as it turned out, a good one. I liked all the characters in this, although the little sister annoyed me at first. The lead actress Elizabeth Lail really drew me into the story. I was mixed on her before this as she was great on Once Upon a Time as Anna, but kind of meh in that summer slasher series on Freeform. She has a constant smiling face that's kind of distracting. It works for a fairy tale character like she played on OUAT, but not in most other things. She dialed it down here and played serious very well. I was more a fan of newcomer Jordan Calloway, a versatile actor playing Chuck on Riverdale and Khalil on Black Lightning, who played the love interest. But turns out I liked both Lail and Calloway equally in this and loved their easygoing rapport and chemistry.The creepy opening sequence of the college party set up the plot well as I recognized the actress who played Chloe from 13 Reasons Why. In fact, a part of me wanted it to stick with those characters. But once it shifted to Lail's character Quinn and the hospital ER where she is a nurse, it kept my interest, especially since it included a couple of more recognizable actors in veterans Tichina Arnold (as the head ER nurse) and Peter Facinelli (as the chief ER doctor). The subplot between Quinn and the doctor felt a bit tacked on and unnecessary, but the writers did try to tie it into the main plot. The main plot is this mysterious app called Countdown that was introduced at the aforementioned college party and the group thinks it's a silly app that randomly predicts when the user is going to die. The opening scene with ""Chloe"" establishes that the app is very real and it accurately calculates your exact time of death to the second. Soon after, our main character Quinn enters the picture as the victim's boyfriend, who is at the hospital after a car accident, says that the girl was meant to die in the accident. So Quinn and her colleagues download the app for fun, but she is the one who gets caught in it's web as the app predicts she will die in 2 days.The plot moves pretty quickly as Quinn obsesses over her fate. Soon after Matt (played by Calloway) enters the picture as he is fated to die around the same time as Quinn. The duo work together to try and beat death enlisting the help of a couple of scene-stealing hilarious characters Father John (P.J. Byrne also from Black Lightning) and especially tech expert Derek (Tom Segura in the best performance of the movie). The amount of levity in this film surprised me and the writers balanced the drama and humor very well. The scene were Derek threw nonstop sarcasm at the grumpy female customer was comedy gold. He was definitely the standout of this piece. Also, talented young actress Talitha Bateman (who played Quinn's said annoying sister that got better as the film progressed) of Annabelle Creation fame delivered a strong performance, too. Also, Matt Letscher of The Flash/New Adventures of Old Christine fame was a pleasant surprise as the girls' father. A cast of familiar faces that all worked well in an enjoyable thriller. I expect this movie to have a sequel based on the Final Destination theme and the reasonably positive reception. In fact, based on this strong introduction to this new style horror piece, I'm looking forward to it.",Countdown

A film about a group of young people who are being plagued by a haunted game of life or death. This month is the month where I'm always in the horror movie spirit, though this didn't seem like that type of film that would cure that horror itch. This film was bland, predictable, cliched, and just flat out bad.The film is about an app called ""Countdown"" which when downloaded onto your phone will tell you the exact moment when you will die. Some people have many years to live. For the protagonist of the film, she has only a few days an she must find a way to break the curse and defy her destined death. She pairs with another stranger who is in the exact same situation.This film is cliched and just felt very generic. The scares are predictable, unoriginal, and come exactly when you would expect them. I actually like the idea for the film. We live in a modern digital age where phones and social media runs supreme, so in theory its a good idea for this film. However, its dull in many passages. Also, they stuffed in a sexual harassment angle that felt off place, most likely to address current modern movements. Also, a love story arc with the two leads that absolutely made no sense with the duration of screen time they had together.Its just a mess of a film that is exactly what you expect. I kept checking my watch during the 90 minutes hoping for it to end as it is dull and the would be scares are so drawn out.

And the over abundance of unnecessary subplots ate away at the pacing of the film. I thought it was poorly handled. The only thing was the weird automatic death scenes of two of the victims. One just flew up in the air in the bathroom and one just fell down the stairs. If the death scenes were not automatic and more like real accidents or more thought out, I'd think it would be better.

Unfortunately, like cell phone batteries, it went flat pretty quickly.This is yet another film where the trailers make it much better than what it actually is, but of course, you never know till you watch it.The writing is pretty lame, the scares are practically non-existent, the characters are annoying for the most part and the #metoo side story line was a cringy attempt to make it more interesting.It failed.The story was all too predictable as well and it was full of the usual tropes (people seeing dead family members yet STILL doing what they want them to do). This is actually pretty lazy writing as it's unoriginal and boring. A bit like the whole film, in all honesty.There was some decent comic relief moments brought to us by cell phone shop manager Derek, and demonology expert Father John, but while relatively funny, these moments made this ""horror"" film less horrific as it was too frequent. I guess that's what happens when you make a ""horror"" a PG-13 and try to make more money by bringing it to a wider audience.It's not all doom and gloom though and there is the occasional creepy moment (the feet suddenly turning backwards was a really nice touch), but it's just a pity they were only occasional.Countdown is pretty much a 'watch and forget' kind of film as there's nothing really memorable about it. I don't regret giving it a go because it genuinely did seem like a good horror. Alas, it wasn't to be but it's definitely not the worst film I've seen.",Countdown
60,johannes2000-1,"Entertaining, non pretentious horror-flick.",8,5 December 2020,"I liked it. It's a non-pretentious, entertaining horror-flick with an original story, and (thanks to this story, where an app with a constantly ticking count-down plays a major part) a high pace. There are hints of the Final Destination movies (when death is coming for you, there's no chance of cheating it!), while the whole app-thing gives it a very nowadays vibe. The acting by especially Elizabeth Lailas is fine, and fortunately there's also a fair amount of humor in the movie (the over-enthusiastic priest for example). Absolutely recommended for an entertaining one and a half hour on some dreary afternoon.",Countdown
61,Java_Joe,Really missed the mark.,2,15 October 2020,"The basic idea behind this is actually quite good. There's an app you can download which will tell you how long you have to live. So a group of friends downloads it and one girl finds she only has 3 hours to live. When it's time to leave soon to die girl says she wants to walk home because she feels if her boyfriend drives her, that's how she's going to die.And yes, had she driven home with him he would have gotten into an accident and she'd be dead. So good news right? Nope because you can't cheat the app and if you don't die where you're scheduled to do so, something else is going to make sure you do and so she dies.A better movie could have used this moment to delve into the psychological horror knowing that you only have a limited amount of time to live. And it tries to but I never felt the characters truly felt afraid.In fact the movie could have done so much more. Like the app glitching and it randomly chooses a date 400 years in the future. Meaning the person will live for another 400 years. Still aging, still getting all the problems that come with old age but they're incapable of dying. Or a person trying to kill themselves early and having the curse, or whatever it was, turn on them and leave them lying broken and unable to move for days, months or even years. Or somebody hacks it to give them more time and the curse decides to mess with them and makes sure they're going to be in pain and misery for every second they tried to steal.In the end it just plays like your standard supernatural safe kind of horror. Nothing really new here. Just the framing device has changed.",Countdown
62,danielmanson,It's flawed. But it's okay,6,15 August 2020,"So this film from the off gave me Final Destination vibes. Not an issue as I love them films. But obviously this is more of a modern version.Just gonna jump into what annoyed me.
So, you actually see the character ""death"" and it makes the person who's about to die see unusual things. I didn't particularly like this element of the film, because there just wasn't a need for it. Just make them mysteriously die, I don't need to see some weird death like figure constantly. Ruined any mystery the film was going for and also ruined the realistic factor.Relating to ""death"", I am not 100% sure what it is still, I assume it's some sort of demon. But the only real explanation given was by a character who is there for a comedic element to the film. So you don't fully believe what he's saying.
But yeah being able to see these figures and so on in my eyes let it down for me and I felt like it was done so they could use cheap jump scares only.It's still a 6/10. Why? Because it's a simple plot to follow, definitely has it's scary moments and included some good acting from all involved. It's worth chucking on during a weekend evening or something.",Countdown

65,nikola17,so it's like Final Destination & Unfriended & The Ring with a Death Phone App,3,11 January 2020,"I know what directors what are they trying to do with a different idea with film it's like Final Destination but they know when they are going to die, but in Final Destination the characters don't see death coming but with this movie it's far too easy because someone already knows but they can't escape from it. i mean who in would upload a death app in everyone phone ? it's the Demon who can control time and use it on people phones but theirs scene where lead character tries to delete app but you can't so Especially that's like unfriended but not with the fact that they acknowledge that ""If you Hang up, you Die"" when lead character the lead girl tries to unfriended her dead friend Facebook account but could not do it but that's ghost or Demon whatever you wanna call it because they can do anything like you try to delete the app it won't delete that's how ghost or demons control the app. wouldn't the government or someone in politics get involved to ban the app or block it ? i mean it's totally stupid how everyone is doing it. so it's like the Ring without the video tape only with an app store AKA death app store.
story follows this lead girl Quinn Harris (Elizabeth Lail) who is a nurse at hospital she was a student nurse, and now she is a professional nurse everyone at work is talking about countdown the death App so she was to download it and she does download it and she doesn't read the user agreement and accept the terms and conditions before she Accept the app ? like she doesn't read it she doesn't read that agreement until like middle of movie with someone else phone, witch is funny how she risked a stupid thing without not reading it. so she download and it's stupid in every another horror movies where main girl or guy risk's something that they don't know and they just research it until theyfound it, it's something dangerous it reminds me off Gallows Act II where the girl did a charlie challenge until she did it and reads about everything she gets surprised something was bad going to happen like with this film, so ghost and demons are hunting her, the app keeps on ticking she got 2 days to live so she tries to break the phone damage it but phone is still on the phone doesn't die or battery because of death app. she goes at phone shop buy new phone. without countdown app and she gets new phone and app comes back ? so the app is basically won't let you go at all until ticking cock countdown goes Zero. this demon death app somehow got into every app store even if she gets new phone the app follows you a lot, so it's demon is attached to anyone who has app that can't break phone, or switch phones or do anything to get away withit. you have another character Matt Monroe (Jordan Calloway) who met her at phone store he download the app like her they both try to know how to solve the problem, like in one scene the guy who works at phone store goes behind technology app and sees all time limits of how long they are going to live he extended Quinn and her sister and Matt time limit to be 30 years or more to extended more years i like how you think in one scene of movie when you think they solved it and everything but it something else happens i like that idea the film keeps going on. a scene between Quinn and Matt have love interest slaright away all of a sudden shows up out of nowhere because his time is running out as well i thought he was going to live and then at end of movie their is love interest with Quinn and Matt. i thought end of day the film is average and it's not worth watching or me saying i want to see it again, but at least this film was eh nothing special, i like some of cool ideas in film but the film itself is more of time waster thank godness this is type of movie you see on Netflix not on cinemas because i thought this was burning time waster flick i thought it's dumb idea to make a film with a death app that is a tricking time death that tells you when your going to die, i thought in movie that people download it and they die i am like why would download the app in phone when people will die ? in phone app company who would expect that ? it feels like a someone made the app and upload it at app store that's what it feels like but the idea of countdown with death app is stupid idea it's trying to do Final Destination idea mixed with Ring and Unfriended i understand the director writers try to something different not to stupid horror film like with Truth or Dare like many more movies dumb horror films like that, for me i hated film i hated how characters made stupid decisions, i thought the death app idea for film and story was completely of stupid idea, i knew from trailer it didn't spoiled it for me it's like i know what's it's about, i hated ending it's not bad ending like you say screw this film. the film leaves a cliffhanger ending like you think it's what the heck but ending tells you it's getting sequel ? but it won't because movie flopped, it won't get sequel unless if it's direct to DVD type i reckon this is type of movie that could of made for Netflix or a Direct to DVD film, and yeah i know they to stole the idea character from Happy Death Day the lead actress who looks like another actress with Blonde hair Jessica Rothe in a different horror idea witch i thought this movie sucked, it's not boring i just thought the idea was stupid with death app that why people would download the app for knowing they will die but they risk it but everyone thought it was bullcrap but it wasn't people didn't know it's real. i thought their was inconsistencies or plot holes like who in earth made the app put it in app store ? what demons or ghost can get into getting into technology and make millions of death apps inapp store to kill a lot of people or if it's someone who is possessed by demon and made the app ? i mean it's stupid idea but i like some of ideas in film like bathroom scene, i like how main character is not idiot like all another characters did but i liked how she tries to do everything and many ways to get rid of app surprisingly likeable and intelligent main character not like girl in Gallows Act II. i thought acting was good not bad acting not terrible i seen worse acting, the weird sexual harassment subplot with Quinn and Dr. Sullivan was stupid he likes to sexual harassed and harasses other female staffmembers that he is a real freak. Quinn i am like that was stupid with her and him at end of film with her set up with him. Realizing that she could kill Sullivan and take the 57 years his Countdown app predicted for him ? so did make the app ? oh did he make the app ? was he connected to demon to make the app ? what i am saying when she Realized that Dr Sullivan has 57 years to live ? and to kill so she can have that time, was he behind all this death app ?
that left hole, see it will be stupid if in Story a Demon makes app with time limit and upload it at app store, it will be stupid if that happened in film in mystery background. i give it 3.10 because look it's bad movie and it's not truly worst film i have ever seen but it's really bad movie that i did not like it's just Lame and predictable film i have ever seen the film title countdown reminds me of song by Europe Final Countdown makes me wanna play that song rather then me watching this movie.",Countdown
66,TwistedContent,"Countdown, Shmountdown",4,14 January 2020,"The trailer was on the way to Generic city, the release and the ratings hitch-hiked a ride in the same direction & basically, any expectations were left on the floor. Despite all that, I have to say that... it's still a stinker, for the most part.This painfully familiar Hollywood-type horror has the basic ingredients for a decently looking, decently sounding and decently acted movie, as well as the horror elements to try and scare the thirteen year olds. To try. ""Countdown"" has been (generously) dipped in the holy pot of all mainstream horror cliché's & then dredged in a pile of every other routine story and/or character arc shticks. The concept at use here and its structure has been overused long ago & now it's awkwardly hidden behind the modern curtains, millennial culture, apps and the rest of the sauce. To 'spice it up', the filmmakers decided to shed a light on the issue / put in their analogy to the #MeToo movement as a subplot, which is fine, but that's all it is, a pushed-in message.Naturally, the budget of six and a half millions provided decent enough cinematography and special effects (albeit not much of them). The evil entity had ""The Nun"" eyes and was, well, kinda wack. The cast battled through the movie doing their best & there's nothing much more I can add.A sequel was teased at the very end (duh), but, to steal a line, ""this app isn't exactly begging for an upgrade"". I'm sure ""Countdown"" passes as an at least an average type of horror entertainment among the mainstream & the younger audiences, but you better believe me it's bland, boring, predictable and very, very uninspiring.

director: Justin Dec
starring: Elizabeth Leil,Jordan Calloway,Talitha Eliana Bateman,Peter Facinelli etc.overall rating 54/100Countdown follows the story of Quinn Harris ( Elizabeth Leil) when she discovers from friends about an app that tells you when you are going to die. Which She doesn't believe,but when people are starting to die when the time hits 0 its up to her and some help along the way in order to put a stop to the curse. Countdown was an interesting idea but not executed well at all. It was a mess but an entertaining one.First of all the overall plot of an app that tell you when you are going to die is interesting. The film executed well how people would react to an app like this existing which is obviously that its ridiculous. But as soon as people were dieing more frequently it became apparent the app was real. Now to think that if this concept was actually real is a terrifying thought. If you forget about the execution of it the idea is clever.Next the film did have a tense tone and well executed jumpscares for some of the film. When the film did try and be scary it executed very well. Depsite the very small budget they manage to get great character design for the demon which looked pretty scary. And the jumpscares were executed well and they managed to get under your skin on a few occasions as well i wish this had been more consistent which we will get into but it was well done.My biggest negatives for the film would be its tonal inconsistencies caused by its terrible script. This film had one of the worst scripts i have ever heard. They made the characters say the most dumb and stupid lines you can think of. It made my toes curl having lines like game of thrones big and hallelujah high five. It just made the film unnecessarily funny when it areally shouldn't of been and as the film progressed it turned more into a comedy.However the lead performance from Elizabeth Leil was good considering the content she was given. She did a solid and believable performance at showing her fear and her disconnection with her family. I also liked how caring her character was with her patients at the hospital. And there was some attempts at character development with her character as well. The fact that she lost her connection with her dad and younger sister was an interesting concept to the movie. As due to her mothers death she grew distant when her younger sister the most which was a interesting and a well enough executed aspect of the film.However i have to say that the film had a random character was thrown in. The main plot of the film was following Quinns story. But then Jordan Calloways character was just thrown in randomly halfway through the film. This made the film lose its flow and made it the pacing and narrative very clunky for me. And this made me not connect with his character. And also the film really poorly executed sexual abuse as well. I felt like the scene involving Quinn (Elizabeth Leil) and Dr Sullivan (Peter Facinelli) was rushed and needed more time and attention on the emotional side effects to something as horrible as this happening. Which countdown didn't do so this should of been more developed on as it felt like it shouldn't of been part of the film.Next i thought the app built tension and the characters were relatable. A lot of the characters reactions to the app at first and then the sudden realisation of the reality of the situation was well executed with each character. And there reactions was more like what everyone else watching would be. And i really enjoyed the fact that the demon went largely went after the people who went against what should of been there death. a lot of the characters were actually clever and did things like not getting into a car with a drunk person so this i found one of the most interesting parts of the film.And my final positive would be that the final act was very entertaining. At least the film went out and a sort of high note . With the final act battle between the demon and the main characters. And also there was a great and satisfying final resolution to the conflict between Quinn and Dr Sullivan as well.However finally my biggest issue with the movie was the overall concept. Despite being an interesting plot. It just didn't connect with or make sense with a demon trying to kill people. I just thought that they could of went with something a lot more creative and believable within the film then an app telling you when you are going to die. Which lets be real here is silly as things can happen before the end of the countdown that are out of the characters control.Overall despite a solid lead performances. Well executed scares and and interesting concept. The film is weighed down by its terrible script poor execution of character arcs and plot points and a concept that just doesn't work.",Countdown

Most users see that they have years to live, but the Countdown app shows Quinn that they have less than three days to live. Quinn does not try to take the app seriously, but when Quin hears that the app was right with others, Quinn starts taking the app more seriously. Now she is trying to find a way to escape the app's fate.This film comes across as a new film from the Final Destination film series, but without the intended comic sides that came to the fore later in this film series. It is sometimes funny to laugh at this film because of the stupid way in which they have put together certain events. Unfortunately, this unintended humor disappears during the film as they try to bring out more about the killer app. All this information about the app is never really clear and seems to be constantly adapting. For example, at a moment it is no longer possible to clearly follow what makes the film lengthy rather than scary. That way you better watch one of the Final Destination films or just another good horror film.In the horror area, the film uses almost only simple jump scares, which you usually see coming. The film is also filled with clichés and events that have occurred in other better horror films before.The cast of the film also provides no special work. Most of the cast's actors are also more novice and TV actors, which can sometimes be seen in the way they act in this film.

This movie was no exception to being one of my faves of this genre. I noticed that it only had a 5.6 rating before I watched the film, but as I always do, I disregarded that and went for it anyways.
So glad I did. No, it wasn't perfect, and some of the acting was crappy, but all in all, it was entertaining and enjoyable. I actually jumped several times. I'm a fan of Elizabeth Lail from the series ""YOU"", which originally brought me to this movie, and as always, she was great as the lead. I love movies like this. Movies such as Final Destination and other movies in this category. Definitely worth the money to rent it, and do not listen to the negative reviews or people giving it a 1 star.

109,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Countdown to Your Final Destination,6,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Not scary enough or innovative enough in the horror genre.The Big Screen: Good humor and evokes stress throughout the movie.The Final Bill: Countdown is a stressful ordeal that provides you with familiar frights for a night in.-S2S5, 4, 3, 2, and welcome back to Stream to Big Screen! This week the clock ran out and we found ourselves at a premier showing of Countdown. Just in time for Halloween season, Countdown brings us a horror/thriller film with a familiar feel. Justin Dec both directed and wrote this money grab of a movie. Countdown follows Nurse Quinn, played by Elizabeth Lail, as she struggles with her own mortality due to a new popular app. The new app, countdown, is becoming very popular with people who are curious, jokingly or actually, about when they will die. Unbeknownst to those who accept the app, this is no joking matter. We follow Quinn as her time runs out.While Countdown has a nice contemporary and technological aspect, the movie keeps it old school evil as well. Similar to the reboot of Chucky, we get a new technology spin on a familiar horror storyline. This spin is both a positive and a negative. While we leave the movie appreciating the use of the app as a device, we also realize this is the same exact storyline as other horror movies. Picture a mixture of Final Destination, Truth or Dare, Ouija, and Lights Out. It's like Director Dec sat down and said, ""How can I direct a film that people feel they've already seen before but has a couple new pieces and people will pay for?""Honestly, the movie had a few eerie moments (jumps) throughout it but for some reason we felt left wanting. It felt as if I never got scared like I should've been. You know a movie isn't truly scary when you can walk out of the theater without watching behind you or staying out of the shadows. They cheated the audience out of the fright they deserved. Particularly in my theater, I felt the patrons were watching the movie as a team. We giggled at parts together. We whispered, ""don't turn around"" and ""if you don't run"" together. It felt like we were in our living room watching a horror movie marathon.Needless to say, this is a movie you can wait to see on a streaming service. This is the perfect movie to catch on FX near Halloween. Not because it's bad but because it's got enough humor to keep you entertained and not scary enough to ruin your evening. Catch Countdown when it hits any streaming service. You'll enjoy this movie if you pay for a rental or the cheapest possible matinee, but you'll truly enjoy this movie, if you don't pay for it.",Countdown
110,helenbassett,Halloween Countdown Film Review - Justin Dec Directs Elizabeth Lail Attempting To Cheat Death's Killer App - It Was Tough Getting That One Through Testing And Ready For Hallow,9,30 October 2019,"Interesting idea for Countdown; the app that tells you how long you are going to live. Enough time to get your affairs in order and enjoy your life. But for several young teens who find it when they think they're downloading a slimming app, Countdown is making up for lost time, and tells them when they are going to die. Courtney a young student played by Anne Winters gets a few hours, and wants to make them last. So rather than driving home with her drunk boyfriend, she walks. His resulting crash sees her seat crushed by a fallen true. But death gets her at exactly the same time anyway, as she violated the terms and conditions. And after injured boyfriend Evan played by Dillon Lane downloaded the app, he also gets a similar short expiry date. But rather than risking death's appointment on the hospital operating table, he decides to take the stairs. But the grim spectre of Courtney gets him first. Another terms and conditions violation.Justin Dec directs as the Countdown app downloads, and the devil is in the detail with the terms and conditions. Elizabeth Lail stars as Quinn a newly qualified nurse who spoke to Evan about the app, and his fears before the operation. And shares what he told her with her colleagues next day. So of course they all download it. Quinn's death date is in three days.After she declines to visit her mother's grave with her father and younger sister that weekend, Quinn also gets a terms and conditions violation. And her death date is speeded up. Evan also makes a visit. And Quinn is most definitely rattled, she's seeing things in the rear mirror, like the Grim Reaper, and only buying a new phone deletes the app. And then immediately downloads itself again. Tom Segura is the witty phone shop manager Derek. And what he doesn't know about phones... but he doesn't understand how the app downloaded itself on a new phone.Only Jordan Calloway's Matt understands, he heard her in the phone shop, he has the same app and his time is even shorter. Matt and Quinn need help. And Quinn's hospital has a resident priest. But of course he doesn't believe in demons. But might know someone who does.If it wasn't bad enough fighting evil, Peter Facinelli's friendly Dr Carlisle of Twilight is now touchy feely Dr Sullivan, who won't take no for an answer. But is pretty good at clearing up after himself, which sees Quinn suspended. Dr Sullivan may come in handy later though.While waiting in the hospital Matt also meets his own pre-death ghoul. Guilt over a past death is the trigger here. And the clock is still counting down.P.J. Byrne is the wacky Father John who does believe in demons and his library happens to have a book that describes a similar predicted death. Sounds like the Devil has gone digital. And maybe reading the terms and conditions might help them beat him. Luckily Quinn and Matt manage to persuade someone who deserves a quick death to download the app, and copy the terms and conditions. Then back to the phone shop and Derek, just off on a date, hacking into the app, and changing all their death dates, including Quinn's young sister Jordan. Although Derek's date has an unexpected ending!And when more ghouls cuddle up overnight the three race back to the church. Father John can read the latin words in the terms and conditions they show him, and he reasons if they can cheat the date by a second, it should break the curse. But the demon haunting Quinn, who looked like an extra from the original Star Wars, wants his pound of flesh.A 90 minute entertaining hoot for Halloween when all you want is a supernatural scare. Atmospheric cinematography by Maxime Alexandre who has a terrific Cv, adds to the creeps. And jump scares abound, I was amazed at the resulting shrieks and jumps from the audience who were having a great time. The seats shook! Great job Justin.",Countdown

The more I think about it, I think the only good thing about this was its production value, and it's sad when a horror film's budget is something to be excited for but there's just so many terrible modern films in this genre that look like class projects.

With aspects of Final Destination and Drag Me To Hell.No, technically it didn't make logical sense, but it was a fun 90 minute ride.

We didn't need the whole sexual harassment by a white male who has the others on the board agreeing with him...with only the black woman believing her. Do we really need the MeToo side story in this? Why is it necessary? Then the bad white man getting violent after Quinn hits his car. Then the Chivalrous and smart black man comes to save the day and to add, ""I'm going to die and don't mind taking a white person with me"". Like come on! Then goto a bar where a drunk moron talking about conspiracy theories is stupidly convinced to download an app...and you guessed it...he's white. Then the other nurse comes to Quinn and says she's had the sexual assault from the same doctor, they hug and say they will back eachother up.I'm so sick of this crap. I had to step away.

Unable to delete the app or destroy the phone, Quinn seeks help from a demon expert priest (lol) to save her life before the time runs out.Look... The movie wasn't amazing or scary to make me jump, but it also wasn't that bad where it became lame. I somewhat enjoyed it. It was a fun horror film. It was also nice to see Elizabeth Lail in the film after really enjoying her in the Netflix series 'YOU'.Some scenes I did eye roll a bit, cause you try put yourself in the situation and if the lights go out and you're the only one in a room, there's no way you go to investigate what something is.. you get the heck out of there.Horror fans will enjoy this, but you won't be scared to sleep at night, unless you scare super easily.",Countdown

It's a fun ride to take and an original concept...they even used one supernatural effect I'd actually never seen before in a bathroom scene, so that was cool. Had a few laughs (though one character feels shoved in for both comic relief and explication and epically fails at the former). The movie doesn't require its characters to act like idiots ""just because"" the movie has to happen, though of course they have to ""play ball"" at times like anyone in a horror movie does. Predicted the final five minutes, and most people good at paying attention to seemingly extraneous plot elements will likely be able to also, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the movie.

The story evoked the ""Final Destination"" movies with a side order of tech paranoia, a bit of well-placed comedy, and a hint of wry political commentary.

The one other movie with a just as bad ending They Reach was worse but not by much
_-----------------SPOILER-----------------------------
What look like was going to be kind of an original ending by not having plot armor for the main characters and having them die. Turned into cliched crap. The older sister figures out but she just has to kill herself before her little sister's time runs out before hers so she kills herself with a morphine overdose. If you see at the beginning of the movie a heroin addict was brought into the emergency room and they saved her with a Naloxone kit. So as you should guess she has it written on her arm the lock zone kit inject here so her little sister could take the syringe and inject it and she would live therefore technically beating the demon super super cheese if they had it where I thought it was going and she's going to kill the doctor who tried to rape her which would have been fine that I could have swallowed I'm going to leave it at that because I'm just too pissed at this ending.",Countdown
141,kmjnhh123,When App's Become Reality,5,12 November 2019,"First off i will say that apps like this do exist & they are completely fake & do not have any correlation to when you will actually die BUT this film proves that how addicted some people can get & that it will literally ruin their lives to a point where it starts to effect them & that may lead to things actually happening as they continue to believe something will happen, they mind will let things happen.The film its self is a fresh take on the app world & many other films about apps could be made regarding how we trust apps with our literal lives. The acting was actually pretty good on this film, there was not any AAA actors in this film but does that matter? There are jump scares through out the film so be warned, its not necessarily a scary film though, some mind find it scary but compared to actual horror films, this is different.It's typical that the main character falls in love with someone then he dies, like you know that is going to happen, so yea there is some cliches in the film. Also i haven't really sat down & watched the Final Destination films but i believe that them films & this film are like the ""Trying to cheat death"" type pf films? Just with a different skin over them, albeit it a modern one with technology.Overall you should give it a watch as theres not many films based on apps these days but probably going to be more common at some point.

If you can prove him a liar, you can break the curse.""Queen Harris. Working as an intern nurse in a hospital. And there were a few days left to complete Harris's intern course. Then she will be a registered nurse. She lives with her father and younger sister. Although the relationship between the two sisters is not so good. Queen feels guilty for her mother's death. And this guilt eats up her from the inside. One day, Quinn learned about an app from a hospital patient.Apps name - Countdown. The apps fix the death date of its user. Instinctively she installs the apps and launches the apps compliance with all conditions. Here comes the main part. The apps show that Queen will be able to live 2 days, 22 hours, 37 minutes, and 11 seconds only.As soon as she comes home with this mental stress, she had a quarrel with her sister Jordan. Queen became emotionally broken. She came to the hospital in the morning, finds out that the patient died and his apps timer became level zero. Her chest throbbed because of app activity. Meanwhile, Queen lost her temper when Dr. Sullivan behaves indecently. For this Sullivan, she lost her job.She desperately tried to leave off the apps. She changes her mobile and others but the apps were still on. Every now and then strange thing floated before her eyes. At this crucial moment, she got acquainted with Matt. Matt has the same problems. After trying a lot together, they finally know that this is a curse. But before findings out a way out of this curse, Queen finds out that her sister Jordan has only 4 hours to live.The countdown movie is based on such an interesting story. It was a good start. Though there's no vibe of horror, but there's a creepy feeling throughout the movie. I liked several scenes very much. But still, in the end, the movie wasn't finished properly. The plot of the story is very interesting. But maybe they didn't know what to do after the ending of the first half. And that's why they blend the story with myth.

In this movie, there's a scene where the black guy comes up to an accident caused by the girl, trying to whitekight for her he tells a white guy, ""I just found out I'm gonna die, and maybe I feel like taking a white man with me.""
Imagine. Imagine just for one second if a white character said that to a black character. If you see nothing wrong with that, you are what's wrong with today's world. And don't come at me thinking I'm some angry white boy. I am not white. What I am is tired of this racism that goes unchecked because ""you can't be racist towards white people."" It is absolutely moronic and infuriating that a line like that makes it through and no one bats an eye.Anyway. The movie itself is pretty decent. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

Not only did he show up, he showed up and stole the scene, in a movie which has actually been pretty damn entertaining so far! The more I think about it, I'm totally engrossed right now. Yes, it's not Scorsese, but it's not pretending to be.

PG 13 horror movies tend to be mediocre but #Countdown was really good. A bit more to the plot than the trailers implied. Witty (snarky) dialogue and a great group of unknowns, with two great veterans dropped into the mix, Tichina Arnold and Peter Facinelli, whom I didn't even know were in the film. As a teen movie, everyone is gorgeous *eye candy* but the twist in the movie gave it more depth than anticipated. Two peripheral characters added an unexpected comic appeal for a ""horror"" movie. I think the Happy Death Day franchise has spun off a new genre ""com-horror"" maybe? Anyway, on a regular movie scale this is maybe a 7? but for the PG 13 horror rankings, a solid 9. Great date movie, as there is no nudity, or a movie to see with a group of friends for laughs and jump scares.",Countdown

One person though figures out that it's some sort of curse that actually gives away a real-timed death clock that changes with whatever event happens to change the course of life before death.Ultimately, the concept isn't too bad and the sequence of events goes down just as you'd expect.

228,trailer_trashed89,Cheap knock off of Final Destination,5,27 October 2019,"WOW! So I have always had a penchant for really tacky and bad horror movies. They always have some kind of redeeming quality, even if it is how hilariously bad they are. Sadly, this one had no redeeming quality...at all!This film centres around the idea of a cursed app (yes really.) If you download the app, it tells you how long you have to live. However once the timer runs out, you start to be stalked by a grim reaper looking dude and ghosts of dead friends and relatives right up until... you die. And how do you beat this terrible evil? By beating death and staying alive longer than your timer, or if someone dies BEFORE their timer runs out. Are you seeing the similarities to Final Destination yet? Cheating Death etc. etc.So besides that fact that this story has been done, a lot, and not always in the most successful and enjoyable way, what else is there to say about this film? Well, none of it is memorable. The scenes that are supposed to be emotional, just fall flat. You don't know or care enough about any of the characters to make these scenes carry any emotional weight. You find out very little about anyone in the film at all really, they are all very shallow. The Mobile Phone Sales Guy is probably the character in the film with the most personality and he is on screen for approximately 3 mins.And can we talk about the ending? So yes, Peter Faccinelli's character was a complete a**hole, and really did deserve to be hit with that tire iron, but he is literally there to serve the ending of the film, he serves no other purpose at all, another wasted character. And then the ambiguousness f the final moments of the film where it looks like they are hoping to hold the door open for a sequel? Please God no!I can't tell if this is meant to be a cautionary tale about reading the terms and conditions or if someone genuinely thought this idea was going to do well, but sadly neither are true and this whole film was a disaster.",Countdown
229,GlarkCable,Definitely flawed but not completely awful,6,24 October 2019,"What I liked:
interesting, original concept that feels strangely applicable to our modern society. Let's be honest: if we could really download an app like this, most people would.decent acting.surprisingly likeable and intelligent main character, which is kind of refreshing in this genre.not particularly scary to me but probably pretty creepy to someone who scares easily. Which is a good thing.no inconsistencies or plot holes I could find.What I didn't like:
unnecessary romance is unnecessary.the comic relief priest.the weird sexual harassment subplot. I feel like they could've done without.bit predictable at times, clichés throughout.a couple of dumb jump scares.
Overall not a terrible experience. Probably don't care to watch it again but if you're in the mood for a fun horror flick this'll do just fine.",Countdown

It drives me nuts when writers can't use a little imagination to get us to where they want us to be. Instead they just make their characters do the dumbest things possible no matter how intelligent and streetwise they seem.

273,DoomsdayDevice,Another trendy waste of a Thursday night.,3,6 March 2020,"I watched the first half of this film last (Thursday) night and I turned it off about 40 minutes in. A few hours later I ended up coming back to it because i would rather subject myself to being bored with a few spare laughs and things to gawk at and make fun of than being bored alone in my mothers basement.This movie does not start nor end strong at all. In short- this movie is just another trendy and uninspired PG-13 horror cash-grab geared towards a audience of the new generation with ""tech"" being incorporated into the ""horror"" (see movies like #horror, friend request, etc.) This movie just happened to get a theatrical release. It was apparent from the trailers and now that ive seen it i can confirm that it is not worth your money, especially not the 20.00$ i spent on the DVD. Why is it not worth a 20 dollar bill?The plot is predictable and at some points borderline nonsensical. Its like characters are introduced in a way that their fate is set in stone as soon as they are seen on screen. My main problem is that this isn't handled with any subtlety at all.>Guy in car will get in an accident
>Weird boyfriend character that doesn't forward the plot whatsoever
> CRaaaZY church guy who will TOOTally not become a plot device in any way.Anyway, the main dynamic between characters which i would expect is the family dynamic is boring and not really necessary. What repercussions does this dynamic have by the resolution of the film? The main character and her sibling has a better relationship now? What about this story had an affect on this family?The way the demon works is inconsistent at best. Theres a scene where the male character is like crying because he stole is dying brothers toy as a kid and this is later reincorporated with the demon basically luring him to be killed because of his past. The problem is, that scene is the stupidest scene in the movie and it didn't make me feel bad for him or anything because its such a stupid like ""mental burden"" situation. Could they not have a better reason for him to feel guilty over his dead brother? Oh wait, this is a PG-13 they cant take any risks....The demon does this sort of thing multiple times in the movie and in a scene they even explain that its feeding on these peoples emotional baggage but yet characters STILL fall for it! ""Yeah I just saw this demon but oh look its my mother thats been dead for years I guess thats uh actually her DUURRR wah mommmy i wish u were alive"" Honestly, I expected it to be this way. What makes you think this movie thats going to make 47,000,000$ worldwide would put the slightest amount of thought into writing? ""Well if its too hard to think about subtle ways the demon could work maybe just write in a few jump-scares so the audience doesn't think about it"" The only way this movie works is if you shut your brain off. People can do that and enjoy a movie, thats fine. But this film treats its audience as if they dont have a brain in the first place.The acting all around was fine. The only two I really couldn't stand where the male protagonist and the little sibling. The little girl wasn't bad at first but as the movie went on the just got worse and worse. The dude was just cardboard the whole way through. Other than that the acting wasn't anything to complain about.But the special effects however ARE something I can complain about. This is another horror movie that is ""Full of jump scares"" (which is advertised on the back of the box) and quite honestly there are only a few i would even label as jump scares. Most of them are just ""Fooled ya, its actually the monster!"" moments that didn't even make me jump. As to be expected, no tension, no atmosphere. Just scared looking dudes and loud noises. The death scenes where also lame. The only one with a little creativity behind it (the one with the hospital staircase) is ruined by a lame special effect that just looks plain stupid when you see it for more than 4 seconds accompanied by an equally lame but yet one of the better jump scares.Really the only thing i can say i liked about this movie is the demons character design, it would have been creepier if used in a more subtle way and yes it does look a bit generic but hey, its a good design and costume either way. Would probably see it at some horror convention in New Jersey or something.This film also made me like Tom Segura way less than I usually do. I hate to say it but it really feels like he was there for a paycheck and my statement is only proved by the credits scene. How does he die when his countdown had like 30 years left? Did the director just want to scene where Tom Segura's character dies because hes Tom Segura? I feel like it was in the credits only because the director had no where else to put it.Also, this soundtrack is literally a spotify playlist featuring songs such as ""Panini"" by Little Nasty X. So with that, the plot, the gimmick and the date this was released, tell me, who was this film aggressively marketed to? Who was this film made for? It was made for teenagers who are probably too busy making out to pay attention to the movie.
And with that, the comedy angle this movie tries to take on usually falls flat on its face. The writing just isn't good enough to be genuinely funny. Hmm....maybe thats why they cast Tom Segura...This film was genuinely hilariously bad at times. Had a few good laughs.
Please do not see this movie. If nobody watches it then maybe we'll send the right message and get more substance out of our horror cinema! We talk with our wallets!",Countdown

On the other hand it makes sense since she didn't really sacrifice herself, because she never died and therefore the entire plan of breaking the Devils curse with someone dying earlier than planed is incomplete.Over all it was a entertaining movie -> +5 points

I think however the characters found out stuff that was too intelligent for them. I love how there was a biblical story with a scroll of the exact same format as the app itself, as it's clearly not a true story and it had to be an old Gypsy lady who told the prince in the story when he was going to die. Also I was bemused by the comment from the Matt, one of the protagonists, who was black. He threatened the white guy saying something along the lines of 'I'd be happy to take a white guy with me' (referring to killing the white guy). This mention of race was really unnecessary and quite a double standard, as a much stronger reaction would have ensued, had it been made the other way towards the black guy (e.g. 'I'd be happy to take a black guy with me') - my advice to the filmmakers would be: stop being 'woke' and encouraging double standards.

In particular the salt circle scene made me both laugh and angry at how stupid these people are. It clearly worked, the demon couldn't get to them. The only reason it failed is because they all just decided to run out of it again. I could understand them doing this the first time because one of them got tricked to leave it. But only one of them died, so the other two characters should be able to figure out to just not leave the circle, no matter what. But they don't even consider it, they just completely leave that idea for absolutely no reason.I'm not very good at explaining excactly what about this movie was so funny to me, but just trust me when I say this movie is very bad, but it's so bad it funny.

Unfortunately it was rather predictable.Too predictable...The first 30 minutes or so reminded me of 'The Rings' (instead of a cursed VHS tape, you've got a cursed app this time around) whereas the rest of the movie felt like 'Final Destination' and 'A Nightmare of Elm Street' of sorts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but... isn't exactly a good thing either.On the plus side, the acting was quite solid and I just loved the character of 'Father John' (played by P.J Byrne who, BTW, is in Final Destination 5 as well). Also liked the character of John Bishop (Circle of Eight). Unfortunately, these two characters had less than 10 minutes of on-screen time combined.Overall, a below average PG-13 horror movie full of jump scares which a teenager might find thrilling but...

334,svinjadebela,OK idea with dumb execution,5,15 January 2020,"This is one of the movies that you know you should take lightly and just enjoy the mediocre ride, and it's actually possible... Until the second part of the movie. Everybody else already said everything about unneeded romance, undeveloped characters and unnecessary comedy elements, but the only thing that bothers me is in the core of the movie.
So, the idea is that demon sets up the time of your death and kinda influences the actions that will lead toward it, but as we get close to the end of a movie we can see that the demon is able to take a direct action too. For example, he was able to literally pull that doctor away in the last millisecond and save him from getting deadly injection. So, HOW can I believe that he is not capable of stopping the protagonist from killing herself? Or just do whatever he wants? He seems to have almost unlimited power, but still fails? Hardly believable.
If only his power was limited in a movie in some way, the story would have been easier to swallow. Instead, it just makes no sense. I really don't get it how can someone gather a few millions of dollars to make something, but cant give it a reasonable 2 minutes thought.
But, OK. I've seen much worse. At least I was able to finish this one.",Countdown

336,stopthekeemstar,"Waste of money, cliché and predictable.",3,27 October 2019,"This horror movie was a huge disappointment. Though some things were decent, it's definitely not worth time and money, The idea of finding out when you'll die could've been explored in a much more creative and scary way meaning this film had lots of wasted potential. The only scares were the cheap jump scares.Certain aspects of the movie such as the protagonist and those she knows being tormented by the ""demon thing"" a lot more than the girl and guy at the beginning doesn't make sense. It sort of contradicts what the Father says during his scenes. Also what were those scenes about anyways?? Although they were funny, they definitely went a bit overboard and it started to feel like a comedy instead of a horror; it was super hard to take the movie seriously. The fact that the demons powers suddenly stopped working such as not being able to stop Quinn from killing herself and the idiotic, unrealistic choices of the characters (oh my dead mother is back all of a sudden, oh I should apologise to my dead brother (bit convenient that they have guilt related to their deceased family members)) that make the movie the opposite of immersive.
I just wanna say that the sexual assault subplot was very cringey and unnecessary, they should've thought that through better.Plus literally no one reads the terms and conditions of apps so practically everyone would be dying very soon if they downloaded the app, I guess that would require the demon to be in more than one place at one time (which it's incapable of apparently e.g when trying to kill Jordan and stopping to kill Quinn). Just move countries and you'll be fine - or record everything that goes down so that it goes mainstream. Who approved of this app anyway?!!! I guess demons in their universe have time to make apps.Overall 3/10, save your time for the videos criticising this movie, would probably be more engaging and keep your braincells intact.",Countdown

It can be thrilling and quite entertaining if you go with an open mind and not expecting anything more than a regular horror movie. It has all the cliches: the pretty girl with a difficult event of her past; a guy that falls in love with that girl and shares her fears; a comic relief (ok, that was the worst part, almost as if making fun of those characters that are seeken by the protagonist for help); lots of jump scares; a person that needs to be protected by the main character; and an ending quite interesting, though it doesn't make a lot of sense, but you accept it because, anyway, you knew what you were getting into.The actors are exactly what the script made out of them, but you can actually have fun seeing some faces you might know from some other summers. You can also see the script in action by the stupid decisions the characters make.

345,explicit-54657,Terrible,3,25 January 2020,"Low excuse for a horror film, which has absolutely zero depth to it. The plot is completely overlooked and blatantly obvious from the beginning, the sound design is terrible; really it's saving grace is the acting and even does it only reach mediocrity. The jumpscares were cheap and also generally bad, I admit at least some of them were original but were also performed bad.First of all, the main character doesn't even die at any point, even during the overdose. So how does the demon get vanquished if she's still at a point in overdose that it can be reversed?Also, how in that allegedly 60GB database of names has one of them not already committed suicide in the span of the time it took to kill the group of three? That's a massive database, just how? Is the IT guy changing the time of deaths also not regarded as deceiving or at least lying to the demon?Its shown at the end that there's a ""Countdown 2.0"" application, and in the title sequence it shows the IT guy having the curse though his time til death was still not for years to come. But would this not also imply that the two sisters still have the curse? Would the demon not have already killed them at this point considering it's several weeks after their death date?What was the point in not re-trying the priests salt circle idea when you had first hand proof that it worked at straying the demon away, the only reason it failed was that it tricked the guy, why not just pull him back or hold him down? In fact you could literally be restrained so you couldn't move and still have the ritual work. (Side note: why did the priest even experience any of this, he wasn't even cursed?)There's just so many loopholes and oversights that can you even call this a story? What was that scene with the agressive white guy at the IT shop who literally had a right to be angry? At least the conspiracy theory guy at least had some impact in the story while providing a miniscule of comedic relief but still falls flat when the obvious is said right after.You could take all of those elements out and nothing about the story would change.I'm not usually a person to be too bothered about the plot of a film, I'm generally okay with spoilers becuase I can tend to look past a films story and appriciate other aspect to it, but it was so difficult to avoid not wanting to close the movie the only thing holding me back was watching with friends.

For a horror movie, the special effects were well done and it maintained a good storyline from beginning to end. A phone app that calculates down to the second when you will die is actually a pretty novel idea but if you try to cheat death, your time of death changes. similar to a GPS app that recalculates a route if you make a wrong turn, and there are plenty of turns and twists in this movie! You watch this movie knowing that there is this impending sense of doom for anyone who's downloaded the phone app. But because you don't really know when, where and how the app user's fate will occur, the movie pulls you in and you have to keep watching. Part of the movie's appeal, besides the humorous lines at times, is that the actors are not very well known and it makes you feel like experiences like this can happen to just ordinary people (with a sense of curiosity and naivety, of course).

There are literally no redeeming qualities in sight as it has poor acting and writing along with a story that's just not very engaging at all. But even worse, the creators have tried to compensate for the low quality by filling the movie with Hollywood-approved bigotry towards white men. For starters, every single white man with a semi-significant role is evil. We're supposed to sympathize with the black main character despite him being incredibly racist to the point where he once tells a man ""I'm going to die soon anyway so I might just take a white dude with me"".
