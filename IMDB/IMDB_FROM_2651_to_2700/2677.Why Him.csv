0,SnoopyStyle,slightly off,6,16 July 2017,"Ned Fleming (Bryan Cranston) runs a printing company in Michigan. He has his loving wife Barb (Megan Mullally) and son Scotty. His daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) is studying in Stanford. During his birthday party, he gets shocking introduction to her boyfriend Laird Mayhew (James Franco). The family goes out to California for Christmas. Laird is actually a video game millionaire. His unfiltered wild ways rub Ned the wrong way. There's also Laird's weird manservant Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key).Comedy is easy to rate but hard to explain. One simply count up the laughs. In this one, there are a few smirks but no big laughs. I like almost everybody in this although writer/director John Hamburg is not one of the best. He's a middling hit and miss. It's hard to pinpoint the flaws.The most obvious are Mullally and Cranston. Their persona is way too cool to play an uptight, white-bread, middle America mom and pop. I would have loved Deutch to play opposite her real life mother, Lea Thompson. She can play slightly more conservative. As for Cranston, it's really his role. He should be a gun-toting, bible-quoting Republican. That would give the conflict more meat. Instead, he's a Kiss fan and much too close to Laird. The daughter is right about them being the same character.Scotty and Gustav annoyed me slightly more than humored me. It's a close call. The Pink Panther bit would work infinitely better if he's attacked by a diminutive China man. The bit should be separated from Gustav and Key could tone down his accent craziness. It's all slightly off which is how I feel about the toilet bit. He should flush before going into the bit. One could almost smell it which distracts from the comedy. Laird crawling into bed with Ned and Barb could be more awkwardly funny if Franco wears a banana hammock. Then there's the ending which kept on going for another fifteen minutes. In general, all the humor is off slightly which keeps this from being great.",Why Him
1,Prismark10,Kiss the bride,3,22 October 2017,"The story is by Jonah Hill, Ben Stiller is one of the producers and this is an even more gross version of Meet the Parents but this time the proposed son in law is obnoxious.Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) is studying at Stanford University and carrying on with her horny, heavily tattooed boyfriend who has sex on the brain. Laird (James Franco) is also a free thinking free wheeling internet tycoon and almost twice her age.Rightly so her parents Ned (Bryan Cranston) and Barb (Megan Mullally) are shocked by him when they visit them for Christmas. Teenage brother Scotty (Griffin Gluck) is more impressed by the cursing and sexualised Laird who also imparts some business ideals on the wannabe entrepreneur.Laird wants to marry Stephanie and asks Ned for his permission. Ned is rather taken aback who also has worries about the future of his printing company.Very little comment is made in the film about Laird's age. A lot of comments are made that Ned was similar to Laird at his age which must had been less than 20 years ago as Laird is heading for 40!I have to admit this is a rather misogynistic film, there is little attraction between Deutch and Franco and Stephanie is always telling Laird to tone it down a bit. The film is more miss than hit, it does have a few laughs and a predictable ending even down to a rock group cameo.",Why Him
2,nogodnomasters,Netflix and chill,7,13 August 2017,"Ned Fleming (Bryan Cranston), Flanders already taken, works for a failing print company in Michigan. His daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) is at Stanford and has asked the family to come out to California for Christmas to meet her boyfriend Laird, (James Franco) which she has kept mostly secret. Laird owns ""Guerrilla Gang"" an on line game company. He has money but is generally crude and obscene, lacking a filter. This sets up a cultural clash between dad and the man who wants to marry his daughter.The situations were over-the-top. Kaley Cuoco was excellent as the cloud voice. While this was not as crude as many of Franco's films, he does show his hind parts. The film had it's funny moments. Cameos include: Richard Blais, Steve Aoki, Elon Musk, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, and Cedric the Entertainer (not as himself). Smile funny 3 1/2 stars.Guide: F-word. Sex talk.

3,kosmasp,Why not?,7,10 June 2017,"This is a very weird comedy, that goes all out and has the acting talent to pull it off (or spray it on or do all kinds of kinky stuff, probably more than you can imagine). So I think I established (if you didn't know already), that this is not for the faint-hearted or rather the easily offended. Yes Bryan Cranston has won quite a few accolades and awards, but that doesn't mean he can't enjoy a silly comedy from time to time. And that's what he's doing here.There's also a very recognizable (AI) voice, not from Scarlett Johannson in this case, but from Kaley Cuoco. She has an integral part in this whole mess. A lovely and very funny mess, if you can lower yourself into that level, you'll understand and enjoy this. If not, you probably should stay as far away from this as possible.",Why Him
4,paul_haakonsen,One of the funniest movies of 2016...,8,15 April 2017,"It is rare that I stumble upon a comedy which makes me laugh as much as ""Why Him?"" did, and that is just one of the aspects why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did.First of all, the storyline in the movie was good, funny and cleverly thought through. Which meant that there was a purpose to the movie, and it wasn't just cashing in on cheap laughs and silly gags. There were several layers to the story, so chances are that everyone in the audience will something enjoyable about ""Why Him?""Then I must also stress out that the casting for ""Why Him?"" was just phenomenal. And they had really put together a great ensemble of actors and actresses all blessed with a good amount of talent and knack for the comedy genre. It was especially fun to see James Franco stand across from Bryan Cranston in this movie, because they had so much chemistry and complimented one another quite well on the screen.And of course, the laughs. And boy were they bountiful and constant. I was laughing a lot throughout the course of the movie, because there were so many funny scenes and funny dialogue.""Why Him?"" is a comedy with a romantic sub-plot, but not to the point where it becomes a sappy romantic comedy (or romcom). And that is good, because that would not have served this particular story well if they had opted for that approach.And there is also a great number of great appearances and cameos throughout the course of the movie, so it is not just Franco and Cranston that carry the movie all by themselves.If you enjoy comedy, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""Why Him?"". I did, and I am very glad that I did, because I was more than entertained from beginning to end. And it is the type of comedy that you can watch more than a single time.",Why Him

6,edwagreen,*1/2,3,25 October 2017,"This film certainly does not say much for technology heads of CEO's.In one of the most vulgar performances ever, James Franco is disgusting with his constant use of the four letter word as well as his general demeanor.A young girl attending Stanford falls for him and when a video appears showing his rear end in her apartment, her conventional parents fly from Michigan to California for the holiday season and to see what's going on here.Cranston is good as the father who cannot give his blessing to such an alliance, but the wife and teenage son are taken in by Franco and soon start to emulate him in certain ways.Leave it to finances to change the situation, but the continuous vulgarity does the picture in.Cleaning yourself up after a bathroom biological function is disgusting even with the new Japanese way of doing things.",Why Him

(and, by extension, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and America) in the recent U.S. Presidential Election by using James Franco's ""Laird"" as a clueless, uncouth, foul-mouthed over-rated business mogul (a Doppelganger for Donald J. IF the Trumpster was 50 years younger, good-looking, and possessed an ounce of Honesty) as he tries to woo a nod from his lover Stephanie's Dad Ned (Bryan Cranston), who as a Grand Rapids, MI, print shop owner perfectly symbolizes the Angry, Old, Obsolete White Guys who rigged the Electoral College for flunk-out Trump in Ned's Western Michigan Stomping Grounds and the rest of Fly-Over Country. Ned is a jobs-killing back-stabber of Michigan's once-thriving Middle Class, confessing several times during WHY HIM? that he helped lead the charge to off-shore millions of Michigan and Small-Town America manufacturing jobs by selling Japan's Sneak Attack #2 Datsun Auto Import Pearl Harbor models Back in the Day. But when it's Ned's turn to go belly up with his second life in the printing business, he implausibly turns here to Laird\Rump to launch a Toilet War against Japan! As crazy as this sounds, it's probably nothing to the Hell on Earth America is facing from Fox's Real Life Trumpenstein. It will serve ""The Mitten State"" right if Donald J. uses its isolated peninsulas as a bombing range for his new generation of Nukes.",Why Him
9,neil-476,Comedy with sputtering laughs,7,16 May 2018,"Stephanie prevails upon her parents, Ned and Barb, to travel with her younger brother from Michigan to California, to spend Christmas at her (newly disclosed to her parents) boyfriend Laird's place. Laird turns out to be unable to utter a sentence without the word ""f*ck"" or one of its derivatives appearing in it at least once, usually more often. He also wears fewer clothes than conservative Ned is comfortable with. It also turns out that he is very wealthy, and that there are a number of other important issues which Stephanie has been less than frank about.Comedies based on generation gaps or, more usually, attitude gaps are not rarities, so the chasm between rather prim and conservative Ned, and the extravagantly unexpurgated Laird is familiar territory, ripe to be mined for comedy. It is surprising, then, that this film isn't funnier than it is. The characters might have been drawn more broadly, but Cranston reins Ned back to the extent that he is a person rather than a caricature and, surprisingly, so does Franco, albeit less so. And so we get two real people both struggling with their own conflicting mindsets in the best interests of Stephanie who isn't always co-operating with them. Among the large brushstrokes of Laird's crassness and ridiculous works of art, and Ned's kneejerk horror, we have a genuine drama of real people trying to make real accommodations and, while it may be dramatically credible, it's not particularly funny.Which is why we have the daftly hilarious Gustav (Keegan Michael-Key) as Laird's preposterous estate manager, and a short but comical routine with a rather baked Barb coming on to a husband whose mind is elsewhere. Less amusing are the hacking, paperless toilet, and moose p!ss sequences.As a comedy this came across rather unsuccessfully to me, although I quite liked it because I quite liked the characters in it, even Laird.",Why Him
10,HotToastyRag,A very sweet story,8,19 March 2020,"It's a simple story: daughter loves family, daughter gets boyfriend, family hates boyfriend, daughter has to choose between them. I watched the preview to Why Him? and figured it was silly and harmless, and I rented it with an open mind and low expectations. Believe it or not, I really liked this sweet movie and wound up teary eyed by the end. Yes, I'm a sap.To my fellow saps, don't dismiss this movie as too weird or offbeat simply because James Franco plays the weird, offbeat boyfriend covered in tattoos and incapable of curbing his language. While most of his movies tend to fall in one of two camps (great acting, or under the influence) and make you wonder which is the real Franco behind the curtain (pun intended), this movie will give you a new perspective and make you absolutely certain that you know how misunderstood and sweet he really is despite his reputation. In essence, that's a large part of the story. First impressions aren't always correct, and people have hidden qualities you'll only discover as you get to know them better.Cute-as-a-button Zoey Deutch comes from a good family, and while she's away at college, her loving parents, Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally, expect her to follow in their squeaky-clean footsteps. Through a very embarrassing accidental meeting, Bryan and Megan find out their daughter has been hiding her unconventional boyfriend from them. Over Christmas break, the whole family, including her younger, impressionable brother Griffin Gluck, fly out to see Zoey and meet her sweetie-pie. He's a perpetually shirtless, overbearing, boundaryless millionaire with an extremely foul mouth, vulgar artistic tastes, and no clue when to stop talking and reign it in. From one hilarious disaster to another, Bryan and Megan are humiliated and shocked as Zoey continues to stand by her boyfriend and plead that they give him a second chance.Some of this movie might be a bit too vulgar for older audiences, especially if they're watching it with their kids to show that they're still hip. Keep in mind this is a modern comedy, so there will be some jokes that step a little too far over the comfortable line, and there will be some terms rattled off that you've either never heard before or never heard repeated in mixed company. But also keep in mind that no matter how much you're scowling at the beginning of the movie, you'll end up with a lump in your throat at the end. This is a cross-generational comedy that is nasty enough to keep the kids laughing but serious enough to get the parents to relate. The moral of the story is not that Bryan Cranston has to let his hair down and realize how wrong he's been; this is a movie about compromises, second chances, and hidden qualities. James Franco might be covered in tattoos and unable to dress himself, but he's incredibly sweet, loving, and expressive. He's honest to a fault and takes his promises seriously, and as much as you sympathize and wouldn't want him as a son-in-law, when he grins and hugs and loves and wears his heart on his sleeve, you can't help but like him. Give this movie a chance. And when you're dabbing your eyes at the very end, I won't laugh at you or call you a sap. I'll just ask you to pass the Kleenex box.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The first couple of minutes of the movie are a FaceTime call, and the handheld camera will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Why Him
11,FlashCallahan,Meet the Son-In-Law???...,6,22 March 2017,"Over the Christmas Holidays, Ned, an over-protective but loving dad and his family visit his daughter, where he meets his biggest her well-meaning but socially awkward boyfriend, Laird. Predictably rivalry develops, and Ned's paranoia goes to a new level when he finds himself lost in this high-tech palace and learns that Laird is about to ask his princess to marry him...It's set at Christmas, and it's Meet The Parents with the roles reversed, Cranston is the straight laced, by the book family man, and Franco is the foul mouthed over bearing boyfriend with nothing but good intentions.His aim is too impress her family, but because of the laws of awkward comedy, every he does makes him appear to be more abhorrent, right up to the Pink Panther reference which is supposed to be funny because the instigators have not heard of the Edward's Classic.The initial tour of the house is nothing more than the writers saying 'see that moose immersed in it's own urine? That will come into use later' trope that many comedy and action films use.But because Laird isn't intentionally meaning to come across as a complete moron, the narrative makes you cheer for him rather than fish out of water Ned, who is your atypical concerned father, which has been a stereotype of these type of comedies since Spencer Tracey was Father Of the Bride.I shouldn't have, but there were times when I couldn't help but laugh, the humour is the lowest denominator in comedy, but because Laird is so likable, you cannot help but laugh at his desperate attempts to impress.Cranston plays the straight Dad with ease, and although many will say that this role is beneath him, so what, his face is a picture half the time.Many have shortened the title to simply 'Why?' When I saw that this was about to start at my local Cinema I thought 'Why not?'I just wanted to kill a couple of hours and maybe get a laugh every now and again.It did the job.",Why Him
12,phd_travel,Actually okay saved by a good ending,7,7 June 2017,If you ignore the over the top vulgarities this comedy is actually okay. The best part is the ending which is actually quite refreshing in that the young girl turns out to be sensible. The story is kind of familiar father disapproves of future son in law. Especially when he is convincing his daughter to drop out of Stanford.The cast is good - anything with Bryan Cranston can't be that bad. James Franco is over the top - could have toned it down a bit. Zoey Deutsch looks prettier than in her previous movies - she is quite sweet here.Almost all big budget comedies are vulgar nowadays and this one is no exception at least the ending makes up for it.,Why Him
13,deloudelouvain,"Some people have a sense of humor, some don't",7,6 April 2017,"I see there are a lot of bad reviews again. Like most of the time with comedies. But it's normal that this genre of movies gets the most opposite reviews because not all people have the same kind of sense of humor. And a lot of people have no sense of humor at all so for them it's just pointless to watch a comedy but they still do. I on the other hand had some good laughs with Why Him? There's a lot of cursing but that's the whole point of the movie. James Franco as Laird Mayhew and Bryan Cranston as Ned Fleming just want the best for Zoey Deutch as Stephanie Fleming. Her boyfriend and father are quite opposites in life and so you get some funny scenes where they clashes. The story is what it is when it's a comedy. It's never far fetched but that's not the point, a comedy just has to be funny. And this one definitely is funny, despise what others may think.",Why Him
14,namashi_1,"Silly, But Funny!",6,17 March 2017,"You know exactly what you're getting into when you begin watching 'Why Him?'. Its the oh-so-predictable father versus future son-in-law story, that's laced with LOL Moments to the point you actually want the feud to end among them. 'Why Him?' however scores, despite clichés, its in fact, a fun watch, that actually works for a large part. 'Why Him?' Synopsis: A holiday gathering threatens to go off the rails when Ned Fleming realizes that his daughter's Silicon Valley billionaire boyfriend is about to pop the question.'Why Him?' would've been a lesser film, had it been cast wrong. But Bryan Cranston, James Franco & Keegan-Michael Key are more than worthy headliners. Cranston is superb as the possessive father, unleashing his comic side after a long gap. Remember his sterling performance as the Dad in Malcom in the Middle? Franco needs to be taken more seriously. With his super-fun performance in 'Why Him?', Franco boasts range yet again. But its Keegan-Michael Key who steals the show here. As Franco's chief assistant and trainer, Keegan-Michael is simply hilarious. Though he appears in bits, he makes you laugh the most! John Hamburg & Ian Helfer's Screenplay works for the most. Of course, some toilet humor (in the toilet, quite literally here) seems forced & unfunny, but the rest, is amusing enough. Hamburg's Direction is decent too. What else do you wanna know?Watch 'Why Him?' with the expectations of having a laid-back, fun experience. You will be rewarded.",Why Him
15,Hellmant,"It's not as good as the Ben Stiller classic, but I enjoyed it.",8,29 December 2016,"'WHY HIM?': Four Stars (Out of Five)A modern re-imagining of 'MEET THE PARENTS' (Ben Stiller even serves as a producer for the film). This updated version tells the story of a conservative father that gets in a feud with his daughter's socially awkward billionaire boyfriend; the variation is that the father is the normal one (in this version), and the boyfriend is extremely eccentric. It's once again set at Christmas time, and it's also extremely vulgar. The movie stars James Franco, Brayan Cranston, Zoey Deutch, Megan Mullally, Griffin Gluck, Keegan-Michael Key, Cedric the Entertainer and the voice of Kaley Cuoco. It was directed and co-written by John Hamburg; who also performed the same duties on 2009's 'I LOVE YOU, MAN' and 2004's 'ALONG CAME POLLY' (also starring Stiller). It was also co-written by actor Jonah Hill (a good friend of Franco's) and Ian Helfer. The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, but it's performed pretty well at the Box Office (so far). It's not as good as the Ben Stiller classic, but I enjoyed it. Ned Fleming (Cranston), his wife Barb (Mullally), and their 15-year- old son, Scott (Gluck), are all visiting Scott's 22-year-old sister, Stephanie (Deutch), at Stanford. Once there they meet her very crude, and extremely blunt, billionaire boyfriend, Laird Mayhew (Franco); who they knew nothing about previously. Laird's awkwardness, and free spirit attitude, take a lot of getting used to (for Ned and Barb). Barb warms up to him, as does Scott (immediately), but Ned decides to wage war against Mayhew, when Laird asks for his blessing to marry Stephanie. The movie is pretty funny, at times, and Franco and Cranston are both fantastic in their roles. The film is definitely too long, and the end seems to go on forever (the movie runs over 2 hours long)! They definitely could have used some better editing, but for the most part I really enjoyed it. The concept has been done before, many other times as well, but it still makes for a pretty amusing movie. This version is definitely somewhat fresh as well. I think most viewers will have a pretty good time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_ufnweLGYJ4",Why Him

17,bowmanblue,Just. Why?,2,15 June 2017,"Okay, I'll start by saying that – thanks to 'Breaking Bad' – I'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston. I reckon that I'm going to watch whatever I see he's starring in forever, based on his 'Walter White' performance. I never knew much about him before he put on that famous hat, but since then, I've heard he had achieved reasonable fame via playing someone's Dad in some pretty successful comedy show (yes, I've researched this review thoroughly!). Therefore, when I saw that he was going to be in a comedy along with James Franco, I certainly thought it would at least be entertaining. I was wrong. I hope Bryan Cranston got paid well for this, because he sure as hell deserves it.It's about a young college girl who invites her parents (her father being Cranston) across country to spend the holiday period with her new boyfriend (Franco). Yes, it sounds like a reasonably premise for a comedy (if you ignore the slight similarities to the 'Meet the Parents' franchise), but it just doesn't work – and for one simple reason – James Franco's character. Don't get me wrong I think James Franco is a very talented actor and have enjoyed his performance on many an occasion. However, here, he's just too unbelievable. I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to say that the parents don't approve of their daughter's new partner. Okay, so he's a millionaire (that's not the issue), it's just that he constantly swears in front of them, makes various s3xually inappropriate comments all the time and does unbelievably over the top gestures that are supposed to endear himself to his potential inlaws (and us the audience).I know this film would be pretty boring if the family came round, they all got along perfectly and just lived happily ever after. I understand there has to be some degree of conflict to move the plot along. However, it's just not realistic. No one would act like James Franco's character and it's simply not believable. Bryan Cranston does his best, but is effectively relegated to the 'butt' of Franco's various antics and is only there to look disapproving and long suffering.There's not much else to say. This one element totally overshadowed everything else for me and I just couldn't get past it. I can't remember James Franco's character's actual name, but I swear I found him as annoying as Jar Jar Binks, Adam Sadler in 'Jack and Jill' and that DJ bloke from 'The Fifth Element.' Okay, so he might not be quite that bad, but he's pretty bad – enough for me never to want to watch this film again. This is just about as far away from 'Breaking Bad' as it's possible to get. Bryan Cranston, you're worth so much more.",Why Him
18,lesleyharris30,"Laugh Out Loud Fun with Two Great Comedic Leads,",8,9 January 2017,"Why Him? is a great movie with a well developed plot and a fantastic comedic cast. It is simple, mindless fun that I thoroughly enjoyed for what it was, there was not a single scene that did not deliver at least two big laughs. A lot of people will probably assume it's going to be like Meet the Parents, but it is actually very different, the dynamic between Cranston and Franco's is nothing like De Niro and Stiller's. Laird is hoping for Ned to like him, but is not observant enough to realise the father of his girlfriend is not one bit accepting of him. I did find that the film took place far too much in Laird's house, leaving it feel very restricted. It would have been a lot more interesting for an audience to see the family head out doing some insane events organised by Laird, emphasising his wealthiness and developing the characters some more. The cast is all around terrific and there are several great cameos throughout. Large credit is due to James Franco and Bryan Cranston who have have instant chemistry on screen. They are very convincing in their roles, as Franco plays a somewhat disconnected man that he has done in several comedies prior, while Cranston plays an angry, disgruntled father, very different from any role he has had before, and he does it to great comedic effect. I would also like to give credit to the very funny Keegan-Michael Key, who had me in stitches as Gustav, his relationship with Franco's character was particularly hilarious. IIt is not a flawless or groundbreaking comedy, nor does it try to be in any way, and I appreciated it for being what it is. Funny and with a stellar cast, I would recommend Why Him? to anyone looking for a good comedy.When forced to visit the wealthy boyfriend of his daughter for Christmas, Ned Fleming soon discovers that he plans on proposing to her, much to his dismay.

Ned's (Cranston) daughter has invited her family to California for the holidays. She is ready to introduce them to her boyfriend Laird (Franco).

This is not a movie that will have you laughing out loud the entire time and it is extremely predictable but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is still a funny movie that is very much worth seeing.

20,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,20 March 2017,"Why Him?A father's best defense against his son-in-law's sex stories about his daughter is dirty diaper stories about her.The duo in this comedy, however, is sharing more than female fluid anecdotes.Surprised to discover that his princess, Stephanie (Zoey Deutch), is dating Laird (James Franco), Ned (Bryan Cranston) drives his family (Megan Mullally, Griffin Gluck) down to California for a visit.Ned's surprise turns to shock when he learns that Laird is worth millions, and that Stephanie is dropping out of school to work for him.Vacillating between love and hate for his daughter's free spirited suitor, Ned ultimately decides to sabotage their relationship by exposing Laird as a fraud.

21,Reno-Rangan,Printing biz meets the app biz! Paper versus digital!,5,14 September 2017,"This is not the theme something you could see for the first time. I have seen many classics, probably you would have as well. But the difference is it was a different cast and a bit modernised. Modernised means just the story set in the todays technological trend world like almost everything that related to AI we use in our daily life. It's yet to be a lifestyle, I mean new norm. So you can see a few people who had already progressed like we say Silicon/IT guys. That's the background and with the same old concept that the parents, particularly the father of the girl meets her boyfriend. When they do, those misunderstanding, generation gap and what else, all hell breaks loose.The comedies were okay. In some places it was too much. Instead of a laugh, it only annoyed. Though there were some good jokes, except I hardly had any good laugh in my entire watch. I remind you again that it was an okay film. Some people might find it good, some won't. Still a watchable film for the good performances. It's a face-off between James Franco and Bryan Cranston as expected. Elon Musk was a surprise. It had several opportunities to be better like turnaround its narration, yet they stuck with the same concept for the whole film. So other than mild entertainment, there's nothing in it to laud. I hope it all had ended here. Please, no sequel.5/10",Why Him
22,Thanos_Alfie,Simply James Franco...,6,21 November 2018,"""Why Him?"" is a Comedy movie in which we watch a young man having a relationship with a young woman who hasn't said anything about him to her parents. Her overprotective father goes crazy when he finds out about her boyfriend but tries to calm down and figure out what to do about it. When her father, her mother, and her brother visit her in order to be all the family together for the holidays they could not imagine what will happen and who exactly her boyfriend is.I liked this movie because it is very funny and it has many good scenes. The plot of it as you can imagine is very simple but interesting and this in combination with some hilarious scenes it's simply amazing. I liked the interpretation of James Franco who played as Laird Mayhew the millionaire boyfriend and he was simply hilarious in many scenes. I also liked the interpretation of Bryan Cranston who played as Ned Fleming the father and he was also amazing. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Zoey Deutch's who played as Stephanie Fleming the daughter of Bryan Cranston and she was very good, and Megan Mullally's who played as Barb Fleming the mother and she was equally good. The direction which was made by John Hamburg was interesting and with some very nice moments such as the ending.Lastly, I have to say that ""Why Him?"" is a nice comedy movie with which I am sure you are going to have fun and you are going to enjoy it very much.

Has some fun moments if you can tolerate James Franco as a tattooed, blunt personality, and a wealthy billionaire that will over do every situation to impress his girlfriends family. It is pretty funny, especially James Franco's performance that is put next to a family that is conservative and kept to themselves. The plot follows when Ned (Bryan Cranston), his teen son Scott (Griffin Gluck), and wife Barb (Megan Mullally) are invited to visit their older daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) for the holiday. And to meet her new serious boyfriend Laird Mayhew (James Franco). What her parents do not know is Laird is a gaming app designer and a billionaire that is tattoo happy, constantly swearing, and has his assistance Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key) constantly aiding him or jump out on him for surprise attacks as part of a defensive training. Laird, who wants to do things the right way with meeting her parents. Asks her father for permission to marry his daughter. With her father, not loving his attributes and lifestyle. It will become a challenge for Laird to impress her father. The film does have its hilarious moments from FaceTiming turning out bad on Ned's birthday as his daughter gets a visit from Laird to Laird making her family feel uncomfortable with his sexual/ raunchy remarks. Even, them staying at his rich estate with everything being modern technology from having paperless toilets, a similar Siri based operating system that runs in every room. James Franco does have fun with his role and is funny at times. I also love Keegan-Michael Key and his character that seems to entertain every moment he is on screen as his assistance. The downside about Why Him? The concept of the idea may have already been done before with the whole girl bringing her boyfriend to meet the family. The father disapproves and the boyfriend tries to impress to win over her family. Conflict rises with the girlfriend and her boyfriend and her father. Guess we can all figure how it would end from there. Films with such similar take like Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac Guess Who film (also a remake), and Meet the Parents, and so on. Why Him was not terrible, it still brings endless entertainment with James Franco's character and his raunchy humor. It is just the film already travels through familiar formula territory. Also, another weak thing about the film is the sub plot with Ned struggling with his printing business as everything is being paperless and everyone keeping up with modern technology. Which kind of left some parts of the movie humorless. Otherwise, Why Him? is a pretty fair comedy film with hysterical performances from James Franco and Keegan-Michael Key, and the rest of the film will either have you laughing if you care for the raunchy humor or dreading for being in a redundant idea.",Why Him
24,Floated2,Over the top but with laughs,7,2 September 2017,"Why Him? is another comedy about a over caring father and boyfriend relationship in which has been done before. Although this film has less of a filter and is rated R (since the Meet the Parents films were PG-13 and less tame), Why Him? does stand out for that reason. In most cases where the plot surrounds withe the daughters boyfriend and father meeting and bonding, this one is different since the boyfriend (James Franco) is a rich billionaire.This film's comedy isn't for everyone, and is filled with a lot of cursing, sexual jokes and over the top antics, which has clearly offended many people. Though once you get to the humor and comedy, there are many funny jokes in this film. Though they could have used without much of the toilet humor. Franco's character is typical over the top 'no filter' character and we see this quickly as the film starts. He carries the film along with Bryan Cranston and is a reason why Why Him? is an entertaining watch.Although predictable, this film is more so for the nature of the comedic elements and the journey we see the characters go through. It could have been better but it was better than expected (considering it received a lot of lousy reviews from critics). As a rewatch 08/10/18' Why Him? remains a funny and insightful comedy which is better and more natural on a second watch.",Why Him

Alas, I have yet to be impressed. An old school family visit their daughter's boyfriend's abode where they uncover his successful video game business. The boyfriend is wanting to propose, so it's a case of impressing the potential father-in-law to gain his blessing. Sounds familiar right? It's a pretty tired formula that we have seen plenty of times, and far funnier in the past. Don't get me wrong, this is watchable and not terrible...it's just wasted potential. James Franco and Bryan Cranston aren't put to good use, I mean they tried and I can see that. Both of these deserve better. It's the screenplay. If a comedic screenplay is unfunny, well...it's a failure. Again, it's a comedy that believes crude profanity is the greatest current trend. Countless sex jokes, numerous ""old vs new"" conflicts and the unusual attachment to the word ""bukake"". Oh and ""double dicking"", Japanese spray toilets and a moose preserved in urine. If any of the above sounds funny to you, then you'll enjoy this. For me, it just doesn't work. I will give the film credit, I laughed twice. A scene involving a webcam and a visually stunning virus that looks like something straight out of Microsoft Paint. Interestingly, both these jokes are in the same scene and it was Cranston's eloquent facial reactions that made me chuckle. The narrative follows a tired formula that surprisingly seemed like it was never going to end. Nearly two hours long! Should've had twenty minutes cut atleast. 'Why Him?' didn't do anything for me. Watchable yet lacking consistent humour, which for a comedy is not ideal. Perhaps I've had the sudden realisation that modern American comedies just aren't doing it for me anymore...",Why Him

The story in a few words: the old man is not very happy with the guy his daughter has chosen and so the drama starts to roll till the curtains fall right after the happy ending.James Franco plays the mega-rich eccentric software-nerd superb and his performance and role alone are worth watching this movie. Zoey Deutch and Bryan Cranston and the other actors, you just can see that they had a lot of fun in doing this little movie - even with a little reminiscence scenes on the famous Pink Panther (Peter Sellers!) movies. The end ofc is all happy ending and even some guys of a very famous Hardrock band of the 70s/80s have a little role. Enjoy.",Why Him
27,paul-allaer,Better and funnier than expected,7,10 January 2017,"""Why Him?"" (2016 release; 111 min.) brings the story of Laird, an out-of-control Silicon Valley 32 yr. old tech billionaire (played by James Franco) and his 22 yr. old Stanford senior girlfriend Stephanie. As the movie opens, Laird and Stephanie are talking on their smartphones. The movie then shifts to Grand Rapids, MI, where Stephanie's dad Ned (played by Bryan Cranston) is celebrating his 53rd birthday with his family and his company's employees. It's not long before the Flemings (Ned, his wife Barb and his son Scotty) are flying out to the West Coast a few days before Christmas, to meet up with Stephanie and to get to know Laird. The only problem is that the Flemings have no clue these two have been dating for a year already and are basically living together, or that Laird is a self- made billionaire. When the Flemings pull up to Laird's mansion, their jaws drop. At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director John Hamburg (he directed ""Along Came Polly"" and ""I Love You, Man"" and wrote several of the Fockers franchise movies). When you see Hamburg's resume, you'll immediately have a good idea what to expect and in that sense ""Why Him?"" provides no departure whatsoever from earlier movies. ""If I had a nickel for every F word spoken by Laird..."" comments Ned at some point, and that'll give you a good idea. But truth be told, there are quite a few very funny bits in the movie, none better than the infamous ""Japanese toilet"" scene suffered by Ned (to give you a clue: Laird's mansion is completely paperless...). The theater's audience was lapping it up over that one, including myself. This is the kind of movie that (1) you need to see in the right frame of mind (no, this isn't going to win any Oscars), and (2) you need to see with a lot of people around you who are in a similar frame of mind. I will admit that my expectations are low, going into the theater, but that I ended up enjoying this quite a lot more than expected. The biggest reason for this is in my opinion the excellent performance by Bryan Cranston, playing it as ""straight"" as can be, and proving once again (as if any further proof was needed) that this guy is a top-notch talent. James Franco can do this type of role in his sleep. Up-and-coming Joey Deutch (looking exactly like her mom Lea Thompson 30 years ago) is very easy on the eyes. Deutch is going places, that is clear (this was her... FIFTH movie role in 2016, including among them an excellent role in ""Everybody Wants Some!"").The movie opened a couple of weekends ago, and I finally went to see it this past weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was packed, somewhat to my surprise. As mentioned earlier, the audience laughed and screamed at all the right times, and even gave an applause when the end credits started rolling. If you are in the mood for some mindless entertainment that is at times very funny but sometimes also very crude, ""Why Him?"" is just the trick for you.",Why Him
28,jtindahouse,Laughs galore with a heart to match,9,23 December 2016,"When I saw that Bryan Cranston had signed on to do a comedy film I knew it wouldn't just be any old movie. He's actually a brilliant comedic actor (as anyone who is familiar with 'Malcolm in the Middle' will be fully aware of) but his career has also advanced past that point and he can now pretty much pick and choose his roles as he likes. The other indicator that this was going to be a quality film was the attachment of writer/director John Hamburg. He has shown himself to be a sure sign of a great movie ('Little Fockers' probably being the one exception). Sometimes though, movies that you go into with the highest expectations turn out to be some of the worst. Fortunately that wasn't the case here, as 'Why Him?' is a very fine movie.There were actually a lot of similarities between this and 'Meet the Parents' (also a Hamburg film), only with the roles reversed and the daughter's boyfriend being the crazy one. Quite a similar formula was followed and that makes perfect sense to me, because 'Meet the Parents' was a very enjoyable film. The 'R' certainly helped it a lot too. Movies with the freedom of that rating are just so much more enjoyable to watch. Nothing feels off limits and the actors seem so much more comfortable in their characters with no restrictions on them. This is particularly prevalent in actors who like to improvise, and you could tell that improvisation was heavily used in this film, especially from James Franco.What I love most about this film though is that while it is undoubtedly crass in nearly every scene, it also has a heart. While these characters might be mildly unrealistic, you can still relate to them and understand them as genuine people who actually mean well. Franco's performance is actually quite outstanding in this way. A lot of actors playing this role would probably come across quite unlikeable, but Franco never does. This could also be put down to excellent writing, but I give Franco equal credit.The other stand-out (in a film that had zero weaknesses in terms of cast, they were all brilliant in their own way) was Keegan-Michael Key. The man knows funny. I imagine he was also improvising heavily and that freedom really lets his performance flourish. He manages to make some lines funny that really had no business coming across that way. Also one moment on the dance floor had me in stitches. His facials are as impressive as his line delivery. A great addition to the film.I really enjoyed 'Why Him?'. The only flaw I could possibly find was a similar one again to 'Meet the Parents', where I found that lot of Cranston's actions (which drive the story) can come across a little unjustified and unnecessary, much the same as Ben Stiller's character in that movie. It's a minor problem though and something that is easy to get past. There is no shortage of laughs throughout and the film has a genuine heart, which is shown no better than in the final couple of scenes. A terrific effort from all involved.",Why Him
29,PWNYCNY,Mayhew: a study in decadence.,5,25 December 2016,"This movie has some funny scenes but is not a good movie. The reason: the principal character is so obnoxious that story comes off as jarring. Mayhew, played by James Franco, is affable and eccentric but is pushy, controlling, tasteless and above all stupid. The movie asks the audience to believe that he is a billionaire. That's a stretch. Fleming, played by Bryan Cranston, has legitimate cause to be offended by Mayhew. Mayhew goes out his way to offend people. Mayhew is so abrasive, so lacking in finesse, that it is virtually impossible to believe that anyone would seriously want to be around him. Yet, Fleming's daughter finds Mayhew attractive, for reasons that are never explained. Hence the title of the movie. The problem is the running gag, that Fleming's pomposity is misplaced, is not plausible. Mayhew is nasty throughout the movie. He deserves to be disliked. There is nothing endearing about him. He is a crass materialist who lacks the style. He's not even a smooth talker. He's goofy but not self-effacing. Cut through all the pseudo-street talk, bathroom humor and gratuitous use of profanities, and Mayhew is just another decadent rich guy, and not a lovable one at that. Still, the movie has funny moments, but that was because of Cranston who carries this movie. The funny scenes all involve Fleming, when he is being goofed on. The problem is that in this case the straight man is being goofed on by the comic character who comes off as being not only stupid but nasty. Cranston's performance saves this movie from immediate banishment to DVD land.",Why Him
30,stevendbeard,Dumb-But Funny-Comedy,6,25 December 2016,"I saw ""Why Him?"", starring Zoey Deutch-Dirty Grandpa, Beautiful Creatures; James Franco-The Interview, 127 Hours; Bryan Cranston-The Infiltrator, John Carter; Megan Mullally-Parks and Recreation_tv, Risky Business and Keegan Michael Key-Keanu, Mr 3000.This is a dumb comedy. And I say dumb because they use contrived or dumb situations to get laughs. Having said that, I still liked it and laughed quite a bit. Zoey is a 20 something year old college girl that wants her parents, Bryan & Megan, to meet her new boyfriend. FYI: If Zoey looks a little familiar, it might be because she looks a lot like her real life mother, Lea Thompson, from the Back to the Future movies. Anyway, James is the boyfriend that is also a 30 something year old Silicon Valley billionaire who made his fortune on creating video games. He is also very straight forward and honest and tends to says things without thinking things through. He also peppers his speech with 'R' rated language all the time. Keegan is James' right hand man that also keeps James on his toes by attacking him at odd times-sort of like Kato did with Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies. Of course, Bryan has a strong dislike for James and thinks he is not good enough for his daughter. James uses his money to help get the family members to like him because he wants to marry Zoey but he will not do so without Bryan's permission. Some things are funny-since he is rich, he can afford to have Kaley Cuoco voice his home computer system or have the rock group Kiss show up to perform a personal concert-and some things are just weird, trying to be funny just because they are weird-James has a dead moose mounted on his wall in a glass case and the moose is pickled in it's own urine. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including animal nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 51 minutes. It has it's ups & downs in the funny department but I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",Why Him

And the vast majority of them have one thing in common. They are not consistently funny. This film is. There still hasnt been a comedy to match Borat, but this one is certainly in the upper ten percent of comedies of the 2000s. Although I felt James Franco was miscast here, everyone else in the film is picture perfect; and Kiss was good as well. Megan Mullaly does a nice job, as does Bryan Cranston, who can do anything. But the real star of this film is John Hamburg, who has Coen Brothers sensibilities. He did a great job of writing and directing this film. I look forward to his works in the future.",Why Him
32,aidanratesmovies,"Typical modern day comedy, nothing special",5,10 December 2020,"Its watchable, although it can be cringeworthy, Why Him ultimately lacks the wit, charm, or spark that would take its tale to the next level- and instead just feels like another star studded dud. I enjoyed James Franco in this film, his character is different, and certainly interesting, and there is no doubt that he gives his all to his performance. There are a few funny jokes throughout, but ultimately it's humor is just too forced and over the top to really prove to be funny. I also enjoyed Megan Mullally's performance, but besides her and Franco, the cast for the most part feel kinda flat. There is nothing rather memorable about the film, which is more disappointing than anything considering its larger than life vibe and it's large celebrity cast. It just ends up feeling like a missed opportunity, messy, and on so many levels it tries so hard, without ever unfortunately succeeding. In the end, Why Him? Is an unsatisfying little comedy that has its moments, but not enough to be worthwhile.

33,questl-18592,Why?,6,3 December 2019,"This movie is almost disappointing. Brian Cranston as the straight laced father battling with James Franco as the crazy boyfriend should have been a riot. It's not, but it should have been. Really, as soon as you see a giant tank of moose urine you have to quickly recalibrate expectations, which can be tricky.It ends up just feeling slightly above average. It generates a few chuckles but never really goes any higher than that. It doesn't help that,, for the most part, this movie is firmly on a Meet the Parents-esque track and is therefore wildly predictable.Except for the ending. The very end of this movie was terribly fascinating and even impressive and I greatly appreciated that. The ending manages to elevate this one above the realm of middling, even blah, to a solid, ""Eh, it's alright.""",Why Him
34,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Why Him?,4,2 January 2017,"Dad lives in Michigan. He is close with his college-bred daughter who attends Stanford University. Said daughter is dating an older man who is rich, littered with tats, and overly eccentric (basically he's a whack job). Daughter has already had sexy time with this older man. Daughter for some faux reason, is in love with him. Dad gets invited to Cali (during Xmas) to meet the chap. He brings his 15-year old son and his wife of 27 years along for the ride. Daughter's boyfriend (and possible, future husband) lets him stay at his house containing farm animals, edible paper, and an all-too-personal version of Siri (voiced by ""Big Bang"" vixen Kaley Cuoco). Chaos ensues. You know, it's the old, familiar adage of daddy's girl being too good for the guy she's with.So OK, this is the gist of Why Him? (my latest review). ""Why"" this movie you ask? Well it does have a few moments. Otherwise, it feels a skit or a running joke that goes on for way too long. ""Him?"" is the film equivalent of splashing paint thrown on a wall. That doesn't mean you can call it art. Also, you could deem this thing a cinematic, polished turd with too much Pledge used on it. There's the obligatory (and cringe-inducing) toilet humor scene. There's the barrage of F-bombs that could probably fill two or more R-rated movies. There's the overacting or improvisation overload by actors who should know better. Finally, there's that cameo at the end by legendary rock band KISS. Boy does it sick. It's probably one of the worst things I've ever seen. Between Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, they speak a total of four lines. Gene mumbles his dialogue by saying, ""did you get laid?"" Shoot, he probably got paid thousands of dollars for that one pathetic day on set.Anyway, Bryan Cranston plays the lead in ""Him?"". He's Ned Fleming, a fifty-something and disapproving dad (of two) who runs a printing plant in Grand Rapids. Mr. Cranston has been nominated for an Academy Award. Mr. Cranston has won multiple Emmy Awards. The question I have to ask is, did he actually read the script for Why Him? Just curious. And then there's his costar, James Franco. He plays Laird Mayhew, the guy who Ned thinks should stay the heck away from his daughter (and for good reason). Franco is a decent actor who knows how to throw himself into character. Heck, I thought he should have gotten some critical acclaim with 2012's Spring Breakers. Now did he bother to read the sloppy script for ""Him?"" as well? Obviously not. Lastly, there's Zoey Deutch. She plays Ned's daughter Stephanie and the sweet girlfriend of Laird. As an actress, this clichéd, raunch fest isn't really her fault. She's just a pawn because her lines are pretty normal. Can't say the same for Megan Mullally of Will & Grace fame. She channels Ned's lackadaisical wife. There's a scene where she gets stoned and tries to get it on with Ned by putting him in a leglock. In a cast meeting, this would probably only look good on paper.The director of Why Him? is Brown University graduate, John Hamburg. In 2009, he made a darn funny movie titled I Love You, Man. In ""Man"", the humor flowed freely and the comedic element didn't feel forced. With ""Him?"", Hamburg tries to sledgehammer you, tries to bludgeon you with laughs. There's some amusement a half hour in. After that it goes on and on and on and on and well, on. My rule with earthy comedies is keep em' short, not 111 minutes long. Only Judd Apatow could pull off these types of flicks with exceeding running times (Knocked Up and This Is 40 come to mind). Hamburg, not so much.In conclusion, if somebody came up to me at anytime and asked me if they should see Why Him?, I'd tell them what I'm about to tell you the reader. I'd say, ""why"" on earth would you, ""why"" no, or just ""why?"" Rating: 1 and a half stars.",Why Him
35,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Why bother?,3,26 December 2016,"Routine, by-the-numbers tale of a man, repelled by his college-aged daughter's boyfriend, attempting to show her what a loser he is. It turns out, however, the boyfriend is an internet multimillionaire, and an obnoxious, loud, profanity-laden one, at that. There is nothing even remotely likable about his character, so it is easy to understand why Cranston doesn't like him.Zzzzz.Little, if anything, we've not seen before (except for the dead moose in a pool of urine, in one of the more disgusting moments) its talented cast carries the film, and its half dozen laughs, and ham-fisted product placement (Subway, Applebee's) The audience I saw this with had a few laughs, but also long, quite stretches in between, so I suppose I'm not the only one unimpressed with this one.Keenan's genuinely bizarre, guru character was more puzzling than funny, as were his sideburns, the oddest sideburns since Tony The Pimp, from Demons. While we're on the topic of puzzling things, why did we have to endure five minutes of Brian Cranston sitting on the toilet, try to figure how to use the bidet?

36,bkrauser-81-311064,A Crumb-edy,6,3 January 2017,"Why Him? is about as close as you can get to stinking as a movie without necessarily being completely and irredeemably awful. A lot of American comedies seem to be falling into this mean of ""just-bearably-good-enough"". So much so that I think we should coin a phrasesucktastic? A meh-ricle? Below ugh-rage?While I work on it, I might as well tell you about Why Him?, a movie about a bourgeois Midwestern family traveling to the West Coast to meet their college daughter's boyfriend. The kicker here is the boyfriend; one Laird Mayhew (Franco) is an eccentric billionaire completely lacking social awareness and a filter. This comes as a big surprise to the family patriarch; Ned (Cranston), who sees Laird's unconventional lifestyle and outward inanity as an affront to his close relationship to his loving daughter Stephanie (Deutch).The high concept alone is ripe with possibility. Perhaps if the characters vaguely resembled humans, the screenplay could have pit the sometime arcane social graces of Midwestern congeniality with the laid-back Techtopian peculiarities of Silicon Valley. The film further sets up sub-textual conflicts as Ned, the owner of a family operated printing press tries and fails to acclimate to Laird's aggressively millennial ephemera. It's old vs. new, rich vs. middle class, salt of the earth vs. not-salt-of-the-earth. The possibilities are simply too good to ignore.Then like a toddler ignoring his new toy and instead playing with the box it came in, Why Him? proceeds to crush the soul. The movie becomes grating within the first fifteen minutes, right when Cranston and Franco occupy the same space for the very first time. It is at that moment you become aware that both of these accomplished and worthy actors are trying to achieve two very different ends.Cranston quietly seethes and sighs in exasperation with every big comedic set-piece. The movie is clearly on his side throughout, but it fails spectacularly to find a tone, an arc, let alone the real human being Cranston is evidently trying to create. I'm assuming he was lost somewhere amid the hours of improvised footage that was shot, because that's how comedies are made these days. If I had to guess I'd like to think he was trying to channel Richard Dreyfuss in What About Bob? (1991) but ended up with the put upon lethargy of the parents from Step Brothers (2008).Franco on the other hand is playing the same dumb, obnoxious lothario he's always played in films like these, only with a tacked on sweetness that makes him the victim of farce of the laziest stripe. It's clear from his barrage of vulgarity that he's playing for the cheap seats in this film, which upon his introduction to the family feels like they're putting the least clever Trailer Park Boy in a Ken Loach film. At one point a character tells the entrenched Ned, ""you think it's him versus you but he's not fighting, you're the only one fighting."" That indeed is the film's most serious flaw; all the conflict is within the mind of one character. And sure the film tries to flip the script, putting the entire onus on the would-be father-in-law instead of the son-in-law. But that model quickly falls apart when the film tries to stir the pot as Laird confesses he's trying to ask Stephanie's hand in marriage.Thankfully with a clash of character direction, minor characters are given a chance to shine. On the farcical side, Keegan-Michael Peele's wacky personal assistant/confidant/evasive parkour instructor does have a few good moments. Meanwhile, down on earth, Megan Mullally absolutely slays it as the family matriarch whose look of extreme discomfort comes with the funniest quips.Yet for every decent jest there are about a dozen or so, that just plain don't work. In the quest for cringe, so many comedies today fail to do the very thing their supposed to do, and instead coax reactions out of the sheer awkwardness of it all. Stop it - please, just stop shooting for the bare minimum! Stop being a half-a**ed crumbedy. – Okay, I promise I'll try harder which, in fairness is what this film should have done.",Why Him
37,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Why Him?""- Charming but lacking in the laugh department, the film is saved thanks to the likability of Bryan Cranston and James Franco's fearlessly outrageous performance.",6,6 January 2017,"It really wasn't much of a surprise to learn that the director and co- writer of the new comedy ""Why Him?"" is John Hamburg. Why? Well, because this film is essentially a sort-of strange and slightly modernized subversion of the incredibly popular ""Meet the Parents"" comedy trilogy, on which Hamburg served as a lead screenwriter. It's got the exact same sort-of high concept set-up as the trilogy, but inverts the storyline, as instead of a charming but troubled young man meeting his strange and secretive potential in-laws, here we see the story told from the perspective of a father meeting his daughter's wildly unconventional boyfriend. I have to imagine at some point in production, this film was going to be ""Meet the Parents 4."" Because right down to specific scenes, the film seems like it was tailor-made to be a fourth installment in that franchise.""Why Him?"" is a strange beast, and in a lot of ways, it also reminded me of another 2016 comedy that was met with generally sub- par reception- ""Keeping Up with the Joneses."" Both are broad comedies with simple but reliable premises, and as far as I'm concerned, both lacked in serious laughs but were salvaged by their likable and charming casts. Much as Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher saved ""Joneses"" from complete oblivion, here the likable charm of Bryan Cranston and the bizarrely over-the-top and fearlessly outrageous performance of James Franco salvage the day and largely make up for the lack of consistent gags. Is it a particularly strong film that deserves your hard- earned money? No, not really. But is it at least mildly entertaining and good for a chuckle or two should you catch it on cable or Netflix? Absolutely.Ned Flemming (Cranston), the owner of a print-ad business that's starting to fail in the age of digital advertising, joins his wife Barb (Megan Mullally) and teenage son Scott (Griffin Gluck) on a trip to visit his daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) for the holidays. But things take an interesting turn when they end up staying with her unconventional internet-billionaire boyfriend Laird (Franco)- a kind-hearted but dimwitted and very vulgar weirdo with a complete lack of an internal filter. Despite being off-putting and difficult to swallow at first, Laird's good intentions eventually win over the family- save for Ned, who worries about his bizarre personality and fears for his daughter's future... especially when Laird confides in him that he wishes to propose to Stephanie. Now, Ned must decide whether or not to embrace this odd young man as part of his family, or try to push him away.To get it out of the way, the film is quite conventional, and there's few surprises to be had. While I won't spoil much, I will say that anyone with even a basic understand of story structure will know exactly where the film is heading and when to expect story- beats and comedic set-pieces. Hamburg's direction is very adequate, however, and the production design is very nice. And even if they are predictable, the few huge gross-out type jokes are reasonably funny. But still, they can't quite overcome the sheer predictability of the script, which comes across as way too stale. And it's frustrating with the talent on-screen.Thankfully, that talent is able to step up to the plate and redeem the film's shaky and predictable structure. Bryan Cranston may be beloved now for his stunning and troubling performance as hero- turned- villain Walter White on the incredible series ""Breaking Bad"", but the truth is he's a wonderful comedic talent, and it's nice having him back in a lighter role like this after so many years performing in more serious productions. He's got a great sense of timing and a sort-of fun curmudgeonly presence as an overwhelmed father that allows him to be gruff yet still likable. Great role for Cranston. And James Franco is just bizarre but endlessly entertaining as the foul-mouth Laird. I've always admired that about Franco- when a role is comedic, he'll commit 110% and go as far as he can to try and get a laugh. And while his over-the-top performance might turn some audiences off, I thought it was fun and at very least entertaining. Deutch, Mullally and Gluck round out the rest of the family in admirable performances, with each getting their moment to shine. And special props go out to the hilarious Keegan-Michael Key as Laird's personal assistant Gustav, a silly and entertaining foil that takes the best elements of the comedic sidekick and combines into one package. Particularly amusing was a fun running-gag involving him randomly attacking Laird in a riff of the classic ""Cato"" character from ""Pink Panther"", even if Gustav refuses to admit that's where he got the inspiration.At the end of the day, ""Why Him?"" definitely suffers from a somewhat cliché and contrived storyline that feels like far too many films that have come before. It lacks originality and comes across as a bit too quaint for its own good. However, this is a film that is so predicated on the endearing interactions between characters, that I do think the likable and charming performances save it from complete obscurity. It's not the sort-of film you need to rush out and see on the big- screen, but if you're interested at all, it'd most certainly make for a fine ""rainy-day"" movie if you happen to catch it on cable.I give it an about-average 6 out of 10.",Why Him

I guess that there is no explicit sex in it, but I don't really know as I couldn't make it past the scene where Bryan Cranston needs help from Keegan-Michael Key in the bathroom after a bowel movement. In other words, it's worse than juvenile, it's intentionally offensive (at least in every scene that I saw).If you saw the trailer I did, you probably expected a little more over-the-top version of Meet the Parents ... but don't be fooled. What's more than over-the-top ... outrageous? But it's worse than that - those involved in making this picture are relentlessly Hell- bent on shocking the audience at every point. There is even obscene artwork in virtually every scene.James Franco, playing a classless Silicon Valley billionaire, wants to marry Michiganians Cranston and (Tina Fey-lookalike) Megan Mullally's daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch). But when the parents come out to meet Franco, he actually discusses the possibility of ""doing"" (avoiding using the F-word; Franco's only vocabulary) Stephanie's mother WITH STEPHANIE! This is after he'd encouraged her 15 year old brother to share his favorite cuss words, then high- fiving him.I have no idea who the audience for this is supposed to be ... actually, it'd be really tragic if there is one.",Why Him
40,Screen_Blitz,"Bryan Cranston and James Franco have their comedic talent, even that is not enough to redeem this crudely mediocre misfire",4,3 June 2017,"A comedy with two A-list actors' names on the marque is likely to attract the attention of many, particularly comedic fans. But packing a few high-rank actors in the cast only makes up half of the equation in the final product. Bryan Cranston and James Franco have both proved to have comedic talent strong enough to shake the funny bones, with the former gaining fame from the sitcom series 'Malcolm in The Middle' (followed by his signature role in 'Breaking Bad'), and the latter starring in such comedies such as 'Pineapple Express' and 'This is The End'. Unfortunately, both of their talents and this movie don't seem to be on the same page here. This holiday comedy, tearing a similar storyline from 'Meet The Parents', pits its fairly decent cast in a raunchy R-rated comedic affair in attempt to score some good laughs. Sadly, this film's endeavor comes to perfunctory results. This film stars Bryan Cranston as Ned Fleming, an uptight 55-year old business CEO who travels with his wife Barb (played by Megan Mullally) and his teen son Scotty (played by Griffin Gluck) to spend Christmas with their Stanford University bound daughter Stephanie (played by Zoey Deutch) and meet her tech-whiz millionaire boyfriend Laird (played by James Franco). Upon their arrival, Laird wants to make a good impression. The problem is he's weird, he's awkward, and he's absolutely inappropriate to the point where Ned disapproves of him. With Ned developing a cold shoulder against his daughter's goofy boyfriend, Laird must a lasting impression on the parents if he has a chance of earning the father's blessing to marry his daughter. This movie is about as profane and raunchy as many R-rated comedies get, and sometimes to the point of pushing the envelope. That is not is too much of a problem as long as it's at least funny. The problem is there are only a few good laughs to be handed here, and they all come far in between. For a majority of the time, the film either spends its time on repeating a joke constantly, or tries too hard to land to bring out the laughs with its senseless vulgarity. Neither of which do the cast, particularly James Franco and Bryan Cranston much justice. One scene in particularly involving a heavily intoxicated Megan Mullally trying to seduce Cranston goes on too long and comes off rather far more awkward than funny. Another scene involving Cranston in the bathroom with Keegan-Michael Key is just flat-out gross and unfunny. Worst of all, James Franco who has struck comedic gold in the past more often than not tries too hard to be funny here. Although he fortunately manages to spray out a few hilarious one-liners, his attempts at good humor too often involve him machine gunning one crass penis joke after another; very few of which are remotely funny. Bryan Cranston on the other hand just seems immensely awkward in this role, completely defying against the talent he has demonstrated in his past career. It is even more disappointing when the banter between him and Franco which is supposed to be the highlight of the story dissolves into an unfunny fiasco. Even Kaley Cucuo, voicing an artificially intelligent Siri- like intercom on the ceiling of Franco's home sounds to have trouble getting a few laughs out.Why Him? marks a disappointing endeavor on showcasing the comedic talent of James Franco and Bryan Cranston, and treats viewers to a shallow comedic fare with little redeeming. While that is not to say fans of Franco will be vastly disappointed nor that it fail shake the funny bone just a little bit, it can certainly be agreed that fans deserve something little better than this.",Why Him

This film is puerile doggerel pretty much from start to finish. The boyfriend is shocking because he swears like a 4 year old that just learned a couple of dirty words. There's nothing shocking about profanity but there's also nothing in the least bit funny about it. Then we move on to toilet humor which I also majored in when I was nine. If this is your sort of thing by all means, keep watching but it doesn't aim any higher. Oh, I almost forgot about the completely boiler-plate story. Why Him? Why? This movie also piggy-backs on a disturbing new trend in pop culture in which the new rich are portrayed as these hyper-rich gods straight off of Mount Olympus or wherever they come from. Mega-billionaires are the new millionaire and screw the rest of you pathetic losers who don't have the brains and gumption to take what should be yours. Adios, democracy, welcome the new aristocracy.

42,blott2319-1,"Lazy comedy, that can't even get the tropes right",3,12 March 2020,"Why Him is lazy comedy film-making at its worst. It's a film that takes that common trope of a daughter introducing her family to her boyfriend (who is not exactly the type of guy they'd approve of her dating,) but adds the new wrinkle of having this guy also be rich. James Franco plays the stereotypical boyfriend from one of these films, who seems clueless about the fact that he is one of the most annoying human beings alive and has no boundaries. Yet everyone tolerates him because he is loaded. The father character, played by Bryan Cranston is such a stereotypical out-of-touch man, he would have been at home in a Grumpy Old Men reboot. I hate this portrayal of 60-year-old guys as being utterly clueless about anything technology or pop culture related. Admittedly, some of the gadgets in this home are over-the-top exaggerations of things that exist in the real world, but it still is annoying that the dad is presented like a dinosaur. It's just a lame joke that plays on archaic stereotypes.Most of the comedy in this film is catering to the lowest-common-denominator audience, as it is made up of sexual references and bathroom humor (with an excess of cussing as well.) In order to make a movie like this work they have to find ways for us to see the boyfriend as a sympathetic character that we can appreciate despite his quirks. But in the hands of James Franco, he just comes off as a douche. It's also useful in a movie with this type of plot if we see the father as irrational and wrong. Yet, in the long run, I think Cranston is right on almost everything. In fact, the movie even turns at the end and takes his side on certain things. It's such a misguided script that doesn't seem to know how to tell an effective story. Instead it feels like a group of writers sat in a room pitching situations and then they loosely constructed a film around those vignettes. Why Him is not a movie I think anyone needs to seek out, because there are plenty of films that have done this better.",Why Him

46,RforFilm,Merry Cringe-Mas? Why Him? has some bright moments in this predictable R rated family comedy,5,27 December 2016,"Merry belated Christmas. This is something we're going to remind family and friends who could be there for certain celebrations. The family that does come to my Christmas parties are certainly a bit nutty, but I still love them enough to put in the effort. What's hard is taking in new members. I'm not talking about the new children that become nieces or sons, but rather the new love interests. It's strange to come over to a Christmas Eve party and to see your favorite uncle with a brand new girlfriend. Not matter how nice that new significant other is, it still feels like taking in a new alien.Christmas is all about showing your love to your fellow maneven if they seem more like a stranger then a friend. So if your having a celebration where someone you know is bringing a new loved one, just understand that their just as nervous to join the family and to give them a chance. You never know how much of yourself you'll see in other people. Today's story is another ""father trying to accept her daughter's crazy boyfriend"" scenario (which we've seen plenty times before) as witnessed in Why Him?. Ned Fleming (played by Bryan Cranston) is the CEO of a printing company in Detroit who has a loving wife Barb (played by Megan Mullally) and teenage son Scotty (played by Griffin Gluck) who is being groomed to eventually take over his father. The only one missing is his college-aged daughter Stephanie (played by Zoey Deutch) who is currently at Stanford in California. During Ned's birthday party, Stephanie calls via face time to wish her father well, only to come across her boyfriend undoing his pants in the background. Though they eventually shut the video off, this sets off an awkward start to the Christmas season.Ned and his family are invited to California for Christmas by Stephanie to come meet her boyfriend. To the surprise of Ned, her boyfriend is Laird Mayhew (played by James Franco) who is a multimillionaire CEO of a video game company. He however has little filter which makes him curse constantly and to say everything that's in his mind. The more time spent at his house, the more Ned is at the horrification that this crazy man could be his son in law. Laird wants nothing more then to gain the approval of Ned so that he can propose marriage on Christmas morning. The story of Why Him? is not an original one. We've seen plenty of romantic comedies where a father is coming to terms with their offspring's loved one. So what does this offer that Father of the Bride or Meet the Parents doesn't already have? This is raunchy. No, this is incredibly raunchy with F-bombs and sexual jokes galore. While that can be funny, it suffers the same problem that Sausage Party had and that the novelty wears off. It becomes tiring to hear James Franco refer to a case of moose urine (you heard that right!) for the twentieth time.So this sounds disgusting, right? Wellwhat does keep the story going are the actors. Bryan Cranston and James Franco are giving it their all to make this work, even though the script gives them little to work worth. They did manage to get a bunch of laughs out of me. I'll also give credit for the script for tackling some ideas involving Cranston's paper company and Franco's gaming business. And plus, while a chunk of the plot may be predictable, the ending is not only heartfelt, but it got a big laugh when a special rock band makes a cameo. I'll give him five monkey statues out of ten. While I wouldn't recommend Why Him? as something to see in theaters, it is something that I might say to wait for Netflix. It'll probably have it's fans. I'm just not one of them. The best way to figure out if you'll like this film is to take a look at the red band trailer and understand that you'll get what you see. See if your willing to give this story a chance.",Why Him
47,dave-mcclain,"""Why Him?"" is crudely hilarious and hilariously crude, mostly because of the film's perfect casting.",8,30 December 2016,"When is crude humor actually funny? Any answer to that question is highly subjective and there are probably as many ways to answer it as there are Movie Fans reading this review. For some, the answer would be simply ""never"", but for most, it seems to depend at least a little on age, gender and ethnicity, but mostly on personal experiences and outlook on life. In the opinion of this Movie Fan / film reviewer, comedic cinematic crudities are the best which offend the least. In other words, it's all about the context in which the humor is presented. Adult language, for example, isn't funny just because there's a lot of it, but the use and/or amount of it can be very funny if it's in service to a plot which calls for it – and in situations that are otherwise comical on their own. Adult humor (such as R-rated language, personal insults, juvenile humor, sex jokes, outrageous sight gags, etc.) is much funnier when it's good natured – as opposed to mean-spirited – especially when children or other vulnerable or minority populations are involved. All this is especially true for holiday comedies, which is why I can hate the ""Bad Santa"" movies, but still love films like 2011's ""A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas"" – and 2016's ""Why Him?"" (R, 1:51).The character asking this film's titular question is Ned Fleming (Bryan Cranston), an old-fashioned owner of a struggling printing company and loving husband to similarly uptight Barb (Megan Mullally), 15-year-old budding businessman Scotty (Griffin Gluck) and college student Stephanie (Zoey Deutch). Stephanie has fallen in love with a somewhat older and very successful video game company CEO named Laird Mayhew (James Franco). Laird is completely without guile, but, as the mother of ""The Waterboy"" (1998) described her son, ""lacks the social skills"". Laird isn't a nerd, but his father and mother were both lacking in the positive parental influences and Laird is now an adult without inhibitions – or a filter between what comes into his head and what comes out of his mouth. (Think an even more free-spirited, cruder and much more intelligent version of most of Adam Sandler's movie characters from the mid-late 90s).After Stephanie's relationship with Laird is unexpectedly and hilariously exposed to her family, they fly from their home in Michigan to California in order to meet and spend Christmas with Steph's new beau. Let's just say that Laird makes quite a first impression. His estate manager, the European and vaguely Germanic Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key), is only a little more socially astute than Laird and tries to advise his employer and friend on how to get on Ned's good side, noting, ""You two don't speak the same language. You speak English, with resounding amounts of f---."" Laird is able to win over Scotty and even Barb, but is very desperate to impress Ned, so he can get Ned's blessing to propose to Stephanie. Laird's millennial eccentric lifestyle, his impromptu self-defense training sessions with Gustav and his wild parties make winning Ned's approval even more challenging, but makes for a lot of fun for the audience.""Why Him?"" is crudely hilarious and hilariously crude, mostly because of the film's stellar cast. It's not just that this cast is experienced and talented (which they are – in spades), but they are amazingly well-suited for their roles. Franco is pitch perfect playing what seems to be a more outlandish version of himself. Cranston and Mullally's TV sitcom cred make them ideal as the parents – and with excellent chemistry. Key is similarly comedically inspired, rising star Gluck is just the right amount of earnestly precocious and Deutch is a wonderful combination of smart, strong and sexy. There are also some great cameos – in person and via voice work, as is the case with Kaley Cuoco, playing herself, serving as the voice of Laird's practically sentient and seemingly omniscient and omnipresent household AI system. (Think a smarter, humorous, sarcastic and conversant version of the ubiquitous Amazon Echo's Alexa.) Of course, the script by John Hamburg and Ian Helfer give the actors plenty of jokes and funny situations to work with, while Hamburg's direction makes great use of his ensemble's chemistry and comedic talents (including allowing for and encouraging plenty of improvisation) and he keeps the film's pacing and the timing of its gags on point. Unfortunately, some of the jokes are more bizarre than humorous, there are a few unintentionally awkward moments and the amount of Laird's bizarre behavior that Stephanie tolerates feels unrealistic, but those are relatively minor issues. The basic question at this point is why see ""Why Him?"" The answer for those who aren't automatically offended by crude humor and who enjoy that type of comedy when it comes with heart and is actually funny, is Why Not? ""A-""",Why Him

This film drops the 'F' bomb frequently (too frequently for me anyway!).The audience had a few laughs, I think I remember laughing 2 or 3 times. The trailer showcased the very few 'funny' scenes and makes this look like a much funnier film than it really is. If your idea of funny is frequent swearing then (unfortunately) this film is definitely for you. Overuse of the 'F' word soon wears thin, makes you realise it was used instead of clever humour.

But James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, and some others seem to have fallen into a trap of thinking vulgar language, semen, and private parts are the keys to a great comedy. Crude is funny when it comes from a child (at times) or an old woman, but it can be overplayed, and it certainly is in this movie. In fact, all of the supposedly comical elements rely on it. The story isn't original, you couldn't care less about any of the characters, and I can only imagine how embarrassed Cranston would be if he ever saw this film. I honestly don't think I'd have found this funny even in my 20s. Can't recommend anyone waste their time watching it, unless you just want to see James Franco without a shirt.",Why Him
50,CineMuseFilms,Could have been the comedy of the year but blows itself apart with F-bombs and worse.,4,10 January 2017,"The holy grail of comedy is to make you laugh but there are many different types of laughter. It can range from a joyful belly laugh about the funny side of being human to a cringe laugh based on the psychology of shame and embarrassment. Joyful comedy makes us feel good while cringers lessen us. The sit-com Why Him (2016) goes hell-for-leather at extreme cringe and is seriously lessened by its choice. Puerile body-function jokes, non-stop obscenities, and sexual and pornographic references ruin what otherwise could have been the comedy of the year.The plot line and central premise is genuinely hilarious. Ned (Bryan Cranston) and Barb (Megan Mullaly) are conservative middle-American parents who visit their out-of-state daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) to meet the new boyfriend Laird (James Franco). Steph's 15 year-old brother is thrown into the mix to heighten the cringe-effect of R-rated humour. Steph does not tell her parents that Laird has no social filters: he says what he thinks, is crude, rude and unpredictable. He is also a mega-rich Silicon Valley entrepreneur while Ned is facing bankruptcy. The outcome is a predictable disaster that gets worse when Laird tells Ned he wants to marry Steph. That's the bare bones of it; the rest is essentially layers of sit-com skits, toilet humour, and no-holds-barred cringe attacks.The central premise is a comedic cliché that pops up in countless films: a new love object is odious to someone's parents. But this one is not content to cross a few boundaries; it shatters them with a sledgehammer. The 'absence of social filters' loosely refers to disorders like Bipolar and Asperger's Syndrome and featuring it in comedies makes it an object of ridicule that contributes little understanding or insight. But that's a minor objection. The real low-point of the film is a script peppered with F-bombs and worse, with a running gag referring to a category of pornography especially degrading to women. We all expect colourful language these days, but it's a substitute vocabulary that loses impact quickly. Cheap gags are more affordable than a quality script and even a strong cast cannot pull this film up from the depths it chose.There will doubtlessly be audiences who enjoy the film's excesses. Many will not even see the timeless sexist spectacle of a father and a suitor haggling over the life choices of a young woman as if she must forever remain male property. Unlike the freedom enjoyed by audiences, film critics must keep an objective view and find the positives in a film.

Yes, he has some tender moments, and his heart's in the right place, but Franco goes at 100% from the get go and has nowhere else to move from there. He's such a dominant presence that he forces far superior actors like Cranston, Mullally, and Key into straight men/women roles.Even the cameo by KISS feels a bit forced and there for the sake of it, though it's amusing to see Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley (in full KISS makeup and costume) sing gentle Christmas carols.The one character with decent development is Scotty Fleming (Griffin Gluck), who starts as the under-appreciated younger sibling, but by the end is respected and rewarded for his innovative ideas.",Why Him

Bigger part of the story actually takes places in California, so there's not gonna be much snow and ice, or much of anything else directly holiday- related for that matter. (For Santa and reindeers, better check recent Office Christmas Party"", or even some of the genre classics like Elf"" or the first Bad Santa"".)But what this new movie does have is energetic mayhem filled with colorful characters armed with enough cute lines to make one at least smile once in a while. You're probably not gonna LOL much though, because for all it's quick pace and dirty jokes – which there are plenty of –, the movie is also interested in plot, main characters and feel-good atmosphere. This comes as a surprise because I had no reason to expect anything else than another straightforward gross-out comedy they love to mass produce these days. Even the dialogue feels more natural than in many comedies because it's given the minimum necessary time to breathe. And having this additional depth makes Why Him?"" stand out of the crowd, at least a bit. Even if you just want to have some easy laughs.Why Him?"" is a vehicle for Bryan Cranston still trying to find his way in movie business since the praised drama series Breaking Bad"" reached to its conclusion over three years ago. He has actually done a lot of movie roles since 2010 but is still looking for something that people really would remember him by. That's because his most valuable movies have made only blips on general radar (Trumbo"" and The Infiltrator"").This is not gonna be his lucky project either because he has such a thankless character who just has to hang around, be startled or disgusted of all the colourful mayhem happening around him and churn out some fry comments here and then. Almost everybody on screen is more exciting and certainly more unpredictable than his playing-it-straight good family man. I get it, it's meant to create a contrast with everything else but I still feel that's a waste of his talent.Luckily, the others are more than ready and able to compensate for the boring dad, especially James Franco as a freewheeling bf and Keegan-Michael Key as his best friend slash guru slash weird butler. If you don't like Franco as much as I do, then you will probably not agree... but he's kind of perfect for this role, channeling his all to equal parts funny, weird and disarmingly spontaneous character who is really holding the whole thing together. He perfectly matches the overall tone of movie, coming across as unpredictable and always ready for some sudden turns.So, the result may work best for fans of James Franco or current wave of mainstream comedies. But despite being a genre movie – made just because there is a demand for this kind of stuff –, it manages to bring something fresh to the table and offer tightly put together experience altogether. Many recent big-name comedies feel like a series of improvisations looking to find an excuse to exist. Why Him?"" feels like a proper movie. I have a good feeling about this.By the way, director and one of two screenwriters is John Hamburg (Safe Men"", Along Came Polly"", I Love You, Man"") and one of the authors of the story is Jonah Hill. Both useless facts but I like those guys!Another useless but fun fact: the cast was given free access to improvise as much as they wanted to and eventually 240 hours of films was shot on camera, which had to be trimmed to about 90 minutes for the final film. How come it feels much more compact and natural than many other impro-based comedies (the worst recent offender being ""Anchorman 2"")?",Why Him
59,srdjan_veljkovic,"It tries to be funny, but does not succeed",4,16 March 2017,"The main problem of this movie is that it tries too be funny way too much, all the time. It only succeeds a few times, but even if it were more, it would not be much better.The premise and the story had potential,the casting is OK, they even have the Kiss playing Christmas carols near the end. But it just doesn't work.It seems that actors felt this is too much, too. Most of the time they look like they feel this will not pass, but, hey, it's their job,so... Since they are not buying it, why should we?Of course, the ""vote Hilary"" ending doesn't help, not just because it is not in line with the characters or the story.

60,mistoppi,Watch this with a lot of people,7,22 January 2017,"The most obvious thing you notice is that the whole story is such a cliché. It has been done million times before and the roles have been reversed and gender swapped and what not. It's a really popular trope, but it's getting really, really boring. Sure, they try to wake it up with different actors, different archetypes and all that. Most of the humour of this movie is dirty. It's usually sex or bodily fluid related, and that's also something that gets boring easily, but also when you are in a group of people, it's hilarious, unless some of you are really boring.My friend and I both thought that Laird (the boyfriend, played by the annoying James Franco) seems relatively normal for a man of his generation / possibly my generation, though he is older. I say relatively, because when someone is a millionaire, they can only be relatively normal. Ned (played by Bryan Cranston) acted like Laird was completely weird when he seemed really... okay. Sure, he had no filter and was a bit eccentric, but he wasn't weirder than some of the people I know, apart from what he does for a living of course. The biggest clash between Ned and Laird was definitely caused because of the differences between the generations, and how the times are changing. Ned's career in printing was being overrun by internet and most of Laird's work was from there. So even if they didn't have the rocky start of Laird's bare ass on the screen during Ned's birthday party, they still would've clashed at some point. Ned was determined to hate Laird from the start, so he did. This movie is fun and it has the holiday spirit and all that. But my advice is don't watch it alone. Movies like this work when you're in a group of people, because then it seems funnier. My relatively high score comes from the feeling cinema gives to it. If I'd watch it in few weeks alone at home I'd probably give it a lower score, but why would you watch this movie alone?",Why Him
61,FelipeCarrillo,Give It An Opportunity? Why Not?,7,22 January 2017,"Romantic comedy has been one of the most harmed film genres in this new era of anodyne artistic revolutions; nowadays, the lucky ones which achieve to lay out unprecedented circumstances are practically non-exist, mixtures are radically away from Judd Apatow' and company's instauration a few years ago, where scatological humor and sarcastic gags were available.Once British people determined the official romcoms prescription, western people sought to make the same thing coming up with more American subjects (""Meet the Parents"").In 2016, love story full-length films for couples had no prestigious presence whatsoever, and despite the fact that it is not a resurgence of the genre, Jonah Hill's movie wins audience's hearts through the essential of the plot, irrigating superb comical situations (with lascivious content on the top), pointing out ineluctable generational switchings and exhibiting modern technologies impact in order to get a laugh more than ever.Not every day we have the possibility to see how Bryan Cranston endures mercilessly in a technological toilet, a foreign hygienic body system (used after urination or defecation) controlled through your smartphone, a place where 'toilet paper' expression does not exist; not every day we have a female personal assistant (with own individualities) in Kaley Cuoco's voice (""The Big Bang Theory""), and much less we can see Megan Mullally trying to have impulsive sexual relations with her husband under the influence of marijuana, only by these three constituents, value of the ticket is worth.""Why Him?,"" set up by the experts in the field, John Hamburg (""Along Came Polly""), Jonah Hill (""Sausage Party"") and Ian Helfer (""The Oranges""), fails to formulate something necessarily different in father-vs.-fiancé or parent-child stories, with the abnormality that in these changeable times, bride's dad is not the domineering, but he is the dominated. And that's exactly what makes it an interesting and even welcome idea. Despite the fact that it presents a lack of brand-new elements, it does not destroy or deteriorate genre reusing expressions, moreover, generates hilarious conjunctions, encouraging mostly by a magnificent James Franco and a sumptuous Cranston.After they glimpse in a peculiar way to the guy who is dating their daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) -who has spent several years attending Stanford University, -Ned and Barb Fleming, a deferential and American old-fashioned parents, decide to visit her along with their younger son on the occasion of passing a beautiful Christmas eve in family. Although they've had already a first (incorrect) impression, the only thing what happens when arriving at the mansion of his new son-in- law is to see in flesh and blood how their fears come true, what would be translated as the worst nightmare for a father.Laird Mayhew, played by Franco, is a spoiled son of Sillicon Valley, creator and owner of a mobile games company, he is a man with good intentions but socially small-minded who aims to win the hearts of his in-laws and his younger brother-in-law through gifts of big media relevance from Steve Aoki, Elon Musk to Richard Blais, nonetheless, his 'no filter' personality will make holiday season into a full enjoyment.Ensconce yourself in your seat with fresh popcorn and a glass of your favorite soda, relax, overlook the pubic hair of Franco in the opening scene and prepare for a fun Christmas journey.",Why Him
62,bastos,Meet the son-in-law.,5,7 January 2021,"For me, for these kind of comedies to work you have to make the conflict between the two main characters be believable. Think Meet the Parents, both De Niro and Stiller characters, while completely different, are believable and feel kind of real. Here the James Franco character is so beyond anything remotely real that you just can't connect with anything that's happening. Franco seems like a psychopath and Cranston responds by being a prick. The romance is totally unbelievable because Zoey Deutch just seems like a regular girl who would never date such a lunatic unless she was a gold digger. All these dynamics don't work for me, making everything feel forced and cringey. And even though I laughed at some of the jokes, most of them felt tired and predictable. As an example, early on there's a mention of an art piece containing urine and I immediately knew there would be some urine flying later in the movie (I'm a genius, i know). That's just an example of how predictable some of the jokes felt. Anyway, all this makes it seem like I hated the movie, I didn't, I liked some of the juvenile jokes, and Keegan-Michael Key always gets a smile out of me, but not enough to recommend the movie.",Why Him

I was angry at it within the first 15 minutes. It wasn't because of the constant swearing, although I find movies, like this one, that include profanity solely in an attempt to be funny to be really objectionable. It wasn't because this movie is totally lacking in subtlety, originality and wit. It wasn't even because this movie completely fails to be funny. No, it was because it offends me that there are people in this world who write this sort of trash and try to foist it on an unsuspecting public as if it has some sort of comedic merit. It doesn't. This is the type of 'humour' that appeals to those teenage boys and others who think that dropping the F-bomb in an inappropriate situation is the height of sophisticated wit. The acting and comedy talent that is wasted here is just incredible. What are Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally doing in this? Did they not read the script before they signed on? This movie goes beyond just being unfunny, however. There are some parts of it that actually make you cringe. Kaley Cuoco's irritating computer voice is one example. Keegan-Michael Key's totally over the top characterisation as Gustav, the German (or something) aide to James Franco's character is another. To top it all off, this crap is just slightly short of being two hours long! I can't believe it watched it to the end. I almost didn't. Do yourself a favour and give this a miss.",Why Him

The material all around was terrible, but mostly James Franco just did a bad job delivering it. I don't even know if I laughed once during the movie.The comedy or lack thereof was unfunny.

66,SpoilerAlertReviews,Just a longer version of the trailer.,5,28 December 2016,"John Hamburg give us his latest comedy drama, being famed for writing the successful Meet The Parents and Zoolander movies, this film comes from the opposite angle, being the from the father's perspective. Also, Jonah Hill is on the writing/producing credits on this, though don't be expecting an appearance. James Franco plays the obnoxious, unfiltered, yet kind hearted millionaire techno-wiz who's fallen in love with Bryan Cranston's stunning daughter, Zoey Deutch and wishes to marry her. Of course, Cranston being the proud, protective father disapproves setting the basis for this comedy. Franco does well being any father's worse nightmare, proving a good bank balance is never enough to win them over.Megan Mullally, who plays the mother and wife, has said they had much freedom to improvise on the script where possible, and I believe it shows, not being a bad thing. She's actually one of the stronger characters, like their son, Griffin Gluck. I don't think Deutch gets enough screen time but it's mostly about Cranston character. The dad who desperately wants what he believes is the best for his daughter. Being a popular, over-extravagant millionaire Franco's character has a mass of famous names meaning cameo after cameo, including Steve Aoki, Elon Musk and a self-ridiculing Richard Blais. The soundtrack is good as expected but still no amazing scenes that films like Bad Moms managed to take full advantage of on more than one occasion. I suppose a couple of scenes come close but nothing that stands out, even with Aoki at the decks. Unfortunately, it makes the mistake many of these films do, which is show many of the key gags in the trailers which results in making the rest of the comedy feel like little fillers. It is funny but there isn't enough comedy to keep me entertained giving the best lines to Big Bang Theory's Penny, Kaley Cuoco and Keegan-Michael Key. It's a funny, awkward film with some clever script writing, a festive comedy to add to the Christmas movies list but is far off being one of the great comedies of the year.Running Time: 6 The Cast: 7 Performance: 7 Direction: 6 Story: 6 Script: 7 Creativity: 5 Soundtrack: 5 Job Description: 5 The Extra Bonus Points: 054% 5/10",Why Him

So it's not all bad. It's just a silly, over the top, in the moment, holiday, blockbuster Meet The Parents fun. Most of the humor came from James Franco. Bryan Cranston doesn't seem to do comedies as well as his drama.Maybe wait until you see it on netflix. It's worth no more than $10.00.

I'm definitely going to see it again, because I know for sure there were jokes I missed from the audience I was with was laughing so hard from the last joke. Be warned-- it does take full advantage of its R rating. It's very much in line with the Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg kind of films, in terms of its type of humor. If that's not your thing, then you probably won't find this movie nearly as funny as I did. But for a person who really loves Rogen's movies and his sense of humor, I found this film to be a blast. The direction by John Hamburg is also great. I don't think this movie is nearly as good of a movie as Hamburg's I Love You, Man, but it has more consistent laughs than that movie.

The film could have turned into a horror thriller, because Franco forces you, in the most entertaining way, to feel slightly off-balance. That alone keeps you glued to it in spite of the moronic lack of ideas. Bryan Cranston, of course, is sheer perfection.

But unlike Meet the Parents, this isn't nearly as funny or wonderfully chaotic as that. If you've seen Meet the Parents, then you don't need to see Why Him. Bryan Cranston is the unbalanced, and indecision father (Robert Di Niro), James Franco is the unusual and awkward boyfriend who gets under the dad's skin one way or another (Ben Stiller). Then you got the useless family members who's roles are only meant to give the actors paychecks, nothing more. Yeah, see what I mean. And the problem it doesn't offer anything new, just familiar territories. The only positive I can say is that James Franco and Bryan Cranston prove they are still great actors and I hope to see them in more significant films in the future. Is this the comedy of the year?

So yes it is a movie that will stand out. Even though it has gotten some hate.But I will recommend people to see it anyway because of the story and the characters. So yes it's worth the watch.,Why Him

The material had some original aspects and the actors all did good jobs in their deliveries. If adult language and humor upsets you then don't bother watching it, it is a movie for ""grown ups"".

The profanity content is massive! It's distracting! It's unbelievable. Some cameos near the end make you scratch your head. The movie was alright. Here are my thoughts: What I liked: Cranston is amusing as the Dad who just can't believe his daughter picked a scumbucket like Franco's character. It may be a one-joke plot, but the characters are what makes this work. Megan Mullally is fantastic, taking her character through a bunch of different comic turns. And I like seeing Cedric the Entertainer on the big screen again. He's a funny guy, and he doesn't make it into that many movies these days.What I disliked: The bad language (call me a prude!) was unrelenting. Zoey Deutch was unbelievable as her character, and pretty annoying, I'd say. The ending seemed tacked on, and a little long in my opinion, like the filmmakers wanted to add more to the story than needed.So... if you're a fan of anyone in the cast, you may sort of like this movie, but it isn't fantastic.

97,Ben_Cap,"Not as Bad as I Expected, But Also Nothing Special",5,5 January 2017,"The trailer for a movie can really get the viewer excited for a movie, or it can completely turn the viewer off. Why Him? unfortunate does not just have a trailer that falls into the later category, but is one of the worst trailers I can remember seeing. Not only did I not want to see the movie after seeing countless commercials for it, I actively wanted to hate it, if not just for that rock throwing gag that feels like the first thing cut out of Meet The Parents. Why Him? is not a comedic classic by any stretch, but the trailer really does a bad job of really conveying what the movie is really about, but honestly I don't even really think the movie knows what it wants to be.Why Him? starts off pretty well. Young collage student falls for an eccentric tech billionaire, who through the course of the movie makes some questionable choices regarding his actions around her family over a holiday weekend. The trailer would have you thinking you were in for a grand competition between James Franco and Bryan Cranston, but the movie makes efforts to prove that is not what is going on here. As the movie goes on it become more and more difficult to ignore what feels like a last minute addition of a Christmas setting by the studio to draw some of the holiday crowd, or the incredibly over the top use of dirty language. That is one of the worst advents in comedy movies over the last 25 or so years. Constant use of bad words do not make movies funnier and kids cursing does not count as good comedy.Why Him also suffers from the problem of not knowing what it is exactly about. About halfway through the movie, almost every character has proved them to be self centered or downright dis likable in some way shape or form, and they run into the problem where none of the easily predictable outcomes is really a good ending for the characters. This turns the ending into a mess where none of the emotional beats are even close to being well executed or satisfying.Other than the two lead roles, none of the characters get much to do. They seem to be missing for whole chunks of the movie and then brought back to help make a bad gag work and then we head back to the two leads. James Franco is actually pretty good here for about as much as he could do. His character is unlikable when he needs to be and can steal your heart in the next scene. To be fair this is basically the same role Franco has been doing for the last 3 years, but if it ain't broke don't fix it. Bryan Cranston is a funny dude, his role as Dr. Tim Whatley on Seinfeld is a beautifully subtle comedy role and then he really knocked it out of the park as the Dad in Malcolm in the Middle. He does not get to use any of the real comedic talent he has accrued in his career, rather being stuck to being the incredibly straight guy who for some reason has a ""crotch chop"" as his signature bowling move.Why Him? was not as bad as I expected, and while I understand that this is not the best way to talk a movie up, but really it's not that bad. I can't in good conscious recommend it, but I am sure there are people out there who like it and I can understand why. There is actually a decent foundation for an interesting comedy movie here, and I don't know what exactly happened along the way but Why Him? stinks of studio tampering and cuts. Not to mention the movie is way too long, at 1 hour and 51 minutes you are probably better off just leaving 20 minutes early and making up an incredibly generic movie ending, because trust me it will probably be better than what was actually filmed.",Why Him
98,slimer8489,I Hated This Movie,3,21 April 2017,"Every Christmas, my sisters have this new tradition where they take my mom and I and go see a movie. Last year, we saw Daddy's Home. This year, we saw Why Him? Oh boy...Firstly, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked stupid, unfunny, and really annoying. But I choose not to judge a book by it's cover, so I went and saw it. Besides, it's something to do.What I got out of this film was a real bad experience. For starters, it's one of those modern comedies that think that just plain swearing and private part jokes are funny. They're not. Swearing could be funny, but you have to make it funny by adding something to the swear. For example, the Angry Video Game Nerd saying things like ""F*ckfarts"". The main character, Laird, is pretty much nothing but a walking swearing and sexual humor machine. All that spews out of this guy's mouth is constant cursing and talking about wanting to plow his girlfriend's mother.... Eww. He's played by James Franco, who I actually respect as an actor and even a filmmaker. But he's really got to pick better movies. As for the comedy, well... Like I said before, it's nothing but swearing and sex jokes. Only a few random bits got a laugh out of me, like when Laird's trainer or whatever makes some random noise at a party, since I didn't see that coming. As for performances, well... James Franco is a complete annoyance, and the rest of the actors are passable. But the one I really feel bad for is Bryan Cranston. Seeing him go through all these lame comedic scenes, it doesn't feel like he's acting, it actually feels like he's really suffering on set. I mean, who could blame him? If you had to go through all this failed comedy, you'd be feeling miserable, too. Speaking of failing on things, this movie fails on the heart aspect, which seems to be absent from most comedies of today. You see, in a movie like this, there's always a scene where the straight man comes to understand the goofball and sees that he's not that bad of a guy. In Daddy's Home, they played it well, but here? All I remember is just Bryan Cranston randomly having a liking to James Franco, even though he didn't really change his ways or Cranston didn't really see the good in him.Overall, this movie is another one of the typical comedies that is shat out from Hollywood these days. It's annoying, it's unfunny, and it's completely stupid. Even though I hated this movie, there was one thing I actually liked, and that was a scene where Laird is going ""cheap cheap cheap"" to his chickens, only because this seems like a subtle foreshadow to the upcoming Disaster Artist movie that James Franco is attached to.",Why Him
99,mgratk,Did the Breaking Bad money run out?,2,22 October 2018,"If juvenile gross out humor and a 10 minute potty joke that feels like 20 are your thing, you probably still won't like this movie, because it's just boring and crude without any point. Yet, oddly, they try to sprinkle in some social justice to try to square themselves with the neo-puritanical left. I've dropped more f-bombs than a B-52 has dropped real bombs, but if you took them out of this movie you'd lose 2/3 of the script. But that's only a minor annoyance. The real problem is the often cringe-worthy awkwardness of truly dumpster fire dialog, and that the actors are mostly perfectly aware of the stench as they mouth the words.

101,nathannicolarobertscouk,Only in a comedy could the weak link be an Oscar nominated actor...,6,21 December 2016,"Possibly more so than any other genre, a solid ensemble cast (as well as the script, of course) is the absolute key to unlocking a decent comedy and unfortunately, the very central piece lets the whole film down: Bryan Cranston is not a leading comic and it very obviously shows. As one of this year's Best Actor nominees, Cranston fails to come across naturally in this lead role, with every joke and riff feeling more like a stiff and laboured effort than an organic energy, as the rest of his cast demonstrate, who are all more typically associated with the genre - and it really rather shows. His lead co-star, Franco, does a far more convincing job and manages to translate what should be an irritating and obnoxious character into a far more likable and funny character than expected. Megan Mullally is also worth a mention; the Parks and Rec star has a rather small role but manages to make quite the impression as Barb, even when the script doesn't quite serve her well enough, including a prolonged scene in which she is determined to have sex with her husband - this same plot was employed with absolutely hilarious results in Parks and Rec (in which she played the outrageous Tammy Two) but it falls completely flat here through no fault of her own. It's another example of a committed performance ploughing against all the odds. Talking of ploughing, the absolute star of this film is the youngest cast member - Griffin Gluck is continually hilarious and awarded the script's biggest laughs, but it is his conviction and joyous performance that secures these laughs, making him the most memorable element of the film, even with the lowest-billing of the main five stars.FULL REVIEW - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/12/why-him-2016-review.html",Why Him

I, however, prefer witty, clever humor and this definitely lacked in that department. It's a very far-fetched premise in that the James Franco character comes across as a complete idiot. The only thing he has going for him is that he's rich. That said, it makes no sense that the daughter has fallen for him, unless if she's a gold digger and she doesn't come across as one. No, she seems genuinely affectionate toward him yet also genuinely and deeply embarrassed by him. I'll go with a far-fetched premise, but in that case, the humor needs to be really stellar to carry the silly premise. In this case, it's not. I give it 5* because it held my attention just enough to finish it, and I quit a lot of movies.",Why Him

How do you lambaste a movie that was just so terrible that it makes you wonder why anyone would waste their money producing it. It also makes me wonder how and why James Franco is still involved in acting. He is without question, one of the worst actors of all time. And, don't get me started about Brian Cranston. It would have been nice if he had played it like the father in Malcolm in the Middle but he played it more like Mr. White from Breaking Bad. It was horrible. In fact, if you watch Drive and see Cranston in that - this role was almost identical to that one. And, although he can act, his character was just not fun nor funny. He played a straight man to what should have been the comedy of Franco but Franco didn't have funny lines so there was no need for a straight man.

106,Westcoastal,Misogynistic and just... bad,3,20 September 2017,"I wanted to like this movie. A friend really was enthusiastic about it and couldn't wait for me to see it. I came into it with an open mind, but it just didn't deliver anything I could enjoy.It's one of those films that is so 'male gaze' that it's almost unwatchable. The movie was supposedly about a woman dating a guy her father doesn't like, but she was almost completely irrelevant and peripheral to the story and the conflict. This is a perfect example of misogyny in Hollywood - women mattering only insofar as they affect the men, who are central to the story.It reminds me so much of ""The Adorkable Misogyny of the Big Bang Theory"". We are meant to forgive the utter misogyny we are presented with because ""Aww, look at how cute and harmless these guys are."" Sorry, it just doesn't fly.Misogyny aside it was just a weak film with almost no redeeming qualities. I laughed a few times, but mostly found the film dull and even embarrassingly bad at some points.You'd have to be a pretty big Franco/Cranston fan to enjoy this film.

107,YbsuhA,Surprisingly funny.,7,7 March 2021,"I wouldn't say Why Him? is surprisingly funny and hilarious, but I heard all the negative things about this movie, and then I watched it. And it was nothing like the critics said. It was at times very funny and entertaining, and I liked the movie a lot. I didn't love it, I thought it was okay, but good enough for a rewatch (which I just did).James Franco is hilarious in the lead role as the millionaire and playboy who dates the daughter to Walter White, who doesn't want him to marry his daughter. Ouch, the story could have been deeper. But the humour is sometimes brilliant and funny.I wouldn't say I didn't expect this movie to be funny. Although it got some bad critics, I liked it. A lot. I watched it only because of I like sometimes movies that others hate. Some of those movies is Pixels, Superhero Movie, and EuroTrip. Some pretty funny movies, and I don't understand why people hate them. Other movies with bad critics, like Cats, The Watch, and Mr. Popper's Penguins, I try to stay away from.There is a funny scene at a party where you've got a lot of famous people who came by the film studio, and thought ""I want to be a part of this"". Wow?! Adam DeVine and Andrew Rannells is actually pretty funny, but Keegan-Michael Key (in a bigger role) is a major problem with this movie. He makes all the bad scenes, and I don't quite understand why he has to be in this movie. I don't say that he is bad in the role, but he is (no offense btw).Bryan Cranston is pretty funny as the father of the (upcoming) bride, maybe. But he's not used to comedy, and I would love to see another actor take the role as the human version of Papa Smurf, just a lot more angrier.But this is afunny movie, and it has its funny moments.

The trailers did take a lot of the funny parts, and there was one part from the trailer that wasn't shown: when the dad throws a rock and it hits someone at the party.Anyways the ending was horrible. All of this ""its my fault no its my fault and the girl agreeing yes its your fault and her saying she'll do things for herself like selfishness is justified for her"". That was all bogus. It could have been really cute if they had a different ending. The bad ending was helped by having some comedy splashed in here and there. So if you ignore the story/plot ending and just look at the funny it was good. Also Laird was totally undone, his cool guy totally undone by eating out the girl scene. They turned him from a guy to a lesbian it was super disappointing, no guy does that. However I kept watching. The ultra high point for this movie was in the end when Laird is talking with the dad and the dad says ""you didn't marry her?"" and Laird said ""no I couldn't because you didn't give your permission"". That was some super awesome bonding. I liked it! Too bad it was surrounded by the crap ending as stated in second sentence of this paragraph.So starting with a great rating of 10, I took out 5 stars for the ""undoing"" which gets me to 5 stars, and then saw the average was 6.6 at time of this review. And a rating of 5 stars wouldn't affect that, and I had to bring it down due to the negatives mentioned above. So I went with 3 stars. But man Franco and Cranston were awesome awesome, if you ignore the negatives in previous paragraph.",Why Him

I literally had to FORCE myself to watch it all the way through. It should be a wake-up call to how selfish, egotistical and banal society has become. In many cases, people don't bother to actually raise their children any more. They just sit them in front of tech and expect them to come into adulthood perfectly balanced. The main character is SOOO coarse and it takes WAY too long to get to the message (if they intended one). It's almost like Jonas Hill & Company were trying to emulate Kevin Smith's formula of quirky basic human goodness and failed miserably. Honestly, I can't recommend anyone watch this movie. The only people who will enjoy it are the tech babies who can understand the cursing/stupidity/sexual idiocy.

We all knew that the dad was going to show up and the daughter's bf was going to be a complete opposite of what the dad is. After being shown around the house I was wondering, ""Okay, where does the movie go from here?"" I knew the bf was going to save the dad's business, it was obvious.I don't know much about James Franco, but it was hard for me to watch a guy who is almost 40 (the movie said he was 32) act like a 25 year old. His cussing got old and I felt he just wasn't a good fit for the part. There was no chemistry between him or his gf. The dad being annoyed just didn't feel real enough and it felt like some scenes were put in there just to take up time, i.e the bathroom scene was dragged out and so was the sex scene (just do the wife and get it over with).I felt the scenes were too predictable and so was the plot. It tried to hard to be funny. Maybe it was a funnier movie in theaters, but watching it at home it flopped.",Why Him
131,spsarkar,Seen Worse,6,4 February 2017,"First a confession. I love Zoey Deutch. She is cute, a very strong actor and although she is getting roles, she should be landing more substantial roles than being the love interest of debauched frat boys, deranged millionaire/billionaire, or side kick to a dirty old man. She deserves the roles that once went to Scarlett Johansson like in Lost in Translation. Zoey is a bit too old (funny that- she is only 21) for 'the Horse Whisperers' role but she needs to show she can pull the 'Black Swan' kind of roles. Even I cannot see her pulling 'Black Swan' or even 'Black Dahlia' with the roles she is being offered. She is a great actor, who also happen to be cute so give her roles that she is capable of. It is no coincidence that Great people are born on the 19th of November!Now returning to the movie. I see so many bad reviews here as if this is the first time an idiotic movie has been made. For crying out loud! Most of the sewage coming out of Hollywood are far far worse. This one was at least funny in parts. Brian 'Heissenberg' Cranston is a strong powerful actor, but after the 'infiltrator' he seems to be just banking his name in preparation of an imminent retirement/Stroke/both. His recent Political pronouncement and liberal politics is not a surefire way to stay in relevance. Having said that, he did a decent enough job but any half-decent actor would have done as well. The revelation is the little guy playing Zoey's brother who announces that he has arrived and you lot better believe it. James Franco, does a decent enough job again, in a role typecast to be an idiot, albeit likable in parts. I want to know however what was the deal with the Gustav character? What did he bring to the movie because the none-too-subtle homoerotic current that threatened to derail the movie. But then no one needs to take the movie seriously. It was funny at times, Zoey is great, Cranston OK and all of you have wasted far more important slices of your life watching Tina Fey and Amy Poehler..or Amy Schumer for that mutter. SO shut up with the hate. Hail the arrival of Zoey Deutch and feel blessed that now Scar Jo is an old hag, you got fresh talent coming up. I very much hope though that unlike her senior colleagues of the same bracket (cute child actors) such as Natalie Portman and Scar Jo, she learns to shut her mouth when it comes to politics. Frankly, no one gives a rodent's anus to what Natalie Portman or Scar Jo thinks of American Politics. Get over it already!",Why Him

That being said.. back to this movie.Usually a movie has to hit a sweet spot for me even trying to wrap my thoughts about it, let alone bother to review it. When i saw the trailer i thought.. that's it. The movie will only go downhill from here on out. But it didn't. It didn't brought unexpected surprises, well not many but it did what it promised: make you laugh and really feel good at the end of it. And when a movie makes up on its promises, then i feel its done its job. The grand moments, you've MOSTLY seen in the trailer, but there is still a lot that wasn't shown. Also the story line was still for most parts refreshing which was also a pleasant treat. Every cast member seemed to have fun with their role and the plot and that clearly shows. You also get some great cameo's who i wont spoil.So if you enjoy a funny movie that hits the sweet spots, then this one is for you. Don't believe all the hate posts.

I found it very funny, and 1/2 way through I was waiting for the sappy feel good crap to take over the movie- thankfully that didn't happen until the last 10 minutes, and the last 2 minute wrap up made up for it. I don't care if the jokes are sophomoric- as long as they are funny- which they were. I don't care if it had 'potty humor'- as long as it's funny. I watched it on HBO last night, and had to watch it a second time because at certain points I was laughing so hard I missed what was being said. I started watching with no high hopes, and ended up crying from the funny silly jokes- sploosh!

This one however, does not.The jokes often feel exaggerated and forced, and are embarrassingly childish with far too much profanity. I can't remember the last time I cringed so often. Sure, there was the occasional joke which received a giggle from just about everyone, but the majority of the humour was replied to with silence and head-shaking.

Liked the dad figure in Breaking Bad. The mum figure (Megan Mulally) was great in Will & Grace as Karen. However, although it's an interesting premise, father trying to decide if the potential son-in-law is good enough for his beloved daughter, the non-stop swearing and lack of funny jokes really spoiled it.It felt to me as though the idea had been given to them by a grown-up and then scriptwriters hired were teenagers who think its' daring & ""funny"" to swear constantly.There were a couple of chuckles but overall, it was pathetically unfunny.

Lots of hilarious uses of the words sh*t, f**k, t*tties, motor-boating and others that IMDb won't let me type.

That's not what happened. I just about laughed my head off throughout the whole thing. Unfortunately, each time I began to laugh that caused my cough to start up again, and then I would get to coughing so hard that I'd start hacking up great big wads of phlegm (and my dog would hop up off her bed and rush over to me to place her paw in my lap, her eyes full of worry; she probably thought I was dying). But, man oh man, it was great to laugh so hard on a day when I was feeling so under the weather.Why Him? is definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and because it made me laugh so hard (so many, many times), I'm giving it a 10 as well as a hearty thumbs-up.",Why Him

They have REALLY good actors and actresses working here, one of them arguably the best in the biz right now. And no matter how hard these people tried, it just felt so generic. So...so...lame.First, a sex joke here. Then, a pop culture reference there. Maybe some product placement over yonder and....Uh-oh! Time for a moment about how the older generation just doesn't understand the young people. Quick, let's make a joke about bukake.The plot moved so fast but the scenes felt so slow. It felt like there wasn't any time for development or arcs or any kind of reaction that the movie deemed worthy of its time.Case in point: there is a scene where Ned (Cranston) goes Christmas tree shopping with Laird (Franco). After some dialogue between the two about making it through rough times, Laird picks a Christmas tree that isn't on the lot, but is property of a rival game app company who are ""a bunch of dicks"". Laird borrows a random employee's chainsaw and tries to start it, unsuccessfully, multiple times before Ned steps forward, revs up the chainsaw with goggles on and smoke bellowing from the machine and...it cuts straight to them already halfway home with the tree, listening to KISS and talking about proposing.No joke.

155,aliceflupper,Heights of Disgust,1,5 September 2017,"A film with such stars as Bryan Cranston and James Franco commands attention. Watching the trailer, I was prepared for a feast of entertainment. Unfortunately, to tell that 'Why Him?' does not live up to expectations would be a compliment.The story-line seems basic but there are more comedies which use well-known stories in new ways. Unfortunately, in this case, the plot-less narrative proves to be the nail in the coffin. The rich- boy persona of the main character is neither funny, nor deep enough to be likable in spite of him obnoxious manners. He is exactly what he seems to be - a spoilt brat with cash. His behavior at meeting his potential in-laws is vulgar. There is a line between breaking rules for comedy's sake and being outright obnoxious. In this case, the failed attempts at humour resort to cursing, vulgar remarks and disrespecting people's privacy and decency. Even great acting fails to make a difference. It actually makes the film worse. The cast is devoted to their characters and their timing is impeccable, which unfortunately makes the base and stupid behaviors seem normal and merely trivializes them. Set in the Californian hills, and contrasting the family (the old-fashioned ways) with the young entrepreneur (the new ways), the implied statement is that we equate progress with obscenity.All in all, watching the film is an ordeal but it makes one reflect on the frightening direction that mainstream cinema is going in. Are the days of subtle romance, witty dialogue, and complex characters long gone? Is watching a man poop a fair replacement? Is this what audiences truly want today?Instead of making my day, this film has unmade it. It's definitely succeeded at one thing though - it's the first sad comedy I have ever seen.",Why Him

The majority of the audience appeared to be enjoying this old fashioned knock about comedy. The laughs come mostly from the crazy situations the Cranston and Mullalley characters find themselves in and also from James Franco's awkwardness around his girlfriend's parents. Keegan-Michael Key also has his fair share of the gags most especially when he has to help out Cranston's character with an automatic toilet, this is one of the funniest but at the same time low-key scenes I have seen in many years. All of the performances are fabulous each one brings their own style of comedy to the film and young Griffin Gluck holds is own with his older co-stars. I have read reviews of people complaining that there's no depth to this film but I disagree it's about one character wishing to feel a part of a family while another wanting to remain relevant in their family and work life.

161,mudplayerx,Decent for an At-Home Viewing,6,13 August 2017,"Let's get real here. Most of these reviews with abysmal scores were probably written by people who should have never gone to see the movie in the first place. Half of the reviews have scathing remarks for the actors. Why on earth would you go to see a movie that starred actors that you didn't like. That says more about their intelligence than the merits of this movie.Secondly, I do not understand these people blasting the movie for being to sick or depraved, or full of vulgarity. This movie was more or less in line with the target audience's acceptable level of debauchery. There was nothing over the top in the movie that I saw and I owe the negative comments towards this end to uptight people going to see a movie that maybe the marketing department misdirected their advertising towards. I can't believe people are going hysterical over potty humor when they go and watch movies with torture scenes, killings and other violence. Get over yourselves.With my foreword aside, the movie wasn't great, but it wasn't a total disappointment either. The actors played their parts well. The script may have been regurgitated and the humor struggling at times, but overall I found the movie just what I was looking for; lighthearted humor. I never laughed out loud, but I found myself smiling pretty often and that is good enough for me.In closing, I watched this movie at home. I didn't pay to go see it in a movie theater. While I probably would not have paid to see this on a big screen in retrospect, it was a decent movie for a night at home with the wife or with friends.ps - I found the actor playing the daughter annoying.

162,averageninjaface,Smug Hollywood Tripe,1,5 May 2017,"The film starts with a typical premise of father/daughter dynamic, daughters family is visiting to meet her boyfriend (Just like meet the fockers anyone?). Seems like a simple premise for a movie right? Seems like one could make a decent comedy in 2016 with a good script and ideal writers right? Well that's not what happened here, not at all.Foremost Deutch acts like an absolute idiot with her dialogue (""why do you love him? dad i just love him"") and a shameless skank in front of her own parents and little brother, there's a time and place for everything, yet these people don't comprehend that and are seemingly spineless cretins with no morals.Second, Franco is just another smug prick who likes to see himself on screen, nothing really to comment on there because he really doesn't have any good lines (or movies for that matter) and the character he ""plays"" really just seems like an accurate version of who he really is, a corrupt, inconsiderate man child who seems to have no respect for personal boundaries.Third, Cranston, why him? After all the good stuff Cranston did, Breaking Bad, Infiltrator, he does this tripe? If I were in this situation as a father, I would have already been planning out how to kill this scumbag. But there are so many over the top things that happen right in front of the poor guy (your own daughter having sex right above you? and the writers didn't think to make a change to that scene? like a confrontation?"" Horrible, and also the ""fight scene"" where Franco and Cranston fumble around on the floor like cavemen and Cranston doesn't know what an arm bar is so he puts his face in Francos crotch?? Really? That's some pathetic writing.Fourth, Elon Musk, what the hell are you doing here? Why do these celebrities always have to congregate on the sets of the worse films I may never know.Fifth, Steve Aoki is a crap DJ and hes just here for the $ and the cake.Sixth, Key was pathetic, he should just stick to doing skits because his character is not funny at all, faked/forced accent that does nothing for a good laugh.In conclusion this movie is just an utter failure and it opens your eyes to how sick and twisted Hollywood is. If this is the kind of crap they put on screen and into theaters just imagine what goes on in real life...Truth is stranger than fiction.

There have also recently been a bunch of comedies relying on the director's or the leads' reputation to carry the film to box office and critical success only to crash and burn upon release. This one is a rare exception. Congratulations to the team for getting it just right! James' Laird was a delicate balance. Annoying yet sweet, sometimes offensive but without being repulsive. Bryan's Ned fits the stereotype yet has been restrained enough to remain relatable. Even the cameo from Gene and Paul, though expected, came out fresh.If you're looking for a fun movie, give this one a try. Be forewarned though of the liberal use of profanities.",Why Him

Many reviews compared it unfavorably to Meet the Parents. I guess it's based on liking James Franco's character, Which I did. I didn't like Ben Stiller character. I couldn't imagine someone putting up with Robert De Niro character. Anyway everyone in the theater was laughing. Yes, lots of the F word, crude sexual jokes. I guess it is a matter of what kind of comedy you enjoy. I loved Brian Cranston in Malcolm in the Middle. He is without a doubt most excellent as Hal. Lots of people know him more for Breaking Bad.

I watched it with with my husband the first time and we equally found it hilarious (it's not often we enjoy a movie together).For me this is one of those movies where you can keep watching over and over without getting bored (I watched it 4 nights in a row once..) because honestly I think there's so many funny parts it keeps you entertained. Whether that's because I have a strong sense of humour I don't know as admittedly I do laugh at practically anything but it's not just the comedy I love it's the story, the characters, the acting and I love James franco.

175,eschimke,Completely different experience,10,2 January 2017,"I really do not understand all the bad reviews this movie has been getting. If you can get past the superficial aspects of Laird's (main character) language and boisterous behaviors, comes a tale that revives the plot of 'Meet the Parents' in a modern tech-savvy way. Why Him (2016) is a fun mix of spontaneous humor, emotional dilemma, and the juxtaposition between old and young generations. Laird and Ned have entirely distinct personalities and different incentives. It is worthwhile to see them reconcile there differences after many intimate moments. Indeed this movie is raunchy and over-the-top at times; just don't bring somebody who has not been/does not want to be exposed to the themes of these no-filter style movies. Watch with a serious eye, as within this film are many pearls of wisdom and life lessons. Often we neglect simple colloquialism and this film expresses pieces of conventional wisdom in a very heartwarming way.Why it wasn't a smashing success? I feel this movie may entertain some preconceived notions due to its trailer and not deliver on those expectations - which I saw after the fact. The trailer seems to take all the flair of the movie and condense it into 2.5 minutes without the substance or context, somewhat misleading viewers as to what kind of a movie will be seen.

191,dmgoldschmidt,A Raunchy Laughfest,9,26 December 2016,"This is a Hollywood comedy. It's clearly not supposed to be an art-film critique of society, although it does poke a lot of fun at the culture of Silicon Valley. The plot is simple: Ned (Bryan Cranston), Barb (Megan Mullally), and their 15 year-old son Scotty (Griffin Gluck) fly out to California from their Grand Rapids home to spend Christmas with their daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutsch). Upon arrival, they discover that she is in a relationship with bizarre tech billionaire Laird Mayhew (James Franco), attended by his hilarious major-domo Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key). The resulting culture clash provides the majority of the film's comedic opportunities, although there is a fair amount of pure physical comedy, many digs at the tech world, and a few pretty good stunts.Many reviewers, including professionals who should know better, have complained that this plot line is not new; and of course it isn't. But I don't see this as a very relevant criticism. After all, if every new movie had to have an original plot, we would have to abolish entire genres such as the RomCom (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl), to name just one.Why Him? has a well-deserved R-rating. It's raunchy, to say the least, and the dialogue is perhaps over-loaded with the F-word in particular. But the whole point of a comedy is to make you laugh, and I laughed a lot.

I would recommend being eighteen or older to watch this movie. Teenagers could connect with this movie because there is a lot of teen slang and culture in the movie. James Franco usually plays the frat boy or wild teen in movies. However, he plays an irresponsible adult in this movie. I like how he tries to impress his girlfriends parents by buying them things he thinks they would like. He goes over board and things get interesting. He has no filter and will say almost anything to anyone. When he talks to her parents he says some inappropriate comments and her parents are not impressed. He talks to her parents like he is talking to his friends and this causes her dad to dislike him. James has to earn there respect back and get them to approve of him.",Why Him
193,itsthelifeofsamson,Why him? Because he is funny,9,11 January 2017,"I loved this movie and I can say the same for everybody who was at the theater with me. This movie made the entire audience laugh from the very first minute till the last. This was a wow movie for me.James Franco showed that he is still a hot one in the Hollywood game and an intelligent and funny one as well as Bryan Cranston.'Why him?' This was the question Ned Fleming asked his daughter Stephanie. Why this guy? For sure he didn't like this young tech billionaire guy and wanted to know why his daughter chose to be with him.If we want to get serious here, I think this story tries to show how a dad who was so close to his daughter couldn't understand the changes he saw in her after she went to college. To him, his girl had changed a lot and not just physically but otherwise. She was grown and there were some things she just felt was hard to say out.James Franco played Liard, the CEO of a video game company. This guy wasn't a nerd or a geek. He was outspoken/free-spirited. Due to poor upbringing or parental guidance he lacks the social know how not being able to differentiate what's good to say from what's wrong to say. He just says what comes to him, hence releasing all forms of curse words when he sees fit. Despite that, he is a good guy and he tries his best to show that by impressing his girlfriend's dad. But Ned on the other hand sees it as his own way of 'putting his mark on every member of the family'. Bryan Cranston portrayed the old-fashioned owner of a printing press company that was struggling to get customers as all of them are going high tech. He was the loving husband and father who was scared of change. He didn't want to accept that his company was creeping and that his daughter whom he loved very much was going to leave one day and stay with a guy he doesn't even trust.Griffin Gluck was the 15 years old son who was good at business. Pitching his ideas to his dad but getting turned down.Megan Mullaly was amazing and funny, playing the uptight wife. She kind of likes Liard but she waits for the approval from the big guy, her husband.Zoe Duetch sees all and knows all. She knew the situation her father was in. She begs for his patience at the same time asking for improvement from Liard. The cast is experienced that they fit in perfectly in their roles.

I found it really really funny from start to almost finish. Each character has his or her moment but Keegan Michael Key stole the show as far as I'm concerned (and I found it quite brilliant the way his character's most humorous scenes always had something just a bit scatological about them. It's been my experience that German cussing and humor tends to be on the scatological side and his character Gustav is supposed to be German. :) )I loved it all the way until the very end when the writers decided to insert a bunch of feminist nonsense. Here's where the spoiler comes in. At the end of the movie Laird proposes and Stephanie turns him down, deciding to stay with him but go back to school. She goes on a bit about how she isn't property to be passed around from father to boyfriend all because the earnest but awkward Laird asked for her father's permission before proposing. No room in feminism for old fashioned family oriented courtesy. I almost walked out at that point but I wanted to see how it ended (and while I think it great the character decided to go back to school, that could have happened without her refusing to marry Laird.). God for bid we have a traditional happy ending in a romantic comedy. This pretty much ruined the movie for me.

And another thing, The Laird character is what most people would wish for, someone who is unique and peculiar but you know for sure they are head over heels for you.

It has positive messages and I laughed many times, sometimes heartily and uncontrollably. Franco's character is ultimately endearing. Like the movie as a whole, he's raunchy, in your face, and ridiculous. But it works. Bryan Cranston's character *could* have utterly sucked as the straight-man fatherly type, but... it's Bryan Cranston and he brought precisely what the character needed. There's a few really silly parts that some might find kind of tiresome, but this movie has no shortage of funny scenes, and it doesn't drag even though it's almost 2 hours long.

203,bjerkli1995,A horrible unfunny mess,1,20 January 2019,"The movie is full of known celebrities and great actors, too bad their abilities are not used at all in Why him?You would think with so many talented people working on this movie, that something must have gone well, honestly it didn't. There are a few scenes that can make you chuckle, but other than that the movie is a disaster.The plot is simple. Ned and his family go visiting their daughter as she has moved away because of college. Once they get there, they meet Laird, her boyfriend she never told anyone about. Apparently they live together now, she is planning to quit college and Laird is an obnoxious character that drives Ned crazy. They both come into supposedly 'funny' shenanigans and try to learn the value of family. Or so they try to...The characters are not developed at all. They come off as boring or obnoxious. Laird the boyfriend curses with every sentence and it gets boring after the first minute. We get it, you can't stop swearing. Please stop, the joke is dead. He is painted as this good boyfriend, in some ways he is but mostly obnoxious, stupid and most of all unbelievable. He is meant to be modern and intelligent but comes off as just annoying. Everything he does is over the top in a none fun way.The father who cares for his daughter has every right to be upset, but he is treated like a plot device. Everyone reacts negatively to him, when in reality you side with him for disliking Laird. He finds out his daughter has been lying to him about dating Laird, is planning to quit college, got a tattoo of his name on her hip, is going to work on a none profit that her boyfriend made and much more. Any father would be upset. You come and visit, she lies about her living situation, her boyfriend swears all the time, hits on your wife inappropriately, talks constantly about how it is to bang your daughter, is disrespectful, tattoos your daughters face and name on his body after they just met and now has tattoos of the whole family on his back. Clearly Laird is immature, acts without thinking, can't make proper decisions and the only reason he is rich is because his mother forced him to learn coding at a young age. The father has every right to be upset and not trust this guy. If Laird broke up with Stephanie, she would be broke, have no job and quit college for nothing.The movie forces you to dislike Ned for not trusting or liking Laird. Laird is so disconnected to ever being human that you cannot feel for him. The scenes you are supposed to feel sorry for him, you just can't, because there is nothing genuine about the guy. Even when he does nice things, you know it's forced and only there as a plot device, because it's so over the top all the time. Everything is so random and does not make sense at all.It's so stupid that the whole family at the end is mad at Ned, when in reality they should be much more critical of Laird. Ned is also hard to like, as he always acts grumpy and does not show much affection. Everything in the movie is very forced. Stephanie is painted as this wonderful, smart girl, which they keep addressing, but you know it's false. She acts stupidly, gets angry at her father for being upset by her choices and at the end blames her boyfriend and father for ruining Christmas, when in reality it comes down to her horrible choices. She could have been honest from day one about her situation and her horrible choice in men.The whole concept of a father disliking a new boyfriend could have been fun. It's been done many times before. Laid could have been a fun character, but in a movie that has no rules or sense to it, it's completely ruined. Characters can be over the top, it's worked a lot of times before, but in this movie, it just does not work.It's lazily written, the dialog is a snooze fest and everything feels forced. The camera shots are not much interesting and the toilet jokes gets old quickly. The plot isn't particularly interesting and does not add anything new to the table as it's extremely predictable. It's such a waste of a time and money. I would not recommend this movie at all.",Why Him

210,alanale,I would buy it on DVD and watch it again,9,25 December 2016,"Still not surprised movies like this get that borderline satisfactory 6 or 6.5 stars.. honestly I think when going into a comedy like this, you gotta remember that everything aside, you're here to watch it to feel good and make you laugh. I'm not part of the Academy so maybe my standards aren't so high but I think this movie did just that- in fact the whole theater was laughing the entire way through! Plot is recycled for sure- disapproving dad, new boyfriend stepping into the picture, the whole shebang. But this movie does it well and the characters although fitting into the archetypes of this movie type, feel fresh and you find yourself liking ALL of them because they're all charming for sure. I don't know if I was expecting it to be bad because of the cruddy reviews in here but seriously, just go watch it because it seriously surpassed all my expectations. It's a little raunchy but that's what the R rating is for, so don't roll your eyes when you hear penis jokes, just laugh~ I honestly enjoyed this film so much that I'm probably going to buy it on DVD and watch it again when they release it. JUST GO WATCH IT AND JUDGE IT FOR YOURSELF!",Why Him
211,marinacaric,It's a movie worth a watch!,8,28 December 2016,"I don't understand why there's so many bad ratings on this movie. I had good time in movies and the film was awesome. I laughed a lot and the casting was just perfectly chosen. If you're looking for a good movie that is gonna make you laugh, then i recommend this one. You wan't regret! The only minus about the movie is that it's not recommended to watch for people under 16 years old. The jokes were mostly dirty but that it's what makes it fun. I don't find this movie childish at all! I gave it 8.5/10. So basically just don't watch it with your children. And you'll be fine. And I would also like to add a good comment about James Franco acting. He was hilarious and I just couldn't see a better fit for this character.",Why Him
212,negative-79746,Hilarious awkward cringeworthy rom-com,10,30 December 2016,"This is not the vow or dear john This is a great awkward funny untraditional rom-com It has its stupid moments, cringe moments but it's hilariously well done. If your someone who doesn't take life too seriously you'll enjoy this film. The bad reviews left On here must be from viewers who clearly imagined that it was going to be the next notebook. Francos facial expressions alone will have you laughing out loud. The first 20min of this movie I was a bit worried it was going to be very tamed and 'disney' but Franco sure put those fears to rest with his first scene. There's a few celeb sightings through out, some warm father moments. Yes it has more than enough dick jokes and sexual innuendos and animal sex paintings but it's all harmless fun that just wants to make you chuckle",Why Him
213,themoviegovenor,A comedic masterpiece... if you like James Franco!,7,5 January 2017,"Last week, after a busy festive period I decided to take a break from the wave of blockbuster movies currently available to watch and decided to go a little more light hearted in the way of James Franco and Bryan Cranston's newest release, Why Him? All the big movies out currently such as Rogue One, Assassin's Creed, and Passengers all cater to the same viewing audience which means Why Him? could possibly speak to moviegoers looking for a change-up in the holiday movie lineup, it definitely did to me and so it will be interesting to see what success that may bring to the table.The plot did leave a little something to be desired but they usually do with comedies, however, with a wonderfully selected cast it resulted as a comedic masterpiece. Cranston, best known as the big bad meth cook 'Walter White' returns to his comedic genius from back in the days of Malcom in the middle and Seinfeld and he is wonderfully supported by James Franco who is notoriously known for his crude and outlandish behaviour from films such as Pineapple Express and The Interview and he plays his character terrifically, in fact, he basically acts as himself, but I found it to be hilarious, especially with the conflict of personality between himself and Cranston's characters.A surprisingly funny aspect of the film, was in the form of Laird's assistant, played by Michael-Keegan key (from Key and Peele). Whilst he did not have too much screen time, the time that he was on the screen continually had the audience in stitches. Without revealing too many spoilers, there was one skit that ran throughout the whole film between Laird and his assistant and it never failed to make the audience laugh!I rather enjoyed Why Him? It was most certainly worthy of its 15 age rating and if you do not like gross out and crude humor than Why Him? may not be for you, if however, you are like me, then you should definitely get yourself a spare couple of hours and head down to the cinema to give it a watch!",Why Him

215,londascott,How vile and disgusting can you get!,1,18 January 2017,"This movie is an exercise in how revolting they can go. But stupid scatological humor, and a plethora of f-bombs is one thing; when disgusting explicit sexual descriptions come out of the mouth of children, well I think this descends into the category of child pornography. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed.I didn't expect this kind of movie from an actor like Bryan Cranston, or the director of ""I Love You Man"". There must be a grown-up somewhere in the process, you would think, to say no, this is beyond decency. I've seen a couple films from Jason Bateman, ""Bad Words"" and ""The Change-Up"", that both put children in sexual situations, which should be offensive to everyone. Studios need to feel repercussions from foisting this kind of sleazy contemptible depravity on unsuspecting audiences.",Why Him
216,martynaspalumickas,An underrated family movie everyone should watch.,7,4 April 2017,"The whole movie is basically nothing without James Franco, he makes this movie perfect. The beginning of the movie is poorly done, adding some happy music every ten minutes. Of course amazingly done performance by Brian Cranston and Keegan-Michael Key. Just in general a decent movie with a bunch of inappropriate and immature jokes which makes the movie funny.",Why Him

218,kassynisavior,Awful movie,3,11 March 2017,"This is a rehash of the same script from previous movies, only it's crude. The way the daughter was portrayed in the movie makes me cringed. If this is how teenagers and young women are in this generation then my God boys and men would be overjoy. This daughter, at 22, is basically a slut for the guy. What guy would not want this? No matter how the movie coat's her, she is basically a dumb slut. That yoga scene, WTF.I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. The script and characters are not well thought out, other than the parents. Cranston is the only reason I endured through this movie. I love Sausgage Party, but this I cannot stand.",Why Him
219,nicolacroshaw,How times have changed!,8,12 March 2017,"This is my first review as I felt compelled to say that I laughed out loud throughout the entire movie. As a 50+ female, it was fun to compare and appreciate old-school values with today's techie world - love IT or loathe it, still hysterical. Watch and enjoy how times have changed. Don't judge as this is an accurate reflection of today's reality ...... sad but true.",Why Him

No big story or some unspeakable content, but it is well directed and the performance of the actors is exceptional. A fun movie to pass the time, guarantees many laughs. The main point of the film is the comedy, really very, very funny. James Franco is enshrined as a versatile actor, and delights the spectator. I point out for a Sunday afternoon, it's worth every minute.",Why Him
221,marie-bourgois,Nice,6,26 June 2017,"Graphic Filmo Adventure more fun, but not super fan The idea of departure seems very nice but the unfolding very beginning takes a little ruin on the middle of the film Pity because the actors are good but the scenario or the length of the film does not follow the cadence Not bad but passed next to something really taking I still recommend this movie, fan of the director, who will do better next time it's on",Why Him
222,leslyg-78967,Is a funny movie,8,5 April 2017,"Why Not Him Dad? James Franco's movies are always funny and ""Why Him?"" is not an exception. ""Why Him?"" is definitely not a family movie. The movie is Rated-R because it has inappropriate language. However, some of the lines have a sexual innuendo, like this one: ""Remember when we made love in the hot tub I mean it was not sexual at all. Steph opened up like a flower, Laird said. In all comedy movies, family relationship humor is always occurring. When Laird told Ned that he was going to start to calling Ned dad and Ned said, ""Don't think that is going to happen."" Ned is an over-protective dad; he does not want his baby girl with a crazy and an older-ish guy. Barb (Steph's mom) is one of those moms that let their kids choose who they want to be, but Barb is kind of in love with Laird's toilet. What I did not like it was when Laird and Ned stole a big Christmas tree. Laird is a millionaire why he did not pay for it. The movie should it be funnier if they would it made a series about fighting how to buy the Christmas tree I had a low expectation on this movie because two of my friends told me that ""Why Him?"" was not a good movie. It is not the best comedy movie I have seen because the language is not for kids. Overall, I found my best-friend and I laughing more than I expected. I'm rating this movie 8/10 it definitely was a funny movie.",Why Him
223,kiarash-39751,"Worst movie I have ever rented from Redbox, with just a couple of good scenes",1,21 May 2017,"My 74 year old dad saw the movie and recommended it to me. i myself picked the movie because i saw the phrase ""a SF bay area tech mogul who doesn't have a filter"" in the synopsis. My dad doesn't understand English very well. So i was surprised with a whole lot of crude (an understatement) language. The best part of movie was when the middle aged parents get turned on by the protagonist's party thrown for them. i believe that the movie does a good job of portraying the vast universe of difference between the Old World (printing presses) and the New World (digital technology). i went in thinking this is an innocent rom com. We have seen the likes ... such as Meet the Fockers... however, i was totally turned off by the movie's crude humor. also the sexual situational content was simply too much. i just want to warn those wholesome guys and girls still left in this so called modern world from renting this movie and then debating a refund or sticking with the movie to get a happy ending. There is a happy ending, nevertheless, for me it involved too much psychological torture.",Why Him

I laughed quite a bit thinking well heck I get treated as if I was as crude as this dude and I have to laugh even tho the cussing was excessive! Some things do work well with the movie and life's humor like being naked always deters visitors. The opening up like a flower was priceless. This guy doesn't put his best foot forward at all nor does he care. I have to say I at least tried so part of it is depressing but at least it could be worse.,Why Him

My faith in humanity has been restored a bit based on most of the reviews I have read. This is probably the first comedy I have ever watched where I had to shield my eyes because I was terrified to watch what would be next. This movie goes beyond just burning brain cells. To say that it is lewd and raunchy does not begin to describe it. Only watch this movie if you enjoying cringing the entire time.",Why Him

Felt like a comedy for the long flight ahead so decided to give it a crack. Was unsure a couple of minutes in but very happy I stuck with it. Let's just say my laughter was distracting my friend from reading so much, she had to start watching it for herself. We both haven't had a nearly 'peeing myself laugh and crying laugh' in a movie for a very long time and this certainly delivered.

228,benbloom-04031,"why Walter White, why?",2,7 October 2017,Surprised that Brian Cranston signed on to such a ham-fisted clunker of a film that seems thrown together and flimsy. Thin plot line and unmemorable performances under-compensate for an incessant tiresome stream of raunchy sex/scatological jokes that are unclever and crude. File under unfunny comedy.,Why Him
229,suzannecarroll,Why this?,2,1 October 2017,"Sometimes, when watching a movie billed as a comedy, and finding myself over an hour into it without cracking a smile, I ask myself, ""Why? Why did I waste these precious moments of my life on such crap?"" This was my exact sentiment during this film. Contrived, sophomoric and actually quite boring. If you want to experience those feelings, by all means, watch this two hour exercise in profanity- laced verbal exchanges between unlikable, one-dimensional characters. I gave it two stars because I normally like Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally, and they give it their best despite having minimal material to work with.",Why Him
230,mfostermarks,Funnier now than in 2016?,7,30 May 2021,"Maybe it's because I'm from Michigan and am even older than the parents in the film, but I laughed out loud a lot at this movie. It hit home in an absurd but knowing way. And maybe the riffs on things like Alexa and vaping are funnier now because they are even more true. I will go so far as to say it may be funnier than The Fockers films and has a more feminist message. And the subsequent work of all the actors, including the young Griffin Gluck, and the writer Jonah Hill, make it a treat to see their earlier work. So surprised that I liked it after seeing how the critics were so lame about it five years ago. But I can see why all these good people signed on and I think they pulled it off better than given credit for. That said, it is unabashedly stupid a lot of the time. But it's hoot now!",Why Him
