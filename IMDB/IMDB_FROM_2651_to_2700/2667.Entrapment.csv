0,bkoganbing,Bad guys have more fun,6,31 January 2017,"Entrapment casts Catherine Zeta-Jones as an insurance investigator anxious to earn her spurs in the business by capturing notorious thief Sean Connery. Connery is looking every bit sixty plus years of age, but he's in good shape and while he lives pretty good as is, he's always up for a challenge.Zeta-Jones is sent by her boss Will Patton to capture Connery. But Connery is up to anything she can throw at him. Her best bet could be to capture him in the act of pulling a job, but after a while just who is leading who on.Entrapment boasts some nice location cinematography in Connery's native Scotland and in Kuala Lampur where the big caper takes place. It's a bank job, but in the computer age it's something different if you're going after a big score. Connery showing his age asks quite innocently 'where's the loot?'How will it go for Zeta-Jones? Well bad guys seem to have more fun and Patton is such a drip. Ving Rhames is in this as well and his role is most ambiguous. The aging Sean Connery still has some great moves in Entrapment.",Entrapment
1,SnoopyStyle,Grandpa buglar Team lack sexual chemistry,5,24 January 2014,"Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) works for an insurance company, and suspects old master thief Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery) is responsible for the latest improbable theft of a high price artwork. She tracks him down to propose stealing a valuable mask.This has a very weak cat and mouse game between CZJ and Conner. It's more innuendo and sexual gamesmanship than actual compelling story. None of it is worthwhile. The two leads would work better as a grandfather granddaughter team, and has as much sexual chemistry as that. It's an excuse for CZJ to roll around in skin tight clothing and get caught naked. As for the capers and exotic locations, they are a bit of fun distraction. It's kind of sad to see Sean Connery in this.",Entrapment
2,Prismark10,Hitting the heights,6,12 August 2017,"Entrapment is a solid heist thriller, certainly implausible, the unusual Kuala Lumpur locale keeps it interesting when at the time the Petronas Towers were the tallest building in the world, now they are just the tallest twin towers in the world!Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an investigator for a US insurance company. She is also a secret master burglar. Her admiration is for her quarry, legendary thief Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery.)Instead of tracking her down she joins forces with him to rob $8 billion dollars from the Petronas Towers on Millennium Eve. However we can sense more twists as Baker's boss senses a double cross and MacDougal also has an agenda of his own.Fellow Celtic actors Connery and Zeta Jones seem to have a good chemistry but the age difference between them really makes the film slightly nauseating although Zeta Jones does like a mature man as she went on to marry Michael Douglas.",Entrapment
3,jboothmillard,Entrapment,5,13 July 2005,"""Entrapment is when cops do thieves"", and that is exactly the idea. Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a professional thief, she stole the Rembrant and she works for some company that wants to catch another thief. This other thief, Robert 'Mac' MacDougal (the excellent Sir Sean Connery) meets Virginia and they live together in a mansion. He has very good techniques to help her train and she does not approve of all of them. They plan to steal a priceless mask. When they succeed, she then plans to rob a bank on Millennium night. If they do not do it on the Millennium night, then they never can. Also starring Ving Rhames as Aaron Thibadeaux and Mousehunt's Maury Chaykin as Conrad Greene. A very good film where Connery dominates with his slight charm and good need for adventure. I think the critics got it wrong, it really isn't that bad. Worth watching!",Entrapment
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Movie Shouldn't Have Fallen Flat, But It Did",6,11 May 2006,"I have this film two chances and liked it much better the second time. I guess I expected more on the first viewing, but why not? Sean Connery usually is good, Catherine Zeta-Jones was a hot, new commodity at the time, and I usually enjoy heist films. This movie had not just one but TWO heists in it, so it should have been really good.....but was fair, at best.It just wasn't that entertaining, too flat in too many spots. Connery looked at times like he was just going through the motions. His usual spark was missing. It's not bad....so-so as a thriller goes, but really not memorable and certainly not as dramatic as it should have been.",Entrapment
5,rmax304823,Short Refractory Period.,7,11 April 2013,"An enjoyable, good-natured thriller, in which Sean Connery is one of those master thieves and Catherine Zeta-Jones is an undercover FBI agent who wiles her way into his company to pull off a joint job.Two joint jobs, as a matter of fact, with virtually no refractory period between in which the viewer can recover his breath. The first one introduces us to one of the film's best scenes. While the dynamic duo are practicing for their first ""Rififi""-style theft of a heavily guarded Oriental mask, Catherine Zeta-Jones, with her skewed irises and her abundant bilateral symmetry, performs a number of slow-motions gymnastics and grotesque arabesques in a skin-tight suit. And a very artistic scene it is, too.The second thrilling scene takes place while the duo are trying desperately to inch their way from one of the tallest buildings in the world, in Singapore, to the other tallest building in the world. Their only support is two smallish steel cables, one to walk sideways on, and one to hold on to over their heads. They have about one hundred yards to cover. I won't describe their difficulties because if you've ever seen a movie with a dangerous crossing of a rope bridge or something, or a movie about someone dangling by a line that's parting thread by thread, you already know the breathtaking, spine-tingling, nerve-wracking devices that are on display.What happens at the end? Well, no power on earth could force me to give away the fact that it involves twisted identities, love, and Catherine Zeta-Jones winding up with one billion dollars tucked somewhere around her handsome body.Younger viewers might not realize that the approach of the year 2000 -- the millennium -- was heralded by near panic among many of the public who believed that all the computers would go berserk at midnight on New Years and the world would end and we would all go to hell where we would have to listen to twelve-tone music for eternity.",Entrapment
6,Tweekums,A fun caper movie,8,9 August 2012,"As the movie opens we see a daring burglary taking place; the burglar descends the outside of a skyscraper then carefully removes a window before entering and stealing a painting, audaciously posting it through the companies own post system then exiting... all the while this is going on an unknown person watches what is happening through a telescope. The next morning insurance investigator Virginia 'Gin' Baker is sure she knows who did it: Robert McDougal; a Scotsman renowned for such thefts. She heads to London and when they meet she tells him that she is planning a robbery and needs his help. They fly to his castle in the West Highlands and plan the crime; here we also learn a little more about the original theft. The proposed theft goes ahead but it turns out the item being stolen isn't the ultimate goal; she says it is just the fee she must pay to acquire the means of committing the real crime; to steal eight billion dollars at the stroke of midnight as the world celebrates the beginning of the year 2000! The plot of this film is preposterous of course but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun. Catherine Zeta-Jones does a memorable job as Gin; few male viewers will forget the scene where she shows off just how flexible she is when practicing for the first robbery! Sean Connery is good as McDougal; he may have been getting on a bit when he made this but his character is no less believable that the film itself. There is plenty of enjoyable action despite the film's light tone. As in many such films there are plenty of great locations including the stunning Eilean Donan Castle and Blenheim Palace in the UK and the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur; these locations are used well without looking like a release from the local tourist board. Over the course of the movie there are quite a few twists which I've strived to avoid spoiling as some of them are genuine surprises; at least they were to me.Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a light hearted caper movie with little in it to cause offence so it can be enjoyed by youngsters as well as adults without worrying about unsuitable material.",Entrapment
7,moonspinner55,Slick and disposable star-vehicle...your mind flushes it away while you're watching it,2,16 July 2010,"Globe-trotting adventure about the attempt to nab an infamous cat burglar by a beautiful insurance investigator who may not be what she first appears. Confusing, derivative, and underwhelming teaming of two attractive stars, Sean Connery and Catherine-Zeta Jones, who look good while encased in this glittery, shallow box. Beneath its slick exterior, the film is merely a retread of several heist pictures from the past--better ones, mind you, than this. One stops counting the clichés after a while, during which time the foolish and formulaic script from Ron Bass and William Broyles nearly sinks the charismatic couple in the foreground. * from ****",Entrapment
8,Quinoa1984,"Good stars, good action, good movie",7,15 January 2001,"Sure Sean Connery always gives a film a boost, but here, Catherine Zeta Jones (who did have her first break in Mask of Zorro but makes a breakthrough here) steals the show with undeniably hot sexuality and finely tuned skills.  She plays a insurance person (or does she totally) who has to track down Mac (Connery), an retired thief.  But soon the two go into cahoots and go after big prizes (if you catch my drift).  Surprisingly good thrills and some other good things bring this film to be...good. B+",Entrapment
9,edwagreen,Entrapped-Don't Get Caught Up in This One *,3,21 June 2009,"Terrible film which is muddled throughout despite Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones in it.I think that Connery and Jones should have stuck with that Oscar show several years ago when he announced her the winner of the best supporting actress award for ""Chicago."" There was more chemistry between those 2 stars in that brief moment then in this entire film.Confusing isn't the word for this. Zeta-Jones is supposedly an agent going after Connery for being a crook. Unknown to her, her superiors suspect that she is a crook as well. The two plan heist after heist and do some mighty climbing throughout, but that's about it.The ending seems that Connery has fooled Zeta-Jones but love intervenes. It doesn't help in this absolutely choppy heist.",Entrapment
10,michaelRokeefe,Can stealing be an art form? Convincing look.,5,13 November 2000,"This movie is one of those that keeps the characters purpose twisting and turning. You have to second guess the ending twice. The vivacious Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a top notch insurance agent that specializes in art theft. She takes on the mission of catching a master thief(Sean Connery)by convincing him that she too is a supreme art thief.Just enough action to keep your attention. Wonderful scenery and the more than just beautiful Zeta-Jones makes for advanced heartbeat. The age difference of the two stars fits the script like a glove and gives a fleeting glimpse of romance.Camera work is intense. The big chase/escape scene is awesome.Also appearing are: Ving Rhames, Maury Chaykin and Will Patton.",Entrapment
11,LeonLouisRicci,Finger Down the Throat Awful,1,13 August 2013,"Cringe-Fest of the first order. Full of expensive Scenes at the expense of anything involving or Entertaining. It even fails as a bit of attractive Fluff. It misses at every turn and is a grueling get-through and an embarrassment to all involved.Sean Connery is a good Actor but his choice of Roles after James Bond is mind boggling. A lot more misses than Hits. CZJ is attractive and competent and can add some dimension to one dimensional Beauty parts, but this is one unattractive Movie.The Plot is laughable, hard to follow at times, seems incompetently disjointed and misfires in all three Acts. The ending is unwatchable and the icing on this deflated cake is the finger down the throat Romance forced on the Audience, when in the beginning they promised not to. This Film fails to deliver on anything it promised.",Entrapment
12,CinemaSerf,Engaging take on some of the Y2K conspiracy theories...,7,23 August 2020,"I quite enjoyed this cyber-crime caper - the two stars have a chemistry that largely gets past the slightly fluffy dialogue and far-fetched plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones is, ostensibly, an insurance operative sent to help catch arch thief ""Mac"" (Sean Connery) once a valuable Rembrandt is taken form an seemingly impregnable high-rise office. It transpires that she has other fish to fry, however, and before long the poacher and the gamekeeper have a grand design to commit the creme de la creme of computer hacks without getting caught. It's at it's best during the heist planning stages, though sadly falls away a bit during a rather poorly constructed last twenty minutes that also introduces a romance that I found a bit cheesy. A pretty wooden Ving Rhames features - luckily, quite sparingly - as a duplicitous FBI agent but Maury Chaykin is really quite good as the odious, sexually ambiguous fixer ""Conrad Greene"". Worth a watch.",Entrapment
13,anaconda-40658,Get Entrapped.,7,8 June 2015,"Entrapment (1999): Dir: Jon Amiel / Cast: Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton, Maury Chaykin: Well crafted action film about being caught but not so much within a crime but within a relationship. It is about technique when committing theft. Sean Connery plays a elderly thief who steals art paintings and Catherine Zeta-Jones plays an agent assigned to bring him in but she wishes to steal the Chinese mask and needs his help. Detailed plot that gets lost in its action scenes particularly in the conclusion where nothing makes sense. Well crafted by director Jon Amiel whose credits include Copycat and The Man Who Knew Too Little. He is successful when it comes to different genres and subjects. Action is exhilarating but it is the psychological aspects of the thieves that draws us in. Connery is excellent as a thief unreeling charm and intelligence as if baiting. Zeta-Jones is graceful in her romantic curiosity and physical skill. Supporting roles are unfortunately cardboard. Ving Rhames and Will Patton appear in flat supporting roles that are beneath the two leads that overshadow it all. This is a film that depends on the strength of its leads because other roles pass through with very little to make them broad or interesting. Clever in its examination of crime and skill with luring romance and stunning sets that may captivate and entrap viewers. Score: 7 / 10",Entrapment
14,HotToastyRag,Watch it for the eye candy,6,14 December 2017,"Sean Connery plays an accomplished and uncatchable art thief in the seductive thriller Entrapment. While Will Patton isn't fully confident of her ability to finally nab the classy criminal, Catherine Zeta-Jones thinks she can handle it because she's a beautiful woman. So, she pretends to be a fellow thief to ""entrap"" him, but who's trapping who?The famous scene in Entrapment is the one featured on the promotional poster: Catherine Zeta-Jones is dressed in a skintight leather jumpsuit and has to ungulate her way in and out of security lasers in order to steal something. If you want to watch that, you can rent the movie. If you think those types of movies are overrated or you're the one person in the world who doesn't think Catherine is attractive, you probably won't like this one. She is a universally beautiful and sexy woman, and who wouldn't want to watch a movie where she's paired up with James Bond?",Entrapment
15,Wuchakk,"Millennium heist flick with Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Catherine's derrière",7,3 September 2018,"Gin, an insurance agent with the curious skills of a cat burglar (Catherine Zeta-Jones), is sent by her employer (Will Patton) to wiggle into the company of aging British master-thief ""Mac"" MacDougal (Sean Connery). He tentatively accepts her but insists on arduous training before stealing a priceless Chinese mask from the well-guarded Bedford Palace. Their developing attraction and suspicion threaten to ruin their partnership but the lure of $8 billion from a heist at the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, maintains their alliance.I usually don't like heist flicks (because I'm not interested in the glorification of criminals), but the charisma of Connery and the beauty of Zeta-Jones keeps ""Entrapment"" (1999) interesting, not to mention the all-around stylish and kinetic filmmaking. Mac's hideout, an isolated castle in Scotland, is an unexpected attraction. The movie's similar in tone to the contemporaneous ""Eye of the Beholder"" (1999), but without the pall of moody gloom and sleaze. The first 70 minutes are surprisingly entertaining before slumping for 20 minutes, but the film thankfully recovers for the thrilling and twisty last act.""Entrapment"" is famous for iconic stills of Catherine acrobatically maneuvering her way through a laser security system, which showcase her heightened derrière. She's a beautiful woman and these sequences are certainly highlights. Yet you could hardly call them pornographic since she's fully clothed and, while her outfit might be tight, it's not exactly skintight.Concerning the mild controversy over the dubious attraction of Mac (Connery) and Gin (Zeta-Jones), Connery was 68 when ""Entrapment"" was shot, but Mac is 60 in the story. Catherine was almost 30 during shooting, but looks & acts 35. So their age-difference is roughly 25 years, which isn't anything unheard of.Moreover, men are naturally attracted to younger women and Gin is a full-fledged whoa-man, not a teenager or even 20-something. Mac may have been 60, but he was charismatic, intelligent, virile and very much young at heart; so it's no wonder Gin was attracted to him.Lastly, being attracted to someone isn't the same as wanting to marry the person or even have sex. You can be naturally attracted to someone, but dismiss any further entanglement for numerous reasons, such as you're married, s/he is married, s/he is too young, s/he is too old, you prefer being single, etc.The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England, Scotland (Duart Castle & Eilean Donan Castle), Malaysia and New York City. Ving Rhames costars as Mac's covert ally.GRADE: B",Entrapment
16,Sylviastel,"No, actually it's called blackmail. Entrapment is what cops do to thieves.",7,19 August 2018,"Sir Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones played a pair of world class thieves who go to great lengths for the robbery. It isn't just the treasure but the adrenaline that gets them going. They seek treasures like a priceless mask and Rembrandt painting. The Millennium fortune falls on New Year's Eve in 1999 where they try to overtake a system stealing money in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The film takes place in New York City, London, Scotland and Malaysia. The cast is great and this odd pairing is quite believable sometimes.",Entrapment
17,SimonJack,High tech crime film that's just passable,6,19 January 2017,"""Entrapment"" is one of a new breed of crime-action-thrillers. It is one of high tech crimes, usually involving computers and electronics and gadgetry of all sorts. While there was an occasional film of the high tech of the time as far back as the 1950s, this sub-genre burst forth by the end of the 20th century. From the late 1980s to beyond the first decade of the 21st century, a plethora of high tech crime films was made. But after nearly 30 years, there's hardly any new idea for a plot. And, the genre began to get old and worn out within 20 years. I saw this film when it came out in theaters in 1999, but couldn't remember that much about it. With me, if a movie isn't memorable, it's not very good or one I would rate very highly. By the same token, if I don't remember a film as being bad, I may watch one I had seen before. That's the case with this movie. After watching it again now, I guess that I might have rated it one star higher than I do now. Because that was 1999, and the high tech crime caper plot hadn't yet quite worn out. And, this film packs a lot of crime caper action into it, with a good cast. Even then, at age 69 Sean Connery was too old to be playing these types of roles. My six stars are mostly for the suspense in the plot over the question of trust among thieves.The action makes this film mildly entertaining. But this film just reaffirms to me again, how the modern bent for fast movies with wild action require so little acting talent of the cast. Perhaps, one day when we run through the newer fads of films (now, much fantasy and other- worldly stuff), Hollywood will again make some quality comedies and real life dramas in which most of those in the acting profession can once again ply their trade.",Entrapment
18,JamesHitchcock,"Slick, glossy fast-moving and does not take itself too seriously",7,9 October 2009,"In the cinema, as in most areas of life, one occasionally comes across some strange coincidences. In 1999 the then reigning James Bond, Pierce Brosnan, starred in a heist movie, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", about a suave, sophisticated Scottish art thief who becomes entangled with a glamorous female American insurance investigator. And in the same year the original Bond, Sir Sean himself, starred in a heist movie, ""Entrapment"", about a suave, sophisticated Scottish art thief who becomes entangled with a glamorous female American insurance investigator. A priceless Rembrandt painting is stolen from an office. Virginia Baker, an investigator working for the painting's insurers, suspects that the culprit is Robert ""Mac"" MacDougal a well-known international art thief, and is instructed investigate him. She tries to entrap him by claiming that she herself is an art thief and that she needs his help to carry out one of her schemes, the theft of a priceless Chinese mask from an English stately home. Mac does not need the money (he is already extremely wealthy and lives in a luxurious castle in the Scottish Highlands) but cannot resist the challenge of trying to outwit the owner's extremely elaborate security precautions. Having completed the theft of the mask, Mac and Virginia then plan an even bigger job, the theft of $8 billion from a bank. (This particular theft does not involve works of art, but will be accomplished by computer fraud). The scene of the crime is to be the Petronas Towers, Kuala Lumpur, Jon Amiel having borrowed Alfred Hitchcock's device of a cliffhanging scene set at a well-known landmark structure. (In 1999 the towers were the world's tallest building). Like his exact contemporary Clint Eastwood (both were born in 1930), Sean Connery has continued to act in action films throughout his sixties and into his seventies- ""The Rock"" and ""The League of Gentlemen"" are other examples- but as with Eastwood his age is generally an important plot point. (Certain other ageing action heroes still insist on taking roles which rally should go to men several decades younger). Here Mac accepts Virginia's assistance in stealing the mask because, in his sixties, he is no longer as athletic as he once was and needs a younger accomplice. Like most films of this type, ""Entrapment"" has a complicated plot. Many of the complications, apart from the details of the actual crimes, derive from what might be called a triangle of mistrust. The three parties involved in this triangle are Mac, Virginia and her boss, Hector Cruz. No-one knows whom they can trust. Is Virginia really helping Mac, or is she simply trying to entrap him? Is she working on her own account, planning to betray both Mac and her employers in her own interests? Or is it in fact Mac who is planning to betray Virginia to the police?For a film that makes glamour its main selling-point, it was a wise move to cast Catherine Zeta Jones as the female lead, as she was probably the most beautiful screen star of the nineties. Apart from the Petronas Towers cliffhanger, the one scene in this film that everyone will remember is the one where the lovely Catherine, dressed in a figure-hugging catsuit, does an elaborate gymnastic routine around network of laser beams during the stealing of the mask. She and Connery work well together despite the big age difference.For me, one weakness of this film, and of the genre to which it belongs, is that it is based on the sort of moral code that will not bear too close scrutiny. The main rule of heist movies is that the commandment ""Thou shalt not steal"" does not apply in situations where no-one gets hurt, where the victims are large corporations or hugely wealthy individuals and where the perpetrators are suitably glamorous, especially if they are sexy young women like Catherine Zeta. Yet despite its dubious morality, ""Entrapment"" is generally enjoyable. I would rate it higher than the Brosnan ""Thomas Crown Affair"" remake, which suffers by comparison with its predecessor. Like the best heist movies- the original 1967 ""Thomas Crown"" being a good example- it is slick, glossy fast-moving and does not take itself too seriously. 7/10",Entrapment
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,All I'm seeing is Catherine and the laser beams,7,15 March 2004,"That was the coolest part of the movie. I mean, I'm not a guy or anything, but I have to admit she does look sexy. I really enjoyed ""Entrapment"". It had high action and intensity. I saw the film over HBO, I showed my mom and she was in love as well. Although this is not my favorite Connery film, it's still worth a look. The love story wasn't really needed. But you'll deal. Over all, the film is good. It was well directed with some remarkable actors. And remember LASER BEAMS! If you don't like the film, you will definatly like LASER BEAMS! Hehe. I would recommend this to fans of Connery or Jones.7/10",Entrapment
20,slightlymad22,Even Sean Connery seems bored,6,16 September 2014,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sean Connery movie in order, I come to his last movie of the 1990s Entrapment (1999) Plot In as A Paragraph: An insurance agent (Catherine Zeta Jones) is sent by her employer to track down and help capture an art thief (Connery).It's not hard to see what attracted Catherine Zeta Jones to Entrapment. Her roles in Blue Juice and The Phantom hardly did her any favours career wise. So following up her role opposite Antonio Banderas in the hit movie The Mask Of Zorro the previous year, by teaming up with Connery in a heist movie probably seemed like a good idea.What is a surprise is why Connery agreed to be in it. Connery only starred in two more movies after this. Finding Forrester a year later, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen 4 years later. Here he seems tired and pretty bored most of the time. The movie just doesn't work. The chemistry between Connery and Zeta Jones is awful, and the scene where they making out is awful. Zeta Jones does look good during the laser scene though!! I'm sure Mmarvel19 liked that bit!! Lol Zeta Jones is the worst love interest of Connerys career. Even worse than Lorraine Braco in Medicine Man and that takes some doing. A leading lady more in the vein of Demi Moore would have been better suited to the role as A, she is a better actress, and B, she is a bit closer to Connery's age than Zeta Jones. Worst on screen romantic couple, I have ever seen in a Connery movie.Ving Rhames and the great Will Patron (a very under rated actor) are solid support though, but other than that, there is nobody else in the cast worthy of note. Outside of the two lead actors chemistry, its not awful by any stretch of the imagination, it's just bland and instantly forgettable. I seem to be in the minority though, as Connery ended the 90's on a high, as Entrapment grossed $87 million at the domestic box office to end 1999 as the 24th highest grossing movie of the year.",Entrapment
21,zkonedog,A Product Of Its Times...And Only That,3,27 February 2017,"As a young adolescent in 1999, I remember watching ""Entrapment"" and enjoying it immensely. It was one of my favorite films from that time period. I just recently watched the film again in 2015 and discovered two things: 1. The film is pretty much made for adolescents; and 2. It truly is only a product of its times.For a basic plot summary, ""Entrapment"" sees insurance agent Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta- Jones) on the trail of notorious art thief Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery). Whereas other agents have failed to catch ""Mac"" and bring him to justice, Virginia hopes to use her seductive powers to catch him off-guard. What follows is a game of cat-and-mouse in which you are never 100% sure who is the cat and who is the mouse.Purely on a plot level, this film isn't all that bad. There are a number of twists/turns, as well as a ""who is playing who"" atmosphere in which viewers never quite know which side any character is on until the very end.The major problem with ""Entrapment"", though, is that it is badly miscast and contains characters that you really don't care about from beginning to end. Sean Connery was having a bit of a late- career resurrection in film at this point, but all it does is create a number of uncomfortable moments of him leering at the shapely, svelte Zeta-Jones. For a movie that so heavily plays on a seduction angle, it is almost comical to see an old man such as Connery playing the leading role. Then, there is the subsequent issue that there really isn't any great chemistry between those two leads (again, probably due to the enormous age gap). End towards the end of the film, when you are really supposed to care about how those two feel about each other, all that potential emotion falls completely flat because it is so unbelievable and acting so unconvincingly.Another issue with this film is that it seems to want to create a sleek, technological environment, yet surprisingly little technology is actually used. There are a few scenes (especially the opening) that look really great, but otherwise there is a lot of roaming around an ancient mansion and inside art museums.So, I believe that ""Entrapment"" can very clearly be designated a ""product of its times"" and only that. Back then, Zeta-Jones was a sex symbol, it was still a novelty to see an ""old James Bond- ish Connery"", and the film was set right before the turn of the millennium. I can see young theater-goers of that time finding some enjoyment out of the experience (I know I did!). But, analyzed as purely a film, it falls short of even being called ""okay"".",Entrapment
22,filipemanuelneto,A good adventure/action movie without a solid plot behind.,6,22 July 2017,"In this film, an employee of an insurance company will seek to investigate and arrest a professional art thief without anyone knowing, however, that she's also a professional thief. The game of cat and mouse is very nice and gives this movie the pleasant adventure flavor, especially when we combine this with the sequences of the robberies, some of them so incredible that they stink the false (without this bothering us too much). Another nice point that helps keep the interest in the movie is the relative vagueness in which the movie keeps Gin's situation. Only in the end did we clearly see if she is a thief or invented all that to approach Mac and arrest him. In addition, the pair crosses with other dubious characters, whose connections also only clarify in the end.In spite of all this, its not a particularly deep film and doesn't have a very strong or solid story giving it basis. These basis is the action scenes and adventure/mystery atmosphere, and its around this that the script is developed, not the other way round. The film still has some romance but chemistry between Connery and Zeta Jones is virtually nil and romantic scenes aren't convincing. This doesn't bring any demerit to their sex-appeal, but there are some things that sound false and I think the mood of distrust was fundamental to discarding this attempt to do romance. The remaining cast is limited to what they have to do. The two main actors, combined, support the film successfully. So the end result is a good action/adventure film, with some mystery, charm and elegance, where the biggest absence is a solid story that builds on everything we're seeing on screen.",Entrapment

The story is about an insurance broker named Gin(Jones) who goes undercover in order to track down a professional thief named Mac (Connery). But with romance blossoming between the two will Mac be captured?.Dubbed by some as the worst film with the worst movie couple,I have seen worse films in my time. If this was made say today,then there could be uproar as the two main characters have a 39 age gap. To me I find it borderline creepy but I seen this film as a crime film rather than a love story.",Entrapment
26,elshikh4,"A Heist Movie, Where I Enjoyed The Heist But Not The Movie !",4,2 October 2019,"In 1999, while eating fish in our favorite restaurant, I asked my friend: ""So what do you think about (Entrapment)?"", which he watched alone in the theater the same day earlier, to have him silent for some time, then answering: ""Right when it ends, you ask yourself: Did Connery really do all what we saw?!"" I think, after watching the movie myself later on as a rented video, that my buddy was UTTERLY RIGHT!They wanted to make an entertaining heist movie. The ""job"" was to hire the so old Connery (69 year old), with the so young Zeta-Jones (30 year old) to have girls who long for a father, old men who long for a young sweetheart, and some other parties who want to see a magical glamour happening between 2 dazzling stars on-screen. The thing is I'm none of those!The details of the thefts and their complications were catchy. The surprises were unpredictable. And the cinematic elements made something glossy. However, the final product was average for most of the time, and weak for the rest.Connery was way too old to believe him in many parts. His performance seemed blank. And there was naught going on between him and Zeta-Jones, mostly a late grandfather connects with lost grandchild (and I mean belated by ""late""!). Simply nothing magical was there. And the explanation for what we saw as weird casting, and love story, is the fact that Connery was the movie's producer!The movie is just 2 heists attached by a story which I couldn't accept. The last 5 minutes were big lunacy. While talking about beyond-forced endings, this is something to recall. It is one of those endings that could determine what side would win of a movie with few characteristics and some flaws. I was laughing after it, saying: ""I can stand a lot of Hollywood nonsense, but this one is so childish!"". It is the end that ""ends"" a movie indeed!So, with that casting, and somewhat that script, it lost the credibility. I'm not so fond of the other mainstream heist movie from the same year, and more or less with the same characters, (The Thomas Crown Affair). But I have to admit, that last one had more entertaining elements than this one. Sure something didn't click in (Entrapment), and between it and us.So the heist was fun, the rest wasn't. Sorrowfully they made ""unbelievable"" in no-believable way!",Entrapment
27,barnabyrudge,"Fairly enjoyable heist flick - effortlessly watchable, totally forgettable.",5,30 July 2007,"The heist caper genre, so popular in the '70s, rears its head with this uninspired but fairly enjoyable 1999 flick. Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones generate genuine sexual chemistry despite their age gap (Connery was just shy of 70 when the film was made), and there are a couple of suspenseful heist sequences along the way. Between the high spots the film is rather bland and forgettable, with little of the humour that made the heist movies of yesteryear such fun (try to imagine The Hot Rock or The Italian Job stripped of their sense of humour, and you'll have a fair impression of what this film has to offer).Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) works for a top insurance company. Also, secretly, she is a master cat burglar who greatly admires the audacity and criminal success of another thief, Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery). Virginia double bluffs her boss, Hector Cruz (Will Patton), into allowing her to track down MacDougal. Her official brief is to become his partner-in-crime for a daring heist, after which she is supposed to turn him over to the police. But in reality, Virginia actually DOES want to be his partner-in-crime.... and has no intention of turning him in whatsoever! Aided by MacDougal's buddy Thibideaux (Ving Rhames), the thieving twosome complete their robbery successfully. Later, MacDougal reveals his plans for an even bigger job. With Virginia as his accomplice, he aspires to pull off the near-impossible theft of $8 billion dollars from the world's tallest building in Kuala Lumpur on Millennium Eve. By this point, Cruz has begun to suspect that Virginia may not be working on the side of the law any more. In a taut finale, MacDougal and Virginia attempt to complete their ingenious crime before the security forces catch them red-handed.Entrapment is slick and effortlessly watchable stuff with little discernible style of its own. Connery and Zeta-Jones, as already noted, overcome their remarkable age difference to make for a rather attractive pair. A good measure of any heist flick is whether your sympathies lie with the crooks or the law. In this one, the burglars win hands-down.... they are infinitely more charismatic than the ""good guys"". The globe-trotting narrative provides some exotic locations in which the stars can indulge in their posturing. Kuala Lumpur especially comes across as an exciting and interesting locale, somewhat underused to date in the movies. Entrapment has its share of silly moments, including a gratuitous sequence in which Zeta-Jones trains for her first robbery by writhing in a skintight cat suit through a maze of wool (strung out in such a way as to replicate the pattern of an infra-red alarm system!) Too many scenes also have Connery vanishing into mid-air to avoid capture, a trick that becomes increasingly hard to swallow and hampers the film's credibility. All in all, though, Entrapment is a harmless time-killer that keeps you moderately entertained, especially if you catch it in the right frame of mind.",Entrapment
28,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Well-crafted thriller about a daring heist,9,2 August 2006,"ENTRAPMENT, in my opinion, is a well-crafted thriller about a daring heist. Although I realize it's illegal, I thought that Mac (Sean Connery) and Gin (Catherine Zeta-Jones) made a good team for such a daring heist. If you ask me, planning to pull it off at the turn of the century was what really made it exciting. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the costumes were elegant, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this well-crafted thriller about a daring heist. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",Entrapment
29,dierregi,Possibly the most boring heist movie ever,1,19 January 2012,"Definitely one of the few heist movies I saw which can be described as utterly boring. By their very nature, movies about robberies are full of action and usually entertaining. ""Entrapment"" is neither. The script is terrible and revolves mainly around the very athletic body of Catherine Zeta-Jones.Her character, Virginia, is supposed to work for an insurance company, but she is also interested in putting a little something illegally aside. Enters Sean Connery, playing super-thief Mac (and a mere 40 years older than Zeta-Jones) and the two are struck by love at first sight and get involved in a series of criminal activities.Connery is ""only"" 40 years older than Zeta-Jones - albeit in good shape – so she is bound to find him irresistible... Putting aside the ludicrous matter of physical attraction, the whole fantasy about super-thieves and transferring billions from one bank account to another has been done - much better – many times before and since.The pace of the whole movie is sloppy and boring. For instance during the stay in Mac's castle, nothing happens apart from the camera lingering lasciviously on Zeta-Jones's body. Even the travel, from the US, to Scotland and to Kuala Lumpur seems to be in the plot for no other reason than adding the usual glamorous globe-trotting.""Entrapment"" is also a very dated movie. It is hard to think it is only a little more than 10 years old, as one would think it belongs to the over the tops fantasies of the Eighties. Eventually, it boils down to a series of overlong sequences, leading to a fairly predictable end.",Entrapment

On the plus side, it's nice to see Sean Connery has still got it! He's as charismatic as ever and the chemistry between him and Zeta Jones is quite strong and believable. On The minus side, the movie just wasn't that interesting. It moved way to slowly and the dialog was rather weak and just didn't reach out and captivate. I am surprised I didn't get into this because it's got an interesting plot and two vibrant leads with fantastic chemistry. But the movie didn't really go anywhere and apart from some beautiful cinematography It didn't really entertain all that much.I think the dialog could have been improved on(much of it was so matter of fact and I wish the dialog had drawn me in more.)The movie should have also moved faster and just maybe focused more on the romance then the heist part of it.(or at least made the heists more interesting.)

He keeps his streak alive with Entrapment.
The opening scene isn't nearly as interesting or clever as the film-makers or many imdb reviewers claim it to be. The mask heist is anti-climactic compared to Zeta-Jones' training session with the lasers. And the bank heist didn't exactly get my heart racing.
Or maybe I should just admit that most heist films are super boring. There's the setup, the planning, the job, the wisecracks, and either the comeuppance or the getaway. Maybe a car chase in there somewhere. But always so predictable.
Personally I was OK with the chemistry between Jones and Connery. But they're asked to delivery weak dialogue and act out implausible scenarios. Does anybody have any idea how windy it would be between those towers even on the calmest day on Earth? After that point, forget about it, it got Mission Impossible-level stupid.",Entrapment

They are getting rich and living an exciting life that is never boring. Sean Connery is always smarter than his enemy and he always gets the girl. Even when he is old and gray. The film is shot in Kuala Lumpur, what looks like Scotland, and London, I think. The Scotland scenery looks lovely, very peaceful and remote. The building used for exterior shots of Mac's safe house (Castle Duart on the Isle of Mull) is the ancestral home of the Chief of the Clan MacLean.""Entrapment"" is great fun: a flight of fantasy for sure; including a few ""missions impossible"" with enough suspense to keep your heart-rate up; a hint or two of 007 (with high-tech gadgetry, and some chase scenes), except with more well-paced action over-all; a touching, evolving romance between Mac (Connery) and Gin (Catherine Zeta-Jones), despite their quite different ages and screen personalities. The story is tight, has some humor and imagination with something of an unexpected ending that I prefer. As far as I'm concerned a dash of romance fits very well, family feud, comedy, military, and even some of the high end series during the last 2/3 years. It is serious drama for the most part, but with some lighter moments now and then as well. It never becomes ""dark"" or melodramatic. The acting is excellent, and the dialog believable.

Those films did not have half the technology used in ""Entrapment"" but yet made an impact on audiences. The opening sequence of ""Entrapment"" reminded me of Hitchcock--the hint of humour, the silhouettes.. and of course the thief on the roof in black. The question is do you find Connery/Zeta Jones more interesting than Cary Grant/Grace Kelly and O'Toole/Hepburn pairs. I feel all three pairs were made for each other. Finally, the film is sexy without any sex, the way Hitchcock might have made a film if he was alive.",Entrapment
36,philip_vanderveken,"Entrapment is a good, entertaining movie.",7,27 September 2004,"I have to say that I liked watching Entrapment. It is a good, entertaining movie. But what I don't understand is why this movie is called a comedy? It didn't really make me laugh. It did make me smile though and that is already a good thing. There were some humorous parts in it, but in my opinion, that's still not enough to call it a comedy. If it isn't a comedy, what is it than? It's a well produced action thriller which was able to keep my attention from the beginning to the end thanks to the many twists and the good acting. You could say of course that Sean Connery is still used to playing this kind of roles. He wasn't James Bond for nothing. He still knows how to play a smart gentleman who likes to play with a lot of gadgets and pretty ladies... And what an opponent he has! Catherine Zeta-Jones is really nice to look at in every way...Connery is an art thief who is able to pass the best security systems, stealing the painting and making fun of the security people by changing the original painting with a picture of Elvis. Catherine Zeta-Jones investigates the crime scenes for an insurance company and tries to catch Connery. To do so she will try to convince him that she's a thief as well, that she has planned a huge robbery but that she needs his help to complete it.Thanks to the many twists, this movie will keep you guessing till the end who is what, who did what to who and why,... And the ending is, in comparison to other movies of this kind, a pure surprise, very subtle and truly original. That is why I reward this movie with a 7,5/10. Truly a good job!",Entrapment
37,Gislef,Mission Impossible 2?,6,4 May 1999,"I enjoyed Entrapment mostly as a ""caper"" movie.  Sean and Catherine are both entertaining enough, and they do the best they can with what they're given. But that isn't much in the way of characterization.  Mac and Gin seem to ""bond"" remarkably quickly - they're thrown together, they fall in love (sort of), and it's all left to the audience to assume this.  Not much is played out, and there isn't really a feel, IMO, for why Connery's character falls in love with Gin despite the fact she's a manipulating b***h.The ""capers,"" are all excellent.  Most of it is left to Zeta-Jones to perform, as someone noted - all of Mac's ""thieving"" is left off-screen.  I found the final money-transfer a bit confusing, and they seem to be doing a ""Mac/Old Thief style vs. Gin/HighTech"" competition that didn't make much sense:  Mac used plenty of high-tech during the mask robbery.  That mask robbery is really the highlight of the film, although it doesn't really contribute much significance to the plot.  But even then, they somewhat mess it up by showing Zeta-Jones performing essentially the same sequence in rehearsal.  As acrobatic as she undoubtedly is, do we need to see the same thing twice??That brings us to the ""twist"" angle.  Quite frankly, I thought they didn't play quite fair.  Thibadeaux's first sequence with Mac is between only the two of them.  But they don't act like FBI boss/blackmailer and ""caught"" criminal - they act like criminal and supplier.  But...there's nobody there to see them act like that.  Okay, they might be doing that for Gin's benefit...if she were there!  As it is, this sequence only exists to mislead the audience.  Boo.As for the other characters, Rhames is entertaining as always, but not given much to do.  Neither is Patton, except to look alternately p****d and infatuated.  Maury Chaykin's performance is absurd.So overall, I rate this movie a bit better than average.  It doesn't dumb down to an intelligent audience, but that same audience probably would rather see more action/intrigue/caper and less of the romance angle.",Entrapment

Between some corny action sequences and very long dialogues. And then we see the infamous couple preparing their heists, and that's where the movie took off. And never stopped getting my intention. I thought the first heist was good, but it's nothing compared to the big one in Asia. There the action takes you, even though you know it is done in front of a green screen. I really loved the ending, it breathed some old fashion romance into the movie, at its very end. And the twist, though highly expected, was still very satisfying.

40,seymourblack-1,Heists & Surprises In Glossy Y2K Thriller,7,5 April 2012,"""Entrapment"" is essentially a lightweight caper movie about a scheme to catch one of the world's greatest art thieves. It features an enjoyable series of action sequences, daring heists and enough double-dealing, twists and intrigue to keep its audience engaged and entertained throughout. This is pure escapism and a fun film that's a great vehicle for its two lead actors who make the most of the considerable amount of screen time that they're given.After a priceless Rembrandt painting is stolen from a New York skyscraper, insurance investigator Virginia ""Gin"" Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) suspects that the culprit is international art thief Robert ""Mac"" MacDougal (Sean Connery) and persuades her boss to allow her to go undercover to pursue him. She meets up with Mac in London where she poses as an art thief and suggests that they join forces to steal an extremely valuable Chinese mask from Bedford Palace. Despite their success in stealing the mask, Mac remains very suspicious of her real motives but then she interests him in a plan to carry out an even more daring heist which could net them $8 billion.Gin's plan involves carrying out a sophisticated computer based robbery at the headquarters of the International Clearance Bank located in the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur. The type of theft that she envisages exploits the fact that the bank's computer system has to be shut down briefly just before the new millennium and so the heist is eventually carried out in the countdown to the year 2000.The tension builds as they attempt to carry out their plan at precisely the right time with Gin's boss and a very large number of security officers monitoring what's happening in the building. Mac and Gin complete their mission successfully but in the process inadvertently set off the alarm system and have to make an incredibly dangerous escape by clambering precariously along some cables that link the building's two towers. The remainder of their plan doesn't run smoothly and they have to escape the building separately before meeting up again the next morning at Pudu train station where a further series of unexpected developments follow.The relationship that develops between Mac an Gin is amusing to watch as there's a certain amount of attraction between them but also a significant absence of trust. Mac clearly appreciates Gin's physical beauty especially in the sequences where he breaks into her hotel room unexpectedly and also when she's practicing the contortions required to negotiate a network of laser beams. On the other hand however, he is very suspicious of her motives and on one occasion asks, ""has there ever been anyone you couldn't manipulate, beguile or seduce?"" and she replies ""No"".Commendably, the quality of their performances and the amount of charm they exude, enable Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones to compensate greatly for the lack of witty repartee that would normally be a feature of a story involving their kind of relationship.A series of exotic locations, excellent cinematography and well-executed stunts are also used well to further enhance the enjoyment of this glossy Y2K thriller.",Entrapment

43,dglink,Star Power Raises Film a Cut Above,7,24 April 2005,"The action races from New York to London to Scotland to Kuala Lumpur, while three intricately plotted and technically executed thefts take place. The action twists and turns, the characters may or may not be what they seem to be, and crosses follow double-crosses. Thus, there is little time for the viewer to be bored or to ponder the implausibility of it all. But, in a sleek glossy film such as this one, logic is not a key factor, it's the look and the action that count, and both of those attributes, especially the look, make ""Entrapment"" an entertaining film. Sean Connery, who plays an aging master thief, can anchor any film that he appears in, and this one is no exception. His presence alone grounds the movie and nearly makes the implausible plausible. However, while Connery is one of a handful of men who have retained their looks and masculine appeal beyond middle age, the likelihood that the luscious Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is at the peak of her beauty here, would fall for him tests the bounds of credibility. Perhaps the romance was written in as a fantasy for us near-codgers and to give us hope. Besides the excellent cinematography of the human scenery, which also includes the dependable Will Patton and Ving Rhames, the lush photography of the Scottish Highlands offers an unsolicited advertisement for the Scottish National Tourist Board. If rooms were available in the luxurious castle that Connery uses in the film, this would have been written there.Thus, ""Entrapment"" seems to have everything: beautiful people, solid performances, breathtaking scenery, suspense, and excitement. There is definitely enough here to entertain a not-too-discriminating viewer for two hours. Of course, afterward, one might ponder why all of the expensive high-tech security systems that are depicted in the film quickly fall victim to a pair of thieves who seem more amused with themselves than intense and focused when they are stealing such incredible sums of money. If theft were as easy and casual as Connery and Zeta-Jones make it seem to be, we could all have a lot more fun in life plotting and executing heists instead of commuting and staring at computer monitors.",Entrapment

Entrapment is one of those films that tries to be clever with the plot but just ends up disapearing up it's own backside and loses the watchers interest. It is too far fetched for it's own good and the plot has more holes in it than Sean Connery's wig. If you dont think to deeply about the story then you may well like this but it wasn't for me.

Her job is to get into his confidence and partner with him on a multi-billion dollar financial rip-off to coincide with the millennium celebration. The job is a set-up to nab Connery, or is Ms Zeta-Jones working a double-cross? For the first half of the movie you care. There are a couple of well-choreographed and photographed heist scenes, and the film moves along as a passable caper flick (although the developing sexual chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is a little creepy, and thankfully short-lived). But by the second half of the movie, the plot holes, poor direction and lackluster performances made it so I didn't care who's double-crossing whom.  The plot-holes become plot chasms, and the acting is so listless that it seems that the actors felt that just their presence in the movie was sufficient.

It manages to do so in an important manner but it is simply let down by an average plot and bad dialog. They are very simple, linear and predictable, making the sequences between the robberies a real pain. You can imagine it as a soap opera, disguised as a film, fact which is simply unacceptable in this type of movie where the main characters are supposedly robbing very high value objects. The producers also tried to do something different with the finale but they simply failed to impress or at least provide a bit of satisfaction. Besides these problems, the whole technology part is way too exaggerated, making a lot of aspects of it seem improbable or impossible, thus spoiling a bit the excitement.Unfortunately, it's an average movie which had a good idea and two good actors but failed to implement it and link all the aspects into an uniform final product.",Entrapment
49,gelman@attglobal.net,Zeta-Jones Wears Eyeliner to Bed,6,22 January 2005,"Caper films always have intricate plots which often do not stand up under examination but ""Entrapment"" may be the most implausible ever. The story line with its convoluted schemes, betrayals and counter-betrayals makes no sense at the beginning, less sense in the middle and no sense at all at the end. The only justification for this movie is that it serves as a vehicle for the aging but still magnetic Sean Connery and for the formidably beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones. When Connery's high-tech second-story man initially confronts her, she seems to be wearing eye-liner and nothing else to bed. But never mind, she's gorgeous and, though Connery's character is a thief, he's also too much of a gentleman to take advantage. (It later turns out that he stole her luggage which is why she's naked in the first place. I told you it doesn't make sense. Trust me.) I can think of a dozen films with more or less the same plot, all of them better than ""Entrapment."" Even ""Ocean's Eleven"" (I haven't seen the sequel). But the best of the lot after 40 years remains ""Topkapi,"" which was directed by Jules Dassin, Melina Mercouri's husband. On a related path of skulduggery and misdirection, the elaborate scam perpetrated in ""The Sting"" offered a lot more fun than any caper film I've ever seen, even including ""Topkapi.""",Entrapment

The idea of Sean Connery still being sexually active makes me feel sick. And why would a vain supermodel type such a zeta jones be interested In a man 40 year's older than her.

I have to say that Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery are trying very hard to do something out of paper thin screen play and not very interesting plot.I tries to like this film but I could not. Since I have to fill ten lines of text let me just say that Cathrine Zeta-Jones is a fantastic actress and very good looking. I am sorry that she has so many health and other problems.

I thought this was far more moving than many of the swoony full-blown love affairs I've seen in other movies. Zeta-Jones is very glamorous and got to model a lot of swanky clothes. Connery is weary and reserved as befitting his age and that made the May-November romance all the more poignant. Ving Rhames again was the street wise tough, a role he has done many times before. The action sequences while quite good are not as exciting or suspenseful as in other movies of this type (ie. The Thomas Crown Affair). Still I enjoyed this movie thanks mostly to the the chemistry and as I said understated romance between Mac and Gin. Recommended, 7.5/10.",Entrapment
54,Movie-12,"A slick, entertaining behind the scenes look at robbery, blackmail, and double crosses. *** out of ****",8,3 June 1999,"""Entrapment"" is a wise and glamorous look at behind the scenes world of robbery, blackmail, and double crosses. It stands on fresh and original ground, and I liked it. The movie is directed with a stylish, savvy blend of unpredictable adventure, twists, action, suspense and mild humor, all contributing to a movie experience worth while.The film opens a little too quickly and energetically with a world class jewel thief breaking into a high security building to rob a citizen of a valuable painting. This person does this with agility, ease and sensibility, putting a sense of mystery and ponder of whom this could be.The proceeding scene introduces a couple of things. First of all, we meet a character named Gin, a seductive secret agent who appears to be tracking the described thief. She plans to become his partner, get close, then capture him right in the act of his robberies.The crook is named Mac, and is very old for his skill. He and Gin meet, agree to do a heist together, and the trap is set. There are a few other side characters as well. Thibadeaux, a young and tough African American who seems to control Mac and Cruz, who is Gin's trusting associate.  The problem with having so many key players in not containing so many of them, but never developing them. And in truth, the only two ever understood, and I struggle to say ""understood,"" are Mac and Gin.The movie is shot in a variety of beautiful locations, and the filmmakers take advantage of most of them. They do the same with the good-looking cast, always convincing and conniving. Even the background effects contribute to the many visual pleasures in this movie, which is full of style and substance, and performances that are distinct but still entertaining.As good as the actors and site areas where the film takes place are, they still can't cover up the clear and obvious formula present. The standard, no-one-is-who-they-appear-to-be blueprint laid out in full color. We see this because the characters are very carefully explained and never detailed. Writers only do this when they want the audience to know only a certain amount about the characters for a particular reason.The film's third act is glory in its greatest. The scenes are presented with a building level of tension, getting greater and greater until the shocking and baffling closing conclusion scene. Adventure and excitement permit.""Entrapment"" is full of interesting and enjoyable elements: a great and realistic cast, romance and sensual appeal, attractive sets and characters, this movie is sure to please the majority of a theater audience.",Entrapment

Their Oshima-like rituals are played against the forces of the law, which try to corral their subversive activities.

56,khatcher-2,Back to James Bond however grown-up he may be,3,15 March 2002,"There is no denying that men need to feel masculine and dominate the world (and women) around them, which is basically why Edgar Rice Burroughs made such fame from his horrendous `Tarzan' personality, or why James Bond became so popular half a life-time ago. So we have now Schwarzenegger, van Damme, Seagal, Willis and like ilk doing very `macho' things all over the place and for absolutely no other purpose than to spend thousands of metres of celluloid so as to keep mindlessness alive and kicking.So without much expectation other than the hopes that the grown-up Sean Connery (after his excellent contribution in `The Name of The Rose') might be doing grown-up things, and thus assure keeping my wife happy, whilst delighting myself seeing the most beautiful woman to come out of Wales since Boadicea conquered marauding Roman armies, I picked this one up at a give-away price just down the street, and dedicated an otherwise useless Thursday evening to a few peanuts, a couple of glasses of `pacharán' and 115 minutes of forceless fantasy-making on the basis of practically nothing.
Definitely Bill Gates should see this film as there is a whole lot of computerised techniques being flashed about which he will not have got wind of and which I am sure he would be more than capable of converting into something less fanciful, thus being of great use to future users of `Windows Millenium XP Version 5.5' and `Explorer 19.3'. Apart from some nice scenery up in Scotland, possibly Loch Lomond, the only thing one can say about this film is that at least Sean Connery earned himself a few shillings, and that Catherine Zeta-Jones is as beautiful as on any web site you may care to find her on, though her antics in this apology do nothing to redeem anything either for the film or herself. Perhaps the only way they could have made the farce worse might have been to replace the ex-007 with Michael Douglas, but that might well have added insult to injury. The main difference between `Entrapment' and the original 007 entertainments is that there are not half a dozen lightly-clad beauties gliding across the screen, but just one; this is because splendid female specimens come out far more expensive per film than they used to.Anyway, it is all hugely exciting, and they saved themselves miraculously from certain death, and without breaking too many light-bulbs, fortunately, as it would not have been at all nice to upset Kuala Lumpan New Year celebrations.No wonder, then, that this video was at a give-away price down the street.........three and a half out of ten only because Ms. Zeta-Jones is good to look at.

It actually is fun to sit back and watch Connery train the lovely Ms. Jones in the ways of high tech thievery. The climax atop on really tall building is exciting, and very little bullets fly.

Virginia manages to go undercover and get in on Mac's latest heist. Will he work out who she is, will she get killed, or will she round him up? Very good action movie, with a solid cast and script.

The starting sequence where a thief is cascading down a skyscraper to steal a Rembrandt painting is textbook for how to shoot a precise, evenly paced and action-filled scene. I loved how readable the action sequences were early on and continued to be.Then we get to see the lovely Catherine Zeta Jones and the still dashing Sean Connery, each exhibiting impressive athleticism and spy-like intelligence and suavity. While the age difference is felt, the two leads share a respectable affection with an unexpected quietude and grace in the accompanying piano. The romance is tastefully done. This aspect is the part I was really the most impressed by.While I appreciated Catherine Zeta Jone's athleticism and relationship with Sean Connery (although I think overall Sean Connery's emotions were the more consistently deeply felt), I overall didn't quite believe her character and was always waiting for the the shoe to drop. She brings a great beauty and fire to her role but I didn't quite get thr fullest conviction from her. However there are a few great moments and I think this is overall an estimable performance from her.Sean Connery is overall the more believable and the more emotionally invested--you can sense his internal conflict at times, or at least make sense of them in retrospect.The two together however make a great pair.

66,HenryHextonEsq,It's just not enjoyable.,3,19 July 2001,"Very much a sub-Bondian crime caper, ""Entrapment"" is a film that doesn't induce much comment, so I can but be brief. Its plot is tedious and far from the big deal it thinks it is. The only characters really given any time are the starring pair. Any chance of the dynamic between the two working is undermined by a cringe-worthy sentimental ending scene, although the dynamic was hardly that interesting or tense to begin with. Connery, once an effective James Bond, but never a true ""character actor"", is dull here, but at least has some residual screen presence. In short, he's no better really than in most of his recent and very mediocre films. I suppose he's at least less ""OTT-in-a-bad-way"" than he was in ""The Avengers"".Catherine Zeta Jones acts almost as the catalyst for the plot; much prancing ""surveillance dodging"" merely to show off her figure, although none of it had a hint of true sensuality. The lack of true chemistry, perhaps understandable given the 40 year age difference between the stars, is a major undoing. I don't see why Ms Jones always feels she has to adopt an American accent in her films; this and the rest of her vaguely posturing performance fail to impress. A very bland, conservative film, with not an ounce of innovation, and barely even much fun.Rating:- * 1/2/*****",Entrapment

Add stunning locations -  the Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur, and the rugged Scottish coast, -  good chemistry between Connery and Zeta-Jones, great stuntwork, some interesting crosses and doublecrosses and this should be a surefire hit.  Unfortunately there are some significant flaws.The script simply does not have much to offer- the dialogue is stilted and the actors have little to work with.  The supporting cast is basically one-dimensional cardboard cutouts that add little to the story. In addition, the action - impressive when it is on screen - is too infrequent.

There are some great scenes in this film, with Zeta Jones showing her flexibility in the physical sense of the role. There is also some great cinematography, particularly in the castle sequences.  Its all very glossy and high tech, but some of the dialogue is a bit rough around the edges - some parts did need more energy and feeling. Its not exactly a bad film, but its not that good either.

The plot is the most unbelievable thing I've seen in a long while. The screenplay and the direction do not make it better or worse. The soundtrack... Well, I don't remember it very well..."" The fact is that ""Entrapment"" is not a great film, nor a bad one. It's just an okay way to pass your time without worrying with huge character developments or Biblical plagues suddenly falling on San Fernando Valley. Oh, sorry! In resume: ""Entrapment"" is a (very) flawed film, but one that doesn't bother you for its lack of quality.
The story... Well, let's not worry about the story. But one thing I found really peculiar (in the bad sense) was how they introduced Catherine Zeta-Jones' character. You know where she works, what she does, how she dresses, what are her plans... You just don't know a ""single detail"": her name. One of the newsgroup critics noticed the same thing as me, and it clearly shows how full of holes this movie is. But it doesn't mean it is bad. The chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is pretty fine. Both of them are charming, both of them are limited actors. Even with that, they are a delight together, helped by the great style of the movie.""Entrapment"" starts off slow, has many disposable scenes, but its climax is the worst part. The scene passed on the New Year's Eve is almost laughable, but what would you expect from a film with a plot like this would offer? I also didn't enjoy the twists in the end very much. They were really surprising, but broke the logic of the whole film. That's something to complain about. Talking like that, it seems that I hated ""Entrapment"", but I didn't. I didn't love it, just thought it was a so-so movie, with good entertainment for an afternoon. Actually, I didn't expect much, and that's what I had.

80,BB-15,Heist Flick with a Few New Twists,7,12 December 1999,"There is a lot about Entrapment that is fun. I happen to like jewel thief movies because they are based on cleverness rather than explosions and the piling up of dead bodies. Entrapment stretches the master thief formula a bit with more plot twists than usual. It is fast paced, has good photography, clever gadgets and is well acted.While Connery can always be expected to be dashing, I equally liked Catherine Zeta-Jones' fire and coolness. Combining beauty and strength she is able to transform stealth into a ballet of movement. The fire that does not ignite in Entrapment is in the romance between Connery and Zeta-Jones.
Entrapment bends the formula for this type of movie but it can't break it. So, in the end the surprises are limited. Also since a few scenes were shot in a famous high rise building, some of the escapes looked a little forced, then a plot twist made that more believable. More disappointing was that Entrapment follows the trend about how honest cops are allowed to be in such films. But that is how these movies are.One always has to suspend belief somewhat with films but it wasn't much of an effort with Entrapment. There are no massive explosions taking out several buildings. Also, the heroes didn't become bullet proof, machine gun toting killing machines. Entrapment was fun. It didn't wow me but it didn't disappoint either. It is a well made, well acted, exciting entertainment.",Entrapment
81,BlueSkies765,Entertaining heist movie,8,9 March 2020,"1999, I almost forgot about that year. 1998 and the beginning of 1999 were pretty quiet until the Millennium bug panic started. The Millennium bug panic had parallels with the Coronavirus now. Even though the Coronavirus is much more serious as it is claiming lives and impacting the economy.However back then there was some serious fear that the Millenium bug was going to have serious negative consequences on society. It was my second time experiencing mass panic (first time was the AIDS panic early 90s). It left an impression on me seeing people store food and be uncertain about what would happen in the nearby future. Luckily the Millennium bug never happened.Entrapment cleverly makes a movie around this phenomenon. It's a popcorn movie with some great heist scenes. Even though Sean Connery was considered too old to be playing a sophisticated burglar, the movie manages to work around it and uses his age as an advantage. A thief who because of his experience is able to pull off elaborate heists. Entrapment is more a battle of the wits than about violent confrontations. I liked this. Not too often do I find action movies in modern cinema where death isn't a central theme.Catherine Zeta-Jones also delivers a good performance. The elusive relationship between her and Sean Connery kept me guessing, not knowing what was going to happen until the end. Even though some feel there was a mismatch in casting I think the point of some of their awkward interactions was to create confusion for the viewers as it was confusing for the characters themselves who didn't really know each other and a lot was at stake. The interactions were a major part of the movie and it was very captivating.The movie does have flaws. The rough patch is in the middle of the movie. There are some things that feel inconsistent with the story even when you suspend your disbelief. The last part however was exciting and made up for it. Overall an entertaining heist movie.",Entrapment

(And for those who pooh-pooh the idea of a romance given their age difference, I have only to say that you should have been sitting behind us in the theater when my 16-year-old daughter and I were claiming dibs on Connery; true sexiness is ageless.)Plot holes, plot twists, who really cares about a plot, anyway? The whole point is fantasy, and Entrapment delivers. The sexual tension was high and believable and a refreshing change from the usual smut. The suspense was intense without the obligatory gore splattering everywhere.Entrapment isn't high art. If you don't like it, send me a ticket and I'll watch it for you again.",Entrapment

I was bored throughout the entire sitting, and even the silly action sequences did not interest me. The story was stupid and completely unbelievable, and the holes in the plot were large enough to fling that gigantic, ugly Petronas Towers building through. Biggest flaw: The so-called 'chemistry' between Zeta-Jones and Mr Connolly's characters. YUCK!!! I like Sean Connolly's acting, but he did NOT suit this movie! As for her, her acting was mediocre and totally forgettable. But some kind of romance going on between them? A young woman and a crusty, bad-tempered old geezer, old enough to be her grandfather? Come on now! She's 20-something, he's 70 years old! Scenes of him groping her: The lustful, *dirty old man* image springs to the forefront of my mind.The ending: Stupid.CONCLUSION: Forget it.",Entrapment

Some criticise that Sean Connery could be CZJs father and they have no chemistry. But is that so? I thought their chemistry was convincing and sweet and know many women who, although younger would date Sean Connery back then. And Catherine? She's a stunner, but also a decent actress.The movie itself delivers. It is charming, has atmosphere, twists, a lovely soundtrack and good actors. I've watched it countless times now and it is still just as entertaining.If it's a rainy day or you need something to cheer you up and make you feel good, I can strongly recommend ""Entrapment"".",Entrapment

The acting was solid, the story was a little shakey at first but all comes together at the end. All in all this movie was pretty good.",Entrapment
86,Danimal-7,A Fun Piece of Fluff,6,20 August 1999,"On the menu tonight we have an insurance investigator named Gin Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is assigned the job of tracking down veteran art thief Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery).  She poses as an aspiring art thief to win his confidence.  Or was she posing as an insurance investigator all along?  Unfortunately, this issue is resolved all too clearly very early in the film, and we are left with a pleasant but strictly routine cops-'n-robbers flick.ENTRAPMENT gets a lot of mileage out of the two leads.  There is perhaps no other actress in Hollywood as heart-achingly beautiful as Catherine Zeta-Jones.  She proves here that she has some character range, showing Gin as a pugnacious, scrappy little woman out to make her mark, in contrast to her breakthrough role last year as Helena Montero in THE MASK OF ZORRO where she was every inch the aristocratic lady.  Sean Connery has still got it after all these years as the old pro art heist man.  His growing, repressed affection for Gin is nicely understated, particularly in one scene where we simply watch him sitting on a bench alone thinking about her.Noteworthy is one scene where Gin trains to avoid a laser security system by twisting and contorting her body through a complex of taut, bell-laden threads that MacDougal has set up.  The erotic tension this scene creates is pleasing and original.  (And for those prudes who retch at the thought of romance between the young Jones and the elderly Connery, I'm at least one movie fan who would not mind in the least seeing some future romance between DiCaprio or Ulrich and Loren or Taylor!).  ENTRAPMENT also has the good taste, rare in an adventure film, not to shower us with unnecessary blood and gore.Is ENTRAPMENT great art?  Heck, no!  It's contrived, absurdly unrealistic, and mostly shallow.  And the finale, which could have lent some meaning to the film, boomerangs completely. Think how sappy CASABLANCA would have been if Rick had flown off with Ilsa; that's how bad ENTRAPMENT's ending is.Flawed and shallow, but a fun ride for most of the way, ENTRAPMENT is worthwhile renting if you have nothing important to do and don't feel up to a more challenging movie.Rating: **1/2 out of ****",Entrapment
87,cinemel,"Exciting, but flawed heist adventure",7,27 April 1999,"Sean Connery stars with Catherine Zeta-Jones (Mark of Zorro) in this Thomas Crownish heist adventure. Just as ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" was the stylish in-film of the 60's, ""Entrapment"", as directed by Jon Amiel, has taken on the high tech feel of the 90's and merged it with the heist film. Any movie with Connery has something to recommend it. His voice alone can be so convincing. Zeta-Jones is as beautiful and alluring as she was in ""Zorro"". Although some of their scenes together do have some chemistry, as a whole something is missing. Of course, the questions here are ""will they get caught"" and ""who are the good guys and bad guys""? All of these are answered by the finale. The film has multi-national settings including New York, Scotland and Maylasia. The latter is a character in itself. The edge-of-your-seat climax takes place in the tallest building in the world, not the Sears Tower any more. This building is a spectacular 2 tower edifice with a high bridge joining the towers. This sequence alone is worth the price of admission. Supporting performances by Ving Rhames and Will Patton are adequate, but they are both under-used. Cinematography and editing are helpful in pulling the whole together.",Entrapment
88,krumski,Surprisingly enjoyable,8,11 February 2000,"Okay, okay - let me admit right off that I had no expectations for this film (it had been so universally panned) and saw it on the cheap merely to ogle Catherine Zeta-Jones for a few hours (does that make me a bad guy?) However, within a very short amount of time I became hooked - this is just a really entertaining story, well told, well shot, and totally enjoyable from start to finish. Implausible plot? Yeah sure, but what escapist movie isn't, and the important thing is that the *characters* really believed in it, and so we did too. The heists in this movie were all meticulously thought out and grippingly presented - and the extended middle sequence where Connery is training Zeta-Jones is just really interesting. It reminded me, in a weird and distant way, of those Yoda-Luke Skywalker sequences in Empire Strikes Back, and emphasizes how seldom Hollywood movies (particularly action ones) ever show anyone in the process of learning something: characters either know what they're doing ahead of time, or pick up skills with alarming speed, usually in the heat of conflict. Now, about that relationship between Connery and Zeta-Jones. Entrapment is no mere Grandpa romances the baby-sitter movie (like Bulworth, or Six Days Seven Nights, or just about any Woody Allen film) simply because the focus of their relationship is always the cat-and-mouse game of accomplices in crime (who don't trust one another) not the mating dance of  horny singles. Both stars are certainly attractive, of course, and the filmmakers know it and emphasize it, but the fundamental relationship takes its cue from Mac's (Connery's character) advice early in the film to the effect that there can be no romance between thieves. This advice is scrupulously followed in the film itself, keeping it free of an embarrassing romantic sub-plot, and thereby maintaining a sharp focus upon the story and action. (If only the other heist film this past summer, the inferior but far more lavishly praised The Thomas Crown Affair, had stayed true to this maxim, we might have had more great sequences like the beginning and the ending, and been spared the long, looooong middle section where nothing happens save for Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan getting it on, improbably and boringly, in as many situations as possible.)To sum up: tight plot, exciting action sequences, great looking stars, and some nifty twists and turns along the way - all without the curse of a boring and improbable romance slowing everything down. What are you waiting for? As long as you're in a purely escapist mood, Entrapment is GREAT entertainment.",Entrapment
89,EdRooney,Walked into the trap,10,1 May 1999,"""Entrapment"" It's got two handsome stars, a smooth portrayal of stealing, and just a hint of action and romance. Considering that this doesn't end at the prom or a warehouse, this is a breath of fresh air. Director Jon Amiel has a very checkered past, but with ""Entrapment"", I've never seen him so sure of himself. The film glides effortlessly between some sketchily drawn romantic inclinations to well-executed scenes of training to actually exciting action moments of the heists.  It's a nice package.The film is really about the art, or maybe even the beauty, of stealing. A refreshing idea that hasn't been considered in some time.  There is a giddy glee in just watching the thieves use high tech mechanisms to outsmart the systems that house the loot. It's a carefully paced film, so the usual action-payoff-drama-action-payoff-drama form for these types of movies isn't used here. It's entertaining as hell, and the climax holds many thrills.Like I said before, the two leads are some of the finest looking in the film biz.  Sean Connery makes a wonderful choice by playing off his old age.  As the character, he seems overwhelmed by Catherine Zeta-Jones. It makes for a few moments of sly comedy.  As for Ms. Zeta-Jones, it has been said of her that she takes the best close-up in current motion pictures. ""Entrapment"" proves that statement time and again.  While she does struggle trying to keep down her natural Welsh accent, Zeta-Jones makes for a lively sidekick to Connery, and despite the ballyhooed age difference, they work together just fine.Despite a lackluster and forced final, ""Entrapment"" works better than you may think.  It's easy to get hung up on the age difference or Connery's hairpiece, but the movie is too much fun to be bothered with such minute details.  This is good pre-summer entertainment.  I give the filmmakers kudos for keeping the tone light and the suspense on 11.------------ 8",Entrapment
90,Xophianic,"Good stars, good action, good plot",6,8 February 2000,"One of the best things this movie has going for it is the two stars. Sean Connery is one of the most recognized and appreciated faces in film today. And Catherine Zeta-Jones is one of the most talented and beautiful new faces around today. Mix them into a film with some good action, an interesting plot and some cool gadgets and you've got a winner. That's what ENTRAPMENT is.Gin Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) seems to be working for an insurance company. She has a certain fascination with Mac MacDougal (Sean Connery), who is an incredibly good thief who has stolen numerous works of art. After a particularly expensive work of art is stolen, her boss Hector Cruz (Will Patton) sends her to track him down, lure him to an extremely beneficial robbery and trap him (hence the title) so the FBI can arrest him. But Gin, who is a very talented thief herself has her own plans. With the help of Mac, and his partner that she doesn't know about named Aaron Thibadeaux (Ving Rhames), she wants to do a robbery with a payoff of billions of dollars.The acting in this movie is, of course, excellent. Sean Connery, naturally, does his usual outstanding job, but Catherine Zeta-Jones steals the show. Her close-ups are beautiful, as expected, and she manages to give off a professional, and sexy, performance. Ving Rhames also does a good job as the not-sure-he-can-be-trusted partner of Connery. Will Patton also does a good job, even though his part isn't especially large.The plot is very interesting, but the ending is a little confusing. It happens and ends rather quickly, which may make you think ""What just happened?"" You'll understand it a few minutes later, but some will be left with a some what dissatisfied feeling about the end.This movie is really pretty good. The actors are good, the plot is interesting, the machinery is nice and the close-ups of Catherine Zeta-Jones' butt are great. Worth a rent, for sure.",Entrapment
91,paul-nemecek,Entrapment--not profound but fun,7,3 July 2018,"One of the toughest things about writing weekly reviews is picking the films to review. If I'm going to invest seven bucks and two hours, I'd just as soon see something I think I'll like. Besides, it's too easy to write negative reviews with the plethora of mediocrity that permeates the theaters. The other issue though is the audience for the reviews. Do I pick films to review that I think the audience should see? This is the castor oil approach-as in ""go ahead, it's good for you"". Or should I review films that I think the audience is likely to see. This week my schizoid ambivalence is on display for all to see. The best films now showing are the Argentinian nominee for best foreign film, Central Station, and Robert Altman's delightfully offbeat Cookie's Fortune. The former is in Spanish with subtitles, and the latter is, well, offbeat. Feeling trapped between high-brow pretentiousness and the populist formula film, I decided to go with the easy crowd-pleaser.John Amiel's Entrapment is surely that. An action-adventure thriller with overtones of romance and intrigue, Entrapment is at the very least, fun. Sean Connery here redeems himself from his dreadful, overblown caricature in The Avengers, and Catherine Zeta-Jones establishes herself (in her first major role since her star-making appearance in The Mask of Zorro) as having the stuff that leading ladies are made of. There is no substitute for good chemistry, and these two have it.What makes the film a bit unusual, and refreshing, is the way that chemistry is developed. One of the most sensual moments in the film is when Connery's character ""Mac"" gazes at the Zeta-Jones character, Gin, as she lies sleeping, barely covered. When Mac reaches out towards Gin it is to pull the cover up, to cover her. It is a tender moment, and a lot more original than the typical ""roll in the hay"" in this kind of film.Gin is supposed to be an investigator specializing in art thefts, and Mac is the world's greatest art thief. As the story develops, she appears to be setting Mac up for a bust, and at other times she seems to be interested in being his partner in crime. Part of what keeps the story engaging is trying to decide just who is the fisherman (or fisherperson) and who is the fish? Or perhaps they are both just fishing together. Just when you think you know, the story will spin round again, leaving you in doubt once more.There are some great supporting performances here. Especially noteworthy is the solid performance by Ving Rhames as Thibedeaux, Mac's supplier and occasional partner in crime. Mission Impossible fans may remember Rhames as the computer whiz in that film. There is no question that this is a formula form in the action-adventure genre. The best genre films emerge out of a dialectical interplay between the conventions of the genre and the inventions of the director. There is enough invention here to make this an engaging example of the genre. If you can't handle the subtitles of Central Station, and aren't into Altmanesque offbeat films, Entrapment is fun and engaging with some great scenes along the way.",Entrapment

Sean Connery is a legend, undoubtedly. His charisma, flair, verbal expression all is profound and nonpareil. His portrayal of an aging thief is so absorbing and peerless that contemplating someone other for his role will seem like inutile. Catherine Zeta Jones looks jaw dropping gorgeous throughout the movie. Playing the role of a crook with a mind as smart as a whip, looks as exquisite as a Picasso's creation and body flexible as a gymnast, Zeta Jones was convincing enough to obviate any negative criticism concerning her portrayal. Rest of the cast chips in well.""Entrapment"" strength lies in its clever plot, impeccable dialogue, sufficient character development and stylized cinematography. The obvious downfall of the movie will be its final half an hour. It includes a heist that is very infeasible and the final twist where Mac leads the FBI to Gin undesirably, only to exhibit certain inconceivable gimmicks resulting in a happy ending.Overall, ""Entrapment"" entertains sufficiently.

95,Web_Of_Doom,Enjoyable movie with a few scripted let downs,7,19 December 2020,"Sean Connery is a brilliant actor & though his character in this movie was 60 years old ( his real age at the time was 69 years old ) & he looked great for his then age.
I've seen some bad reviews of this movie & they generally seem to be based on the fact that this ""60"" year old man does not swoon all over his much younger female ""professional thief"" business partner, however I thought the balance of chemistry in the movie between veteran + up and coming ""professional"" star was very good.
The movie does suffer from some silly errors in script writing that can take you out of the flow of the movie, however if like me you can enjoy the movie for what it is ""over exaggerated professional thief"" movie then it actually is an enjoyable watch.
Catherine Zeta Jones is also very good in this movie & if you watch the whole of this movie carefully & think about the characters motivations & their characters then the chemistry between the two leads in this movie makes perfect sense & is correct.
Unfortunately this movie could have been much better with a much better script so it tops out at 7 out of 10, however if you have not seen it I would recommend you do.",Entrapment

Also honestly, my wife enjoyed this one more than I did.The special effects are pretty cool. The scenery is also quite nice. The acting is so good that it makes up for a script that, had it been better, would have made this one a slam dunk blockbuster.We both enjoyed it, but I don't think I would have paid a full ticket price.This is a heist, action and romance plot; much along the lines of The Thomas Crowne Affair. Like the two Thomas Crowne films, it includes some interesting, even if predictable plot twists.If you run across this in the bargain bin, or if it's available via Amazon or Netflix, it's probably worth a watch.

97,badfeelinganger,"A movie with a preposterous plot, exotic locations, absurd action sequences, and so much chemistry between actors",7,2 October 2014,"A movie with a preposterous plot, exotic locations, absurd action sequences, and so much chemistry between attractive actors that we don't care. Gets by well enough on style and star chemistry and the basic allure of watching a tightly-planned caper unfold. A certain sunny sloppiness almost redeems Jon Amiel's throwback caper flick.Connery and Zeta-Jones not only look great together, they work well together, too.Connery and Zeta-Jones are such fun to watch together it almost doesn't matter how little sense the movie makes -- and their relationship is far more gleefully perverse, weirdly chivalrous and surprisingly interesting than the trailer makes it look.Cleverly updates the formula with a sprinkling of fun, fin-DE-millennium touches.Entrapment luxuriates in the best Hollywood big bucks can buy: superb sets and cinematography, spectacular locations, expensive stars. During the opening credits the camera glides through a romanticised Manhattan skyline. The steel and chrome gleam, the lights of the skyscrapers are digital jewels and the frame of the screen is dynamically pierced at odd angles by a laser-like red beam. This sequence holds out a tantalising promise for the movie, particularly when the camera rests on a sinuous cat-burglar entering a high, tightly shut window with elegant ease. We expect an exciting, sleek and slick caper movie, something like To Catch a Thief (1954) or at least (let's not be too greedy) Arabesque (1966). It's not the stars' fault that Entrapment is disappointing. Sean Connery gets the Cary Grant treatment here, made the object of his co-star's desire. Catherine Zeta-Jones chases him just as surely and shrewdly as Audrey Hepburn chased Grant in Charade (1963). Given the 40-year age gap between them, her instigation is presumably meant to make their romance less risible, but it's an unnecessary precaution. Close-ups reveal Connery's skin is losing the battle with time, but his appeal was never really based on youth.Connery's stardom rests on his ability to represent a man completely at ease with his masculinity and his sexuality better than any other star of his generation. There was always something a bit suspect about prettier men like Paul Newman (cf. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, 1958) while tougher guys such as Clint Eastwood seemed too stiff to be turned on by anything but seaminess (Tightrope, 1984). Connery, however, deploys his physical size, gruff and commanding voice, a glance both sure and sly and a stillness that can pounce into graceful movement at any moment to project a sexuality so confident it can afford to be nonchalant and playful. We are easily convinced that what Zeta-Jones wants from him, give or take a couple of billion dollars, is delivery on the promise of a rough good time.Zeta-Jones more than holds her own here. Connery may be the object of her desire, but Zeta-Jones is meant to be the object of ours. The sight of her leotard-clad figure practising gymnastics in order to avoid the burglar alarm's lasers is more spectacular and pleasurable than the action set pieces. She emerges from Entrapment a full-blown star, flirting with such intelligent sultriness not even a man of Connery's strength can resist. Good alone but even better together, the two have an undoubted chemistry.Entrapment aspires to be nothing more than a bit of glamorous nonsense, but although it has done all right by the glamour, it has perhaps done too well by the nonsense. Very badly structured, the story begins to feel ripped off half way through, its maze of double-crossings never delivering a narrative payoff. At the unbelievable and tacked-on ending, even a cynic might feel a twinge of discomfort at the lack of even a half-hearted gesture towards a moral rationale for the action. We're meant to root for these thieves just because they look gorgeous, seem meant for each other and are good at their work.The fact that the combination of sex and capital as spectacle is thought to need no other rationale says a lot about millennial culture, and would make a good subject for another movie. But this is by-numbers genre work which has forgotten a few sums. Entrapment fails as a caper film because it neglects that fundamental ingredient - a credible plot, evidently something even the biggest chequebooks in Hollywood can no longer guarantee.",Entrapment
98,Falcon-51,Some Action a Mega-Star and a Babe,6,7 May 2000,"There is good and bad in every film, so I'm going to tell you a little about both that I found in ""Entrapment."" Let me start with the good. Despite what half the armchair critics like myself wrote about the chemistry between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones it was not all that bad. Will Smith and Kevin Kline's ""Wild, Wild West"" is an example of bad chemistry and that wasn't even their fault. If you must sit there and waste your time trying to figure out that Connery has 40 years on Zeta-Jones then you are already looking way to far into the film. If this were intended to be a very serious Drama then maybe you'd have a gripe, but this was an action/adventure and for all intensive purposes it is not supposed to be taken to literally. The same thing can be said for all the Hi-Tech toys. I thought they made the story too easy and fictitious hence if you got the money you can steal anything, but that's the breaks in an action/adventure film.
What's the story about? Well, it seems to have similar traits to the ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" Of course I'm talking about the later 1999 version with Brosnan and Russo. Rich thief's of valuable art becoming involved with women out to catch them. ""Entrapment"" is not trying to prove anything and the dialogue and plot has many unfilled holes, still it's worth seeing. If you are an action aficionado then you should make this a must-see. For guy's that just like beautiful women then sexy Catherine Zeta-Jones may be all you need to keep your eyes glued on this one. I admit she is not very talented as an actress, she was cast here for one reason only, to be beautiful, and she does a fine job of that. I must give credit for some beautiful filming locations in the feature. Then, I must also include that another big name Ving Rhames is in the film and does a fine job in his small role. The most disappointing part of the film was the ending, but even it had a plot twist. So on a final note, if your too wound up and can't enjoy a movie unless it's serious and realistic then you may want to let this one slip by, but if your an average JOE and just need your weekly fix of action and a hot chick then give ""Entrapment"" a try.",Entrapment

100,Colonel Ted,"Slick, stylish but ultimately hollow and unsatisfactory",5,10 February 2000,"Sean Connery really should give up doing action films, because on the basis of Entrapment, it's no wonder why Gidgets and Geezers (old men being cast with babes) won Worst Movie Trend at the Golden Raspberry Awards this year. Entrapment is not a bad film, but it stumbles in its romantic pairing of a crusty old man with the young and lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones. (Art imitating life here?) The plot has Zeta-Jones as insurance agent, Gin Baker pursuing master thief Robert MacDougal (Connery) after an art-heist. To get near him she poses as a thief and follows him on a heist to trap him. There are a barrage of twists in the script as to the real purposes of both characters, except after a while, they become rather tedious and predictable and by the time they are resolved, the plot has already run out of steam. As well as that, Connery's resolution not to get involved with his partners is forgotten as soon as he sees Zeta-Jones in a tight lycra suit, curving her bottom to avoid security beams. The supposedly suspenseful heists and computer disk downloads, don't really produce much tension, with the scene where the pair dangling off the World's tallest building easily the standout from a mainly mediocre lot. So what of the relationship between Connery and Zeta-Jones? Well, it has to be said that the massive age gap doesn't produce much sexual chemistry. Connery is still looking fairly good for his age and the pair's sparing certainly induce winces in the audience; in fact they do make a half-decent team. Yet one can't help thinking that Connery is really too old for action films now and should start going for character roles like Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman are doing in their old age. British director Jon Amiel handles the film with style and slickness and I have to admit that Entrapment never bored me. Yet this doesn't compensate for Entrapment's flaws and Amiel would have been better served with a more intelligent script and more appropriate casting.",Entrapment

Sean Connery doesn't fair much better with his ""lonely crook with a heart of gold"" character.  The two of them together are laughable as ""romantic"" leads.  Their chemistry is abysmal, and Sean Connery comes off more as an abusive father, rather than a sensual lover. Although most of the movie consists of this idiotic affair to forget, there are a few fairly entertaining action sequences.  Sadly, they're spread thinly out over the two hours, and we're forced to watch the stuff in-between to get to them.  This intrigue picture isn't intriguing enough to justify its two hour plus length.",Entrapment
103,shamsee,"A great Movie, but not what audience of the 90's would be able to appreciate.",9,1 December 1999,"This was an excellent movie. It kept reminding me of Alfred Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"". It actually had a real conversation, and back and forth come-backs without using un-necessary vulgar language to fake coolness. If it had been made in few decades ago, then it would have gotten the tag of being a 'Classic'. However, since it is supposed to be an action thriller, it did not have enough explosions, cursing, and blood shed to satisfy the thirst for today's audience. John Amiel is a tremendous director. His movie with Bill Murray, ""The man who knew too little"" is another movie that partially revealed his genius, but was also largely unappreciated. Catherine Zeta Jones has same class, personality, glamour and presence that Grace Kelly and Rita Hayworth had. Her character's personality should be inspiring to women. Most of all, this movie has romance, which although is NOT at the calibre of ""Casablanca"", but strongly reminds people of it. Even though the movie was not about romance, for me that was the best part. There was some decency and purity about the way two characters interacted. At almost near the end of the movie V. Rhimes character, who the director hints is like the ""Loui's"" character from ""Casablanca"", delivers the line that ""...this feels like an ending of a terrible friendship"".
One has to be very keen fan to notice that. I think John Amiel messed that part up. He did not let V. Rhimes  character develop enough, for that line to have an impact. Also, he did not give the lead characters an opportunity in a bit less stressful surroundings to open up, show their vulnerabilities, and get to know each other. However, I will recommend that those who enjoy movies like ""To Catch a Thief"", ""North by Northwest"", and ""Casablanca"", to see this movie, as it gets you close to those times.",Entrapment

107,Doc-134,A Perfect Example of A Hollywood Star Movie,4,4 May 1999,"I did not go into ""Entrapment"" expecting too much, and well, there wasn't much. I have come to the conclusion that there are only two reasons why people may like this movie and both have to do with the two leading stars. Sean Connery is universally seen as the best looking older man and his Scottish charm is of course also one of his attractions. Then there is Catherine Zeta Jones, a red-hot newcomer whose luscious figure would make any man want to watch. ""Entrapment"" is a perfect example of a Hollywood star film, which has the sole purpose of raking in as much cash as possible. Any attraction to the film is based entirely on its stars. I saw the movie with a number of people who liked it, and when I was discussing it with them, all of their praise was based on the two leads.The director, Jon Amiel is generally an unknown film-maker to most people. He has done ""Copycat"" and ""Sommersby"", both of which are average films and whose success can be attributed to the stars. ""Entrapment"" does not contain any breakthroughs in terms of editing or cinematography, and it certainly does not have an original plot. We have seen the formula that makes this movie many times, perhaps in varying inflections, but essentially the same. So what's left, entertainment value. Many people reading this review may think that I do not look at films in terms of entertainment value. Not the case. There are many films that I have given excellent reviews to based entirely on the merit of entertainment. Two recent examples that I can think of are ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Go"". But ""Entrapment"" lacks anything close to what might have been an entertaining or interesting plot. The idea of basing a heist that will only work if it is conducted on New Years of the Millennium is a great idea. I would love to see a film about the meticulous planning and the execution of such an endeavor. ""Entrapment"" tries to accomplish too much and ends up leaving such huge plot holes that the film feels rushed and absurd.Gin (Catherine Zeta Jones) takes on the role of an insurance agent/undercover thief who hooks up with Robert (Sean Connery) a rich career criminal to execute a couple of huge international heists. They train together in Robert's castle. There are a few scenes here that I enjoyed. I especially liked the scenes of Gin practicing avoiding lasers simulated by strands of yarnOf course Robert and Gin have a romantic tension that is complicated by the rules of being a thief. You can not trust each other if you're romantically involved, right? At first, they do not seem to get along. Hollywood loves to put together two misfits who have to put aside their differences to accomplish some task. This formula has marked the cop-buddy film for years. Take for instance the first Lethal Weapon. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover at first hate each other. And in ""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"" Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson did not at first get along, but in the end their differences are put aside and they emerge as friends.""Entrapment"" also exists as a catalyst to Hollywood's ongoing trend to have romantic encounters between young, extremely attractive women, and much older men. There is a forty year age difference between Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Zones. Other recent examples of this trend include Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow in ""A Perfect Murder"" and Harrison Ford and Anne Heche in ""Six Days Seven Nights"". This trend is not necessarily a negative thing, but in ""Entrapment"", it's just too blatantly obvious and cliched.""Entrapment"" is a movie that had potential, but got lost in a number of cliches and its hurriedness. Connery and Jones do have chemistry and look good together, but forget the romantic tension; leave it for romantic films. Forget the first heist; it feels like filler to keep us occupied until the final scenes and climax. A strong film could have been made with the planning of the year 2000 heist. Because it would be the heist of the century, so many ideas could have been developed which would have made for a much more entertaining film.** out of ****",Entrapment

Surprise, surprise.",2,7 August 2016,"The presence of Sean Connery can often rescue a dire movie but not when it is a truly dire movie because one of the main actors, Catherine Zeta Jones, has not talent whatsoever. This Welsh woman can mimic an American accent but that is all she does, mimic not convince, nor can she convince us that she is a savvy , experienced, hard-nosed insurance investigator. Without her, the movie might have been a success, but her presence was required because she was married to Michael Douglas.

Together, they steal a jewel mask and fall for one another. However, Gin has an idea to pull off the ultimate heist on New Years Eve, 1999 (there's a funny Y2K subplot involved in that one). And it can also be noted that the climax of this picture is NOT for the acrophobic.""Entrapment"" isn't much more than a stylish, glossy caper film. But in an era when movie protagonists are violent loners or thin rebels, it's quite refreshing to see Connery and Zeta-Jones light up the big screen as a pair we can root for cheerfully. With people in movies either being too violent or totally devoid of a personality, I'd actually like to see the two lead characters from ""Entrapment"" again sometime.

In a way, it's a bit of a shame because it's a decent heist movie with a good plot and pretty good acting. Sean Connery was, as always, excellent in his role and the cinematography.

111,Adec,"Not quite sharp enough to be great, but still very good...",8,8 September 1999,"Entrapment feels old, not old in a bad way, more old fashioned like a caper film from the sixties or seventies but injected with a nineties gloss. Now that's not a bad thing, but it does lead to the occasional stretch where things slow down dramatically, only to speed up again at a later point, stopping and starting as it switches from caper to drama to mystery and back again. That's not to say that Entrapment is disjointed, it's not, it's just that it's structure and execution owes more to the past than to the more recent all action set piece format so popular and prominent these days. And better still it manages to pull it off...pretty much.While it's not quite sharp enough to pull everything off perfectly there are no real missteps and the script (by Ronald Bass and William Broyles jr.) and direction (by Jon Amiel) are both well handled. But that said the films real saving grace is the two fantastic lead performances.Sean Connery is great (as usual) as the aging cat burglar, and has charm and charisma to spare, spreading both around in good measure, but the real surprise here is Catherine Zeta-Jones who gives a head turning performance and is every bit the match, both in character and screen charisma, for Connery in her best, and most natural performance yet. Zeta-Jones seems to be going from strength to strength and handles her role here with ease and skill and is a definite talent on the rise.Supporting players Will Patton and especially Ving Rhames both give good support, while Maury Chaykin is passable, if a touch cheesy, but this is really a two person show, with both Connery and Zeta-Jones igniting the screen and dominating the film to great effect.Overall Entrapment is nothing remarkably new, but that said it still makes a good bet for good, old fashioned entertainment and has enough thrills, twists and charm to more than sustain it's length, plus two top notch performances, and as such is a hell of a lot of fun at the end of the day.8/10 One Man's Opinion.",Entrapment

To discourage skepticism, one can be distracted by the clever antics of the thieves, their strong personalities (Could Sean Connery ever be boring?), the convoluted plot (Who are the good guys and the bad guys?) and the well-paced action.

Sean Connery, not-so-fantastic in this role, did help set the realism (if any) for the first half which I must say was shot magnificently in Scotland.

117,snaunton,"Slick, tense, entertainment, with a twist that works",7,7 November 1999,"I suppose we can accept the excitement of thievery, but not really its romance. In this film, the uncertainty as to who is stealing what, for which purpose and for whom adds some extra interest to a story, the outcome of which can be predicted almost from the beginning.I do not really think that the film is about theft, or that it takes an ethical position in relation to theft (in itself, perhaps, ethically risky). Rather, it is about excellence, about being the best at what you do; and it succeeds in demonstrating something of the commitment needed, and the satisfactions to be found, in the exercise of superlative skills.It is amazing that Connery still manages to convince in action roles, but how very clever to give him so lithe and stunning an amanuensis as Miss Zeta-Jones. In her role as Gin Baker, she claims a perfection that seems justified and which is an undeniable part of the appeal of the film. In the rehearsal for and performance of the defining theft scene, which could so easily have slipped into bathos, Miss Zeta-Jones is convincing and her balletic grace entrances. The switches between the tough girl and vulnerability are intrinsic to the stereotype, but are well done, and we manage to admire and sympathize with her character throughout. The action scene towards the end is sufficiently tense for the genre, and the final scene twists the plot, and the people and roles switch sufficiently, to add a final touch of irony.This film succeeds completely in what it seeks to achieve, without troubling to puzzle us with the plot, it is thoroughly entertaining, with some interesting locations, plenty of action and enough tension.

119,Erick-12,Late Capitalism as Symptom of Entrapment,6,30 October 2005,"_Entrapment_ was produced like the usual thriller plus romantic interest. But beyond this pop B-movie work, the film is a symptom of so-called ""late capitalism"" or our own global era of market dominance and online networks. The film envisions the Malaysian capital as a real Cyberjaya which is one of the centers of networked global financial transactions. High-tech criminals, assisted by actor Sean Connery's stern-yet-likable masculine mastery, plan to tap into the heart of these financial transactions during a Y2K preparedness test of a bank's main computers. The computers are said to be privately networked to New York and other metropolitan centers of transnational capital flows. The tallest towers in the world are the site of this crime--as though the nebulous and secretive interconnections of transnational flows requires some visible ""center"", some master-signifier or sign of mastery to enable the mis-en-scene of an otherwise nondramatic and non-visual act. This crime intends to download relatively small amounts of money from hundreds of banks operating across Asia. Such a crime could take place by hacking in from a ranch in Oklahoma, but Hollywood style needs to visualize the actors on a set which itself defines a specific imagery. So the difficulty we have with ""cognitive mapping"" of the new social formations across global dislocations and complex flows of postmodern value is imaginatively solved in such films by registering landmarks: the tallest towers in a city constructed on the promise of digital networks and overseas investment. Interesting to note that Malaysia officially complained about this film, since it used cinematographic techniques to make a slum appear right next to the shining hypermodernity of Cyberjaya (or the symptoms of the 3rd world right in the shadow of the symptom of the 1st world). This juxtaposition was manipulated by Hollywood and led to the Malaysian complaint of bad press. The film apparently made some feeble gestures to show that it is not merely a symptom of our times, but also a deliberate revelation. Much more should be said about this, but not in this cramped space...",Entrapment

The version I saw was a never ending string of cliches embedded into a plot so flimsy it couldn't stand up if it were not for Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The direction of Jon Amiel was a never ending series of well worn manipulation techniques that were not even well done. I don't mind being a passive observer, but I do not like to be blatantly manipulated.Several times during the movie I found it difficult not to laugh out load at the ludicrousness of what I was seeing. For example, in the well advertised scene of Catherine Zeta-Jones wriggling her way through the fake laser beams I couldn't stop thinking ""Why doesn't she just crawl"" or ""What was the point of that move?"" It's indicative of the whole movie. It's a scene played for the audience, and we aren't supposed to be there. In another scene between Sean Connery and Ving Rhames, Rhames scolds Connery for changing partners etc. Who is this scene for? We discover later in yet one more feeble plot twist that these two know this conversation is a sham, but rather than playing it out to further some clever hidden agenda it is solely to pull the wool over the eyes of the audience. And as I've stated before, the audience is not supposed to be there.There are so many good caper movies ranging from The Great Train Robbery to Ronin to The Great Escape. It is truly a disservice to the research that went into making those movies to add this fairy tale to the same genre. There are movies like Spanish Prisoner and even Wild Things that do a far better job at consistent plot twists and intrigue. Even the bank job concept was better done in Superman III. In short this movie was a waste of time and money.",Entrapment
139,Paul P,Don't get trapped in the theater with this one,2,11 May 1999,"Sean Connery cashes a check, and Catherine Zeta-Jones becomes an early front-runner for a Razzie worst-actress-of-the-year award in this unimaginative and often laughable movie.While there are a couple mildly interesting heist scenes, the movie throws most of its energy into trying to build sexual tension between its two uninteresting lead characters who--as in so many bad movies of recent years--were born half a century apart.  The flimsy mood is broken whenever they speak to each other, which they do in dialogue that seems like it comes from a Saturday Night Life parody of itself (""it wasn't clever, it was. ..PERFECT!"").  The title of the movie is spoken in one of the dumbest exchanges of all.If you manage to stay to the end, you will see Entrapment disintegrate into a bunch of bad cliches.  These include the heroes dangling from the top of a skyscraper by a steel cable (which of course must start to snap) while a crowd of thousands of people below (that is looking up, no less!) doesn't notice.  Then there are several surprise revelations that don't fit with the logic of what has happened earlier.  Apparently, the writers felt that they could make up for writing a by-the-numbers heist script by ending with the tired thriller cliche of a-half-dozen-pointless-plot-twists-that-make-no-sense.On the plus side, there were several things I learned about the business of cat burglary from this movie: (1) If, after you steal a piece of art from a museum that is swarming with police, you and your partner feel it necessary to stop outside and scream at each other at the top of your lungs, don't worry. Nobody will notice you! (2) Apparently, a bank won't notice if several billions of dollars are suddenly shifted into a new account. (3) While I have had posters damaged in the mail after sending them in cardboard tubes (which subsequently got crushed), cat burglers are not afraid of this happening to a priceless canvas. (4) The easiest way to break into a skyscraper is to scale to the top on the outside.",Entrapment
140,mitas-marios,overestimated movie,3,25 July 2009,"First of all Sean Connery is an overestimated actor. This movie is overestimated too. I do not like neither plot and actors in this movie. This movie is trying to depreciate the IQ of people. I m boring see Sean Connery to be the wise and the perfect guy in the movies and every time with the same ""unnameable"" style. Why plot is so stupid? Because two guys have stolen the ""International Clearance Bank"" and they avoided FBI and CIA and finally the end was too happy. The plot and the end was so predictable. Finally i think Catherine Zeta-Jones is an overestimated actor too. Let see the true which is if she was not so beautiful she would never be a good actor.",Entrapment

A woeful movie. From around the same time the Brosnan/Russo re-make of The Thomas Crown Affair treads a similar path of high-class thief, tracked and entangled with an investigator. Ok, so Entrapment had a couple of twists, but they weren't enough to maintain interest, and it wasn't a patch on its competitor. Apparently Brosnan turned this down to play Thomas Crown. Wise move Mr B. (Or was it the other way around - that Connery declined to play in this one? Not so wise move Sir Sean.)",Entrapment
143,GrammarCub,Entrapment is a hit-and-miss prospect,7,30 April 1999,"For pure entertainment value, you can't go wrong with Entrapment. Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones are sexy and suave as a pair of art thieves who find themselves falling in love. Connery plays his usual character - dashing, brave, and the quintessential ladies' man; he always seems to have a quip ready to spout and the savoir-faire that makes his fanny-patting James Bond style work. Of course, Connery is arguably the best of the actors who have portrayed James Bond; his latest characters have put that panache to good use, whether playing a hardened criminal in The Rock, a criminal mastermind in The Avengers, or an ingenious art thief in Entrapment. Is Connery getting typecast? That's a discussion to be held at a later time - but his character here, Robert ""Mac"" MacDougal seems to have echoes of many of his earlier characters.Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose main claim to fame thus far has been the romantic interest opposite Antonio Banderas in The Mask of Zorro, is a sultry and sassy Virginia ""Gin"" Baker. Zeta-Jones tries hard to hold her own against Connery, but it's really his show and she's just there for the eye candy. Not that the audience was complaining - she is a very attractive woman and the sheer gymnastic routines she goes through to steal the artwork will be the stuff of every preteen boy's dreams for weeks to come. For all her sex appeal, however, I found it difficult to take Zeta-Jones seriously in this role. She's not the most experienced actress in the world, and often her dialogue sounds forced and unnatural.The plot is a basic rehash of Mission: Impossible and The Rock, a sort of ""let's break into the impregnable fortress"" show that features high-tech special effects and some acrophobic stunt work. We see three individual ""heists"" here - a Rembrandt, a priceless Chinese mask, and the money supply of Southeast Asia. One big problem I had with the movie is that Mac is supposedly a legendary criminal - he's the guy who (right or wrong) gets blamed for the major art heists. However, we see Baker doing all the work, even so far as planning each job. The movie fails to put a real handle on Connery as a thief and instead plays him mainly as a love interest. Due to some machinations of the screenwriters, Ronald Bass and William Broyles, Mac manages to stay ahead of Gin by stealing her clothing (off-screen), stealing the stolen Rembrandt (again off-screen), and stealing the Chinese mask (yet again off-screen).Director Jon Amiel strives for some stunning visuals here; there are terrific shots of Gin practicing to beat a laser-protected field, of Kuala Lampur at night, and the opening sequence ranks right up there with the Langley break-in from the movie Mission: Impossible for sheer excitement and invention. As in Mission: Impossible, Ving Rhames is in the cast, acting tough and spitting out pithy tough-guy sayings.Entrapment isn't nearly as well-done as Mission, but it does have some terrific sequences and the characters, while not fully fleshed out, are at least engaging enough to spend a couple of hours with. There are some major plot holes, but why quibble? Entrapment moves right along and has enough plot twists to keep you interested, so take a date and spend the next two hours trying to figure out how to get him into bed.",Entrapment

And about the beautiful Catherina Zeta-Jones...this girl is one to keep an eye on. She is playing this character pretty good. If you like her, you will find the scene where she is playing the snake act in the laserstreams definitely erotic!!!

How could that go wrong?Well I still don't know how, but it did, big time.The movie opens up well enough. We get treated to a high-tech, Mission: Impossible style break in. A mysterious person watching from the shadows. The viewer gets right into it.Fifteen minutes later all of the suspense goes right out the window.The first key to a thriller like this is having characters who remain a mystery throughout the movie. Zeta-Jones spills the beans about her character in the said fifteen minutes, and Connery is merely an art thief that everybody in the WORLD knows about.Key two: A duel of the minds. You can't tell me for one second that you ever thought that Zeta-Jones could outsmart a stump of wood, let alone Connery.Chemistry, 0.Dialogue, repetitive and just plain stupid (ie. ""You should take a look at the facts!"" ""Why don't you take a look at the facts?"" ""Why should I take a look at the facts?"")Suspense, a bit.

155,OnlineObserver,I think this film needs more appreciation,10,19 May 2017,"Well to begin with, the film ""Entrapment"" has Sean Connery as the main actor with co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones. Could you pick better actors to star in a movie? Probably. Although, I think they were well picked for this film in particular. Sean was perfect to play the suave and sophisticated gentlemen and Catherine was perfect to play the beautiful and confident lady. What do they both have in common in acting abilities? They both are convincing when it comes to playing intelligent characters who can survive in fantasy film plots.I think Entrapment is a really good film! This action film actually has an interesting story where you more or less follow two criminals, who are working together, who are stealing rare artwork from famous museums and galleries from across the globe. They are also only working together because they are both using each other secretly, but neither one finds out until nearly halfway - to the end of the film. Action films, I think, are only good when there is an interesting and different story behind it to give it some substance. Otherwise, I get bored of watching films where there is just fighting and people firing guns when the plot is pathetic. If you are a fan of Sean Connery or Catherine Zeta-Jones's as actors, then you should definitely see this film. I actually think they make a very attractive on screen couple, even with the big age gap, although, I am probably biased given that I love them both as actors. This film is a lot of fun to watch, so don't miss out on it!",Entrapment
156,Ares-2,"Pretty good, just not a GREAT film",7,2 May 1999,"I was really looking forward to this movie. As a fan of Sean Connery, and of ""Thief"" stories as a whole, I thought this might be the penultimate Thief movie.  While both Catherine and Sean were great in this film, they are the only reason to see it. The plot has a couple interesting twists, but is predictable throughout. All in all I gave this 7 outa 10 points. (I would watch it on TV, but won't rent it when it comes out on video)  If you are looking for a REALLY good thriller, rent ""Heat"" or ""The Usual Suspects"" both of which I consider to be the best of the genre.

I decided to go see the movie anyway because I was doing spring shopping and there was no other movie I was interested in. I went with two friends, and we all expected the movie to be bad. I thought it would be average at best. Since we had such low expectations, the movie was very enjoyable. I really liked it. Go into this movie with low expectations, and you will be pleasantly surprised. If you go into this movie with high expectations, this movie might be a disappointment. The plot of this movie is far-fetched, but intelligent. The movie makes you think, and is very confusing at the end. It is a movie that you probably need to watch more than once.

Sean tries hard in this film, but he is not convincing anymore as a romantic, adventurous leading man.  Since this, he has gone on to more understated roles, which I think should suit him very well for the rest of his career.Despite Sean's efforts, this film is a convoluted mess.  It is filled with plot holes (after having ALL of her clothes stolen from her hotel room, how is it Gin's wearing a different outfit the next day?...how is it that Gin can scale a wall in the castle and walk across a 4 inch beam like it's nothing, yet get all wobbly while walking across an 18 inch ledge?) and there is really no chemistry between the two leads.Catherine Zeta-Jones is really nothing more than eye-candy...and very nice candy, indeed.  Regardless, she is no actor.I felt that the pacing of the film was really poor.  There was never any tension developed.  Not in the heist scenes and not between any of the characters.  After about 70 minutes, I felt like I'd been sitting through this for 2 hours!Despite all that I've mentioned, the real problem here is the script.  It does not matter who the actors are, who is directing, what the basic story is or how eye-popping the FX; if the script is bad, the film is bad.

169,SYMBOLIQ,Trapped,4,20 May 1999,"Trapped was how I felt while watching the film Entrapment. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I went through the other reviews and was thoroughly surprised to read that there were many people out there who enjoyed the movie. My thinking is that - what was there to enjoy? The plot was unoriginal, the script lame and the acting absolutely soulless. As far as I was concerned, it could have been two unknowns as the lead actors and the effect would have been the same. It is such a waste that big names like Connery and Zeta-Jones were used for a humdrum movie like this.Much was said about the ""chemistry"" between the two leads. Romantic, intriguing, charming were some of the words I saw being used to describe the relationship. I beg to differ. I would use more befitting words like contrived, incestuous and downright disgusting. Didn't anyone notice the 40-year age gap between them? Had they kept their relationship purely professional, then the movie would have been slightly more palatable.There were two reasons why I decided to watch the movie. First was the two leads and second, the filming location. Having being disappointed by the former, I was hoping that the latter would have been the saving grace. Being a Malaysian, I was eager to watch how the Petronas Twin Towers, currently the tallest building in the world, would have looked on the big screen. Of course, a sense of pride enveloped me when the first few glimpses of the majestic towers were shown. It is not often that major movie productions come here for filming. Although some scenes were manipulated (like the scene when Connery and Zeta-Jones were on a boat on the Malacca river with the Twin Towers on the background. Malacca and Kuala Lumpur are over 100 km apart!), I couldn't help but feel a sense of fulfillment whenever a familiar setting was shown. Notwithstanding the fact that none of the actors who potrayed Malaysians were actually from Malaysia. Perhaps ""Anna and the King"" starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fatt would do justice to talented local actors. This remains to be seen as the movie is still actively shooting here.In conclusion, I feel that unless you're a Malaysian, there's nothing that the movie can offer that's groundbreaking. You'll leave the cinema with a hollow feeling and will find yourself hard-pressed to recall a scene that will make an impact in your movie-going life.",Entrapment

That being said he is still Sean Connery, and will be cooler at 90 than just about anyone else at 30.  One of the best things that a heist movie can show is the level of preparation the characters go through before pulling off their caper, and this movie spent an enjoyable amount of time on that aspect -- providing some shots of Ms. Zeta-Jones that were worth the price of admission. In the end, they lost the mystique of the cat burglar and opted for an action-adventure cop-out ending.  And the final heist was trite.  [See Superman 3 and Office Space].

It isn't quite sure whether it wants to be an action movie, a heist movie or a sneaky espionage-type movie. So it tries to be all of these. And it doesn't quite work.Here is the tale. Sean Connery plays an ageing but still very successful art thief. Catherine Zeta Jones appears as the insurance investigator charged with capturing him. Is she all she appears to be, though? Is he?Her plan is to present herself as a potential protege so as to be taken into his schemes. She is, of course, successful. She soon demonstrates a developed ability at thievery that should have set a few alarm bells ringing, or rather keep them silent.Anyway, the suggestion is that she is a professional who has infiltrated the insurance company to use them as a legitimate cover to nick lots of nice bits and bobs. The on screen relationship between Sean and Cathy is a little more sensible then you usually get - he is, after all, old enough to be her grandfather.But in the end it is that wily old Scottish National Party supporter who comes up short.

There was no chemistry between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Ok, I have to rant a little bit.  I will always give good movies their due, but this movie was terrible.SPOILERS:1)  When they  are in the big party scoping out the castle to get ready to steal the mask or whatever, the clock says 10:30 pm.  Next we see them under the castle blowing up the floor to match the clock bells at midnight.  So this HUGE extravagant party was over and everybody completely cleared out in 1 and a half hours?  Maybe they came back the next night, but I don't think so.   With this movie's pacing and direction, it was impossible to tell what day was what, when things happened etc.2)  That stupid looking Mega-Tower that they were to infiltrate.  Give me a break.  Hmmmm, big sky-walk 1000 feet off the ground, I wonder if the thieves are going to somehow end up hanging on it or falling from it...wow what a surprise! They did!3)  The ending was plain atrocious.  Sean's friend lets him go because of some stupid fake kidnapping plot?  They finally caught the art thief of the century and they are guarding him with..hmm...2 cops?

Does nobody pay attention to what is happening in the various building (none of the guards, I mean) ? Also there are a lot of inconsistencies which should have been sorted out before making this film. Zeta-Jones may look great in a catsuit, her bending around invisible beams may look sexy, but sometimes she bends directly into the beams. How come it takes her more time to get to the mask than to retrieve it, yet the alarm is not being set of. Curiouser and curiouser.

192,uflbri,Rent Mission Impossible or Goldfinger instead,2,9 May 1999,"Although it was refreshing to sit through an entire action movie without seeing one fatality, this movie was dull.  The action sequences were unimaginative and predictable.  The problem is that the characters don't run into any problems.  What makes crime capers fun is that they never quite go as planned.The film was written by ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" screenwriter Ron Bass. More than likely, it was the result of a pitch meeting, where established writers try to convince studio bosses to pay them to write treatments, and ultimately scripts.  The disadvantage of this method of script creation is that often, thin ideas are never fully fleshed out.  This is a prime example of that defect.  Instead of developing a story, the studio simply attached two charismatic stars to the project and hoped that the rest would take care of itself.  Based on the mostly-positive reaction to the movie, it can be argued that such hopes were well-founded.  I disagree.  The movie needed more conflict and a more developed plot.Rent ""Mission Impossible"" if you want to see how action sequences and contrived plot are SUPPOSED to unfold.  Or if you're dying for a glimpse of the ever-entertaining Sean Connery (or you need to work on that hilarious impression of him that you're developing) rent Goldfinger or another Bond classic.

Connery, as always, is good (although his character was not as fleshed out as he could have been,) and Ving Rhames, while covering no new territory, does a passable job. But Catherine Zeta-Jones seems incapable of showing any emotion other than outright glee or despair, and Will Patton exhibits his one-face-fits-all acting style again.Unfortunately, this movie strikes me as a good idea gone horribly wrong.

Though the two actors are about four decades apart in age, the attraction between them is very believable.  Afterall, Sean Connery has long been hailed as one of the most sexiest men alive, despite the fact he's now in his 70's, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is, well, just breathtakingly beautiful.It is not just the steamy connection that the two have on screen that makes this film worthwhile.  The action scenes make the movie easy to keep focused on.

Also, there are many discrepancies in the relationships between the characters.  Obviously the writer and director were trying to confuse the audience by hiding the ""true"" identities of some of the characters.  There is nothing wrong with that in this type of movie.  However, doing so by having characters say and do things that openly contradict earlier scenes is not excusable.  The performances of Connery, Zeta-Jones, and Rhames are very good considering what they had to work with as far as dialogue goes.  As a gen-x male, I must applaud the appearance of Catherine Zeta-Jones.  WOW!!!!  It almost made everything else seem unimportant.",Entrapment

There's something for everybody to see.  But, the missing details make the film an unbelievable mess.  Wouldn't you expect a huge rush of cold wind if you opened a gigantic window on an upper story of a tall building in the middle of winter?

If you're looking for character development, good dialogue or a halfway decent plot, this is the wrong movie. Even if you're looking for Catherine Zeta-Jones' butt, you're still going to be disappointed. (You saw it all in the previews.) The only compelling aspects of the completely 2-dimensional characters were due to the fact that he's Sean Connery and she's Catherine Zeta-Jones. But even James Bond with a Hellenesque beauty at his side cannot save this cerebrally-challenged script.The worst part is that it was too painful to make fun of. If a cheap and bad horror movie is a man falling off of his bike that you can laugh at (and sometimes laughs with you), than ""Entrapment"" is a catastrophic and very painful train wreck.

Unfortunately Entrapment left me utterly disappointed.The movie itself makes an attempt to glorify the art of theft and desire for money.  Which, if done in the right manner, can be pulled off.  However, Entrapment's very premise left much more to be desired.The entire movie was simply two thieves moving from one job to the next in hopes of making more money from their endeavor.  I found myself drifting off, wishing their was more of a solid plot.And if the lack of a solid plot wasn't enough, most of the scenes were not very exciting, and left me wanting more.  For example, the scene in which Jones' navigates through a series of lasers (string in practice), is an obvious substitute for the quintessential action/adventure sex scene, and not a very good one at that.Another of the many aspects that annoyed me was that Connery and Jones' were not only thieves but vanishing magicians during the movie, appearing and disappearing out of thin air.  This ruined the credibility even more so.In conclusion, Entrapment was a bad movie, and if you are a Connery or Jones' fan, don't spend the 8 bucks to see it.
