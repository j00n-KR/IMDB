0,Leofwine_draca,"Perfectly watchable, although it's the least of the series",6,20 August 2016,"Now I do enjoy the MAD MAX films. They're the epitome of Australian cult filmmaking on a budget: filled with uniquely Aussie humour, outlandish characters and plenty of action. In fact, MAD MAX 2 is one of my favourite films ever, finishing with that massive, sprawling chase sequence that's still inspiring filmmakers today (Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY, anyone?). For some reason, I'd never got around to watching this, the third in the series, although I had seen snippets of it on TV. I wasn't impressed by the scenes I saw: it seemed cheesier and sillier than what had come before, more child friendly. And the presence of Tina Turner seemed a definite distraction.When I saw MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME was showing on TV again, I decided to bite the bullet and sit down and watch it, fearing the worst. I didn't get that, but this is definitely the weakest MAD MAX film of the series. The heart and soul of the story is missing from this one. It seems like a tired repeat of the last movie, with an unwelcome American presence in the likes of Tina Turner and more Hollywood ideals. Much of the blame must lie on the troubled production: the producer died causing George Miller to back out and only direct the action sequences while another hand took over the character and dialogue moments. The result is a mixed production. The action scenes, of which there are only really two – the 'gladiator combat' scene in the Thunderdome, and the final chase – are exquisite, as good as that which has come before, and very entertaining. Not original, but still entertaining.The non-action scenes drag like heck. The colony of feral children are mostly irritating, with too many attempts to make them 'cute'. They actually reminded me of the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI. Gibson's character is underwritten in this one, so that he barely speaks and seems like a void at the centre of the film. There's no sense of his desperation or his primal nature here, he's just a stock hero character. I found Tina Turner to be pretty insipid as the would-be villainess, although I was happy to see Bruce Spence returning as the helicopter pilot, albeit he plays a different character this time around. I was also delighted by the casting of veteran dwarf actor Angelo Rossitto who bags something of a swan song performance late on in his career. So, the final result: a hit and miss effort, soon forgotten. The final chase scene, though, is worth watching, even if it is a case of revisiting past glories.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
1,SnoopyStyle,Embrace the Camp,8,1 December 2014,"Max (Mel Gibson) is driving his camel wagon train across the desolate wasteland. Jedediah (Bruce Spence) and his son flying their plane steal his vehicle. Max tracks Jedediah to Bartertown which is run by Aunty Entity (Tina Turner). He makes a deal with Aunty. She wants him to take on MasterBlaster who run the Underworld. Master is the midget riding on top of the giant Blaster. They produce methane from pig manure and have become arrogant. Max fakes a confrontation with MasterBlaster and they settle the dispute in the Thunderdome. ""Two men enter, One man leave."" After ripping Blaster's helmet off, Max is unable to finish him off and Aunty's minion kills Blaster. Max is banished for not completing the deal. He is rescued by Savannah Nix and her band of children river dwellers.I love all the camp. This one fully embraces it. Tina Turner is a great diva to play the top dog in Bartertown. Bruce Spence's return does confuse me a little but one must ignore any possible disconnection. The franchise may have started as a violent B-movie but this is a fully fun campy B-movie. I even love the Goonies and their cryptic English. It's a movie where the audience either love the fun or roll their eyes in disbelief.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
2,kosmasp,Lightning in a ... Thunderdome,6,19 May 2015,"They try to recreate the magic of the second one, but they don't succeed entirely. The action sequence this end on, is almost as good as the one in the second, but it's the things in between that might not be to most of the viewers liking. But let's recap a bit. We have Mad Max once again, who was never to be seen again by those who survived the second outing/movie. Strangely enough one actor from that movie still returns in a different role. Unless it's the same role and he had some memory loss happen to him - hard to tell.Whatever the case, you get a new bunch of people that will rely on Mad Max and again a Max who is reluctant to help. Again a female who's very pro-active and so on and so forth. You also get Tina Turner to play one main role. For those who never heard of her: She didn't have to do a whole lot of Make-Up and Hairstyle change for her role here (at least to her singing personality/celebrity persona). She seems excited and doesn't hurt the movie as much as I thought she might have.The movie is not really that bad, but not as good as it could and maybe should have been, considering the cult Mad Max has/had achieved. Apart from the end action scene, we also have a very good action scene inside the ""Thunderdome"". If that's good enough for you, than so shall be it",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
3,jboothmillard,Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,5,27 January 2018,"The first film was very good, the sequel was good, and I was interested to complete with the third and final film in the original trilogy, especially because I knew it had a famous female singer in it, directed by George Miller (The Witches of Eastwick, Babe: Pig in the City, Happy Feet, Mad Max: Fury Road) and George Ogilvie. Basically, in the wastelands of Australia in a post-apocalyptic future, former Main Force Patrol (MFP) officer 'Mad' Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) crosses the desert, Jedediah and his son, Jedediah Jr. (Adam Cockburn), in a Transavia PL-12 Airtruk attack him, stealing his camel-drawn wagon and belongings. Continuing and following their trail on foot, Max reaches the seedy community of Bartertown, he is at first refused entry, he is brought before community founder and ruler, the ruthless Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), she offers to resupply his vehicle and equipment if he completes a task for her. Aunty explains that Bartertown depends on a crude methane refinery powered by pig faeces, which is run by a dwarf called the Master (Angelo Rossitto) and his giant bodyguard the Blaster (Paul Larsson). ""Master Blaster"" and Aunty hold an uneasy truce for control of Bartertown, but the Master has begun to challenge her leadership, Aunty wants Max to provoke a confrontation with Blaster in the gladiatorial arena Thunderdome, where conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death. A convict called Pig Killer (Robert Grubb), sentenced to work for slaughtering a pig to feed his family, befriends Max, who enters the refinery to size up to Master Blaster, he finds his stolen vehicle, and discovers the Blaster is exceptionally strong, but sensitive to high-pitched noises. Max faces Blaster in the Thunderdome, using his weakness to gain the upper hand, but refuses to kill him, discovering he has special needs and the intellect of a child, Master finds out about Aunty's arrangement to have Blaster killed, he vows to have the refinery, and by extension, Bartertown, shut down. An enraged Blaster executed, Master is imprisoned, and Max is exiled, he is bound on a horse and sent in a random direction into the wasteland, the horse perishes in a sinkhole, allowing Max to free himself, and he presses on. Near death, Max is found in the desert by desert dweller Savannah Nix (Helen Buday), he is hauled to a community of children and teenagers who live on an oasis, they are all survivors of a crashed Boeing 747, and abandoned by their parents who left to find civilisation. The youngsters believe Max is a pilot named Captain G. L. Walker, returned to fix their plane and fly them to civilisation, Max denies this and insists they remain in the oasis for relative safety, knowing the only ""civilisation"" within reach is Bartertown. Some of the children, led by Savannah, leave anyway, determined to find the prophesized ""Tomorrow-morrow Land"", Max stops them by force, but another tribe member Scrooloose (Rod Zuanic) sets them free during the night and leaves with them. The tribe's leader Slake M'Thirst (Tom Jennings) asks Max to go after them, he agrees, taking a few of the children with him to help. They find Savannah's group, but they are unable to save one of the children from a sinkhole, with limited supplies, they are forced to head for Bartertown. They sneak in via the underground, and with the help of Pig Killer they free Master, escape in a train-truck, and destroy Bartertown's methane refinery in the process. Aunty leads the inhabitants in a pursuit, catching up to them, Max's group slows them while Scrooloose hijacks one of the vehicles, which happens to be Max's vehicle. The group comes across Jedediah and his son, Max coerces the pilot into helping his group escape in their aeroplane, after clearing a path the plane is able take off and escape, but Max is left to Aunty's mercy. Aunty spares his life, having come to respect Max, she departs and is presumably making good on her vow to rebuild Bartertown, the children are flown to the coast by Jedediah, there they discover the nuclear-devastated ruins of Sydney. Years later, the children have established a small society for themselves, wanderers have been lost in the ruins, Savannah is now the leader, and reciting the story of their journey, and the man who saved them, Max, who still wanders the desert to places unknown. Also starring Frank Thring as The Collector, Angry Anderson as Ironbar and George Spartels as Blackfinger. Gibson is sort of still charismatic, but he is perhaps not as ""mad"" anymore, and Turner is certainly an interesting choice as the local dictator, the gladiatorial battle sequences are alright, the scenes with the nomadic warrior surrounded by children I recognised as being spoofed by South Park, and there is a pretty good chase sequence near the end, but it is perhaps a bit slow and not enough of a flow with the story, but it is not a bad futuristic action adventure. Mel Gibson was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and number 17 on The 100 Greatet Movies Stars. Worth watching!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

5,Tweekums,Max the Messiah,7,24 January 2010,"As it is a very long time since I watched the first two films in this trilogy I can only review this as a stand alone film; thankfully this film works well enough on its own. Having being robbed of all his possessions Max follows the thief to Barter Town, a rough desert outpost run by Aunty, played by a chain-mail wearing Tina Turner and powered by the methane produced from pig manure. The power plant is run by a dwarf known as Master and Aunty thinks he is getting above himself, the problem is wherever Master goes Blaster is also there and Blaster is a giant who can't easily be dealt with without breaking their own laws. When Max arrives offering to trade his services to get his goods back. After an arranged confrontation Max and Blaster must settle their dispute in a fight to the death in Thunderdome. Not surprisingly Max wins but when he sees Blaster without his helmet he can't kill him and is this guilty of breaking his deal with Aunty. As punishment for this he is tied to a horse and sent out into the desert. Here he finds a group of children who think he is some sort of Messiah who has come to take them to a promised land. When he says they should stay a group of them set off alone... when Max learns this he heads after them and they end up at Barter Town, here they take Master and escape by rail pursued by Aunty and her goons who are driving a strange array of vehicles.While this isn't exactly a great film it is a lot of fun with plenty of exciting action in particular the gladiatorial fight in the Thunderdome and the case sequence at the end. Tina Turner is somewhat over the top as Aunty but that is what the role called for and Mel Gibson is fine as Max. The film is notable for including a strange looking Transavia PL-12 'Airtruk', an aircraft that looks as if it was modified to look extra weird just for the film but in fact is real. The other characters were good enough although I must admit I preferred Aunty's goons to the children who could be a bit irritating at times.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

7,BA_Harrison,Mad Max Beyond Belief.,6,30 December 2009,"After he is attacked from the air and relieved of all his belongings by Jedediah the Pilot and son (Bruce Spence and Adam Cockburn), Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) wanders through the desert until he arrives at the trading settlement of Bartertown, ruled by Aunty Entity. Keen to recoup his losses, Max strikes a deal with Aunty to kill Master, the strong half of MasterBlaster, a dwarf/bodybuilder duo who control the town's power supply.Max picks a fight with Blaster, and the two enter Thunderdome, the arena where disputes are settled with a fight to the death; however, on defeating his opponent, Max discovers that Blaster is mentally disabled, and refuses to kill him, thus breaking his agreement with Aunty; his punishment is to be tied to a horse and cast into the desert without water. On the brink of death, Max is found by a tribe of children, the descendants of the survivors of an air crash, who mistake him for their mythical saviour, Captain Walker, and nurse him back to health at their desert oasis.When a handful of the children leave the safety of their home in a desperate attempt to reach civilisation, Max tries to bring them back, knowing that there is nothing beyond the oasis but a world in ruins. After a long walk through the desert, Max finds the kids, but with water in short supply, a return journey proves impossible; the group have no option but to head for Bartertown...Mad Max 2, the perfect post-apocalyptic action film, was always going to be a tough act to follow, and for the third film, a change in direction seemed inevitable; but when director George Miller sold out for the almighty dollar with a Hollywood-style action/adventure blockbuster that is often played for laughs, a legion of dedicated fans-myself included-felt somewhat betrayed.The superb photography, fantastic set design, brilliant costumes and spectacular stunts were still present, but gone was the relentless, gritty, bone crunching, and realistic violence of the first two films, replaced by a couple of admittedly fun, but extremely unbelievable, family-friendly action set-pieces (the Thunderdome fight and a final chase scene) interspersed by ill-advised attempts at humour and cringe-worthy moments of over-sentimentality.Worse still, Miller cast pop/rock legend Tina Turner in the role of Aunty (meaning the film had a catchy theme song, but a lousy lead villain), brought back 'gyrocopter captain' actor Bruce Spence in a role that still confuses the hell out of me (is he supposed to be the same character?), and virtually cloned the climax of Mad Max 2 for the ending: Max and the kids flee Bartertown on a train (exactly how and why there is a perfectly usable railway track leading into the ever shifting sands of the desert, is never explained), hotly pursued by Aunty and her cronies driving a cool selection of customised vehicles.Whilst I like the basic idea of turning Max into a quasi-mythical figure, and appreciate that, as a mindless slab of slick, slam-bang entertainment, many viewers will find that it does the trick, Beyond Thunderdome definitely lacks the power of the previous films, is a bit too bloody silly at times, and will no doubt prove to be a huge let-down for those who like their 'road warrior' to have a harder edge.I rate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome a disappointing 5.5 out of 10, which I will very generously round up to 6 because I like Turner's song, 'We Don't Need Another Hero'. Let's hope that after a 25 year hiatus from all things Rockatansky, Miller will finally put matters right with Max's long awaited fourth outing, Fury Road (due 2011).",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
8,paul_haakonsen,"It had its moments, but ultimately not an impressive movie...",4,30 August 2014,"Well, at least ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" was better than the abysmal first movie in the series, but nowhere near the second movie.Sure, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" has the best production value and most likely also the biggest budget, but the storyline just wasn't all there. And it seemed like they were trying to cater to a whole new audience here. What was up with every other scene having a kid in it or being about the tribe of children?While being nowhere near the ""Mad Max 2: Road Warrior"", then ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is still watchable, but take into consideration that it deviates quite a lot from the previous movie.I will say that they went all out in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" with the sets, costumes and vehicles. They had managed to build up a more distinct atmosphere and environment here, and that was one of the best things about the entire movie.One thing I didn't get was why they recast Bruce Spence for this third movie. In part 2 he was known as the gyro captain, and in the third movie he is known as Jedediah the pilot. Was it supposed to be two entirely different characters? I assume as much, since there were no relationship or rekindled partnership between Max and this pilot character. If that was the case, it would have been more believable if they had opted for a different actor all together.It was nice that the underlying homo eroticism tones from the previous two movies were eliminated and replaced by a more harsh and unforgiving post apocalyptic atmosphere.""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is enjoyable enough for what it was, but kind of anti-climatic following after the second movie.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
9,Quinoa1984,"silly rabbit, Mad Max is for kids...isn't he?",6,2 December 2006,"What a fascinating mess Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is. And really I'm not too sure who's to blame. Probably least of which is Mel Gibson, who is still impeccably strong as a the hero of the series, and who in this film- no matter where the epic, lumbering, what-the-hell-logic-wise script takes him- is always in fine form with a bit of humor here and there too. I'd say if anything the flaws might be a combination of two things- the script, which seems to have a focus for the first half and then once transitioning into a second part that might SEEM to connect into the first part goes off the rails into a blender of brawny chase and action sequences, and then the whole scope of the production itself, which is almost too big for its britches, so to speak. Damn it all if Miller and his team don't get major points for ambition, and for trying something different than just the high-voltage exploitation-satire flicks the first two Mad Max's were. But amid the high ideals and shooting-for-the-mainstream tactics, it becomes a case of being too much and too confusing for one common movie-goer to take. What started as a series made perfectly and astonishingly for the drive-in theaters and B-movie houses (and the Road Warrior being one of the very best ever made in that tradition), becomes a near-Peter Pan type of story of good versus, um, evil I guess.Max this time seems to be after a mysterious pilot called Jedediah (Bruce Spence, who is in a similar role but not exactly, kind of like in a Leone film I guess), and it leads him into the dingy, dangerous, pig-s*** powered Bartertown, who is lead by a brain and a brawn sort of combined (one midget, and one very large man), but seen as a threat and possible advantage to Aunt Entity (Tina Turner). She makes a deal with Max to get rid of the brawn for fuel and whatever else he might want, all to take place in the Thunderdome. This is quite a battle that ends up being waged, a very creatively staged bout where the two men go in, one man only to come out (as the on-lookers chant feverishly), with any given weapon at their disposal. When the plan doesn't go quite right though, Max is cast out into the desert, and left for dead... then found by a group of kids who have a few adults in the group of outcasts, and all think that Max is a Captain of some sort, their former leader. He isn't, but somehow he becomes apart of them finding their ""tomorrow-morrow land"", but it just really leads back to Barter-town, among other things.That's the basic gist of the story, as much as I could make of it. The flow of the story is interesting in how it moves sometimes with the same tenacity and edginess of the previous two films, most particularly with Max's time in Barter-town and how easily things can be broken if the one rule of Thunderdome is broken. It's when he goes 'Beyond' it that the script sputters and then starts up only sometimes. What laid also in the previous two films, however subtly in the first one and really with one big point (oil) in the 2nd film, with sort of social points being made, are harder to find this time around. I guess if there is any one sociological point or other it's that any sort of mini-society that forms itself is bound by convictions and ideals of what either works best (as in Barter-town) or what could lie outside in what lay in the past with the cities and civilizations. But the two appealing sides of the picture sort of collide with one another- it's neither a family film or a real mature action picture, but a weird hybrid of the two. It's a little unsettling at times to watch, like a film made right out of the desert, dirty and violent and quite unusual, and with the cuter tendencies of Return of the Jedi.This is not to say directors George Miller and George Ogilvie don't try to make it as exciting as it could be, and the final climactic battle/chase that happens between the two sides, however incoherent it becomes, does deliver better than anything else in the picture. I liked seeing how, in a sense, Miller was trying to take the scope of the climax in Road Warrior, with an important, big vehicle on the run, with little menacing vulture-type villains riding along to stop at nothing to take it down, and make it even bigger than before. But by this point I didn't really have any idea what the destination was for either side, or why the Barter-town cars were still going after them even when they already lost getting back 'the Brain'. In the end, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome carries some mesmerizing images of wastelands and people unbound from hope trying to cling to something more, and in the middle is a hero who almost becomes second tier to everything else that is going on. It's admirable and still some fun, but it's definitely least in my ranking of the three films. 6.5/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
10,Coventry,Mad Max: The Warrior ... Nanny!,6,20 July 2008,"George Miller, this time assisted by another George, *almost* made the perfect cinematic trilogy. For two and a half films, the ""Mad Max"" franchise is stupendously brilliant, with unequaled grim post-apocalyptic imagery, outrageous villainous character drawings and nail-biting suspense. The original ""Mad Max"" and particularly ""The Road Warrior"" easily rank among the greatest cult classics ever, but sadly the third and final act isn't as overpowering and unforgettable as its predecessors. I deliberately stated two-and-a-half movies, however, since the first half of ""Beyond Thunderdome"" is still a delightfully dark and old-fashioned sinister Sci-Fi story. Max, still roaming the post-nuclear deserts as a loner, gets robbed of all his possessions and arrives with empty hands in Bartertown. The place is a forced attempt to recreate civilization with trade and gambling above ground, ruled by the charismatic Auntie (Tina Turner), and a wholly impressive factory (turning pig faeces into power and energy) underground. Conflicts are settled within the titular Thunderdome, where literally all types of fighting are allowed. It is here that Mad Max defeats Auntie's nemesis, but he's nevertheless banished into the desert again. The scenes in Bartertown and especially the masterful fight in Thunderdome are surreal and magnificent cult movie material, but then the script incomprehensibly shifts into a bizarrely futuristic version of Peter Pan. Max reluctantly becomes the leader and wise Shepard of a group of forsaken children in their quest to reach Tomorrow-Morrow Land (instead of Never-Never Land, I guess) but all they ever find is the hell of Bartertown again. This second half is far too implausible and raises too many questions whilst, simultaneously, it completely lacks adrenalin-rushing action scenes and spectacular stunts. Mel Gibson notably feels uncomfortable and presumably didn't care too much himself about the choice to turn immortal Mad Max character into a nanny for a bunch of Lord of the Flies dropouts. But hey, Mel owed a lot to George Miller and the MM franchise, so what other choice did he have? There's more dialog and attempt to bring out emotion in this second half, and that's hardly ever a good thing in a testosterone-driven movie formula. The post-apocalyptic Peter Pan plot is frustratingly overlong, whereas so many potentially awesome elements of the first half begged for further elaboration, like the character of MasterBlaster and the history of Bartertown and its female leader. The film nonetheless with a good old-fashioned and steaming race/showdown in the desert, but it's too little too late. For me personally, the wondrous Mad Max saga ends when the wheel of fade points at Gulag",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
11,michaelRokeefe,Its dying time. The Thunderdome awaits two combatants.,5,15 March 2003,"Pulse pounding violence and action galore as Mad Max(Mel Gibson)stumbles into an evil oasis ruled by Aunty Entity(Tina Turner)and becomes a gladiator and is challenged to a duel-to-the-death in the Thunderdome where two men enter and one man leaves. Max is caste out into the desert and is rescued by a band of orphans. At times this nonsense is very interesting. Talk about working out a mean streak!

13,hitchcockthelegend,Max Rockatansky and the Goonie feral gang.,3,4 March 2008,"Even allowing for my unabashed love of the first two films in the franchise, and sweeping away any sort of biased leanings I might of had for the character of Max, I just can't bring myself to rate at average this cartoonery waste of space that so nearly soils what had gone before it.Gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character Mad Max Rockatansky, gone is the impacting feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world, and more crucially, gone is director George Miller's passion for the franchise. The dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film, it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third instalment. Sure the stunts are spot on (to be expected by now), and of course Miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before. Yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since ""The Road Warrior's"" crowning glory of the Petrol Tanker pursuit is replicated here, only he uses a train instead!!.It's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s, but when viewing the three films together now, Thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly, in the context of this series, anyway. I give the film 3/10 purely for one real good Thunderdome fight sequence, while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least. But this is the third time I have tried to like this film, and as glutton for punishment as I undoubtedly am, I wont be trying again, ever.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
14,poolandrews,Disappointing third entry in the Mad Max trilogy.,5,5 May 2010,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is set in a post apocalyptic Australia where a man named Max (Mel Gibson) is traveling through the vast desert, Max is attacked & his camels & wagon's full of his stuff are stolen. Max makes his way to a settlement known as Barter Town looking for his stolen goods, there he causes trouble & Barter Town ruler Auntie Entity (Tina Turner) is impressed with his fighting skills. Auntie Entiry offers Maxa deal, kill a man & he goes free with his possessions returned to which Max agrees. After his opponent is defeated in the Thunderdome arena Max is banished & left to die in the desert but is found by a tribe of children living in a valley who think Max is their saviour...This Australian American co-production was directed by George Miller & George Ogilvie, not many films have two credited director's but it is generally thought that Miller handled the action side of things while Ogilvie handled the drama & people moments. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a very different type of film that came before, the original mad Max (1979) was a violent revenge drama with some brutal action scenes while Mad Max 2 (1981) is surely one of the best action films of the decade with some stunning stunts & inspired the whole post apocalyptic action film genre while Mad max Beyond Thunderdome is widely regarded as toning the action & violence down to appeal to a more mainstream audience & it's hard to disagree as everything that made the original two mad Max films so special has been watered down. The first third of the film is set in Barter Town & is reasonably good as far as post apocalyptic action films go but then it changes direction & a tribe of children are introduced that Max feels compelled to protect as they help him regain a bit of humanity, these kids are a bit annoying actually especially with their broken English mixed-up dialogue that does get irritating quite quickly & their silly myth about an airplane pilot that they go into great detail about (lucky us...). At well over 100 minutes it does drag at times & while it's watchable it feels predictable & the action scenes can't really compare to those in Mad Max 2.Again there's the whole end of humanity post apocalyptic look, while in the other two Mad Max films it looked quite real here the production design is very elaborate & a bit showy. The final chase revolves around a train & various bad guy's chasing it, it's OK but not as exciting or dramatic as the chases in the other Mad Max films. The violence is tamer here, in fact apart from a few fights there isn't any. Just as the end credits start it says on screen 'For Byron' which is a reference to producer Byron Kennedy who was killed in a helicopter crash while scouting for locations for the film in 1983.The film looks good if a little staged, the stunts & action are good but nothing spectacular & that just about sums up the whole film, good but not spectacular. Filmed around New South Wales in Australia. The acting is alright, I didn't like the little dwarf Angelo Rossito as you can barely understand what he's saying while pop star Tina Turner doesn't really do anything other than deliver a few lines.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't a terrible film by any means, it's not exactly great but it's watchable. It's just that the first two & Mad Max 2 in particular as so good that this watered down vision of Max was always going to disappoint. A Rumours of a fourth Mad Max have persisted over the years but I doubt it will ever happen.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Bartertown is not a friendly place and Max soon finds himself in the middle of a power struggle between its leader, Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), and her rival Master Blaster, a dwarf/giant combo. This results in Max having to face Blaster in the gladiatorial arena called Thunderdome, where ""Two men enter, one man leaves."" The least of the Mad Max series is still a good one. It's fun and clever, with some of the same quirky inventiveness that the second movie had. The unique sets, costumes, and characters are all fantastic. Aunty Entity, Master Blaster, Doctor Dealgood, and the kids in search of Tomorrow-morrow Land are wonderful characters. This movie is not as dark or violent as the previous two and is much more mainstream in its appeal. That's not necessarily a bad thing, in my opinion. It also has a nice script with plenty of memorable lines. The cast is terrific, with Tina Turner having her best acting role and Mel giving another enjoyable turn as Max. Let's not forget this movie gave us two great Tina Turner songs: ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" and ""One of the Living."" It's an entertaining movie that I probably enjoy even more now than when I saw it in the theater as a kid.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
16,view_and_review,We Don't Need Another Hero,7,28 October 2019,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was a bigger production than its predecessor: Road Warrior. I still think I like Road Warrior better. The nemesis was more nemesisee and Mad Max himself was in more peril.Beyond Thunderdome was lighter as far as mood (which the presence of children may have caused). This time the nemesis was the incomparable Tina Turner as Aunty Enmity, but I couldn't bring myself to hate her. The character wasn't a real hatemonger and... it's Tina Turner. She was the Beyonce before Beyonce.One thing I'll give Beyond Thunderdome over Road Warrior is the theme song. It's top ten in my book. In 2002, for Spider-Man, Nickelback sang: ""they say that a hero can save us, I'm not going to stand here and wait."" Well, Tina Turner laid the groundwork for that in '85 when she said: ""We don't need another hero."" And she knocked that song out of the park.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

However, in order to get his supplies back he has to make a deal with the ruler of Bartertown known as ""Aunty Entity"" and she wants her main competitor killed. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film started out great. Unfortunately, when the focus shifted from inside Bordertown to the desert, things began to deteriorate. Essentially, what started as a good post-apocalyptic action movie switched to a fantasy presumably made for a younger audience. At least that is my impression and I blame the directors (George Miller and George Ogilvie) for getting a bit too cute and trying to appease a more general audience and thereby forsaking the viewers who made up their base. As a result I have to rate this film as only average.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

It stars Tina Turner as an evil ruler of the town Max drifts into and he is subject to a tremendous combat sequence in an upside down dome where straps suspend himself and his massive opponent. When left in the desert to die he is found by orphans. Directors George Miller and George Ogilvie delivers on exhilarating stunts and action scenes with fantastic futuristic production. Mel Gibson brings a whole new level to Max in his fight for freedom. In Mad Max he was out for revenge. In Road Warrior he served on a mission. Now here he is as good as ever. Turner steals every scene she is in as the ruler and the role is broad and avoids being typical and straight forward. Fine supporting work by Bruce Spence as a thief and pilot who disappears through much of the film yet reappears later. He was much more prominent in the previous films. Helen Buday plays a leader or such who leads these children. Then there is the midget launched on the shoulders of a gladiator called Master Blaster ready for a dome fight. The futuristic theme is lost to excellent production but the film is fun and and goes way beyond Thunderdome and hopefully our expectations. Score: 9 / 10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Max seems sidelined here, and Mel Gibson, though still game, looks disinterested, and who can blame him? Not enough story here to engage the viewer, and so it feels lethargic. A pity.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
21,FlashCallahan,Slightly agitated Max.......,6,4 May 2015,"Robbed of his possessions whilst travelling through the Australian outback, Max manages to stumble upon Bartertown, a trading post for all manner of criminals and governed by Aunt Entity and Master Blaster. He is forced to fight on behalf of Aunt Entity in order that she gain complete control of the town, but he is thrown back out into the desert when the fight is over. He then stumbles upon a group of orphans, the only survivors of a plane crash during the nuclear war and with their help he returns to Bartertown.......So Max finally goes to Hollywood, and he's slightly been lost in translation along the way.It's starts brilliantly though, and sets the film up to be something pretty special. For the first elongated act, we are treated to the barrage of crazy characters we have all grown to know and love in the world of Max, and Tina Turner is a crazy, but brilliant addition as Aunty.The Thunderdome fight is spectacular, if a little similar to Escape From New York, and just after Max gets double crossed, the audience kinds of gets double crossed to.The film then turns into sugar coated territory, Mad Max turns into Peter Pan, and the film turns into a different beast, a lethargic, slow, uninteresting one, and almost ruins the impressive first act.After all the bizarre child bonding, it's back to the, what seems by this time, an obligatory car chase, and it's as impressive as ever.Gibson is as brooding as ever for the majority of the film, and Miller still has a great eye for action, in particular one practical stunt involving a train and a bad guy hanging on the side of it.It's not groundbreaking in any sense, but there is something about the randomness of the film that makes it worth the watch.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
22,Aaron1375,Not as good as the Road Warrior.,6,26 February 2003,"This film is ok, but it is not as good as the above-mentioned flick. Hopefully, when Fury Road comes out, it is more like Warrior and less like Thunderdome.  Thunderdome finds Max having all his stuff stolen by a pilot played by Bruce Spence, just like the second one, but I don't believe they are supposed to be the same character.  Max makes his way to a scummy town called ""Barter Town"".  He meets Tina Turner who does pretty good and they form an alliance to kill this one big guy in Thunderdome...an arena where fights to settle disputes takes place.  There is a fight and Mad Max does in fact go beyond thunderdome, unfortunately the movie gets a bit weak in this section.  Max runs into some kids in an oasis who tell really boring speeches and get facts all messed up.  This goes on for a bit and finally there is more action as some of these kids go to ""Barter Town"" and Max has to get to them first.  Then there is scenes involving a train that aren't as good as the truck battle in Road Warrior, but it is better than listening to those kids tell their stupid stories.  All in all it is an ok film, but nothing great.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Max accepts a deal to take out MasterBlaster, who runs the town's methane production underground, but ends up exiled to the deadly desert where he meets... (watch the movie and see).""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) is the third in George Miller's franchise after ""Mad Max"" (1979) and ""The Road Warrior"" (1981). The fourth installment, ""Fury Road,"" didn't surface until 2015 (meanwhile Miller has announced a fifth entry, ""The Wasteland""). All of these films were rated R except ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" which turns off some devotees. I could care less since the amount of gore, violence, sex and cussing don't determine the quality of a film, except maybe to teenagers.Like the previous two films, ""Beyond Thunderdome"" combines the austere life-or-death situation with a cartoonish vibe, so it's difficult to take it too seriously, as can be done with the first two Planet of the Apes flicks (1968 & 1971). This campy air always turned me off to these movies, but if you can accept it they can be enjoyed on their level of semi-believable fantasy. You just have to be willing to enter into their weird world.Most fans object to the kids in the desert angle, but this section only lasts 25 freakin' minutes before tying back into what took place in the first act. Besides, Savannah (Helen Buday) is cute and has nice legs. The departure from a paradisal oasis in exchange for Bartertown seems nonsensical, but it's figurative of leaving the utopia of youth to the ugly real world and challenges thereof.The verbiage is odd, basic and guttural so don't look for fascinating dialogues. Meanwhile the storytelling isn't very compelling. Nevertheless, the movie's iconic to the 80s and has its points of interest, like its all-around bizarreness, the desolate landscapes, the laconic hero and cutie Savannah, not to mention Turner and her songs (""We Don't Need Another Hero"").The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in Australia.GRADE: B-",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
24,zetes,I can't believe how low the imdb rating is on this film!,8,23 May 2000,"Sure it's probably the least good of the Mad Max films, but it is still entertaining as heck! It is maybe a little more Hollywood (which is a bad thing) than the first two. The music is overbearing at times, and some of the attempts at jokes were very cheap and American blockbusterish.
One of the main faults that has to be sited with this one is that the last thirty minutes or so are basically taken straight from The Road  Warrior. The car chase and then the speech about how a stranger helped them establish a new society were taken right out of the 2nd installment.It still is very creative, and the action has a wonderful momentum. I love the whole society that finds Max in the desert. I loved the recitation of their foundation, and I loved their dialect. I loved Masterblaster. And Tina Turner was actually cool, too. 8/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

However, this is just a story about Mad Max going into a desert and giving children of the desert a new life with happiness. This particular film was a big disappointment to me and I could have found a better way of spending my time than looking at a film that failed to live up to other Mad Max films. I am sure there was plenty of money spent in making this film, but it certainly does not measure up to the other Mel Gibson films. Love all kinds of films but this particular film was nothing I expected and I am glad it was produced and can be forgotten completely about.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
27,JamesHitchcock,Visually and Verbally Inventive,6,13 November 2009,"It has become a commonplace of film criticism that sequels are never as good as the original films and that, the more sequels a film spawns, the worse they become. There are, of course, exceptions to this sweeping statement, and I have always felt that the ""Mad Max"" franchise is one of them, the original ""Mad Max"" being in my view the weakest instalment in the trilogy and the third episode, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", the strongest. (There were, apparently, plans to make a fourth episode, turning the trilogy into a tetralogy, but these came to nothing).Like the second instalment, ""Beyond Thunderdome"" is set in a post-apocalyptic Australian desert. (The first episode was filmed in an agricultural region of Victoria and made no mention of a nuclear apocalypse). Max stumbles upon the nearest thing to civilisation surviving in this wilderness, the dystopian community of Bartertown. As its name suggests, Bartertown is a specifically capitalist dystopia. The town exists principally for trade, and its most sacred rule is that no contract can be broken, for any reason. Those who evade their contractual obligations are subject to severe punishment. (""Bust a deal, face the wheel."") Disputes are settled by fights to the death in an arena known as the ""Thunderdome"" (hence the title of the film).Bartertown is ruled by a ruthless female dictator named Aunty Entity, but her leadership is being challenged by ""Master"", the diminutive but highly intelligent technician who runs the city's sole power supply, a methane refinery, fuelled by pig dung. (Exactly how a barren desert manages to produce enough food to feed so many pigs is never explained, but this was clearly not intended to be a realistic film. The idea of an economy based upon faeces was presumably intended to be a satirical comment on capitalism). Max gets caught up in Auntie's political machinations against Master, and ends up being exiled from the city when he reneges upon a deal to kill Blaster, Master's powerfully-built but simple-minded bodyguard, whom he has defeated in a Thunderdome duel.Wandering through the empty desert, Max comes across a tribal community of children, the survivors of a plane crash, living in an oasis. They believe him to be ""Captain Walker"", the pilot of the downed airliner, who has come to return them to civilisation, or ""Tomorrow-morrow Land"" as they call it. (This part of the film clearly shows the influence both of William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"" and of Barrie's Peter Pan, with its ""Lost Boys"" and ""Never Never Land"".) The rest of the film chronicles Max's adventures with the children and his return to Bartertown.In 1978, when the first ""Mad Max"" film came out, Mel Gibson was a virtually unknown Australian actor; by 1985 he had become internationally known, having appeared in British and American movies like ""The Bounty"" and ""Mrs Soffel"". He was also a better actor in 1985 than he had been in 1978, although perhaps not quite as good as he was to become in the nineties in films like ""Hamlet"" and ""The Man without a Face"". Tina Turner makes a splendidly sexy villainess as Auntie, in a performance which made me wonder why her ventures into acting have been so few. (I also wondered if the name ""Captain Walker"" was borrowed from another film in which she appeared, ""Tommy"").What makes the film better than its predecessors, however, is not so much its standards of acting as the fact that it possesses something which is vital to fantasy films but in which they (especially the first instalment) were deficient, namely imagination. This imagination is both visual and verbal. The film's visual imagination is shown in the early scenes, set in the creaking, ramshackle dystopia of Bartertown. Its verbal imagination is shown in the second part of the film, while Max is living among the children. The children have developed their own quasi-religious set of beliefs, centred upon the legend of Captain Walker and Tomorrow-morrow Land, and recite their mythologies in ceremonies known as ""tells"". The language used for this purpose is not correct standard English- it contains plenty of what we would consider errors of grammar or vocabulary- yet it has a strangely formal, ritualistic, incantatory quality.""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is not a great film; the two halves do not hang together particularly well, and there are a number of plot holes and illogicalities. Nevertheless, its imaginative style of story-telling make it a watchable example of post-apocalyptic film-making, comparable to something like ""The Omega Man"". 6/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

29,StevePulaski,A path better left unexplored,4,16 May 2015,"The third film in a series can make or break it. There's a wave of ""wow, we got this far?"" on part of the filmmakers and a wave of the ""I can't believe they're making another one"" on the audience, and, understandably, filmmakers and studios try to see if they can take the series in a different direction once making it a trilogy. The problem is that, with this change, while certain admiration comes into play for risk, the change in direction can often squander or lessen what was already built from the previous films and solidify the decision for moviegoers not to seek out any more films from that franchise. It happened with the Child's Play franchise and the Halloween franchise, and unfortunately, it had to happen with Mad Max.The series, in my eyes, was never an amazing one, but had certain appeal. The first film took the bare basics of action filmmaking and predicated a frightening, if somewhat slight, dystopian story on the large canvas of a desert. Its sequel, however, kicked itself into high gear, formally asserting Mel Gibson's titular character as an action hero. The third film, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, takes a Return of the Jedi-style approach to the sequel, softening it a bit, decorating it in costumes, trying something completely different, and ultimately, leaving divided reactions in its rear-view.What was once a series about suspense and disorder in the middle of nowhere has descended into a film that takes the formula of an epic or a classic warrior tale with little effect. Beyond Thunderdome morphs into a film of silly costumes and scenery-chewing fluff rather than capitalizing off of what made the franchise so unique and, often times, quite mesmerizing.Gibson returns in the titular role, this time exiled into the desert by Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), the ruler of Bartertown. While wandering through the desert, again, trying to remain alive and alert in a sea of chaos and disorder, Max stumbles upon the crashsite of a Boeing 747. The people inside the airplane are members of a Melanesian Cargo cult, many of whom children who act in primal behaviors. After protecting the villagers in the previous film, Max confronts himself in order to try and maintain order amongst the people and protect them, specifically the children, from the dangers of the gangs that lurk in the desert.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome feels like a film that managed to escape the control of George Miller. The film feels hijacked by greater Hollywood forces, who, in turn, minimized the violence, turned down darker themes, and created a film much more concerned with the portrayal of people than the dangers that lurk in the desert. That would be understandable if the film wasn't burdened by a general sense of disconnect. Little human or character interest can be obtained from these characters, and Max feels as if he has transcended the realm of being an enigma to a completely artificial character, especially when cloaked in ridiculous costumes.At this point, the franchise's different direction, equipped with more light-hearted scenes than the first two films and, for a while, what seems like low stakes suspense, especially in the middle portion of the film, does what I feared it would do and that's take it off course in hopes this particular move would pave the way for greatness. Unfortunately, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome suffers under the weight of its own ambitions and ideas, effectively creating something out of an original property that wasn't there to begin with. I'm sure if you told the Max from the first film he'd end up in the situations he finds himself in in this film, he'd laugh at you.Starring: Mel Gibson and Tina Turner.

30,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Good action, but such a different turn from the other Mad Max films",5,28 January 2008,"A few weeks ago, I picked up the Mad Max 2 and Mad Max 3 combo for ten bucks, I figured since I was a fan of Mel Gibson, why not see the movies that put him on the map? So when I saw the first Mad Max, I was really impressed, what they had to work with, they created a good low budget action film. Mad Max 2 had nothing but awesome action sequences and a cool rebel that was charismatic, strong, handsome, and just so awesome that could always be known to us as Mad Max. Now we have Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, I have to say while the action sequences are pretty good, I know why not too many enjoy this sequel, it definitely took a strange turn from the series. But it was still kind of an interesting story, with Tina Turner, that was a strange role for her to take on.Mad Max has changed a little bit since his day as the hero, he comes to a land where all his possessions have been taken away from him. He is forced to join a group where they beat each other to the death in the Thunderdome. But when Mad Max doesn't like the rules and refuses to follow them, he's in big trouble. He makes a run for it, but the gang is now after him and will make sure that he pays for this love for humanity. He is pushed into the desert where he encounters these children, he promises to take them to a land that they were heading for called Tomorrow Morrow Land, clever title, huh? But together they head to the world that seems better without being caught by Aunt Entity.Mad Max Thunderdome is over all entertaining, I wouldn't say that this is a bad film. I think just compared to the other two Mad Max films, this seemed a bit flawed. It was a little bit of a different story to take on, but the one thing that is for sure, is any action lover will be satisfied. Tina Turner was actually pretty decent as Aunt Entity, it was very strange to see her take on the role, especially with those earrings she had to wear, lol. But Mel Gibson and she both were cool to watch, I would recommend this if you are a fan of the original Mad Max films, just to complete the series.5/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

""Beyond Thunderdome"" is cheesy to begin with (I mean, Tina Turner as a villain of the wastelands? C'mon!) and adding a group of Peter Pan-styled ""lost boys"" into the film is the icing on the cake.Essentially what starts out as a decent film (Max having his belongings stolen, ending up at the Thunderdome, playing gladiator with some thugs in the arena) quickly descends into mediocrity.I would like the cast to reunite for a hard-core R-rated final installment, if only to erase the bad aftertaste of this very disappointing close to the trilogy.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

33,disdressed12,does nothing to improve on the two previous installments,5,26 April 2008,"i think this a case of the Mad Max series losing steam.the first movie,simply entitled Mad Max,was exciting from start to finish.the second,Entitled Mad Max 2:the Warrior had less but more intense action sequences and a better story.it also developed the character of Max(Mel Gibson).however,this third installment does nothing to set itself apart,in terms of anything new,from the first 2.it's really just old hat,just not done as well as the previous installments,particularly number 2.i was quite frankly bore through out,just waiting for it to finally end.Tina Turner is in the movie,but unfortunately she has little screen time.i don't think this was a poorly made movie,just a boring one.my vote for Mad Max Max Beyond Thunderdome is a 5/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
34,KineticSeoul,Lame third installment,3,18 August 2014,"This third installment is the worst one compared to the previous 2 installments. Not saying the previous 2 installments are bad, but this one is just appalling and campy. The whole direction becomes silly and mundane to the max. I don't know what happened after the previous two movies, but now Max is in some sort of steam punk game show of some sort in a dystopian steam punk like society. And the games are just so darn cheesy to watch and loses it's mark when it comes to innovations to drive this story. The beginning parts makes it seem like I was in for one heck of a ride but as the movie progresses it becomes dumb and dumber. This is just plain out a lame 3rd installment that just doesn't stand out compared to the previous installments and becomes forgettable.3.9/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Rollin' on the river, that's where she'd be. But she's beyond Thunderdome, because she decided to send a message"" - Jim Carrey, Liar Liar.Much like Breakin' 2's subtitle, ""Electric Boogaloo"" was immortalized by MST3k nerds, like myself, Tina Turner's turn in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was made famous in Jim Carrey's side-splitting speech to Jennifer Tilly in Liar, Liar.I would be wrong to say that quote is the only good part of her performance, because, quite frankly, she was a lot of fun in Beyond Thunderdome. Not to mention (lightly), one of cinema's best songs of all time: We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome) by Tina, herself. Sorry, Mel, in more ways than ten, she stole your franchise.It's obvious with each installment, the budget increases, the sandy desert more apparent and the lack of Max being ""mad"" is irritatingly maddening. In fact, maybe I'm missing the boat, but after three features I just viewed for the first time apiece, I'm still puzzled why he's called that. Perhaps a more suitable nickname would be ""Solo Sam"" or ""Loner Lane.""At any rate, again, Max faces the rough conditions alone in the desert following multiple events following the death of his wife and child in a semi-destructive future two chapters prior. The simple fact that this key element to Max's, ah-hem, drive hasn't resurfaced since their passing is beyond me. I'm shocked they even brought up that he was an ex-cop in this one as his tidbit of a background.Subsequent to a robbery, Max finds Bartertown and is thrown into a dispute between two ""leaders"" of the barren outpost and must fight a brute to gain his belongings back in the deathly ""Thunderdome"" fighting cage. Following an unexpected turn, Max is outcast and picked up by Ewoks disguised as children who believe him to be ""the one"" to lead them to the same driving getaway climax as expected in the Mad Max universe.The film's watchable and a lot more mature from the first MM feature, though a step down from The Road Warrior. It is shaky and probably unnecessary aside from a few key and interesting scenes – mostly in the grand finale, BUT, again should be noted for Tina's fun role and Tina's fantastic (and should've been nominated) song.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

37,lost-in-limbo,"""This nobody had the chance to be a somebody"".",6,7 August 2011,"A couple years after ""Mad Max 2"", film-maker George Miller would return to the Mad Max franchise with the fashionable ""Thunderdome"". No way did it come close to the previous entries, as it totally felt different in tone (feeling more like mythological adventure epic) and slightly favoured a more comedic route. Although it was bigger and showier, it didn't have that forlorn and gusty post-apocalyptic edge (as it felt a childish and safe) and its car chase sequences / stunt-work (which is the epitome of Mad Max) didn't show up until the last twenty minutes. Even then it wasn't anything memorable. Enjoyably speedy chaos, but well-worn. It doesn't entirely repeat the formula, but that's what you're waiting for. Still we get a creative sequence of caged hand-to-hand combat that involved bungee ropes and weapons. Midway through it does kind of lose its way, getting bogged down with its focus on a tribe of children which had that lost children vibe. Interest arose more so when it centred on Aunty Entity and her Dystopia. And hey great to see other than gladiator spectacles, wheel of fortune is still around in a post-futuristic wasteland. The photography had scope in capturing its scenically exquisite desert backdrop, but it was a smoother looking presentation with some striking visual decors. The performances were modest. Mel Gibson's returns, where his drifter character traditionally opens up making him more humane. Tina Turner is credibly good as the devious Aunty Entity who looks over the city Bartertown. Bruce Spence reprises his rousing role, character actor Frank Thring shows up and Angry Anderson is a delight in costume and attitude as one of Entity's right-hand men. A playful sequel.""Two men enter. One man leaves"".",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
38,ElMaruecan82,To the Thunderdome... and Beyond!,9,29 August 2019,"""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" goes beyond your expectations of a movie sequel, it's a standalone classic, an adventure movie that could have been as enjoyable and admirable had it been the first or the only film of the legendary franchise from director George Miller.Well, it's not, it came three years after ""Road Warrior"", which was already a fine departure from the bleak and nihilistic tone of ""Mad Max"" (which suited its minimalist budget). The first film, becoming the most profitable movie of all time, met with universal success, allowing the second to challenge the odds and be an exciting action picture, but what ""Thunderdome"" accomplishes is a miracle, this is a film where any viewer would expect spectacular chases, fight scenes and action set within communities of people with bizarre neo-punk fashion and a ruthless larger-than-life villain and while these elements are present, they all take you off-guard.A bit of contextualization, the film is set at a time where oil has become more than a luxury and in every part of the Australian wasteland, micro-societies are being built to ensure minimal chances of living. There's no money, not much oil and people trade for food and water and insurance for survival. In this definite setting, we meet Max, with longer and greyer hair in a remote city named Bartertown, a sort of advanced society in that post-Apocalyptic Australia where a sort of equilibrium reigns under the firm authority of Auntie Entity (Tina Turner) and where the energy is supplied by the Master Blaster, a composite of two persons, a little man for the brain (Angelo Rossitto, he was the ""loving cup"" dwarf in ""Freaks"") and the muscle is Blaster, a giant who terrorizes the workers. Those workers handle the main supply of energy, which is the waste coming from pigs and turned into into methane. When a whole ecosystem depends on pig feces, you know humanity reached quite a low.Except that the system works and makes sense, people have work, they can trade, eat and drink and like in the Roman society, they have their coliseum, a dome that reinvented the art of fighting, where the two opponents are attached to elastic ropes and can move backward, forward and up and down and can grab any weapon from a stick to a chainsaw, and the spectators are all hanging on that very dome, chanting the battle slogan ""two men enter, one man leave"". And this is how we get one of the most original fight ever put on screen, ""Road Warrior"" had the chase, ""Thunderdome"" has the duel between Max and Blaster. So many action pictures take the fighting for granted and doesn't dare to reinvent the wheel, this one does and the fight not only surpasses our imagination but even manages to end with that little twist that makes Mad Max more than a bad-ass fighter, but a hero. What happens at the end is something in the vein of the fight in ""Spartacus"", since we were speaking of the Romans.The dome is just halfway through the movie and there's more to come when Max is exiled in the desert that would have made Lawrence of Arabia go back to his native England, a desert where the sun and the quicksand leaves no chance to anyone crossing it and makes Bartertown a real-life Valhalla in comparison. But Max is rescued by a group of kids who formed a new society, as if Bartertown wasn't spectacular enough. The survivors of the crash formed a sort of Nevrland group waiting for their prophet ""Walker"" to make their plane fly again, they see Max as Walker the one who'll fly them back to ""Tomorrow-morrow"", another promised land. Obviously, the plot borrows some elements from ""Road Warrior"" but we still get many surprises including another heart-pounding chase scene between cars and a train served carrying a load of methane and a little house, I can't describe how effective and thrilling the stunts in the chase are.And as it wasn't enough, it all leads up to the final duel between a plane and cars, where the same game of who's going to jump first plays like the common denominator between the three movies. And beyond the ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" aspect, the real winning moment of the film isn't the one you expect and I daren't to spoil it. If Ml Gibson is terrific as a more human and talkative version of Max, Tina Turner has literally stolen the thunder... dome. Indeed, I always figured that the little weaknesses in ""Mad Max"" were the villains, too one-dimensional and vicious for the sake of it, whereas Aunty is a totally competent leader who knows she can't rule a new order in a post-apocalyptic world by being nice. Even Master Blaster who starts as a villain reveals more depths as the film progresses, so if Max was an anti-hero, they're obviously anti-villains, and it's quite ironic that the film is renowned for its Award-baity song ""We don't ned another hero"", a line taken from the first hero, while the real motto is that ""we don't need another villain"" and Miller understood it.Yes, there comes a time where survival is so fragile that no one benefits from sheer evilness and there comes a time where engaging in merciless fights become futile and pointless, so when a film is humbled by that level of self-recognition, it respects the audience's intelligence and provides something that challenges all expectations. The film is a mature version of ""Road Warrior"" and the most accomplished version of the trilogy, adventure-wise. And it's certainly one of the best action pictures of the 80s, to the Thunderdome...and beyond!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

40,lesleyharris30,"Failed to Grip me,",4,10 October 2017,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a mediocre movie with a lackluster plot and an average cast. It has its moments, there are certainly some beautiful set pieces and, as you would expect, some glorious high octane action sequences that still hold up today. George Miller's work as a director is one I always admire, even if his work as a writer fails to grab me.It was a lot more character driven and grounded than the previous two installments, which sound like a good thing, but the way it is done is immensely bland. I found it very difficult to care for these characters, they are not likable enough for me to gain any sort of affection for them. The cast do not do a stellar job in helping this movie either. Mel Gibson still shines as Max, but his heart simply is not in it as much the third time around. Tina Turner, on the other hand, is absolutely horrendous, failing to do anything interesting with a juicy role like this, having no screen charisma, there is a reason why this is her only big acting role. Has potential, but lets you down. Some people may love it, but Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome simply was not for me, and I would not recommend it. Max teams up with some new allies to fight for his survival in this post apocalyptic world. Best Performance: Mel Gibson / Worst Performance: Tina Turner",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

I am a huge fan of the 1st 2, and found them to be very exciting, however this one is just plain dull, with uninteresting characters, and a dumb story. The setting was certainly cool, and it had one exciting duel at the start, and a great chase scene at the end, however, the children got on my nerves, and Mel Gibson seemed bored at times, plus the ending was kind of lame!. The action is pretty dull, and the character of Max, has sort of changed, he has too much dialog, and i found him very uninteresting, plus, Tina Turner never took advantage of her potential, she had a cool character but didn't do anything with it. The villains are not menacing at all, and the plot isn't that interesting, plus It's sort of a disgrace to the brilliant 1st 2. This is a rather dull 3rd installment, it tried to go in a completely new direction,and it simply just did not work, worth the watch i guess, however it's not really worth it, so don't go out of your way to look for it, stick with the 1st 2. The Direction is mediocre. George Miller/George Ogilvie do a mediocre job here, with some good camera work, however it feels bland, and the pace is terribly inconsistent!. The Acting is decent i guess. Mel Gibson is not his usual amazing self, he seems bored, and sleep walks through the whole thing, there are a couple moments where he seems interested but overall, he just wasn't himself and i don't blame him. Gibson still rules though!!. Tina Turner is sexy, but her character never took advantage of her potential, and was also dull to boot. Bruce Spence is funny as the pilot and remained one of the cooler characters here i liked him lots. Frank Thring and Angelo Rossitto both do okay and did what they had to do adequately. Rest of the cast do okay. Overall worth the watch i guess, but don't unless you have nothing better to do. ** out of 5",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
43,Bored_Dragon,"""You can shovel crap, can't you?""",8,17 April 2019,"The scenario for ""Beyond Thunderdome"" was originally a post-apocalyptic adaptation of ""Lord of the Flies,"" subsequently modified and converted into the third part of the ""Mad Max"" franchise. The budget jumped from two to ten million dollars, and Gibson is no longer the only big name, because he's now sharing a movie with fantastic Tina Turner. In addition to the role of the main ""villain"", Tina is also credited with the song ""We Don't Need Another Hero"", which entered the legend and to this day has remained one of her greatest hits and one of the biggest hits of film music in general. The word ""villain"" I put in quotes because this time the story is far more complex than in the previous films and deviates from the black-and-white pattern of the good against evil, representing us a post-apocalyptic future in the shades of gray. The characters are numerous, diverse and quite realistic, so who's the good guy and who's the bad depends on from whose perspective we chose to look at the story. For me, this is one of the strongest trumps of the movie, and with the visual spectacle and good music, it earned the movie a strong eight.8/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
44,The-Sarkologist,This movie does have a classic cinematic moment,7,23 December 2012,"The thing that I have noticed about the Mad Max movies is that while the first one finished with a chase between a car and a bunch of motor bikes, the vehicles in the next two became ever more exotic, to the point that in number three they are just down right strange. Look, a lot of people seemed not to have liked this particular movie, but this was actually the first Mad Max that I had seen, and it is also the first that was actually a big budget version.It has been fifteen years since the previous movie and Max is still a loner, but this time he is without a car, most likely because petrol is simply impossible to get. After being ambushed by a guy in a plane (who is identifical to the guy in the plane from the second movie) he is left to wonder the desert on foot, but the guy in the plane is not that smart, because Max is able to follow the tracks to Bartertown, where is gets into fights, thrown into an arena known as the Thunderdome, and then is sent back out into the desert where he is rescued by a group of children who are waiting for the return of Captain Walker, a messiah like figure from the past.Where the first movie was set at the brink of social collapse, and the second one after the said collapse, Mad Max Three has come full circle to the point where society is beginning to bring itself back together. Gone are the roving gangs, as they have now formed colonies that are governed by laws, even if they are the law of a dictator. Even more so we have groups within the colonies fighting for control.Like in the second movie, there is also the colonies of innocents, but this colony is sheltered from the rest of the world, living in an oasis hidden in the desert. They have food and they have water, but what they also have are stories that have been passed down for them to remember. They have not become savages as is suggested in Lord of the Flies, rather the stories have given them not only a semblance of civilisation, but also hope in a future. In a way it is a contrast between the society of Barter town, where law may be brute force, but it is still law, and that of the oasis, which is in essence the land of a noble savage.The problem with this film is that there does not seem to be much of a direction and there is even less of a plot. Some have said that the first part of the film is really good, but it seems like once Max returns to Bartertown the director and writer simply ran out of ideas and decided to rehash Mad Max 2 (and I must admit that the chases in both movies are very similar, it is just that the third one had a bigger budget to play with). Even then, the fact that a perfectly perserved railway literally appears out of nowhere also completely baffles me. However, if there is one thing I can say about this movie, it is that it has a classic cinema moment, namely after Angry Anderson's character dies, we see his hand hanging out of the wreckage, the hand shudder, and in a final act of defiance, flips the birdy. However, having Auntie (Tina Turner), after chasing them across the desert, salute him, and say goodbye warrior, seems a little odd (but that is probably because she had been defeated in that the little man, Master, had escaped).",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
45,slightlymad22,"A Watered Down Mad Max, But Still Fun",7,24 January 2015,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Mel Gibson's filmography in order, I come to his final outing as Mad Max in 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Plot In A Paragraph: Max is back, and his situation had not much improved since ""Road Warrior"" Max has his car and supplies stolen and follows them to Bartertown a city on the edge of a desert that has managed to retain some technology thanks to pig manure. A mulleted Gibson gives his flashiest performance of Max, and whilst the action is still fantastic, this is certainly a much watered down Mad Max movie, compared to the previous two entries. Tina Turner looks great, and does a fine job acting wise, however she is not in it as much as I'd hoped, and the children appear to be just 'the lost boys' lifted straight out of Peter Pan.I'm undecided if this or ""Road Warrior"" is my favourite Mad Max movie. This one certainly divides fans, as some rate it the best, and others the worst. It's certainly uneven, but I think that's down to having two directors. After a friend died in a helicopter crash, Miller only directed the action and left the rest to his co director George Ogilvile. No doubt helped by Tina Turners hit single 'We Don't Need Another Hero, the more family friendly Mad Max was a hit with audiences as Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome grossed $36 million at the domestic Box Office to become the 24th highest grossing movie of 1985. Grossing more than favourites Commando, Weird Science and Teen Wolf. Both were personal bests for Gibson, who was on his way to the A List.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
46,sol-,Above and Beyond,6,27 May 2017,"Often cited as the weakest entry in the 'Mad Max' franchise, 'Thunderdome' is a surprisingly decent post-apocalyptic tale. The negative reputation is understandable with the film lacking the extreme violence and kooky supporting characters that made the first two movies such big hits. The basic plot is enthralling though -- even if it does not really take off until 45 minutes in -- with Max found unconscious by a group of children living by their wits in the desert. The kids mistake him for a missing pilot who they consider a savior, and while initially reluctant to play hero, Max nevertheless finds some of his lost humanity from the first two films and eventually helps them out. None of the kids are especially interesting, but their lifestyle is endlessly intriguing, full of madcap philosophies and mythologies as a result of them being stranded for as long as any of them can remember; old photos evoke memories of a pre-apocalyptic world that they dream of, but they really are lost - a first generation of the post-apocalyptic landscape. Add in sets and costumes as creative as ever, and it is hard to see this as a significantly lesser film than the first two. It is just very different. Sure, the first, second and third acts here feel a tad disjointed, but there is lots to like in all three sections including the title location. And Tina Turner's theme song is simply divine.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

48,tomgillespie2002,The weakest of the original trilogy but still entertaining stuff,6,1 September 2015,"From the opening shot of wandering nomad and mulleted anti-hero Max Rockantansky (Mel Gibson), travelling along the endless Australian plains in a makeshift vehicle put together from spare auto-parts and whatever junk he came across on the road and pulled along by camels, we know that the world George Miller created back in 1979 has descended even further into apocalyptic turmoil, and we are now even further from civilised society than ever before. Max has his vehicle and supplies stolen by Jebediah the Pilot (Bruce Spence), so he is forced to wander barefoot through the desert until he comes across a community dubbed Bartertown, a place where you can trade anything or anyone.Like the vehicles in the world of Mad Max, Bartertown is hammered together from spare parts. It is ruled by Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), who is locked in a constant power-struggle with Master Blaster, a grotesque tag-team who overlooks the pits below the town where pigs are farmed and harvested for methane gas. Master is a dwarf played by Angelo Rossitto who rides on the back of Blaster, a giant of a man who wears a huge concealing helmet, and is played by Paul Larsson. Master Blaster may be George Miller's most interesting creation, and as Max inevitably faces Blaster is the arena known as the Thunderdome - where all quarrels are concluded as two men enter but only one leaves - one of the most inventive scraps in cinema history plays out, as they bounce at each other on huge elastic bands and hack at each other with all manners of weapons.Yet that is only half of the film. Miller resigned himself to just directing the action scenes following the tragic death of his friend and location scout Byron Kennedy, so the rest of the film was put in the hands of George Ogilvie. Narrowly escaping Bartertown with his life, Max discovers the young survivors of a plane crash who has developed their own little tribal society, and it's here that the film goes a bit Peter Pan. Whether this was down to Miller's absence or not - Beyond Thunderdome lacks the edge of its predecessors, occasionally dipping into traditional mainstream fantasy fare and losing focus of its antagonists motivation. Still, the film delivers where expected - the action scenes. Again we get a tanker being chased down by an army of baddies in doomsday vehicle's, and again we are treated to some awe-inspiring stunts that hold up even today. It's the weakest of the original trilogy but hugely entertaining stuff.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
49,Dr_Coulardeau,No future without a spiritual savior,10,13 August 2007,"The motor vehicles are going to be there, even a plane. The desert is going to be there too. But the whole world has regressed for a reason we don't know  but do we care?  losing all its technology and its energy. But Mel Gibson takes the orientation that humanity will not regress in inventiveness nor even in intelligence, which means it will reinvent some kind of civilization by developing new sources of energy, this time the energy that can be produced by pig slime, the gas that comes out of it that can be used in plenty of machines and for might. Thus they reinvent a civilization based on pig slime (and that is a Pauline element that must not be neglected: it is neither Jewish, nor Moslem) as the source of energy of their society. That's the positive point. But there is another side that is less positive. The necessity to establish some protective body and some protection against the outside world and outsiders that may try to intrude, some captured power and established their absolute authority over the others in a society that cannot afford the luxury of democracy, just some kind of rules that are not really written but chanted at any crucial moment like a performative prayer. Hence they reinvent feudalism for most people and slavery for some. They reinvent circus games to entertain the masses and control human emotions and passions. Gladiators reappear as such public performances: two men go in and one leaves, provided he kills the other one before. If he does not then he breaks the deal and has to face the wheel that can give him any kind of violent end, death by what ever torture you may imagine, the best choice (at least you survive some time without any direct physical torture and maiming) being the Gulag: to be sent in the heart of the desert and die there, at best of thirst. But Mel Gibson is already taken by the divine devil of some religious vision more or less inspired by the Bible. So the whole story is told by the survivors a certain hero-messiah-savior has helped escape this hell in order to move back to the derelict and ruinous cities of the old days. And this salvation is in fact a union of him, Mad Max, with these outcasts in order to re-enter Bartertown, the city of the dominant society that lives on pig energy. There they are able to recapture some vehicles to escape this world, at first a ""train"" that runs on rails, and, at the end of the tracks, a plane that was waiting for some opportunity to serve, with its pilot and a kid enjoying their permanent idleness. A rainbow alliance of all against this tyrannical society of Bartertown. And they manage to escape except Mad Max who has to sacrifice his own life to enable the others to fly away. And he will be left there in the middle of the desert to die of thirst probably. But what can we say about this vision of the future after the final catastrophe that will bring humanity back to antiquity? First the tyrannical society is led by a woman, mind you black, and she is a more violent and exacting leader than any fascist leader you can have met in history textbooks. Women, and black women at that, are not representing a soft and comfortable future. But maybe only black women will be able to govern the people to survive these dire straits? That's an idea. Especially since the one who is telling the story of Mad Max the Savior is a woman too, though white. Maybe after all women have to become central because of their role in procreation, and surviving in difficult circumstances is not a question of sex, or sex does not make the slightest difference, and yet the gladiators are men (listen to the chant) and the savior is a man. Is there some sexism and a touch of racism in Mel Gibson's vision? What's important after all is to be able to impose the discipline necessary to survive as a group with some indispensable hierarchy. Humanity will not regress to any inferior level of intelligence, as H.G. Wells had thought for example in The Time Machine. What will regress is the social order, the mode of production. No more supermarkets for humanity but only bartering. No more democracy but feudalism. No more free labor market but slavery and serfdom for most. No more virtual games and entertainments but real gladiators games and fights to the death. And no escape from this hell on earth but thanks to a savior that will lead the outcasts of this society to a migration back to the old cities and skyscrapers of the past where they will have to reinvent what is indispensable for humanity to become better, a religion based on a human savior who is also divine since he was the savior and died in his self-imposed mission. We can smile at the naivety of the idea, but it is inescapable and true that there cannot be any real humane civilization without a spiritual ideology or attitude, and that is called a religion or a philosophy, and these civilizing factors are based on the personality of one person, a savior in the Christian tradition, a prophet in the Jewish or Moslem tradition, or a founder in the Buddhist tradition. And it does not matter whether it is a myth or whether the action of the man has been distorted to stick to some kind of rite. What is important is that such a figure is the inspirer of humanism and human life. Humanity cannot be human without a religion of some spiritual belief.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Instead we have some good scenes in Barter Town with Tina Turner, but then the movie goes south a bit with the children looking for Captain Walker? And their silly talk (which they make fun of in Rick and Morty see the episode list).They throw in another race scene just to be the same as the previous two movies, even reusing some of the vehicles. The scene isn't as good as the other scenes. It's OK, but not really the same quality. In this race, they even use some of the same costumes from the second movie.The movie isn't terrible, it isn't great. It was really big back in the 80's because Tina Turner was an unstoppable force. She was huge with ""We Don't Need Another Hero"". She did a good job in this movie and I thought it showed her ability to be more than a great singer.It's strange that the opening song got nearly no air play. It was the closing song which hit it big with the public.It is a good movie with a sub par script. The actors are good. The action is good. There is a bit of a twist at the end.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

55,Captain_Couth,"""Mad"" Max + P.G.-13 = Tame and lame movie.",5,4 June 2004,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) was a travesty.  Even though it takes place in an even bleaker future, the filmmakers decided to line their pockets even further by making this one ""family friendly (i.e. P.G.-13). What made the other films gritty and nihilistic is missing from this film. Only a few spots but other than that it's just other one of those sequels that morphed into a more mainstream movie (i.e Robocop 3).  Needless to say I was very disappointed because when I was much younger I was a huge Mad Max mark.The story takes place years after the events that transpired in part two. Max is content with his life out in the wastelands. But one day, the fates would appear.  Someone has robbed him of his caravan and his old souped up vehicle (sadly no longer in running condition). When he recovers he finds that all roads lead to one of the last vestiges of civilization, an arm pit called ""Bartertown"".  Whilst in ""Bartertown"" Max finds the person who cold cocked him but his unable to do anything about it.  So, after a brief scuffle with the local authorities Max is taken to meet the ""mayor"" of ""Bartertown"" Aunt Enity (Tina Turner).  After a brief display of his talents, Enity and Max strike a deal....Like the other films, the world of Pro Wrestling has taken several themes and characters from this movie (i.e. The Thunderdome and The Master Blasters, etc..).  Many knock-offs and wannabes have spawn off of this one as well.  It even started up a sub-genre, children living in a post-apocalyptic society films.  Not a bad film but die-hards of the first two will be disappointed.C+",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
56,freemantle_uk,The weakest of the trilogy,5,16 February 2009,"Mad Max: good. Max Mad 2: the Road Warrior: very good. Max Mad Beyond Thunderdome: poor. Why does it when film series get to their third film that it tends to be a weak effort, from Batman Forever, Alien 3, Dead of the Dead, Superman III, X-Men 3, etc? Max Mad Beyond Thunderdome is no exception.The story of the film starts when Max (now looking like William Wallace from Braveheart (most overrated film ever)), has all his belonging stolen by a plane pilot (Bruce Spence). Mad ends up going to Barbertown, a small settlement that attempts civilisation. It is in the middle between Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), the leader of the town and the Master Blaster (Angelo Rossitto and Paul Larsson) who runs the power supply. Max agrees to help Aunty Entity in exchange for the return of his belongings and ends up challenging the Blaster in the Thunderdome (a gladiatorial style battle). However, when Max refuses to kill the Blaster he is forced out the town and ends up in the desert. But Max is found by a tribe of children who live in an Oasis and have created their own myths about civilisation. Max sets up to help when some of the children try to go off to Barbertown.Between the time of Mad Max 2 and 3, the producer Byron Kennedy died and George Miller was starting to lose interest. George Miller does write for the film but only directs the actions scenes, George Ogilvie takes over for the rest of the film. Whilst Mad Max and Mad Max 2 had a camp factor to it, it never over took the story. However, in this film it is overplayed, especially in Barbertown and with characters like Aunty Entity and the Master Blaster. The acting isn't good either. Mel Gibson was okay, but seem tired with the role, and other actors like Tina Turner and Angelo Rossitto was poor. As well, even the action scenes were not as good as in Mad Max 2. Roger Ebert thought that the fight between Max and the Blaster was the most original fight scene since the start of the material arts films; I personally thought it was a poor scene. As well the final chase scene wasn't as good as in the previous films. There were interesting ideas, like people trying to rebuild civilisation and start up trying to make technology work again, and the ideas of the children's fading memories and creating their own mythology, but even that isn't used to its full potential.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was a missed opportunity.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

She is GREAT!!!! She IS this movie. And what about the Master-Blaster? Two guys who become one, and try to impose their control over what is a microcosm of modern society. The analogy is obvious and well-stated. Yet this is a movie with few words, but when spoken, they resonate with meaning. For Mad-Max is a pawn in a power-struggle, the resolution of which I will not reveal.

58,drqshadow-reviews,"Mel Hits the Road, One More Time, to Finish His Wasteland Trilogy",6,17 June 2020,"Mel Gibson climbs back into the black leather pants for a third run-around as George Miller's dusty, dystopian desert-goer, in what would be his curtain call with the franchise. Something of a paradox, Beyond Thunderdome is both a different beast from the other Max movies and, at the same time, cut from the same cloth.The budget has certainly ballooned, lending a mainstream sheen to the formerly scrappy, seat-of-pants production. That influx of cash goes a long way, enabling Miller's vision to blossom into a genuine dash of unrestrained wasteland genius (the wardrobe, vehicle and environment designs are way ahead of their time), but the non-action scenes feel far softer and less confident than before. Chalk that up to the extra director, I guess, who kept an eye on the shop while Miller concentrated on getting the adrenaline-driven shots just right. There's still no shortage of inspired, alien weirdness, but it feels less essential, less purposeful. Tina Turner's bejeweled junkyard princess is a good example, talking and acting tough but lacking the conviction and follow-through to really make the role mean anything. Max's mid-act sidetrack to meet an oasis-dwelling troupe of forgotten children is equally hollow, like someone dropped the pilot episode of a spin-off series in the midst of the original film.At least it all comes together for an appropriately white-knuckled sendoff: another epic, high-octane pileup with a colorful fleet of spike-trimmed desert buggies and flame-belching hot rods. I was beginning to wonder what'd become of all the eight-cylinder death machines that were so pervasive in preceding chapters.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
59,estebangonzalez10,The weakest entry in the franchise. A disappointment.,5,15 May 2015,"""Now, when men get to fighting, it happens here! And it finishes here! Two men enter; one man leaves.""Everything I loved about the first Mad Max sequel is what is missing in this third installment, Beyond Thunderdome, which is the weakest entry of the trilogy. I was surprised to discover that this film was so warmly received by critics in 1985 when it came out because I felt like they changed the entire structure of the series and the Max character. Whereas Mel Gibson played Max as a quiet and antisocial character in The Road Warrior, here he seems to enjoy chatting with others and transforms himself into a completely different person. Beyond Thunderdome also lacks some of the spectacular choreographed vehicle chases that the previous films had and which made the franchise such a hit. It isn't until the final 20 minutes of the film that we actually get these spectacular chases and by that time I really didn't care too much for the characters. It's unfortunate because George Miller's vision of this post- apocalyptic world is intelligently designed, but somehow the characters and the story arch take some absurd turns. The film itself seems like it's divided into two separate movies. In the first half we are introduced to Bartertown, a civilization that is being built in the middle of the dessert, and then the second half takes place in the middle of an oasis where a group of young teenagers and children are patiently waiting for a savior to lead them home. These two stories didn't feel like they belonged in a same movie together and the film takes an incoherent turn from what it was doing in the previous Mad Max movies. This seems to be a much more family friendly film and somehow the producers convinced Miller to include the Max character so they could bank on the success of the franchise, but it feels like a completely different story.Beyond Thunderdome begins with Max (Mel Gibson) traveling through the dessert having his vehicle towed by a group of camels when all of a sudden a plane flies so close to him that it knocks him off the road. In a matter of seconds the pilot, Jedediah (Bruce Spence), jumps off the plane and steals his vehicle while his son flies the plane back home. Max is left with nothing in the middle of the vast wasteland. Fortunately he discovers that there is a nearby city called Bartertown where travelers exchange goods. The city is ruled by Aunty (Tina Turner) who is trying to bring back civilization after a nuclear war has nearly wiped out the entire population of the world. Of course in order to build this civilized city she governs the place by controlling the population with soldiers and slaves. She can't run the city on her own however, because the city needs energy which is powered by Master Blaster who is using pig manure to produce methane. Master Blaster is actually two characters, Master (Angelo Rossitto), a midget who rides on a giant's back named Blaster (Paul Larsson). Master is the brains, while Blaster is the brute force. Auntie wants Blaster out of the picture so she can control Master along with the rest of the city on her own. That is where Max comes in handy because she soon discovers that he is a talented warrior who might just be able to defeat the monster. He promises Max vehicle and gasoline if he accepts to face off Blaster in a death duel inside the Thunderdome, the place where all problems are settled and justice is served. The film takes some unexpected turns along the way leading Max through the dessert once again where he is saved by a group of tribal children who seem to confuse him for Captain Walker, a man who supposedly promised to lead them back to civilization. The film suffers an extremely rare tonal shift once Max arrives at the oasis where the tribal children live, but it never ceases to entertain. The Thunderdome scene is by far the best action sequence of the movie and the film is almost worth recommending just for that. It's an inventive fight scene that is expertly choreographed and shot through some great camera angles. The final twenty minutes of the film are action packed, but it comes a bit too late. It's in these action scenes that George Miller's direction seems to excel, but the narrative structure and character development does suffer as the film tries to bring all these different archs together in an unconvincing and none-cohesive manner. The sequel seemed to have lost the heart and soul of Miller's previous visionary post-apocalyptic world, but I'll still give the film credit for trying to do something completely different from the previous sequel. Unfortunately that inventiveness didn't pay off and I would've preferred Miller stick closer to the world he had envisioned in The Road Warrior. I didn't care too much for the villains in this film either and that is why I found this to be the weakest entry of the series. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Loner fighter man wins a duel inside a metal sphere with the town looking on. He doesn't follow all the rules and is cast away to die. He ends up at a village with lots of native kids. Stuff happens. The original mean town learns he is alive. They chase after him with one of those iconic mammoth car chase battles. Sprinkle on dirt and sweat and grim and there's your picture. The End.

There's a bit more polish, and a little less violence and neither really suit this particular franchise very well.The Bartertown/Thunderdome stuff is reasonably entertaining--with the Max/Blaster fight being the highlight of the entire film--but once Max finds the Lost Boys out in the desert it loses any pretense of being an actual 'Mad Max' flick.Here's hoping 'Fury Road' returns to the manic energy that made the first two movies so memorable.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
62,barnabyrudge,"Part three of the Mad Max trilogy - decent action sequences, but not as urgent as its two predecessors.",5,23 July 2007,"Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome is the final segment in the Mad Max trilogy, and probably the weakest. The budget is higher than in the previous movies and the whole film has a more polished feel to it, but the story is far less inspired this time around and the main character seems to be developing rather too much of a conscience! Whereas part 1 and part 2 were short, tight and single-minded, this third chapter begins to get ideas above its station. moreover, it digresses too much before finally coming back to life for an exciting climax. (One carp, though: the climax  exciting as it is  is virtually a re-run of the ending from Mad Max II).Post-apocalyptic drifter Max (Mel Gibson) stumbles across a town in the desert called Bartertown. Here, the rough and ragged inhabitants have begun to rebuild a sort of existence under the tyrannical leadership of Aunty Entity (Tina Turner). Max is forced to take part in a savage fight to the death in a gladiatorial arena that has been set up in the town, known simply as the Thunderdome. The rules are simple  two men enter, one man leaves. Max finds himself pitted against a towering giant known as the Blaster (Paul Larsson); but after an exhilarating contest, Max defeats his gigantic opponent. However, when Max refuses to finish off the Blaster in the arena  as the law of Thuderdome states he must  he is banished from the town and exiled into the desert. Almost killed in the burning wilderness, Max is rescued by a tribe of children who believe that he is their saviour, come out of nowhere to lead them to a better life. Reluctantly, Max has to lead the children out of the desert. but with Aunty out to stop him, the chase is on! Gibson is still very watchable as Max, even after three movies. but Turner over-acts hideously as his nemesis this time around. There are some impressive action sequences along the way, including Max's hair-raising fight against the Blaster and an extravagant stunt-filled climactic chase. Maurice Jarre provides a good score that complements the on-screen mayhem quite nicely. Between the high spots of carnage, however, the film slows down rather too much. The fates bring Max into the hands of the desert children, at which point he becomes an almost-biblical figure. His redemption lies in leading them to a better life; the job of doing so becomes his personal quest. The earlier Mad Max movies were so much better for their single-minded concentration on action and spectacle; this one comes perilously close to going all ""sentimental"" on its audience. One scene that does stick in the mind is the ending, where Max sacrifices his chances of escape to help the others get away. Needing a clear runway for their small makeshift aircraft to get off the ground, Max drives a truck in front of the plane and smashes through an oncoming convoy of pursuing vehicles to clear the route. Those on the plane look on in silent agony as he makes this extraordinary sacrifice. After three movies, countless chases and car smashes, and enough adventures to last anyone a lifetime, we finally get to see just how ""mad"" Max really is!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
63,juneebuggy,What the hell was this?,4,2 December 2014,"Sadly the Mad Max franchise turns into bit of a cheesefest with this instalment. After the grittiness of the first two movies I was expecting more here. Its still full of strange characters and feels low budget even though (by this point it wasn't) but Max has just become a caricature of himself here as he fights Master Blaster, is sent into the desert to die by Bartertowns evil Queen (Tina Turner) and rescued by a tribe of children. Where the hell were all the high speed car chases? What was up with the comic one liners? and wow did I get bored with the whole Tommorowland side plot and the kids.

64,slokes,Mild Max,4,26 May 2014,"""He's bad, he's beautiful, he's crazy!"" Mel Gibson gets quite the build up in this third installment of the ""Mad Max"" series. Does he live up to it?It depends on what you expect. If you were a fan of the high-octane ""Road Warrior,"" or the even fiercer ""Mad Max"" which kicked things off, you may well miss the disturbed loner of the earlier films, and mind the fact he is more settled and less crazed than ever. But if you watch this film divorced of such expectations, well, I think ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is still problematic, if entertaining in fits and starts.We meet Max still alone in the post-Apocalyptic deserts of Australia, his goods and camels stolen. In search of them, he arrives in Bartertown, a pig-poop-powered oasis for cheats and chiselers. Auntie Entity (Tina Turner) takes an interest in Max, enough to offer a proposition: Kill a rival in town so she can have full control of Bartertown. Max agrees readily.""Who's the bunny?"" he asks, clearly not caring one way or the other.That's about the only Mad Max moment in ""Thunderdome,"" which otherwise deepens the character by adding a layer of sentimentality and, eventually, paternal protection to a group of cute kids who live all alone in the deepest desert and sees Max as the return of their saviour.You can read the responses here and on the comments thread. These kids are too much like the Ewoks in ""Return Of The Jedi,"" only worse because the ""Star Wars"" movies always had a kid focus and fuzzy alien types. ""Mad Max"" was geared more for adults, which makes long close-ups of dewy-eyed babes under a cloying score that much harder to take. This long detour into Joseph Campbell-evoking storytelling sessions takes up a lot of time that Max could be spending lubing his car axles with some mohawked maniac's guts.Actually, Max doesn't do a lot of driving in this one, just a bit at the end. For the most part, he's regulated to the sidelines, listening to the kids or else Auntie, who explains about her den of misery: ""It's civilization. I'll do anything to protect it.""As long as ""Thunderdome"" focuses on Auntie and Bartertown, it's at least enjoyable if not as focused or as visceral as the prior Max films. You enjoy the pungently nasty characters that people Max's world, the debris of the old world re-purposed to strange ends, and the guy who hawks camels by telling a crowd: ""This is the vehicle that sent Detroit broke!"" Max is there, too, a man of few words as always, his actions building to a cage death match in ""Thunderdome"" that is one of the movie's major reasons for being.After that, though, the film wanders. ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" it turns out, is more than a cool name; it's an all-too-accurate descriptor of the proceedings. Beyond Thunderdome, there's little for Max to do than go back into the desert and discover his lost humanity with the help of those impish Lord Of The Flies kids.A new ""Mad Max"" film, sans Gibson but bringing back director George Miller, is expected to open in 2015. If ""Thunderdome"" accomplished anything for Miller and company, it was to lower the bar set by the earlier Max films. ""Thunderdome"" is not terrible, it just makes you fidget in the wrong places.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
65,gcd70,Clever creation lost its way,5,10 February 2010,"After two highly successful, cult hits, George Miller was faced with a problem: churn out more of the same or get a little creative, and try something different. Damned if you do and damned if you don't, Miller chose to take the risk and create a very different third instalment; he lost his cult following in the process.Maybe it was Tina Turner as Aunty Entity, or Angry Anderson as Ironbar (both difficult to swallow I admit), or maybe it is just the change of focus that lost the fans, with Max now the freedom fighter leading a new cause against the tyranny of Bartertown in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Whatever the case we're left with the forgotten third of the ""Mad Max"" trilogy here.For mine, Miller and co-writer Terry Hayes have used their imaginations to the best of their ability, and in so doing have presented a reasonably entertaining work. At times it is inherently silly, yet it does break free of the infantile to hold you on occasion. Thunderdome itself is a clever creation, and the final chase, though obligatory, is fun.Sadly for the fans Gibson doesn't present us with the same hollow, burnt out soul of the first two films, with Max appearing a new man, full of purpose and direction.

66,Witchfinder-General-666,Not As 'Mad' As Its Predecessors - And Not Nearly As Fascinating,5,8 June 2008,"'Mad' Max Rockatanski is back again, but with less madness and a lot less brilliance this time. While ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (aka. ""Mad Max 3"") of 1985 is by no means a bad film as such, it is just vastly inferior compared to the 1979 milestone ""Mad Max"" and the, even more brilliant, sequel ""The Road Warrior"" of 1981. Director George Miller proves that he still is a master of atmosphere (this time, he was assisted by George Ogilvie, whose repertoire doesn't include a lot else) in this third entry to the ""Mad Max"" trilogy, but the film sadly lacks most of the other elements that made the predecessors so fascinating. The original ""Mad Max"" was a gritty, brutal and uncompromising classic of revenge action cinema, and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" was a post-apocalyptic masterpiece that can easily be named as one of the most defining examples of 80s cinema. The third journey into the world of Mad Max Rockatanski often seems like a sequel that was mainly intended to cash in on its ingenious predecessors, however. First off, the producers obviously wanted to sell this to a wider audience and therefore intended ratings that would allow younger audiences to the theaters (such as a PG-13 rating in the United States instead of an R-rating). Whenever producers of violent classics intend a more child-friendly rating for a sequel, the sequel tends to receive a lower rating from me, as the quality of the franchise usually sinks immensely. And indeed this third ""Mad Max"" film is not nearly as violent and menacing as the first two. Also, Mad Max Rockatanski, who was a merciless avenger in the first film, and a antihero who basically didn't give a @*#$ about anybody else in the second, is turned into a hero and somewhat nice guy in ""Beyond Thunderdome"" - which is not exactly a conversion of my taste. But it would be wrong to say that ""Beyond Thunderdome"" hasn't got its qualities. Mel Gibson, of whom I am not a fan generally, is once again great as the greatest character he ever played - Mad Max Rockatanski. Also the casting of Tina Turner was a good idea, as Tina fits greatly in her role of 'Aunty Entity'. The film actually starts out greatly, but the subplots don't really fit the film very well, and it ends up a bit messy. The film has its great aspects, and several downright ingenious moments, but it is overall disappointing for fans of the first two ""Mad Max"" films. ""Beyond Thunderdome"" is a worthwhile film, but i highly recommend to watch the excellent ""Mad Max"" and the brilliant ""Road Warrior"" before this.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
67,ShootingShark,One Of The Living,8,30 July 2010,"In a post-apocalyptic future loner Max drifts into the cutthroat hangout of Bartertown and is quickly drafted into a duel to the death, as a political pawn of the ruling Aunty Entity. Subsequently abandoned into the desert to die, Max is rescued by Savannah Nix, one of a strange tribe of outcast children who mistakenly believe him to be a messiah.I really like all three Mad Max movies, but I think this one is my favourite. It's not as pure an action film as its predecessor, and Max himself is a more moral traditional hero, but it's a much better, fully-rounded story, with much more character depth. The plot is kind of rambling, as Max gets bounced around various people and places, but it's tied together well and every new situation is intriguing and visually imaginative. In essence, it's just a great adventure yarn, with surprises, scares, humour, pathos, fights, chases and a beautifully touching ending. There are three things which combine to make it so much fun I think. The first is the cast, who are just wonderfully weird - Gibson is fantastic in what for me is his signature role, Turner is marvellously scheming in what (sadly) is really her only substantial acting role, and the supporting players are a combination of great fringe character actors like Rossitto and Thring, and bright young Australian child performers like Buday. Of particular mention is Anderson (singer with seminal Aussie band Rose Tattoo) as the henchman Ironbar, who is scary and hilarious at the same time, constantly getting whacked about, and stealing pretty much every scene he's in, especially his final death spasm. Equally good is Graham Walker's eye-popping production design, which expands on all the crazy vehicles and studded clothes from Mad Max 2 into truly bizarre props and costumes raided from junkyards and factories. The fine art direction and Norma Moriceau's terrific costumes add tremendously to the atmosphere and gives the film a unique science-fiction / adventure look, a sort of Lawrence Of Arabia meets Damnation Alley. Bringing all this together is co-writer/co-producer/co-director Miller's steady hand behind the lens, deftly capturing all the crazy sights to see whilst at the same time telling a compelling drama and injecting the whole movie with a terrific sense of fun. Maybe this film isn't for everyone's tastes but I think it's just sensational, and probably the best of both Miller and Gibson's careers. After making it, both emigrated to Hollywood, which I personally think was a misstep, especially in Gibson's case. He may have become much more famous subsequently and he has produced a large body of good movies but if you look at the ones he made prior to this (particularly Gallipoli, Mad Max 2 and The Year Of Living Dangerously), I believe they are much better (and he is better in them) than any of his US box-office hits like Lethal Weapon. Shot in the deserts of New South Wales and at the remote town of Coober Pedy (used in several other movies, such as Until The End Of The World and Pitch Black). Book-ended by two terrific songs from Turner, this is a great Australian action film and is lovingly dedicated to Byron Kennedy, Miller's longtime business partner and producer, who sadly died whilst he was scouting pre-production locations for the film.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
68,a_chinn,"Third Mad Max film starts strong, but loses steam in the second act",8,1 August 2019,"Weakest of all the Max Max films is still terrific fun, especially the first act. Max finds himself highjacked right off the bat and left in the desert with just the clothes on his back. He then wanders into Bartertown, a post apocalyptic trading post of sorts run by Auntie Entity, a memorable Tina Turner who also provides two songs for the film, but there's a power struggle of sort going on for the control of Bartertown. Turner runs topside and underneath Bartertown Master Blaster runs Underworld, an underground methane refinery that powers Bartertown. Master Blaster is actually two people. Master is a dwarf who knows the science of the methane refinery and Blaster is his massive helmeted bodyguard. Auntie hires Max to kill Blaster, keeping the brains but losing the body. This culminates in an arena battle in the titular Thunderdome. A humpbacked Dr. Dealgood explains Thunderdome to the crowd:""Listen all! This is the truth of it. Fighting leads to killing, and killing gets to warring. And that was damn near the death of us all. Look at us now! Busted up, and everyone talking about hard rain! But we've learned, by the dust of them all... Bartertown learned. Now, when men get to fighting, it happens here! And it finishes here! Two men enter; one man leaves.""Then later giving fight instructions to Max and Blaster:""Thunderdome's simple. Get to the weapons, use them any way you can. I know you won't break the rules, because there aren't any.""Chainsaws, swords, machetes, giant metal mallets, and other deadly implements are hung all around the metal dome as Max and Blaster are hung from elastic bungie cords as they start their fight. It's a dynamite scene and stands a a highpoint for the movie and also for the Max Max series as a whole. It's that good Bartertown itself is a rich world created by writer/director George Miller and co-writer Terry Hayes, populated with colorful characters and fascinating in the dynamics of this society they've built out of the ruins of the old. However, the film takes a turn in the second half when Max is left for dead out in the desert and is rescued by a tribe of children who have created their own Lord of the Flies-like village in a jungle oasis, with only the vaguest memories of the old world. It is interesting to see how these children have created their own community and social structure, along with their incorrect recollections of a world most of them have never seen or barely remember. Reportedly the story of these children making their own world in a post-apocalyptic setting was it's own separate script when it was proposed, what if Mad Max discovered these kids? That may have been an interesting idea, but that half of the movie is such a drag compared to the initial Bartertown sequence and the film's third and final act where Max returns to Bartertown to retrieve what was stolen from him. The film really should have told one of these two stories because the two stories really don't seem go all that well together. It's also disappointing that the film was PG-13 instead of the hard R-rating that the prior and subsequent films all received. Maybe the inclusion of the kids and the PG-13 rating was an attempt to reach a wider audience, but in the end that did not help the franchise. Still, the Bartertown portions of the film are dynamite, Mel Gibson is his usual charismatic self on screen, there's a lush score my Maurice Jarre, gorgeous photography by Oscar winner Dean Semler, terrific production design by Graham 'Grace' Walker, and most importantly some top tier action sequences from director George Miller, who most recently showed a whole new generation of filmgoers what an action movie should look like when he released the long gestating four installment in the series, ""Fury Road.""

For an action hero film that intends to be taken seriously, Mad Max 3 is way too quirky. With this in mind, the film feels like a bit of a forerunner to Waterworld. It's ironic, that despite some pretty blatant similarities (feeble screen writing being one of them) the financial success of the two is totally dissimilar. Makes you wonder what people see in this that they don't in Cosnter's famed box office flop. Personally, I prefer Waterworld, because it's a more adventurous tale.Mad Max 3 tries to improve on that which the second entry was missing (story) while at the same time maintaining its muscle mass. What George Miller and his screen writers come up with (in a failed attempt to be clever or fresh) is a sort of desert oasis munchkin land. Despite being surrounded with such hokey characters, Mel Gibson maintains his serious face, and in fact, I think Max is at his best in this movie. Bruce Spence is back too, but he plays someone else, and he only gets half the screen time he did in the previous entry.The ending of the film (sort of) opens the doors to the possibility of one more instalment, but there is certainly a stronger sense of closure to this one, than the previous two, as Mad walks into the sunset across the flat desert, to whatever future. Needless to say there is no fourth instalment, and frankly I don't think one is necessary. The Mad Max trilogy together form an interesting little entry in science fiction genre.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

72,philip_vanderveken,"Enjoyable, but not the most original one of the three",7,5 May 2005,"The Mad Max series ended with this third movie called ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" and if I'm honest, it was one too many. It certainly isn't as bad as some people like you to believe, but it has lost much of it's power because this is no longer that small independent Australian production. It even had Tina Turner playing a role in it.This time Max is still traveling throughout the Australian dessert, when he manages to stumble upon Bartertown, a trading post for all kinds of criminals. His supplies have been stolen from him and he has no choice but to seek shelter in this outpost of technology where civilization has long gone. It is ruled by both Aunt Entity and Master Blaster, which leads to a lot of tension between the two leaders. Max will fight in an arena called the Thunderdome on behalf of Aunty, where he'll have to defeat Master Blaster. But when the fight is won, he's banished and chased back into the desert where he soon meets a group of children that survived a plane crash during the war. They believe he is their former pilot Captain Walker and some of the children leave to find their fabled tomorrow morrow land, leaving Mad Max no choice but to save them from the desert and from Auntie's Bartertown...Of course I could say that I didn't like the fact that Tina Turner played a role in it, but if I'm honest, than I must admit that she didn't do a bad job. I quite liked her role and her acting. It even didn't bother me all that much that Mad Max was degraded to some kind of kindergarten hero. No, what bothered me most of all was that the movie didn't have much new to offer. Sure, there is the Thunderdome and Bartertown, but in the end this is exactly the same movie as Mad Max 2. What's more, the final part of the movie almost seems to be an exact copy. No, personally I find the first two movies better. Each of them was renewing and original, something that certainly can't be said about this one. I give this movie a 6.5/10.

Yeah the action's not on-par with the innovative chase scenes of The Road Warrior and it doesn't have half the teeth (grit) of the original Mad Max, but Thunderdome does dive deeper into the world that was established with those movies.

Hard to describe - although not as episodic as the first MM, film changes direction several times, ending in the obligatory car chase/fight scene.  Some of the directions are unique and awe-inspiring, others are just the same old.

75,brchthethird,A more thought-provoking sequel that still delivers the action,7,14 November 2014,"MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME, while a bit of a different beast than the previous two Mad Max films, is able to stand on equal terms with them in terms of action and spectacle as well as having deeper themes. This entry takes place several years after THE ROAD WARRIOR and has Max trekking the desert in a camel-drawn vehicle. After his vehicle and belongings are stolen by a pilot, Jedidiah (Bruce Spence, the Gyro Captain from the previous film), he makes his way to Bartertown. Bartertown is a city built in the aftermath of the apocalypse, and run with an iron fist by a strange character known as Aunty (Tina Turner). Hoping to get his stuff back, he agrees to fight in Thunderdome. After getting kicked out of Bartertown back into the desert, he meets a group of children who are surviving the apocalypse in their own way.The best thing about the film is that it fleshes out the world established in the previous two entries, as well as bring in some new elements. The most interesting of these new additions is the Thunderdome, a caged arena where participants fight to the death with whatever weapons are available. The car chases were also creative, and had excellent stunt work, but the Thunderdome really showcases the brutality of the post-apocalypse in a way that the other action sequences couldn't (or didn't). Also, even though it made the narrative slightly unwieldy, I did like the side-by-side comparison of Bartertown with the tribe of children that Max meets. The central theme or message of this film seemed to be about how civilization recovers from apocalyptic events. Bartertown does this by regressing back to an animalistic, violent capitalism, while the young tribe remains innocent in anticipation for the return of a distant, utopian past. And all the while they hope for a better future. Thematically, this film stands head and shoulders above the previous two. Still, the way in which the narrative is drawn out makes the film a bit slow at times, which could turn off people who enjoyed the previous two for the non-stop action. Here, the bulk of the action is saved for the last 15-20 minutes, in a chase sequence that should please the action junkies in the audience.As far as acting is concerned, it's OK but Mel Gibson is the only person who really does what I'd consider a ""great"" job. I also feel like Tina Turner was miscast as Aunty Entity, and a lot of her line readings felt really awkward to me. In contrast, I thought that the child actors portraying the tribe did a rather decent job. Overall, despite being a little slow at times, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME is an entertaining post-apocalyptic movie with great action and some things to think about as well. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the series.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
76,Beta_Gallinger,"A rather ridiculous third installment, unsurprisingly the weakest in the trilogy",5,5 October 2010,"Released a few years after ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"", ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" was the third and final installment in the ""Mad Max"" trilogy, starring Mel Gibson. I just saw the first two installments for the first time last month, and after finding the first one to be a pretty good action movie, I had high expectations for ""The Road Warrior"", expecting it to be better than the original. However, I found myself disappointed and thinking that second film was overrated, unlike so many others who have seen it. Even if that 1981 blockbuster had lived up to my expectations, I still wouldn't have had high expectations for this far less popular 1985 follow-up, which is unsurprisingly inferior to both of its predecessors.The world is still suffering from the effects of the energy crisis, and in the Australian Outback, Max Rockatansky is still a lone warrior, wandering the land and fighting for survival. He comes across a community known as Bartertown, where people go to trade for supplies. Having just been robbed, Max has nothing to trade, but is taken to see the town's evil leader, Aunty Entity. He learns about the town's underground methane refinery, fueled by pig feces, and run by an intelligent dwarf named Master, with the help of his large but simpleminded bodyguard, Blaster. These two threaten Aunty Entity's ruling over Bartertown, so Max is hired take on Blaster in a fight to the death while the two of them are locked inside a gladiatorial arena known as the Thunderdome! The former police officer doesn't exactly keep his side of the bargain, and for this, he is banished from the town. Soon after this, he finds himself with a group of orphaned children, who mistake him for their savior, Captain Walker! When this film begins, it isn't long at all before we see Max entering Bartertown. As we watch what happens to him in this town, the film isn't exactly terrible, but it already proves to be a little messy. One character I think sometimes put a confused look on my face when he spoke was Master, played by Angelo Rossitto. There is some tension during these Bartertown scenes, but it's still not exactly satisfying. Also, the Thunderdome fight may be a little tedious. After Max is banished is when the tribe of orphaned children comes into the picture, which certainly doesn't help the film. Maybe Mad Max and Peter Pan don't mix. The members of this group are generally played poorly, including the leader of the tribe, Savannah Nix, played by Helen Buday. She might stand out over the rest because she has more lines, and I would say this character is somewhat annoying. This tribe unfortunately only makes ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" worse, and I think the movie would still be a fairly poorly crafted mess without them.Even though this is the least popular installment in the ""Mad Max"" franchise, it does have a following. However, I basically agree with the naysayers on this one, and think this was an unfortunate way to end the trilogy, though it certainly wasn't the only time in film history that happened. The first two films are rated R, whereas this third one is rated PG-13, and they really didn't do a very good job making the transition. It's been 25 years since the release of ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (it came into theatres the year before I was born, so I wasn't around to see any of the films when they first came out), and there hasn't been another film in the franchise since then, but it appears a fourth installment called ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is coming in 2012, with Tom Hardy replacing Mel Gibson in the starring role of Mad Max Rockatansky. Since this third one is so lacklustre and it has been a quarter of a century since its release, a fourth one doesn't exactly sound like a good idea.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
77,phubbs,Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,5,11 August 2014,"For the last outing Miller has taken a different route for his lone wolf character. Gone are the highway chases, road wars and Max's personal Ford Falcon, this adventure is a completely new kind of beast...with kids...hurrah!It does seem that Miller took a leaf out of the Lucas book of ideas for this film. A much more toned down Mad Max film with very little blood and road vehicle based death and carnage, but an abundance of children in a kind of tribal 'Lord of the Flies' meets 'The Lost Boys' in a 'Peter Pan-esque' type of way. Not too dissimilar to the way 'Return of the Jedi' went all cute and cuddly towards the end with a large tribe of teddy bears.Although the change of pace was risky and in my view...not the best decision ever, you gotta give kudos to the writers for being brave enough to go in another direction. The film doesn't really offer much action and adventure at any point to be brutally honest, my opinion. The first half set in 'Bartertown' is a complete bust really as all we get is a seedy dirty dusty desert town inhabited by lots of marauder types and weirdo's yet nothing really happens!The bad guys aren't really bad at all, just a bit naughty I guess, the plot isn't really of any interest and goes nowhere and the only action is a rather limp fight between Max and a huge helmet wearing foot soldier/bodyguard called 'Blaster'. We also find out the leader of this wasteland dump is errrm...Tina Turner, terrific.Of course we all knew this before the film came out but it was definitely a sign of the franchise hitting the rocks. After this average kick off things progress towards the desert where Max finds this tribe of kids and where the franchise U-turns harshly, think of an early version of 'Hook' and you might get an idea of what I'm talking about. Its not as cringeworthy and terrible as that Spielberg film but lets be honest its pretty crappy frankly. From here on Max babysits these kids until the plot leads them back to Bartertown for...hmmm not much really, plot is absent without leave.The sets costumes and makeup for the kids and their homes are nicely done, doesn't look tacky or too childish, luckily it all still fits OK within the Mad Max universe. Of course we do still get some lovely location visuals with some beautifully stunning vast orange and tan coloured Aussie outback shots. These landscapes really are the core of this franchise and give it such depth and scope, it just looks awesome basically.After observing nothing much in the form of excitement we do eventually get a reasonably solid yet watered down vehicle chase sequence at the end. Its not as intense as you would expect and barely serves up enough thrills to raise a smile, the violence level is at a complete zero here folks, bloodless. I'm not saying that automatically means the movie will be poor but come on...its Mad Max, lets see some claret spillage.As I said it was brave to go into new territory with Max but maybe this particular idea wasn't the best way. There isn't really anything very memorable anywhere in the film, the title sounds daft and although the Tina Turner theme song is a good tune its all very Bond-like and too glossy. You half expect Turner to start bellowing out her power ballad midway through the film to a montage of Gibson's tanned buttocks...well maybe.5/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
78,Mister-6,No wonder Max was mad....,8,20 August 1999,"With only three ""Mad Max"" films to judge from, ""Beyond Thunderdome"" ends up on the bottom of the pile.  But for the longest time, this one looks like it's going to spring right off the screen at you.Mel's good, Tina's sexy and Angry Anderson, Ironbar is just about the nastiest, most stubborn baddie ever concocted (well, him and Master Blaster).  And the life in Bartertown is extremely intriguing (the Thunderdome battle is one of the most exciting combat events since that last pay-per-view).  But then Mel is banished to the desert, where he comes upon the lost children of the desert, all waiting for a grown-up to take them home. 
This part of the movie drags badly and almost threatens to take everything else down with it.  In a ""Mad Max"" movie, you just expect Mel to set things right, solo.  But no: the brats tag along and help as much as they can. They're cute, but what are cute kids doing in a ""Mad Max"" movie?Getting in the way, that's what.Without the kids, this could have been a classic along the lines of ""The Road Warrior"" (i.e. - ""Mad Max 2"").

79,KnightsofNi11,The weakest of the trilogy,6,18 December 2010,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the third film in the Mad Max series, pits our anti-hero protagonist against heartless and greedy foes once again. Only this time with a little more soul rock in the form of Tina Turner. The film begins with Max trailing across the desert wasteland of post apocalyptic Australia for a third time. He stumbles upon Bartertown, a run down old shantytown run entirely on methane from pig crap. The main attraction is Bartertown though is its Thunderdome, which pits two men against each other to fight until one is dead. When Max fails to adhere to this Thunderdome law he is exiled from Bartertown and next finds himself a deliverer of a colony children. The whole story is pretty bizarre, and so is just about everything else about this film.Over the course of the three Mad Max films, the clothing and architecture becomes more and more tribal and much less urban as the world descends deeper into its post apocalyptic demise. Hence why the archaic clothing and decrepit old tribal architecture is so abundant in this film. The film feels like it is set in the caveman era until some article or object from the demolished modern world pops up. The costuming and set design of the film are very neat and a lot of fun to look at. That is until some of the costuming goes a bit overboard. The Mad Max series has always had weird costumes for everyone, especially the bad guys. The fur and black leather had become the norm Mad Max villains, but Beyond Thunderdome made it all a little weird. Some of characters in this film wear minimal black leather outfits that remind me a little too much of The Gimp from Pulp Fiction. But for the most part the design of Max's world is very cool and very different for futuristic sci-fi.It's pretty evident that the filmmakers had all but run out of ideas when it came time to make Beyond Thunderdome. There's little variation between the story lines of Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome as far as the basic plot outline goes. Max travels the wasteland, finds a struggling city, and then rescues a group of oppressed or neglected people. The biggest difference though is that Road Warrior did it all much better. Beyond Thunderdome doesn't stay nearly as interesting as Road Warrior and drags at times pretty badly. The story is definitely there and its fun and typical of Mad Max but didn't have the same impact as it's predecessors. You spend a lot more time wondering why the filmmakers put certain things in the film, instead of paying attention to the storyline. Like I said, this film is just really weird in a good and bad way. There are some strange little nuances that are really pretty cool, but also some things that make you ask why they were necessary at all. Overall it gave me very mixed feelings about this film.The movie would have been a lot better if it hadn't dragged in so many spots. At the beginning of the film Max spends a lot of time in Bartertown and some interesting and strange things happen that build up to his fight in the Thunderdome. Unfortunately when we finally got to the Thunderdome it ended up being fairly cheesy and silly. After Max is exiled from Bartertown he is discovered by the colony of children. Here the film really starts to drag and the film has a hard time keeping a solid and straightforward narrative going. A lot of things begin to seem useless and I started to wonder when things were going to start happening again. Of course it eventually did pick up. What Mad Max film would be complete without an intense final car chase scene? Beyond Thunderdome delivered in that field, but definitely not to the extent of the two previous films. Once again we saw the filmmakers running out of ideas and I'm sure if you looked at the final car chase scenes from Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome side by side you wouldn't see a huge amount of differences. The film definitely picked up at the end, but it almost got ahead of itself and began to feel rushed. The ending was decent but nothing extraordinary.All in all Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome wasn't a bad film. It has its issues and doesn't hold up against the first two films, but it has its good elements. I loved the design of the post apocalyptic wasteland that had grown even more distressed since Road Warrior. The story has a substantial amount of issues but I can't complain too much since it definitely tried and it was no doubt a Mad Max story. If you've seen the first two Mad Max films definitely finish out the series with this one. It's not great but it's not awful either.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
80,TOMASBBloodhound,About as compelling as a long Duran Duran video.,5,7 October 2007,"This disappointing second sequel to the 1979 classic film Mad Max plays out like a long music video. The dastardly PG-13 rating and the ludicrous casting of then huge pop star Tina Turner only help to dilute a script that already had little to do with its main character.Mel Gibson returns once again to play Max Rockatansky, the drifter who endlessly wanders through a post-apocalyptic Australia and every now and then is forced to defend himself and his property from other scavengers. In this film's opening scene, he is robbed of his derelict vehicle and a team of camels by the guy who played the gyro captain in Mad Max 2. It is a typically annoying element of this film that we are not sure if he is in fact the same character, or just a new meditation of that original character. Max would seemingly be able to recognize him in an instant, yet there is only a vague familiarity when they meet up later in the film. Anyway, it is the same actor. Max tracks him down to a futuristic scummy civilization known as ""Batertown"". In this vestige of civilization, people trade whatever they have for whatever they need. The town is seemingly run by Tina Turner's ""Aunty"" character, yet once Max gets inside, we find that she has a rival within the community. This rival, known as Master/Blaster is perhaps one of the more interesting characters of the entire series. To sum things up, Max makes a deal. He doesn't exactly follow through with it. He is exiled to the desert where he meets a group of plane crash survivors who think he's the chosen one to lead them back to society. Until he can fulfill this prophecy, the group will have to deal with those who run Bartertown and escape them once again.That plot is convoluted to say the least, but with all that is going on it actually seems like little is happening for long stretches of the film. The original story was centered around the plane crash survivors and had nothing to do with Max at all. In fact he almost seems like an afterthought once the film finally ends. The film has very little in the way of graphic violence that filled the previous entries, and this was a big disappointment to fans of those two films. Mad Max 3 just isn't edgy enough, and at times seems too child-oriented. The musical score is uplifting when it should be menacing. George Miller reportedly only worked on the action sequences, but since there are so few of them you wonder how much he really did on this picture. The film is full of references to other films. Right down to a villain rising out of a tank full of pig excrement ala Martin Sheen out of the mist in Apocalypse Now! Who knows what path this film would have taken had Byron Kennedy lived to help make it.On the plus side, they had a lot more money to work with this time around, and the film generally looks impressive in a visual sense. Each Mad Max film had a different feel and style to it. This last one was just too much like a tame music video than a rip-roaring action film. And it's too bad that Mad Max 4 has never gotten into production yet. Miller instead is too busy making what American audiences seem to line up for these days..... animated penguin movies!!!!

81,ivo-cobra8,The weakest Mad Max film I ever saw,2,12 September 2017,"*SPOILERS* The third movie in the trilogy Mad Max franchise and the weakest Mad Max film I ever saw. This movie is stupid! I never understood why this movie is so bad. Even the first Mad Max is better than Beyond Thunderdome. Why such a praise for this film? The only good thing in this film is Mel Gibson and Tina Turner and her songs but that's it. The rest of the film everything sucks so bad in here and it is rated PG-13 and everything in this film is just wrong. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is awesome and the best of the trilogy, this film just isn't. But it is a real let down and a true disappointment for a fan like me. Max without his car V8 is nothing but a peace of low life.I know a lot of people love this film and I respect that some people even think this is better then the original Mad Max, Really? What is so good about this movie? Huh. This movie is boring, less violent it is PG-13 movie and Mel Gibson is at worst at his performance. This movie was a failure to me.Every time I watch it I just feel miserable oh and Mad Max the original film is way better flick then this one it really is.I apologize to all fans but in my opinion not yours this movie is the weakest one in the Mad Max franchise and if they would focus more on Bardertown and Thunderdome and got rid of the kids and make this movie rated R this could have been a great movie but right now in my opinion its a ""bad"" movie .This movie felt too rushed and it felt it just wasn't right.And also why this film is in the sand why the are no roads here? Why this is not a wasteland? Gosh I hate this film sue me! I also reviewed 2 years ago the first three Mad Max films and I didn't want to disrespect Mad Max franchise and I didn't want to get the hate on here.Mostly it was George Miller's fault when his friend and Producer Byron Kennedy died in a helicopter crash. He didn't care he made it less violent less apocalyptic and less action I really don't understand why people love this movie but the first one they don't? I don't know.We never found out more about Max or his fate the movie does not tell us anything.Shame on you, George this movie destroyed the Mad Max trilogy I am glad that Mad Max: Fury Road come out 20 years later and yes it is MILES way better action film then this one and I have reviewed all of them.Also I like Mel Gibson as a actor I always did I never said I hate him he is a really good actor and the Mad Max Trilogy alongside with Lethal Weapon franchise those movies made him in to a star that he is today so yea.Sadly the film is failure to me just my opinion.Tina Turner wasn't that terrible because she made two songs for this film and she performed her self. Songs: One of the Living and We Don't Need Another Hero a great songs and I love to listening them. Tina Turner also at acting isn't that terrible. But this film is horrendous awful and it sucks I hate those kids. This Mad Max has no weapons by him self, he has no car and Max doesn't kill anybody in this film.It feels to me like this Max is a pussy and he is afraid to kill people. I also have this movie on Blu-ray disc in my collection even tough is a boring stupid awful time waster I still have it in my video collection. I don't like this film I don't. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 action film in this franchise which is the best one, second best one to me is Mad Max: Fury Road I love those two films to death they are great films. Mad Max the first one is a good action film but it has problems but is at least better action film then Thunderdome that is my opinion. 2/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

I can start by saying that in this movie I had a lot of action scenes with cars (which is what any movie in the saga ""Mad Max"" requires); The story and the characters were also pretty forgettable, and the story was not very meaningful and incomplete.
But even so, this movie had parts that take advantage; He had some special effects, a good shot, a good casting and a very good mix of sound. Although not a great movie, I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of 1980s action movies.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
83,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While not nearly as strong as the first two films, Beyond Thunderdome is a good third entry in the franchise",8,8 July 2020,"At Bartertown, the most advanced town in post apocalyptic Australia, Max Rockatansky comes across Aunt Entity. Then, he faces a challenge inside Thunderdome where he engages in a match to the death with a grotesque being Master Blaster. After a complication happens, Max gets banished to the desert until he discovers a lost tribe of children who survived on their own waiting for the arrival of Captain Walker. So he decides to take some of the children with him to deal with Aunt Entity and get them to a place far away from Bartertown.After the success of the first two films, a third movie entered production before a tragedy happened. Byron Kennedy, a friend of George Miller, got killed in a helicopter crash in 1983 while scouting the location for the film, causing George to become hesitant. So he ended up co-directing the film with George Ogilvie (who sadly died three months ago this year), who he had worked with before on a television series The Dismissal, where Miller would direct the action sequences and Ogilvie would direct the rest of the film.Then, Beyond Thunderdome released in theaters in 1985 with good reviews from critics only to receive a more mixed response from audiences who praised the 1st act of the film but criticized the film's lighter tone and more hollywood-ized feel when compared to the first two films. As a person who loves watching all sorts of movies, though, I thought this was pretty good. Is it as strong as the first two films? Not quite, but as a third entry, it's quite as interesting as I thought.It does lack the violent gritty nature of the first two films and the lost children subplot does feel like a totally different movie altogether. However, there's a lot to recommend. The story is very rich and expands more on the universe of Mad Max. What's interesting about the lost children subplot is the dialect as it explains why they got marooned on the desert and found shelter at the blue mountains. Also, Aunt Entity's attempt to rebuild civilization at Bartertown makes it clear that there aren't any villains which is very refreshing.The pacing is very good, the directing from George Miller and George Ogilvie is superb, the music score from the late Maurice Jarre (known for his work on Lawrence of Arabia) is beautiful and haunting along with some great pop songs from Tina Turner, who subtly hams up her role as Aunt Entity, and the action mostly the Thunderdome sequence is brilliant. The acting is very good too especially Mel Gibson who continues to shine as the cynical but complex Max Rockatansky.Overall, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome may not be a perfect movie and I understand why some people don't like it as much, but considering how a recent Star Wars movie became such a disappointment, this third entry is worthwhile with a rich story and some interesting themes. To those who haven't seen this or any of the other Mad Max films, certainly check this out and the others too.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

It really feels so different compared to previous two , that you might think somebody else except George Miller directed it. Gone is the gritty atmosphere and violence . ""Mad Max 3"" is much more lighthearted , funny and less violent (there is action , but barely any blood). It feels like a family friendly entertainment, especially with such story .It reminds me of something that could appear in Spielberg movie . I don't know , maybe they were going for wider audience with this one ? That would probably explain the appearance of Tina Turner , who not only sings two songs , but also acts . The songs - One of the living"" and the much better known We don't need another hero (Thunderdome)"" are really good . Her performance also is nice , so one can't complain that Tina destroyed the movie . She's actually one of the strongest points of it.The story has a heart , just like the other two movies , but it doesn't affect you so much like it should . The movie is definitely enjoyable , despite it's sometimes silly . Mel Gibson seems to be a little lost in this one , but he still delivers good performance . The art – direction is quite impressive . The music by Maurice Jarre is magnificent . It was also good to see a old face back.The problem lies in the fact that without it's dark and gritty atmosphere ""Mad Max 3"" loses a lot . The direction is not as sharp as before. Also , the story is rather simple and predictable. And the ending seems like ""We have to end this somehow"". If you seen the movie you will know what I mean.Still , it's not a bad farewell to Mad Max , compared to some other sequels (Matrix sequels). I give it 5/10.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
85,K3nzit,Feels more like a Disney movie,2,28 December 2019,All the movies in the Mad Max trilogy are completely different from one another. This one is less raw and more like a Disney movie. The second movie is the only one worth the watch and you don't even have to see the first movie to enjoy it.,Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
86,LeRoyMarko,"""Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, dying time is here!""",7,19 December 2004,"The final installment in the Mad Max trilogy is not as good as the first two movies in the series. But it's not as much a disappointment as some people would like you to believe. The Thunderdome scene (where there is no rules to break) and the whole Bartertown site are pure entertainment. I also liked the child tribe: the Waiting Ones. They're the survivors of the Pox-Eclipse! I also liked when we see the city of Sydney, years after Chaos has won the world. But what I enjoyed the most was when the racing-cars are out of the garage near the end! But I would agree that there is some eery similitude with the second Mad Max movie. Example: the truck chase in the ""Road Warrior"" and the train chase in ""Beyond Thunderdome"". And I would have to say that the stunt scenes were way better in the first two Mad Max.Seen at home, in Toronto, on December 19th, 2004. I first saw that movie when it came out in 1985, while on a trip to Brussels.76/100 (**½)",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
87,rebeljenn,"Boring, strange",1,19 January 2006,"Like the previous two 'Mad Max' films, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. I got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. I did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film. It's too weird for me, and it was much too dull.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
88,grahamsj3,I LIKE IT!,7,20 February 2004,"This film, while not quite as good as the second (my personal favorite), is still a great film. Most folks seem to have thought less of this one than the others. However, I believe this is the most polished of the triad. The acting is better, the story good, it seems pretty well shot, directed, etc. I can't quite figure out what makes others rate this one lower than the first two. I like this film a lot and think it ranks up there with the first two. There is or were plans for a fourth Mad Max film, but the project hasn't made any progress and it may be dead now. Gibson wanted to end the Max series, so I believe that he was planning it to be the last Max film. However, this one may have been the last one.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
89,TheOtherFool,Oh no. No no no!,3,16 August 2004,"Intelligent summary, isn't it?If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!Such a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was! It's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction. Add the obnoxious Tina Turner and the no good story-line of the people waiting for a plane, and this is just one huge stinker.Maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget-explosion kinda thing), because this just isn't right.3/10.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
90,tomimt,A bit better than given credit for,7,14 January 2006,"I want to note, that I speak only about Mad Max 3 and 2 because I still haven't seen the first one.When I was younger I didn't like about Mad Max III. The reason was, that it was a disappointment after seeing Mad Max II, which I still think is better movie. But now, after seeing this again, I've noticed, that it's not that bad I remembered it was and it actually has some pretty efficient scenes in it, although it does have some pretty bad acting in it too.MM3 is more humorous and adventurous than MM2, which was at heart pretty nihilistic movie. What actually is rather fun aspect in the film is, that there really isn't so clear definition between good and bad like there was in The Roadwarrior and there are some surprises in the characters.This time Max (Mel Gibson) arrives at a blooming city, governed by Auntie (Tina Turner), who soon notices the raw talent of Max and hires him to kill Blaster (Paul Larsson), protector of methane producer Master (Angelo Rossitto), who keeps the city in his grip.Tina Turner does actually surprisingly well in her part, tough it's pretty evident that she's more of a singer than an actor. Overall the main actors do well, especially Gibson, who is born to be Max, who was the character that made him what he is today.Beyond Thunderdome isn't a same kind of classic than The RoadWarrior, but it is great fun action film, if you don't take it too seriously.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
91,cardsrock,Weakest of the original films,6,26 November 2019,"I loved the first half of this film with Thunderdome, Tina Turner, Master Blaster and all of the scenes in Bartertown.

92,markovd111,PG-13 Mad Max isn't all that bad!,9,30 March 2019,"When I watched the Road Warrior, I was amazed how good that movie is. And then I found about the third one, which big part of the fan base hates, because it moves away from seriousness and almost makes family friendly adventure comedy from what was once nihilistic wasteland filled with murderous maniacs and criminals, portraying the journey of a lost soul through it, like he's passing through limbo. But, here's why you should still watch it and enjoy it. It's a good movie! Mel Gibson is great as always and the whole thing has a beautiful message. You can understand it as if Max saw his own family in those lost children. It's actually warm and lovely when you think about it. Miller devoted this movie to a friend he lost, so there's surely a connection to that. Watch it with that in mind, don't expect something like the first and the second movie, and you will appreciate it a whole lot more. And, if you don't want to do that, hey, there's the other three that are masterpieces :D",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
93,Al_The_Strange,"""Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls... dyin' time's here...""",7,19 May 2015,"Max Rockatansky survived onslaughts of biker and motor gangs, becoming a fierce warrior of the desolate future. His journey now takes him to the humble beginnings of a new society, in a place called Bartertown, where disputes are settled in a deadly arena called the Thunderdome.In this third entry in the Mad Max universe, we are thrown headlong into a more populated world, far more dense than before. This is not a simple matter of Max out-running or out-gunning enemies; he becomes entangled in a conspiracy that turns him into an outcast and a villain, forced to fight for his life, before wandering the wastes and finding the most unlikely resources to retaliate against his enemies. In the film's beginning half, there is some gladiatorial bloodsport, which is a wicked sight. In the film's last half, there is a grand chase scene involving even more of those crazy buggies that made The Road Warrior so memorable; only now, the chase involves a train and a plane as well.Unfortunately, the experience of this film is nowhere near as intense or compelling as the last two in the series. Once Max winds up in the hands of a group of feral children who descended from plane crash survivors, the film becomes a bizarre post-apocalyptic version of Peter Pan, with Max leading the lost boys out of the desert to salvation. Not only does the pacing slow down during these scenes, but the film loses all sense of savagery and intensity that made Mad Max so poignant to begin with. A plethora of goofy antics makes the film light in tone and silly in execution, making the experience rather goofy.However, the story has merit. This is a more complex tale that incorporates some of the tropes and archetypes of a western - complete with a corrupt sheriff-like villain, who seeks to control methane power the way they used to control railroads or oil in those old movies. Max walks into things as a rogue element, but leaves as a prophetic hero; his role as both fits comfortably in the two settings he's made to blend into, and his journey in and out of the Thunderdome proves to be a satisfying one in the end.This film is crafted with decent photography and editing. Mel Gibson continues to play it tough as Max, although his performance seems much more playful in this than in the last two movies. Tina Turner hams it up as the villain, and every other performer does their part well. Writing is okay. This production uses a lot of great-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is not bad.This film is usually considered the weakest of the Mad Max films, thanks largely to its goofier parts, but it is still an exciting adventure with plenty to behold.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Content: Okay | Film: Good)",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
94,mcfly-31,thunderdumb,3,7 January 2001,"The somehow enormously popular series is poorly wrapped up with another slack paced offering.  Mad Max is more like Mellow Max as he doesn't find himself as active as in the first two films.  He's still the mostly speechless loner roaming the outback, and comes upon a crudely constructed ""town"".  Tina Turner (I guess she was hot at the time coming off the success of her ""What's Love Got to do With It?"" song) is the ruler of this land. The people are still griping about gas problems as in the first two installments, and have discovered that piggy poop(!) can be turned into fuel.  Mel goes to work for her but ends up piffing someone off and dropped into some kind of steel cage/american gladiator/ultimate fighting championship match.  He and a bad dude are suspended from cables(?) to duke it out.  Mel thinks he's out of the clear when he wins, but ends up getting tossed into the baron desert to die (I guess).  He's rescued by a band of kids who take him to their little community, which is where the film really heads downhill.  Totally uneventful scenes pile on top of one another until they go back to Turner's joint for the finale.  And then FINALLY, at approximately the 1 hour and 30 minute mark(!), we get a trademark chase scene that defined the series.  But that's exactly what the problem is: the film is absolutely action-less until this point.  This is a Mad Max film?? Did director Miller forget what made part 1 great and part 2 a cult hit? The chase scenes, buddy!  Why do away with that and put this muck to film? And as far as the big chase, it's about as uneventful as the much loved part 2 chase, with everyone going at the same speed, the difference here being that a train is involved.  Still, it wasn't awful, and redeemed the film ever so slightly.  So why is there no part 4 after 15 years?  Max doesn't die (oops, spoiler), so how come no continuation?  Odd that I would ask considering that the only one of these films I liked was the barely budgeted part 1.  Despite my disappointment, the trilogy has a lot of lovers, so what do I know?  The one other bright spot of ""Thunderdome,"" Tina's great theme song, a favorite over the years.  At least that's something.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
95,Rautus,Alright but definitely the weakest out the Trilogy,5,30 July 2008,"After the success of Mad Max and The Road Warrior Gerorge Miller decided to make a third entry in the Mad Max series making the franchise a trilogy. Sadly after the death of long time friend and producer Byron Kennedy George Miiler lost heart in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome and had another director named George Ogilvie to direct the majority of the movie while George Miller just directed the action sequences.One thing that makes Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome different from the previous two Mad Max movies is that this one has more of a Hollywood blockbuster feel to it while the previous two were low budget gritty action movies. Apparently they wanted to go in a different direction by giving this movie a PG-13 rating and making it more tame, now this was a nice idea trouble is because of the PG-13 the movie loses that dark gritty tone that Mad Max and The Road Warrior. The movie also loses the violence that the previous two films had.Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome does have it's good points such has the acting, Mel Gibson does a great job reprising his role has Max. Tina Turner does a great performance has Anuty Entity. Most singers who try to become actors don't do a great job and some do, Tina Turner does an good job. Another good thing about this movie is the Thunderdome fight, it's got some great stunts and is pulled off effectively. The final chase scene is okay but again with the whole PG-13 rating it's no way near as violent as The Road Warrior's final chase scene.The bad points with this movie is the lack of violence, in Mad Max and The Road Warrior people got shot, killed and smashed as there vehicles collide with other vehicles. In Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome there's hardly any of that, Mad Max doesn't shoot anyone dead instead there's only one scene where he fires his sawn off shotgun at some guard's head gear making the feathers drop off it and another thing only a few people actually get killed in this movie unlike the previous two.One thing that doesn't sense with this film is the environment, this movie is set in Austrailla so why does the Outback have sand dunes and sinking sand? The Austraillian Outback looks nothing like the way it does in this film, you'd think Mad Max was in the Sahara desert and not Austrailla. Another thing I don't get is why they got the actor who played the Gyro Captain in The Road Warrior to play a similar character in this one.Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome does actually start off quite well, the first half does have the dark and gritty looking tone that Mad Max and The Road Warrior had. Sadly the second half starts to slip and become more lighter when Mad Max discovers a tribe of kids living in the Outback, the whole tribe of kids seems to much like Peter Pan and the Lord of the Flies. The movie does kind of redeem itself when Mad Max and the kids enter Bartertown but because of having kids in it now and having the PG-13 the violence is toned down, the bad guys just get knocked out by the kids swinging around. There's even a scene that copies Star Wars where we see Mad Max chase someone but then runs away as he's chased by a load of guards, the chase scene is okay but again because of the rating it's not has exhilarating as The Road Warrior's final chase scene.Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome is alright but it's not has good has Mad Max and The Road Warrior. Check this film out but don't expect it to be like the other two Mad Max movies. 5/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
96,lagudafuad,We didn't need this movie...,5,7 November 2012,"This to me is the low of the Mad Max series and the only one with a PG-13 rating. With all the cruelty, action and inhuman behavior sipped out in this Mad Max movie, Thunderdome was just a movie I think was better off left on the shelf for the future when a good story will be available.The movie boasts of a wonderful action sequence when it comes to the Thunderdome fight scene, where Max takes on Blaster. The avenue for the fight was set up in a circus like way and the tools for destruction were scattered everywhere in the dome.Mad Max 3: Thunderdome was released in 1985 as a post-apocalyptic film. It is directed by George Miller, who also directed the first two prequels to the movie.The movie plot has our protagonist Max, traveling through the wasteland after the nuclear war has rid the world of all normal civilization. He got robbed and lost all his belongings as he travelled the desert. He followed the robbers to Bartertown, a city on the edge of the desert that has managed to retain some technology.There he got involved in a power struggle between the woman who runs the town Aunty (Tina Turner) and the brains of the town Master.When he (Max) refuses to kill Master's henchman Blaster based on a deal he struck with Aunty, he got exiled into the desert where he was rescued by some children who believe he was the man there were waiting for, coming to take them back to civilization.When Max tells them there is no civilization left, some of the children decided to go seek it out on their own. Now Max has to go save them from the clutches of Bartertown.Just like its predecessors Thunderdome had a chase sequence which was more of a bore compared to the one in Mad Max: The Road Warrior. Also Bruce Spence, who played the Gyro Captain in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior plays Jedediah, a different character who robs Max at the start of the film; don't be confused because both use flying machines.The children in the movie were more annoying than there were planned to be and I didn't feel sad for them because they were just annoying and the way they dressed reminded me of the Lost Boys in Peter Pan.The thing that I like most is that (seeing this for the first time) Tina Turner had a role in this movie and the song ""We don't need another hero"" was one of the soundtracks in this movie.There is going to be a Mad Max 4, but sadly the baton has been passed to Tom Hardy (played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises 2012 and he was also in Lawless 2012) George Miller also will be involved in directing this new Mad Max, whose budget is 5 times more than the combined budget of the first three Mad Max movies.Well, Thunderdome is something to see when all other movie options have been satisfied.www.lagsreviews.com",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
97,Cinemaniac1984,The third Mad Max movie is underwhelmingly reduced to a children's fantasy movie.,5,25 June 2015,"I am very disappointed with the way Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome turned out. Mad Max (1979) and Mad Max 2 (1981) were action packed, violent, show stopping bonanzas with both movies setting the trend in movie making. I don't know what happened with Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Did some genius high up come up with the suggestion ""Will someone please think of the children?"" Because it just seems like Mad Max who used to be a road warrior is now reduced to a hero of the children.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome sees the return of Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson). After he is robbed of his possessions whilst travelling through the Australian outback via camel-drawn wagon, Max manages to stumble upon Bartertown, a trading post for all manner of criminals and ruled with an iron fist by a ruthless Amazon-like ruler named Aunt Entity (Tina Turner) as well as a freakish Master Blaster (Angelo Rossitto and Paul Larsson). Bartertown is also powered by pig manure utilised to maintain the town's electricity supply. Max is forced to engage in gladiatorial fights on behalf of Aunt Entity in order that she gain complete control of the town, but he is thrown back out into the desert when Max refuses to kill his opponent. He then stumbles upon a group of orphans, the only survivors of a plane crash during the nuclear war and with their help he returns to Bartertown.Apart from the fact the entire movie was watered down and just seemed like a kids fantasy movie, there was really nothing spectacular to write about the movie. The train-truck pursuit had the only thing going for it but that was about it.I can't fault Mel Gibson here and Tina Turner does a decent job as the flamboyant Aunty Entity. Keep an eye out for other actors in the movie such as Angry Anderson, the late Frank Thring, Bruce Spence who returns as a different character, George Spartels (Play School), and a really young Justine Clarke (also from Play School fame as well as a multitude of Australian shows and movies).I don't know what director George Miller was thinking with Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The end result is very underwhelming which saw the trilogy come to an end with a whimper. Thankfully the Mad Max series was spectacularly resurrected with Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) which saw Tom Hardy take over the coveted role as Max Rockatansky.True action fans and fans of the Mad Max movies should only really consider the first two Mad Max movies as classics, and if they want to consider the fourth movie they can. The third movie was a disappointment.5/10.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
98,rajatdahiyax,The third and the weakest in Mad Max series!!!!!!!,6,15 May 2015,"About 15 years after the events of Mad Max 2, nuclear war has finally destroyed what little was left of civilization. Grizzled and older, former cop Max (Mel Gibson) roams the Australian desert in a camel-drawn vehicle -- until father-and-son thieves Jebediah Sr. (Bruce Spence) and Jr. (Adam Cockburn) use their jury-rigged airplane to steal his possessions and means of transportation. Max soon winds up in Bartertown, a cesspool of post-apocalyptic capitalism powered by methane-rich pig manure and overseen by two competing overlords, Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and Master (Angelo Rossitto), a crafty midget who rides around on the back of his hulking underling, Blaster (Paul Larsson). Seeking to re-equip himself, Max strikes a deal with the haughty Aunty to kill Blaster in ritualized combat inside Thunderdome, a giant jungle gym where Bartertown's conflicts are played out in a postmodern update of blood and circuses. Although Max manages to fell the mighty Blaster, he refuses to kill him after realizing the brute is actually a retarded boy. Aunty's henchmen murder Blaster nonetheless, then punish Max for violating the law that ""Two men enter, one man leaves."" Lashed to the back of a hapless pack animal and sent out into a sandstorm, a near-death Max is rescued by a band of tribal children and teens. The descendants of the victims of an airplane crash, the kids inhabit a lush valley and wait for the day when Captain Walker, the plane's pilot, will return to lead them back to civilization. Some of the children, refusing to believe that Max isn't Walker and that the glorious cities of their mythology no longer exist, set off in search of civilization on their own. Max and three tribe members must then rescue their friends from Bordertown and the clutches of Aunty Entity -- a quest that ends in a lengthy desert chase sequence that echoes the first two Mad Max films.

He is forced to become a gladiator in order for Aunty to gain control of Underworld, a crude methane refinery powered by pig feces, which is run by a dwarf called Master and his giant bodyguard Blaster. He gets dumped in the desert where he is rescued by a band of feral orphans who have been looking for help for years. When several of them take his appearance as a sign and go off into the desert, he follows them back to the town. A lot of people think that the third in George Millers sci-fi series is the weakest, but it remains a hugely entertaining futuristic spectacular, featuring awesome set design and a final chase scene involving car, train, truck, cycle and incredible stunts. Bruce Spence the Gyro Captain from the Road Warrior returns in a different role, Jebediah Sr, who along with his son Jebediah Jr. (Adam Cockburn) uses a jury-rigged airplane to steal from travellers. Angry Anderson from Rose Tattoo plays Ironbar Bassey, head of Bartertown's security and Aunty Entity's Number One Henchman. In his last major role Angelo Rossitto is Master, who is carried around by Blaster in an iron harness strapped above his shoulders.

101,tankace,Peter Pan meets Mad Max (wtf?),7,15 January 2017,"Beyond Thunderdome was the final entry to the original trilogy and it was definitely the weakest of the three for although at first it seems a totally fine continuations of this gasoline fueled apocalypse at the middle point it is combined with a plot about a society which is somewhat reminiscing of Peter Pan's Lost Boys. Even though that change doesn't break the film ,that sudden change in tone was a bit confusing to me and if you think it for more the five minutes, then you find out some quit big plot wholes.To start once again we follow Max (Jesus that dude can't catch a break) years after the events of the Road Warrior as he stumbles to the city of Bartertown, a town in which under to authority of Tina Turner at her prime, has prosper despite the fact that by that point petrol is 100% gone. To be honest the structure of the city is very interesting as also the idea, how would a town be after oil is gone, what could it use for energy, what are the rules of this society. In general if the film had focus in that city and the clash between our beloved anti-hero and the sexy dictator, it would definitely work out.Unfortunately it didn't go that way and though I don;t want spoil the movie, to put it in general after the middle of the film this Lost Boys story-line is added and markedly decease the quality of the final product over all. I have no clue why Miller put that in, but my educated guess is that, the death of the producer Byron Kennedy and his replacement with George Ogilvie, is the main reason for that. For the Mad Max series was practically created by both Miller and Kennedy and the lose of the main-producer surely hampered the production.Nevetheless it is a serviceable film and worth your time, if not for any reason then at list to see a interesting take of a post-apocalyptic society. As for the other plot, well just go with it, you can't do something less for that.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
102,Scars_Remain,An Absurd and Pretty Disappointing Final Chapter,7,11 February 2008,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome but it was a complete let down after the first two movies which were masterpieces in my book. The great thing about the first two was that they didn't try too hard to be amazing but that's a big reason why they were. It seems like the writers of this one tried to make some sort of sweeping epic, but it didn't exactly pan out. This movie is good, but it's no Mad Max or Road Warrior.Mel Gibson does an awesome job as Max, once again and he adds a little bit more depth to the character. I don't care what anyone says, Tina Turner was absolutely awful in her role. Who decided she should be an actress? Other than that, the effects were good and so were a lot of the action sequences, especially the train scene. If you can't make it through the movie, be sure to fast forward to that scene =).On an ending note, I found MMBTD to be a very enjoyable action film with a lot of flaws that doesn't live up to its two previous films.

On the contrary, the majority of those who make up the Bordertown community are as greedy and corrupt as those who led humanity to the nuclear holocaust. Only the arrival of Mad Max and the tribe of lost children will be able to deliver those who suffer in this hell on earth, where only the law of the strongest and the most perverse reigns.The thunder dome scene is full of insights about those who always try to oppress and dishonestly take advantage, as well as what it really means to be ""human"".

104,GeorgeRoots,"Two Go In, One Comes Out.",7,27 May 2015,"""Thunderdome"", doesn't really hold up as well as the previous ""Mad Max"" movies (Topping 1981's ""The Road Warrior"", is a pretty hard feat to accomplish). However upon repeated viewings I rate it as good as the first movie, just because it surprisingly does have a lot to offer the franchise in terms of style and pacing. Unfortunately production began with sadness, as the series producer Byron Kennedy died in a helicopter crash in 1983 whilst location shooting. Director George Miller was somewhat obviously distraught and reluctant to continue, thus leading to the employment of George Ogilvie (Whom Miller worked with prior) as a Co-Director.Set 15 years after the events of ""The Road Warrior"", Max (Mel Gibson) is now navigating the wasteland by a camel-drawn wagon. It is eventually stolen and the trail of the thief leads him to ""Bartertown"", a seedy community ran by the somewhat eccentric Aunt Entity (Tina Turner). As Max soon learns things are not all as they seem, his exploits in the towns gladiatorial arena ""The Thunderdome"" eventually leads to exile, discovery and redemption.Probably the most campiest of the series, and considering everything we've seen so far that is saying something. ""Mad Max 3"" definitely is a lot more kid focused in this outing, but the style is delightfully exaggerated given that the budget (12 million Australian dollars) was the highest the series had seen yet. Unfortunately the car chases have taken a back seat this time around, therefore the other action sequences do a somewhat decent job making up for it. ""The Thunderdome"" itself remains unique and exciting, maybe in the future we too will suspend weaponry on the roof of our cage fights (One can dream). Mel Gibson is still a strong leading man, but Tina Turner's hammy performance steals the show and she easily holds her own as one of the most memorable characters of the series. Sadly series composer Brian May doesn't return this time around, then again is it actually possible to go wrong with Maurice Jarre (The man responsible for the music of ""Eyes Without A Face"", and ""Lawrence Of Arabia"")? Either way the soundtrack does the job, but Tina Turner steals the show blaring out her songs over the opening and closing credits (""We Don't Need Another Hero"" would go on to be one of her biggest hits).Final Verdict: Fans have openly criticised ""Beyond Thunderdome"" for being more obviously ""Hollywood-ized"" then the previous outings, but I think there remains just enough here to not label it as the black sheep of the franchise. Though a light, Peter Pan-esque tone certainly doesn't suit a series originally inspired by car accidents and high speed chases, there is enough here I remember fondly to keep me coming back. Essentially it's like an old episode of TV's Batman (1966), it's rusty but there's a certain charm reflecting back on it. 7/10.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

106,The_Core,Ebert says visionary wonders...,9,6 February 2002,"... and I'm inclined to agree, with a few reservations.  There's a lot of ""good stuff"" in this film, and if it isn't as accessible to the masses as the average action flick, all the better.  I'm partial to the entire ""Mad Max"" series, but ""Beyond Thunderdome"" resembles ""The Matrix"" in that it combines post-apocalyptic sci-fi with action.  It was done somewhat better in the aforementioned film, but here the settings are different, the intent is different and the movie is different.  The apocalyptic feel is greatly emphasized here over the first two films, and this one takes on almost the feel of an epic by the time the final 5 minutes rolls around.The film suffers a bit from slow pacing in parts (anathaema to action fans), and perhaps tries to satisfy too many -- in a sense, it's one of those films that lack a clear ""target audience.""  However, I like this movie enough that I recently bought it on DVD, to experience it again as often as I like. 
And there's a whole heck of a lot to like.  A fine conclusion to one of the greatest action series ever put to film.9/10",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
107,AndreiPavlov,Madly sad movie,10,2 May 2006,"Spoiler: Shall not be writing three different reviews on the three parts of this movie, but will just post all the three identical ones to each title (a rare thing, but this movie deserves it). To me all the three parts are one solid insane movie: ""Mad Max"".It's a downright mad movie. Sad and sick. The landscape makes all the actions look wild and post-apocalyptic (desert, vultures, endless roads, spooky forests, primitive living conditions, vacant beaches, and crazy freaks on wheels). It was one hell of a movie to watch in my earlier years. My reaction to this extravaganza was swift: a table game with the plot line taken out of the third part of the movie was created (one was to complete it by throwing the dices).Now, as quite a lot of time has passed, there is an urge to watch it every year.Thankfully, there was a chance for me to watch this insane trilogy back in 1989 or 1990 all the way through from the first installation to the very last at a local ""videozal"". Some girl had a few words to say before pushing the VHS into the player. She said something like: ""During the movie there will be about 3 minutes of silence somewhere in the middle, don't be surprised. The sound will come to normal after that"". How do you find it? Great commentary before airing a great movie! If it were a run-of-the-mill action, who would care at all about some minutes in the middle of something? But here we all were missing the sound because we soaked up the insane atmosphere of those sick characters' deeds on the screen.How many films, which have strong follow-ups, can be named? Not many, and ""Mad Max"" is definitely among them. It was as revolutionary as ""The Matrix"" but had great parts 2 and 3, too. The first movie does have the Australian soundtrack indeed.And one more thing: if someone calls this film stupid, don't take these words for granted. Among the entertaining, bizarre, mad, and at the same time clever action movies this one is an absolute hydra-king (with three enjoyable incarnations). Don't you see the warning to our human race, which goes in the form of demented ""motorheads""? Don't you feel the doom hanging over people that have no power to resist the evil forces? Don't you see the emptiness of human existence in a high-tech world that is built upon pain and broken lives? Don't you smell the gas of future, ready to blow up?After all these words it is clear as the blue sky of Australia that the mark is 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
108,kurciasbezdalas,All what Mad Max series need is a forth part,10,21 November 2008,"Some people were disappointed by this movie. When I first time saw it I was disappointed too. It was a little different from it's prequels and there were less action. But I think if they would make this movie more similar with The Road Warrior, it wouldn't be that good. Now Mad Max is a trilogy of fall and rise of civilization. In first part civilization just started to fall, in second - civilization has fallen and all the people are living like savages, in third part they begun to reproduce civilization. When I was watching this movie, it felt like I am witnessing historical events. This movie needs another sequel where they would show total re-creation of civilization. As always there were some good action sequences and I think a Thunderdome fighting scene is one of the most original fighting scenes ever filmed. There also was few colorful characters. So it's a great movie and all post-apocalyptic movie fans should enjoy it.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

110,robsta23,3rd Installments are Either Great or S*** - This Was the Latter,3,9 June 2015,"Since the third act is so crucial to stories, you would think that third installments in trilogies should be great, but movies like The Godfather Part III, Spider-man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End disappoint so much. George Miller took the road-action aspect of the first two films - the best part - and threw it out the window in this movie.The end of Mad Max 2 was ambiguous yet still had great closure - a good way the series could have ended instead of moving onto this garbage. As always Max finds himself among a community of people in this post-apocalyptic world, looking for what he needs and nothing more. The people there need his help to rebel against the team of ""master"" and ""blaster."" The title comes from Max and ""Blaster"" fighting to the death in a cage called ""Thunderdome."" Max is extradited from the community (by a wheel of consequences - really??) after not killing Blaster, which was part of a deal he made. He meets up with a different community that happens to have a huge child to adult ratio, almost to a level like the one in ""Hook"" by Spielberg. He is forced to help them since they worship him as if he was a hero they all know and love.Road-action is slightly present in the third act, but it is more ridiculous than in the first two films, so it is not really worth discussing. This film was boring, almost cartoonish, and was a terrible third installment. Third installments are extreme hits or extreme misses, and this was a miss.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
111,coasterdude44,"One of the world's strangest sequels, let alone the strangest Australian film",7,6 April 2020,"I first watched Beyond Thunderdome in 2016, 1 year after Fury Road came out so I knew in terms of action direction and cinematography which would come out on top, the action in this film doesn't even hold a twig of a candle to Fury Road which is now labled as in the top 3 action films of the 2010s aswell as being one of the greatest and most original action films of all time in the terms of the way it was crafted, directed and shot even though it does have what many would say to be a particularly thin story.Thunderdome is definitally the most dialogue heavy and story driven Mad Max of them all despite being the weakest when it comes to the car and road based stunts and action. Thunderdome though arguably has the most memorable lines such as ""Who runs Bartertown?"" ""Master-Blaster"" ""This is Thunderdome, Two men enter, One man leaves""The film's production value is interesting and appealing. Even though Joe's Citadel in Fury Road was a very memorable, well realised and crafted location, it did rely on a heavy use of CGI and wasn't all that varied in it's structure with only brief moments shot inside.In Thunderdome however there is a complete wasteland town called Bartertown filled with loads of extras playing some very colourful human characters. The town itself is based on Primitive Technology (see what I did there :) aswell as many crafted works and ornaments as George likes to say ""Just because it's the wasteland doesn't mean they still can't make beautiful things""There are some good pop culture refrences in it with visual references to WB cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Tina Turner plays a major character as the leader of Bartertown and even has her own song during the credits which is a great song by the way.The biggest issue with this film however is the pacing, this movie really drags in certain parts and does have some pretty boring pockets in it where nothing really much happens. The whole act with Max venturing out and coming across the village of children is a part that drags on for too long and find myself sometimes skipping. The scene itself with the imaginary movie screen and the kids reenacting though is creative and is another great example of Miller's powerful visual imagination. I mean come one, the guy made Fury Road in his 60sAnyway this is one of the strangest movie sequels but it's unique and I applaud it for that. It's nothing like the first two but it doesn't need to be. I think a lot of Fury Road fans hate on this movie because it is so unlike that movie and hasn't aged very well. It is definitely a product of it's time with 80s nostalgia dripping all over it, and yes it is slow with a pretty anticlimactic final chase sequence in which The Road Warrior's ending chase sequence was far superior, definitely with the improvised motorbike launch shot which was a complete accident.It is still at the bottom of my Mad Max movie list with the original at #3 Mad Max 2 TWW at #2 and Fury Road at #1 but this movie is not crap as many reviewers will lead you to believe, it worth watching at least once where you can form your own opinion of it",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
112,thekyles99,Not a bad sequel however not my fave,5,2 January 2013,"Although not being my fave of the series this edition to the tale is still effective. Set once again in the beautiful backdrop of Australia, director Miller once again sets out to continue the tale of lonely hero Max Rockatansky. I guess i was originally p'eed off due to the fact that this film (I guess much due to the fact that it was more popular within the States) was too Americanized. The original two films were not and aside from Mel Gibson (Max) and Bruce Spence the rest of the cast were virtually unknowns and to me that is why they are so great. This time 'round director Miller decided to cast a big name to go side by side with Gibson (Who at the time was just starting to rocket to super stardom) and that was super '80's pop diva Tina Turner as chief antagonist Aunty Entity.Although Turner does show us some acting chops which in turn shows off how multi talented she is..this movie falls short of what the original two provided and goes in a new direction, a more western film culture then staying Auzzy something i believe was a mistake. We still get a thrilling car chase (Which is the whole reason i was drawn to this series in the beginning) not bad storyline..the movie just in my opinion falls short somewhere.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

What do you expect for a PG-13 movie sequel coming from two original rated R movies to be like. Less stuff from the other two movies. Just making it into a more wide range of people to see does not make it better than the first two. I am sorry, for the Tina Turner fans. I really was turned off by having her in it. There were only a few good songs from her I liked. Not enough to make me love this movie over the first two better than this. It is like as an analogy of Robocop. First two were best and then here comes Robocop 3 PG-13. BOOOOM, crap movies sequels, just like what happened to this movie. That is why this movie rating has gone lower, and you people can't see it. What they should do to this movie like lately done to PG-13 is make it unrated with it like rated R content, and it would be better than what it is now. PG-13 is just boring now a days with any movie that is action, sci-fi, thriller, horror. It takes it from normal to kids kind of movie.I will watch the first two of this series and stay with them.

I have to say I thought the first 45 minutes of the movie played as a great sequel to Road Warrior, but the movie gets to its climax waayy too soon, which is the Thunderdome sequence. After that the movie gets out of hand and borrows elements from better stories like Peter Pan and Return of the jedi and the last sequence in the movie is basically the same as Road Warrior, only they use a train this time around... Also, the first 2 Mad Max were gritty and violent and this one just feels a lot like it was made for kids somehow. So yeah the movie kinda sucks a lot of ass.

Mel Gibson puts out a fine performance as Max and although no particular cast member stands out (least of all Tina Turner) the ensemble tends to complement and work with the story.

117,caseynicholson,An Odd Blockbuster,7,21 May 2015,"I just finished watching ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"", the third in the ""Mad Max"" series and the final of the Mel Gibson era before ""Fury Road"", which is in theaters now. I've now watched all three of the Gibson movies, and as such this review will be both a reflection on ""Beyond Thunderdome"", but also a review of the trilogy.""Beyond Thunderdome"" is by far the most polished of Gibson trilogy in terms of visual appeal. The first movie, made in 1979, is grainy and has an ""old movie"" feel to it. ""Road Warrior"" was a major step forward in terms of picture and production quality, but ""Thunderdome"" is certainly the best of the three in this category. I think that was the result of both a larger budget for the film and the many advances made in filmmaking in the early 1980's. This movie shines in a way that its predecessors do not, and its setting is more intricate than either of the two.It's mainly for that reason that I've given ""Beyond Thunderdome"" the same rating that I gave its predecessors--7 stars each. Each of the three films have their good and bad qualities. The original film was a well developed story that centered around Gibson's character and thoroughly told his origin story in a way that felt akin to a Clint Eastwood movie. The picture was low budget, but well done. ""Road Warrior"" featured a story that was not quite as strong as the original, but it also was a significant leap forward in the overall production department, and its unending action made it fun. so I found it worthy of a seven as well despite the fact that I didn't like the story or its ""Indiana Jones"" type of feel quite as much as the original.With ""Beyond Thunderdome"" we find a movie that, as mentioned above, is extremely well made, and yet it is a further devolution from the quality script of the original ""Mad Max"", and indeed is a descent even from ""Road Warrior"" in the story department. Like ""Road Warrior"", ""Thunderdome"" features a narrative that is less about its main character and more about telling a story of the apocalyptic Australian outback that we first saw a glimpse of in the first movie in the series. This latest chapter in the series is a bit odd in terms of how the story plays out--half way through the movie we are introduced to a completely new batch of characters who had absolutely nothing to do with the first half of the movie at all, but fortunately it does eventually come around full circle into a consistent narrative. It's certainly not the best story ever put into a movie, which is a pity given the amount of time and effort that went into making this very well made film. But the story is strong enough-- with the film's redeeming picture quality and introductory act--to deserve to be ranked similarly with its predecessors.In trying to estimate the entire Gibson trilogy, I would have to say that ""Mad Max"" isn't my favorite franchise, by far. I think that the major issue that I have with the series is that the tone shifted dramatically from the original movie to ""Thunderdome"". As noted, the first Mad Max was a well developed movie that told the origin of a vigilante antihero--a cop who lost everything to roving gangs in a dystopian future, and then went ""mad"" by seeking out vengeance outside the parameters of the law. That story, despite the flaws of the first film, was a compelling narrative that made me care about Max as a character.With ""Road Warrior"", Max's persona was certainly on display, but the situation he found himself in was one that had no real connection to him as his own character. With ""Thunderdome"", Max's tough guy persona and antihero character are downplayed altogether, as the gist of the movie becomes less of an Eastwood clone and more of a kid friendly ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Rocky"" type of feel. Couple that with a weaker story altogether and the biggest problem with the entire franchise (not having seen ""Fury Road"" just yet, mind you) is that the series became something very different from what made the first ""Mad Max"" such a brilliant film.That having been said, though, as I was watching ""Thunderdome"", the thought occurred to me that perhaps I've been evaluating the trilogy the wrong way this whole time. Perhaps the genius of the series is not that they follow Max's character, which is what I liked so much about the first movie, but rather that the whole franchise is actually not really supposed to be about Max at all, but rather about further introducing us to the post apocalyptic world of the series' setting. If I step back and see that dystopian world as the main star of all three films, then I can see how the three films fit together nicely. As such, maybe the franchise would have been better served to have been titled not after its protagonist from the first movie, but rather to have a generic name for the post-nuclear Aussie outback. Indeed, a name like ""The Outback"", or ""Wasteland"" would have strung the three movies together in a much better way than having them tie together through Max's character.All that said, if I see ""Beyond Thunderdome"" as a movie in which Mel Gibson isn't really the star so much as is the weird world in which his Max character lives, then I can deal with ""Thunderdome"" and its plot a bit easier. Whatever the case, this isn't an epic that deserves grand applause, but its nevertheless a relatively watchable B-grade movie that advances the scope of the franchise.Now on to go see ""Fury Road"" this weekend!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

119,cashbacher,Memorable supporting characters that do more than that,10,3 November 2019,"In general, the third film in a sequence tends to be underwhelming compared to the first two. That is not the case here, Tina Turner stars as Aunty Entity and turns in a superb performance as the protagonist to Max. Unlike in the first two movies, Aunty Entity is not a brutal, evil person, in her own way she is a savior of humanity and civilization. She has created a civilization out of the ruins of an apocalyptic war, giving the people hope for a future. Aunty Entity has given the world the rule of law once again, brutal though it may be.
Max is once again a vagabond loner where circumstances give him no choice but to act as an agent of Aunty's bidding. The ultimate in surviving, Max joins forces with a group of children that survived the crash of a 747 and are living in an oasis in the middle of a vast and nearly impenetrable desert.
The chase scene is once again an incredible thing, this time there is some humor amidst the fighting to the death. In this case it involves a train to nowhere, where the day is saved by a man and his son with a plane. Max proves that he is very much a hero, risking his life to save a group of children.
As was the case in ""Road Warrior,"" the supporting characters in this movie do much more than that. They provide tension, light moments and do more than is usual in making this movie the entertaining powerhouse that it is. There is Robert Grubb as ""Pigkiller,"" a man given a life sentence for killing a pig for food, Frank Thring as the ""Collector"" the front man for Bartertown, he is the one that decides what goods are worth and who gets to enter the town to conduct their business. Bruce Spence as ""Jedediah the Pilot,"" a role similar to the one he had in ""Road Warrior."" Angry Anderson as ""Ironbar,"" one of the commanders of the troops controlled by Aunty and perhaps the best was Angelo Rossitto as ""Master,"" the genius that designed and managed the infrastructure of Bartertown.
This is an entertaining and thoughtful movie, pointing out one unfortunate fact about the behavior of humans. Even after being nearly wiped out, there will still be struggles for power and control over what meager structures are rebuilt after the destruction. The action and character interactions are exceptional.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

The early demise of their buddy, kind of depressed both director George Miller, that asked for his friend, George Ogilvie to co-direct the movie with him, and the star Mel Gibson, who started on booze during principal photography, even if the huge success of this film, was his passport to mainstream lead actor status in America, after a string of more 'artsy' oriented films such as ""Mrs.Soffel"", ""The River"" and ""The Bounty"" (all released in '84).""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", departed from the car chase action / revenge flicks from the previous entries, entering in the realms of the fantasy / adventure 'genres' on the footsteps of the new found success after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ('81) and its sequel, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" ('84) and the ""Conan"" ('82 / '84) films.The script once again penned by Miller himself, with the collaboration of Terry Hayes, pays homage to the Lost Boys from Peter Pan's story and the 1980 post-apocalyptic novel by Russell Hoban, ""Riddley Walker"", which sets the action a few years after the events of ""The Road Warrior"" ('81) in a more barbaric world, or at least more visually showed due it's larger budget, where our hero, 'Mad' Max Rockatansky is wandering through the Wasteland in a camel-drawn V8 wagon, after the destruction of his supercharger V8 - Interceptor in the previous entry.
After he was robbed, Max goes to Bartertown, a community established in the middle of the desert, and makes a deal with the founder and ruler, the relentless Aunty Entity, to kill a man in the 'Thunderdome"", an arena where the conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death according to Bartertown law, in exchange of her resupply his vehicle and equipment, but once again things will not go as Max expected...""Max Max Beyond Thunderdome"", works as a fantasy tale in an outlandish world and is more lighthearted in tone than its predecessors, Max have much more lines and his humanity increased, and the movie's appeal was aimed at a larger audience, being less crude, sadistic and violent, which infuriated some of the die hard ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"" fans, but gained several other enthusiasts in the proccess.It's true that the movie suffers from an uneven pace, especially in the 2nd Act where it becames too slow, when Max is approached by the lost tribe of kids as a somekind of 'religious' figure and the movie starts to drag on, but Miller compensates it, creating the fabulous final car chase, which is equally excellent as ""The Road Warrior"", very well staged and filmed, featuring daring stuntmen and peculiar & effective camera angles once again photographed by Dean Semler.Talking about the cinematography, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", presents beautiful composed shots of the Wasteland, in the vein of such desert classics as David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" ('62); Sergio Leone's ""One Upon a Time in the West"" ('68) and even Steven Spielberg's aforementioned, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ('81), and in terms of photographed backgrounds and the use of scenarios, props, wardrobe, and the hundreds of extras that gave life to Bartertown, it's the most visually accomplished ""Mad Max"" film.About the performances, Mel Gibson plays Max Rockatansky in a lighter tone, and even if he stills cynical and a kind of a laconic character, he's way more talkative here than in ""The Road Warrior"" and his witty & provocative humour in the dialogue delivering, created the 'Mel Gibson persona' on-screen that would be full explored in his future Martin Riggs' of the four ""Lethal Weapon"" ('87, '89, '92, '98) films; ""Bird on a Wire"" ('90); ""Air America"" ('90) or ""Maverick"" ('94), among lots of others.Rock 'n' Roll Goddess, Tina Turner, in her screen debut, co-stars as Auntie Entity, in an outstanding, sharp and commanding performance as Max's nemesis, proving that she can act much better than several singers-turned-actors and she could have handled more film roles.The supporting cast is full of vivid, eccentric and colorful characters as much as weird as the actors playing them, including the frontman of the Hard Rock Aussie band, Rose Tattoo, Mr. 'Angry' Anderson as Ironbar, Auntie Entity's henchman; the veteran character actor from ""The Vikings"" ('58) and ""Ben-Hur"" ('59), Frank Thring as The Collector; dwarf actor from the controversial cult classic film, Tod Browning's ""Freaks"" ('32), Angelo Rossitto as The Master; the returned Bruce Spence, this time not playing the Gyro Captain, but a similar character named Jedediah the Pilot; Helen Buday, as Savannah Nix, the leader of the tribe and a potential Max's love interest that was discarded from the film, and an eerie looking Edwin Hodgeman, playing Dr. Dealgood, the Thunderdome's Master of Ceremonies.Fueled by a great orchestration by Maurice Jarre, replacing Brian May from the first two installments, and two catchy power pop / hard rock tunes sang by Tina Turner: ""One of the Living"", presented in the opening titles, and the Golden Globe nominee, ""We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)"" in the final credits, ""Max Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is a great piece of escapism that deserves to be ranked higher, especially nowadays after the release of the over-hyped, the CGI borefest and soulless flick, called ""Mad Max - Fury Road"", in which ""Thunderdome"" is clearly, and without question, the superior film.Concluding, my only complaints about ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", besides the slower middle-part, is it lacks the novelty, the edgy, the spontaneity and the crudeness of the first two films, and the villains are less memorable (not counting Tina as a villain, she's more an anti-heroine, like Max himself), but i still give it a 9.5 / 10.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
121,KatMiss,BEST IN THE SERIES,10,6 May 2001,"After giving us, respectively, a rich character study, and a kinetic action picture in ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"", director George Miller stops and creates one of the most visionary and creative worlds I've ever seen in films. But ""Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome"" is the best of the series, in my opinion, because it manages to negotiate the elements that made the first two such great films with this new element.Mel Gibson is back as Max and he gives his best performance as this character here. He convincingly keeps developing his now well-worn but still welcome persona that we know so well. Tina Turner is a pleasant surprise. In an era in which most singers who try to act fail miserably, she succeeds in a difficult role.Mostly, the film is wall to wall action and Thunderdome is the locale that Miller supplies us with this time. Here, with an even bigger budget than the first two combined, he gives us some of the biggest and best action sequences ever.I don't want to talk too much about this film because part of the joy is experiencing it. It's happening to us as we watch it. And I wouldn't want it any other way.Sadly, Warners has yet to issue a widescreen version of this on tape. While the first two are easy to find, it's hard to find a copy of this even in full frame. Meanwhile, lesser films are easy to find.

After that, the movie drifts and drifts badly.Now that I am older, I get how the movie was trying to show a different side to this grim futuristic vision and also how it was playing off the then populist fear of nuclear war. That makes this film feel like a preachy mess of a movie and that always turns me off. That ruined Superman IV too though it didn't help with fearmongers desperately trying to make people feel such a war was inevitable in those days.

On a funny note, Bruce looks like drummer Stuart Copeland from the musical group ""The Police"" in this film to me.And one final note, and I'm surprised no one saw this....was that one character from the 1st film, came back in a surprising fashion! I'm talking about the character of ""Benno"" Aunt May's mentally challenged protector from Mad Max 1! (in the 1st film he was played by actor Max Fairchild) I at least realized it right away when Max beats ""Blaster"" and knocks off his helmet, we see the face of a mentally challenged man-child. When Max looks at him and realizes this Benno from the 1st film, he can't bring himself to kill him. Even Benno/Blaster recognizes Max now and even smiles at him like he did in the 1st film and the music cue from the 1st film comes on for a brief seconds. That was like a bittersweet moment for me. It was a shame that Auntie's goon Ironbar kills Benno/Blaster and it ended the the brief reunion Max and memories he may have had at the moment.Everyone else the cast was good. Little Adam Cockburn as Jedediah Jr. was hilarious. Reminded me a lot of a similar little guy with a loud and dirty mouth. The one I'm talking about is from the original ""Bad News Bears"" with Walter Matthau. Tina Turner did a good turn as evil Auntie. Her sidekicks Frank Thring as The Collector and Angry Anderson as Ironbar and George Spartels as Blackfinger were memorable. Robert Grubb as Pig Killer was amusing. Especially the scene where Max opens the door with arrow stuck in Grubb's leg! Priceless. Edwin Hodgeman as Dr. Dealgood was right on as he portrayed him as a evil, slimy and devilish game-host way. And last but certainly not least was Helen Buday as Savannah Nix the leader of the Lost Children's Clan. And her 2nd in command Tom Jennings as Slack. Tom reminded me of Blue Lagoon's Christopher Atkins character, Richard. Almost looked the same in appearance.So all in all if you watched the 1st two films , then might as well watched this 3rd one. Not as good but not bad either.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

After watching all 3 films back to back recently, I still feel this is the worst of the trilogy. It seems to be 2 different films stuck together, and while that can sometimes work (from dusk till dawn), here it doesn't, due to the latter half being vastly inferior to the first. By the end it seems to be running out of ideas, being an almost carbon copy of the final action scene from the second film, but less good.

125,CherryBlossomBoy,♫ We don't need another Mad Max ♫,1,6 June 2015,"Without wheels Max ain't much. It's hard to be mad when you're on foot, ain't it? Frustrated, maybe. Tired, surely. Mad? Nope. Say what you want about other installments (I'll say that only the first one is really good, others merely passable), but they all had those precious wild car chases. That's what the audience loves about Mad Max and that's what everybody remembers.So, in this third installment Max is deprived of his beloved vehicle and, consequently, his road rage. To stay in keeping with the title, they gave him a mad hairdo. Granted, you'd have to be mad to want to look like Tina Turner, so I guess it's legit. They also cast that very lady in the role of villain. Mad, isn't it? But wouldn't you believe it - at that particular point in history she was bigger than Mel Gibson. Somebody thought this combination would be bankable. However, there's too much Tina Turner in Aunty Entity (!) to fool you into buying into her character and she quite grabs the attention away from the titular character and the plot. Maybe it's for the better because Max didn't look like having much to do other than getting beaten up and saving some hippie kids, and there was barely a plot to speak of.The end result, expectedly, looks like an extended Tina Turner video. She doesn't sing in it, but she looks like she might. I wouldn't mind her doing a duet with Mel, because that at least would've been something to remember out of this all.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
126,midas-jacobs,"""Dying time is here!""",5,15 November 2015,"Max' vehicle is stolen by pilot Jerediah and his son. Max then goes to the post-apocalyptic town called Bartertown. This town is ruled by Aunty Entity. To get his car back he has to do some shady stuff. But then he finds himself fighting against Master Blaster in the so called ""Thunderdome"". Well actually he only fights Blaster, because Master Blaster exists out of a tiny man and a muscular giant man. This was the first part of the movie. you can see the movie as two separate movies, and if I am going to tell the epitome of the second ""movie"" I am afraid I am going to spoil some things.George Miller came back as the director of this movie, he also did ""Mad Max"" (a good movie), ""Mad Max: Road Warrior"" (even better) and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (the best movie of 2015 till now). In this Mad Max movie he did a good job at directing it, I just don't get why he made it feel like there were two different movies. If the fleshed out the first part of the movie more, this would have been an amazingly good movie, but they didn't. The cinematography was very well done, the camera flows were nice, and there were some pretty aerial shots. Sometimes, mostly in Bartertown, there were long shots, with just a couple of edits, but with these shots they showed really good how the post-apocalyptic town looks like.Due to these shots they made the town more interesting. With these aerial shots they also showed well how deserted the wasteland looks. The clothing design was like in the previous movies, a bit on the cheap hand. But I liked that they kept the clothing style of the second movie. like the rugby sholderpats and the mohawk. The wig of Max looked really fake, which was a big minus for me. The music was good too, it felt Mad Maxy, and fitted well with the post-apocalyptic ethos. This movie stars Mel Gibson, Tina Turner and a lot of lesser known actors. Mel Gibson repraised his role as Max Rockatansky. He was just as good as in the previous movies, although I like Tom Hardy better as Max. Mels Mad Max still had some charisma of the previous films, which was nice. Tina Turner was OK, she was better then I expected, you don't get a lot of good performances of singers. Even though Adam Levigne was pretty good in ""Begin Again"". Turner played Enity. She was in control of Bartertown. You also had the Master and the Blaster. Angelo Rossitto played the Master. He is a tiny guy. I didn't like him at all. He was too childish, just near the end of the movie I started to like him more. He felt like a comic relief. Or as someone who has to lure in more kids to the theater. The Blaster is played by Paul Larsson. Max had to fight him in the Thunderdome. This scene was probably my favorite scene of the movie. It was very creative, and nicely filmed. In the thunderdome the opponents are tied up to two elastic cords. on the roof of the arena there are weapons, and the two opponents have to get a weapon and then kill each other. In this scene Max gets his hands on a chainsaw. This was the perfect opportunity to have a blood fest. But because the movie is rated pg13 it isn't. And it is so stupid that it is rated pg 13. The script of the first part of the movie was well written but the script of the second part, was just plain boring. it was dull and unnecessary. it was just ridicule at times. The story of the first part was good, but it already ends after the first hour after that you don't hear anything anymore about the thunderdome, nothing at all!there were also some clichés in the movie but the thing that bothered me was that they tried to recreate the chase scene from the first movie, but with the truck being a train. the fighting in this last scene is just to comical. I mean, come on, they hit someone with a pan... Overall this is the worst Mad Max film that there is. The first part was really good and gets a nine out of then from me, but the second part just ruined everything for me, and this part gets a one out of then which is a ten out of twenty which makes it a 5/10. This movie is very interesting at the beginning, but ends as a boring mess.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
127,mmuggi,A half-hearted affair,3,2 August 2020,"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is the third installation in the Mad Max series. A series that was previously a post-apocalyptic action series, but which with this installation became so involuntarily comic.Mel Gibson (Mad Max) did what he could and was doing well. It was Helen Buday (Savannah Mix) too. Helen never really started her career, and has not broken through yet. Tina Turner (Aunty Entity) was not performing well in this film and one did not understand her motives. This is especially true after the crucial chase scene, which ended with her not getting hold of the dwarf. How did she react to that? By letting Max live, and leaving the place in a good mood ??? What's the point? We also never get the understanding of why Max helps the tribe? Usually he helps when he gets something in return, but this time he does it completely voluntarily.The Gyro Captain is back, or .. Bruce Spencer, who played him is back, in a new role, but with exactly the same character traits. Could one have utilized it better? I think so.The film also ends just as the brilliant two did, with Max once again alone. It could well have tried a different ending.The film's director and franchise manager gave up the film a bit after his childhood friend died, which is why this film is also dedicated to said friend. Unfortunately, it goes so far beyond the film that it becomes a half-hearted, involuntary comic affair.-Max is robbed by Jedediah
-Max seeks out a place to shop. Here Max makes an agreement with the trader to be allowed to enter, in return for 24 hours of his time.
-Max must kill the muscles so that Aunty Entity can make the dwarf do as she pleases.
-Max can not kill the retarded dwarf in the Thunderdome, which is why he is sent to the Gulag, by being put on a horse and sent off into the open, without any action from the Aunty Entity.
-Max is rescued by a tribe who thinks he's Captain Walker. He is not, but half still believe in their ideology, and set off to have it confirmed.
-Max chooses to stop that half to help the other half of the tribe.

128,shawnmikedryer,Max is back,8,2 May 2021,"Bardertown, the most advanced town these post-apocalyptic lands have ever known since the fall of man. The Road Warrior Max Rockatansky stumbles upon this civilization after his vehicle and all his supplies are ransacked and stolen. In order to retrieve his things the ruler of Bardertown Queen Aunty Entity offers Max a deal, enter The Thunderdome and face off against the brutal Master Blaster. This symbiotic being that has become obsessed with it's power is who the Queen secretly wants exterminated. After an issue arises in the arena during the brutal battle, Max finds himself once again banished to the barren landscape. Eventually Max discovers the safe haven of a lost tribe of children only grasping at survival. Max agrees to help the tribe to refuge but only after he returns to Bardertown to settle a score with the tyrannical Queen Aunty Entity.Although this film may have strayed away from the brutality the first films are known for, Beyond Thunderdome is transferred into a campy film but a fun one at that. In my opinion the best parts of the film are in the beginning and the end, parts more reminiscent of what made the series a hit, the middle chunk may be lost on some viewers but succeeds on making its own path. For Mad Max fans this is just what we needed, in the past George Miller had succeeded each prior film but this is probably the weakest of the bunch, but clearly on the high end of ""weak"". For a being on the weaker side of plots Mel still proved to be a force to be reckoned with in this anyway you look at it.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Helen Buday does a great job as Savannah Nix, and she's probably the best character in the whole movie. Very likable.Though the film itself is too childish and fits very badly into the Mad Max-movies. The violence isn't there, the plot (?) is just messed up and the cool car-stunts and car-scenes are missing.What started out with possibly the best action movie ever made (MAD MAX, 1979) and got a sequel with the best post-nuke movie ever made (MAD MAX 2, 1981) got totally lost in this third installment, Beyond Thunderdome.Tina's hit We don't need another hero is a great song. Too bad they didn't use her tracks throughout the whole film, because the music totally sucks! That is probably the worst thing of the whole film.Well, it's not a total waste of time though.

130,jiangliqings,An entertaining and enjoyable action/adventure.,10,9 March 2001,"*** out of ****Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is the sequel to The Road Warrior, which remains one of the most energetic and exciting action films to date.  For this film to live up to it would be hard, but credit truly has to be given to directors George Miller and George Ogilvie for trying something quite different.  Instead of non-stop, no-holds barred action, they give us an enjoyable adventure tale with touches of exciting action and genuinely funny humor.The film begins in the deserts of Australia, with Max (Mel Gibson) being attacked and robbed, and his supplies and belongings are all stolen.  He manages to make his way to a place called Bartertown, for he has tracked down his missing things.  In order to get in, he makes a deal, which leads to a meeting with Aunty Entity (Tina Turner).  This, in turn, builds up to another deal in which Max promises Aunty he'll take on a giant in a one-on-one fight in Thunderdome, and in return will get whatever supplies he needs.Not everything goes exactly as planned, and Max is banished.  He's eventually saved by a large group of children in the desert, who have been stranded in the area because of an airplane crash not long after the devestating world-ending war occurred.  Max then comes with a plan to help these children and hold back a wrathful Aunty Entity at the same time.Working with a much larger budget than the previous films, Miller and Ogilvie have crafted an entertaining motion picture.  First of all, one reason it's so successful is the look.  The money was wisely spent on visuals, and there are an abundance of breathtaking shots. (moderate spoiler in this upcoming sentence)  The sight of a wide expanse of desert, a large airliner covered by sand, and the ruins of Sidney are definitely some of the most stunning scenery featured in the series.It's not just the look of the film that's improved over the previous installments but also the far more in-depth look at post-apocalyptic societies.  The directors this time are obviously fascinated by the possiblities and the sort of towns that can be created after devastating world events.  Beyond Thunderdome works quite well on that level and is worth watching alone for this.Beyond Thunderdome has a lot of adventure in it, and as a result, it should please fans of the genre.  There's hardly a truly dull moment, a there is always an interesting plot development, stunning sights, or some exciting action scenes to pick up the pace.  Speaking of action, that is exactly what the series is famous for and Beyond Thunderdome doesn't disappoint.The film does not have as much intensity as The Road Warrior, but it does feature one truly inventive fight sequence that's sure to have viewers on the edge of their seat.  It's the Thunderdome battle itself, featuring a one-on-one showdown that involves bungee cords, weapons littered all over the arena, and Gibson taking on a gargantuan villain all by his lonesome. Of course, we can't forget about car chases.  Beyond Thunderdome concludes with one, and while it's not as heart-poundingly suspenseful and exciting as the brilliant final chase of its predecessor, this is still a very fun and enjoyable action scene.  George Miller proves he still has his flair for action.The performances are all actually quite good.  Mel Gibson is terrific as ever as Max, and his character's development is brought to a full spectrum by the end of the film.  Mad Max is without a doubt the most intriguing anti-hero around and the character's development is a partial (but certainly very important) reason to the film's success and enjoyability.  Tina Turner is surprisingly decent as the film's villain, and she does a credible job with the role.  Helen Buday is also good as Savannah, one of the leaders of the tribe of the children.  I haven't seen in her another film since, which is a shame because she showed a good deal of talent.  The only other standout is probably Angry Anderson, whose character Ironbar is truly hilarious.  He doesn't rely on much dialogue, but gets the point across with physical humor.Also worthy of note is Maurice Jarre's score, which often creates excitment and a sense of wonder and tension.  It's considerably different than Brian May's pulse-pounding brilliant score for The Road Warrior, but Jarre's is more than a suitable change, and the result is very pleasant on the ears.I've noticed a lot of expression of disappointment with Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.  True, it doesn't maintain the same tone and mood of its predecessors, but that's part of the film's success.  It tries new things and it mostly works.  For an adventure film Beyond Thunderdome still holds its own and more.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Where Mad Max dealt with Max losing his sanity in the face of insanity, and The Road Warrior reflected that he was a survivor, Beyond Thunderdome still had the western flavor of the other two movies, but it kind of slow moving.  This time, Max comes across a makeshift city in the middle of the desert called Bartertown. He meets it's ruler, played by the incomparable Tina Turner. To get his car back, he must kill Tina's rival. While in Thunderdome, he sees his foe eye to eye, and finds out he doesn't have the heart to finish him off. So he is banished to the wasteland, where he is found by a tribe of children who see him as their savior. When some of the kids wander out into the wastland, Max has to rescue them, and return to Bartertown, and the classic Mad Max chase begins!  I remember reading the press at the time, George Miller wanted give Max back his humanity. George saw children as our future, and as corny as that sounds, he's right on that one.

And for once, I agreed with him. He was notoriously impossible to please but he did have good taste in films. The ""Mad Max"" trilogy recounts aftermath of WWIII. Some people are confused, watching the first movie they wonder why there are still cities and towns, and things still look pretty much normal... at first! Well, when World War III happens, nuclear strikes of major megatonnage will be precisely located. Whoever will still be strong enough when the dust settles, will not want the ""breadbasket"" areas of the Earth to be destroyed. Most likely a few major cities of Austraila will be nuked. The real danger is from the resulting fallout and the breakdown in the food chain. More people will die from radiation and starvation then they will from an actual nuclear strike (I think!). The first movie probably takes place close to a few months within a year after World War III. The Road Warrior most likely within 10 years after the first film, and the third film possibly another 10 years. So the trilogy spans the first 20-25 years after World War III. So making an action film in the nuclear wastelands seems simple enough, but what the filmmakers did was use the basic archetypes of mythological characters to make the story resonate with the audience. The Mel Gibson character for example, represents the sort of stranger with no name that Clint Eastwood used effectively, as well as the role of the ""Shane"" like savior who comes to rescue the weaker and defenseless. Cinematography, visual and special effects, and sound effects got better and better with each film. I think most people would be inclined to agree the third film is a pretty good film but probably not something for 5 year olds to watch. The ending to ""Beyond Thunderdome"" is one of the most memorable movie endings ever.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

138,NutzieFagin,"Get Ready for the ""Pocky Clipse""",7,23 December 2012,"When I viewed Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the first time, I really didn't understand it that well or get into the whole plot of the movie. But don't give up on this movie after watching it! Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is one of those movies that gets under your skin enough to become one of those cult flicks where you have to watch it again and again.OK! Let's make a quick review of the past Mad Max films. Mad Max dealt with a cop who while fighting crime against a gang, the head gang member kills his friends, and wife and child. Max who aches for vengeance becomes Mad Max and kills all the gang members while still driving away in a rage. The Road Warrior is a film that was made during the Energy Crisis with a simple plot of a post apocalyptic world fighting over a gas tanker. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome has Mad Max fighting again for his property but this time he is embroiled in a plot with a tough female who is the lawgiver and leader of a motley and corrupt town called ""Barter Town."" It is seen that even though society has some order after a the Apocalypse, it has slid into a more unmoral, survival of the fittest type society--dog eat dog world. After Max realizes and is disgusted by this new social structure, he is entered into another plot where some cast off children, presumably survivors of a plane crash after the nuclear war, are searching in vain to find ""the promised land"" called Tomorrow Morrow land. Will they reach their destination? Will Max come to their aide? And how will they find it in this cruel jungle world where there is not much compassion? I think this is where the movie drives it's point about how people will live and react after a nuclear attack where they become more animal than human.---The ending of the film sadly demonstrates this with showing the scenes of past devastation. But it also gives out a lot of hope that we can change our destinies even after the War has past---that is, if we even survive....The acting is not bad. Mel Gibson as Max gives out a silent brooding ""High Plains Drifter"" like performance. Tina Turner is MOST impressive as Auntie Entity, the ruler of Barter Town. Even though she may look uncomfortable wearing a steel cage life dress, she gives off a sexy persona as a villon-ness. Why she never played a Bond girl in the James Bond movies, I'll never know. The stunts are good but somewhat cartoon-nish--but they are enjoyable to watch.So see the film---if you survive the gritty unfriendly reality of a post war world---It may give you a warning to try to save it.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
139,rams_lakers,We don't need another Mad Max,4,3 October 2009,"Mad Max rode off into the sunset at the end of The Road Warrior (a timeless classic), but someone wanted to make more money by putting forth little effort, so alas, Beyond Thunderdumb was born.I did not rush out to see this when it first came out in 1985. I had loved the Road Warrior and was curious about the 3rd installment. I looked at some movie magazine photos of it and wasn't the least bit impressed. My thoughts were' ""Who's this bald goof with the kabuki head sticking out of his skull? Is this the style in the future?"" and ""Tina Turner? What's love got to do with it?"" Wez and the Lord Humongous were killed off in the 2nd movie, and this was the best they could do? If I were to make a quick assessment of this whole mess, I'd call it a cross between Peter Pan and Lord of the Flies. Adding children into the mix and toning down the violence was a bad idea. The gyro kid's scenes looked terribly rehearsed, with disastrous results. I liked the premise of one feral child with a blade-boomerang, not 50 dirty-faced young punks with mushroom heads.On the filming/editing itself, the first two Mad Max films featured a few rolling closeup scenes, placed strategically to add suspense as they zoom into a character's expression. The character then says an important line as he is looking straight into the camera. In Beyond Thunderdumb, we get a very noticeable overuse of these zooming closeups - which degrade any attempt for a suspenseful shot. Since there are so many of these zooms happening it loses the shock value and becomes comical. The line that the actor spits out as the camera stops zooming and the music comes to a halt really isn't so important, either.I finally got around to watching this in it's entirety (the other day)and I gave it 4 stars for the Master Blaster/Bartertown scenes at the beginning, which was bearable to watch and had an interesting post-apocalyptic theme like the first two Mad Max films. It goes downhill in the second half of the film, after Max is sent riding away wearing a giant clown head.The mandatory (and refurbished) chase scene is also comical. Max boards a train and goes churning across a track with the enemy following. The kabuki head guy keeps up with him by savagely pumping one of those push-pull levered contraptions. At the end, after furiously chasing him for miles, Tina looks at Max and laughs. Her kabuki head cohort had just been killed after crashing the car he jumped in (hmmm...a retread ending here), and she blows it off with no explanation and drives away. Why the sudden change of heart from Tina? Max is left standing alone again. Bad writing, bad acting, and one Mad Max too many.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

He must fight this guy in the ""Thunderdome"", and that's all I'm gonna tell you. But rest assured, the movie doesn't go downhill. It gets better. There's as much to like and dislike about this movie just as much as the other ""Mad Max"" movies, but I guess everyone didn't see it that way.

Nothing disappoints in its first half, because we see the universe Mad Max, wild and cruel with Max fighting to death which gladiatorial fight against the giant destroyer, which is victorious, but causing his exile to the eternal desert, in what is practically a death sentence.And it is here, right here where, unfortunately, everything goes wrong. The rescue of Gibson by that tribe of children sweetens a film that had begun so adult and sober in a poor childhood adventure where Max becomes an archetypal hero a thousand times seen in the movies. A turn that of course, badly sat a lot of fans of the saga understandable, because nothing had to do with the previous films breaking the adult spirit, dark and pessimistic, in a more childish and optimistic, more adventures, obviously for commercial reasons, because this film is much more Hollywood than the previous ones. A change that I personally do not like and that makes this third sequel lower the level in terms of quality and intensity. In fact there is only one pursuit between cars and at the end of the story. In addition to Gibson is undoubtedly discouraged, it does not print the intensity and strength that had in the previous deliveries or joke. Surely he should not have liked the script too much, doing his job with correctness and period.Now is Mad Max 3 a bad film? Absolutely. It is a film very well filmed, set, entertaining and at times spectacular, with a Tina Turner brilliantly characterized and a really good and entertaining first hour.The bad thing as I say is that absurd and unnecessary turn of the children, but finally, one ends up forgiving him for his undoubted charm and a great sense of entertainment, and despite being more lax than the second, but he had nothing easy overcome it.With all it is worth it and it is much better than hundreds of by-products and similar copies.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
145,actionstar-89625,"Enjoyable, but Weakest of the Mad Max Films",7,12 August 2019,"Mel Gibson is back as Mad Max. This time he is on his way to Bartertown his retrieve his stolen goods from Bruce Spence who returns as well this time as Jedediah who has his son (Adam Cockburn) with him this time. Anyways, Tina Turner not only belts out a couple songs including the great catchy hit ""We Don't Need Another Hero"", but also stars as Aunty Entity. She is the villain in this one. She hires Max to infiltrate Master's (Angelo Rossitto) layer where they are manufacturing methane to be used for gas. Of course the plan goes wrong and he is sent out to the desert to die. But a group of children who have no idea how the world works find him and bring him back to life.Extremely well made and while pretty good never really comes close to hitting the heights that the previous entry THE ROAD WARRIOR or MAD MAX 2 did. There is certainly a bigger story to this one and perhaps more twists and turns than the last one.If you've made it this far through the MAD MAX films absolutely watch this third installment, you should enjoy it. Sadly, Mel Gibson's last turn as Max, but we need to wait 30 years for the next one. Written by Terry Hayes and George Miller who also directed.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

147,Minsky95,We don't need another hero,8,10 July 2002,"I'm a huge fan of these movies.  I have been ever since I saw the Road Warrior(which, I think is the best one out of the three).  I really liked this thirs installment of the Mad Max films.  I thought having Tina Turner star in this film was a great idea.  Max and Tina had something on screen, you could tell. The ending sequence is fantastic.  Not having a car scene in these films doesn't make these films.  You need to have cars and crashes and that's what this film has.  I liked this film becuase it showed more of how the people lived.  It had a more apocaliptic tone to it.  I really didn't care about the tribe part.  That was a little corny and I thought that George Miller could have done without, but it still was a great movie.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
148,kangarooconnor,"Great first half, bad second.",6,16 June 2020,"The beginning of this movie is great, max is still kicking it, content with life but is suddenly thrown upside down when his stuff is stolen. The scenes with Bartertown, aunt entity and weird randomness of the town are all interesting. The thunder dome concept is completely believable considering how deprived and idiotic humans really are. The plot made sense, the story was understandable and showed that one thing led to another. However it's the second half of this movie that really makes it mediocre. The lord of the flies concept is interesting on paper. The idea that when children are born into a world of lawlessness and craziness, they will become cultish. They will wholeheartedly become devoted to a story told to them by their parents and that fascination leads to hope. However, the execution is a little goofy, more along the lines of lost boys style which causes the movie to become childish. The end action sequence is sub par to the sequence in Road warriors and the end is kinda abrupt. Aunt Entity just leaving him in the desert as punishment felt undeserved. The end with the whole ""we will remember him"" felt WAAAAAAYYYY too much like the end of Battle for the planet of the apes. Cheesy, quick end and overall rushed.Movie is enjoyable to watch at times, the clothes look more naturally wastelandic than Road Warrior in my opinion. More like someone would actually cobble together pieces of clothes not just leather fetish gear. The town was interesting, the methane gas made sense, people were trading instead of killing for other stuff. It made logical sense. Then the Peter Pan stuff began and just ruined a lot of the potential for the movie.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Civilization. And I'll do anything to protect it. Today, it's necessary to kill a man. What d'you say""A savage parody of modern living with an action backdrop, this movie captures great attributes of old school golden age action/adventure movies (1980-1989) perfectly. From the film it was shot on, to the beautiful Austrailian settings, to the many, many great one liners and sharp humor this movie is high on my action movie list. The end of the world always fascinated me, the thought that civilization and technology could be lost and people could become savages rampaging the earth (more than usual) throwing spears and looking for M-16 ammo.Max ends up in a strange place called Barter town in a plot that seems almost a remake of Mad Max 2... This film however has an X factor that puts it above the others in my mind, maybe it was the production quality. A certain Lord of the Flies bit is injected and it gives a welcome respite from the dusty dunes. Interesting characters almost everywhere Max goes, Tina Turner however gives an interesting performance as Aunty Entity and the two have magnificent chemistry. ""Ain't we a pair..."" Indeed.
People seem to be confused on how to classify this film, is it a sequel, remake?? But if you look at the others they all have similar traits. I think of it more like Sergio Leone's Man with No Name Trilogy... Similar, yet not quite sequels. George Miller leaves half puzzles around with the dialog and set pieces and interesting quirks in the scenery giving you a quirky feeling that draws you into this strange place.A great film and well worth a watch late at night or on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

153,vze3vhtf,One of the Worst Sequels I Have Ever Seen...,1,10 May 2014,"Possible Spoilers:In 1979, the first Mad Max came out (Although the story goes it was actually filmed in 1977, as Director George Miller's Film School Project). At any rate, it was a low-budget film that achieved a cult status.Then came 1981's MM2: TRW. One of my all-time favorite movies, largely because Miller combines a tortured, minimalist performance by Gibson, offset by almost cartoon-like violence, comic relief by other characters, along with some of the best cinematography in any 1980's film, all so brilliantly, that the result is much greater than the sum of its parts. In addition, Brian May's brooding operatic score was so good, & contributed so much to the overall feel of the film, that I have pondered over the years that it must have influenced Danny Elfman's soundtrack to Tim Burton's 1989 ' Batman '.At any rate, it was a great movie.But Miller could not just quit while he was ahead-He had to go for the ' Hat-Trick '.The result being 1985's MM: BT: A film that starts with Gibson,' The Road Warrior ', looking more like ' Lawrence of Arabia ' as he trades his Bad-Ass Black Ford Falcon Interceptor for-A covered wagon pulled by Camels???-WTF??? A film that trades May's score for pop tunes by Tina Turner. -WTF??? A film that trades SOME plot in TRW, for NO coherent plot at all! -WTF??? A film that is so absurdly campy, that Turner herself looks like she is trying to be a drag queen! -WTF??? A film where NONE of the action makes any sense, least of all the ending.-WTF??? So if this trilogy were a Three-Course Meal, then MM would be the appetizer, TRW would be the Filet Mignon Entree, and BT would be Miller's big steaming dump in a dessert dish. Shame on you, George.

155,ChubbyChecker,We don't need another hero...,7,9 September 2018,"True, we don't need another hero, but if we're going to have one it might as well be Mel Gibson back in his prime.This is the often panned third part in the Mad Max series. Its flaws are pretty glaring and unfortunately obvious. Most glaring of all is that the film starts off with good promise but kind of falls apart in the second half when Max finds the kids. Even so I still like this film for what it achieves. It shows how the world has evolved since Part 2 (Road Warrior) and what the future could hold. While definitely a step down from its predecessor I found Beyond Thunderdome to be a still enjoyable part of the franchise.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
156,bitomurder,I could have made it better,7,11 April 2018,"Then we come to Beyond Thunderdome which is a disappointment after the awesomeness of the previous film. It tried too hard to be a rehash of The Road Warrior as well a more easily acceptable, Hollywood version of it that it just fell flat. While watching this one I couldn't help but come up with a different version of Thunderdome which I think would have been so much better.Thunderdome or Beyond Thunderdome without a Mad Max preface. If The Road Warrior could stand without the Mad Max preface, Thunderdome can as well. The Thunderdome also should have been the focus of the movie. The Thunderdome is the most interesting part of this film and should have been the emphasis instead of simply the one fight we get between Max and Blaster. Make this one stand out on its own and be the story of Max trying to earn his right to fight Blaster to accommodate the deal he made with Auntie Entity. The Thunderdome should be a form of entertainment for the people of Bartertown instead of just simply a way to settle disputes. Cut out all of the unnecessary junk with the children and Capt. Walker and instead fill up that time with Max battling his way through opponents in the Thunderdome and maybe a sweet montage of Blaster destroying all comers. The fight with Blaster could have been exactly the same, but instead we would have had 2 or 3 fights leading up to the showdown. If for some reason you found it necessary to include the children make them part of underworld and have Max fight to free them. The beginning of the movie and the end of the film could have remained the same, but our middle section would have been filled up with fight action instead of Lord of the Flies kid societies and quicksand. I would also have cut out the very 80's music and the cheesy comedy. I truly believe that these changes would take this movie from a not good 7 to at least a good 8 if not higher.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
157,greenflea2,Not very good,4,4 January 2007,"This movie has a big budget, its fails to follow suit of the two prior movies, by having just one chase scene at the end. Max Mad is more about car chases, and action, were this movie seems to lacking this through-out the movie, only at the end. So really fans was seriously let down in this movie, as it seem more concern about the after-math of a Nuclear war, and how the survivors cope.This movie gets bog down with the children survivors from an airline crash, yet most seem unaware of a nuclear war. Yet the older children would be fully aware what happened, as looking at the ages, most of the older children who are in their teens, would be around 9 and 12 at the time of the nuclear war, meaning they would know fully well, the situation.The scene were Sydney harbor is dried up, is totally daft, like that would never happened, regardless what the nuclear war did to the planet, its more likely that Sydney would be flooded than, having its harbor dried.This movie should be a chase movie, not something out of the Lord of the Flies which is really what the story is base around.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
158,siebertws13,Spielbergian Disappointment,4,15 May 2015,"Third and final of the Mel Gibson trilogy, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" is the weakest in the entire franchise. It's not even close because ""Beyond Thunderdome"" is the only one that's not really a good movie. It has a decent start, but then hits a long draggy section before a big chase and smash 'em up at the very end. ""Beyond Thunderdome"" is also the most Hollywood and thus most dated of the Mad Max films, with better lighting and bigger sets, but broader performances, safer PG-13 plot lines, and a softening that takes most of the anarchic sense of danger and that anything can happen from the film, which the previous two had and was part of their acclaim. The performances are a problem. Gibson's a movie star now, and it shows. His Mad Max isn't really so Mad anymore, now he's just a badass --it's a fun, confident performance and Gibson's a good actor so we have fun with him, but it's Mad Max as James Bond, with bon mots and other quips. Not the tortured stoic anti-hero we saw in the other films. But even if the movie star actor has subsumed the character, at least Gibson's a gas to watch. Not so Tina Turner, who is terrible. Her delivery is loud, but not convincing...she's broadcasting, not acting. She has screen presence, but she conjures no majesty. I believed she was a strong woman who came through hard times and was now elite, but I didn't believe she was THAT woman. She couldn't connect beyond herself. The best thing about the film is how they try to expand the narrative from lone outposts in the wasteland to pockets of civilization that are springing up in the wake of apocalypse. The Bartertown community offers a chance for new weird characters and conflicts. The story builds well to the Thunderdome sequence, also another innovation that moves away from the car chase genre ""Road Warrior"" and into straight apocalyptic sci-fi. Up to this point, the film's just about half way and still promising; flawed and overly-stylized in spots, but it's created a new sense of place and opened up a new kind of story for Max. But then Max is back out in the desert and he meets a bunch of feral kids and the movie takes a ridiculous twist into sentimentality and cuteness, like the Ewoks in Star Wars. The next hour is Max hanging out with this wild society of lost children, who just happen to have found a great oasis. This leads to a necessary rescue and a big escape and chase back into ""Road Warrior"" territory at last, and the film ends on a high note. But boy, that long middle section with the kids is a drag and a bore. It's like George Miller handed over the reigns to Stephen Spielberg and told him to let all his worst tendencies run amok....and use cheap visual techniques to get around a few complex shots for stunt work. One final note: A major plot point is that Bartertown is run on pig sh!t, and there are a lot of disgusting sequences where working in or falling in or even being forced to swim in liquified pig sh!t plays an important part. It's played as a joke instead of the disgusting gross horror it should be, and thus completely unnecessary and makes the film very unpleasant to watch in a few repulsive sequences.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

First of all, it is very well made in every aspect. The music score by Maurice Jarre is especially amazing and as good as it'll ever get. Listen closely to it and you'll notice the outstanding quality. Not many composers are in the same league. The cast is great (including Tina, and what a great title song she delivers) and Mel Gibson is simply perfect for the role. On the whole, the movie stands out as the best post-apocalyptic movie there is. It somehow sets the mood and ambiance perfectly, with the dry, desolate, windy landscapes, and with just a pinch of romantic and comic undertones. Love it! The filming locations and sets are perfect - Aunties home and the Thunderdome - expertly made. Well, I've run out of superlatives, so just buy it on blu-ray and enjoy!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
163,Challenger2013,Disappointing Installment in the Series,5,17 May 2015,"After immensely enjoying the first two ""Mad Max"" films, I thought this one was a disappointment. This film just did not have the feeling of the first two and seemed like it had been absolved into the eighties (part of which may have to do with the casting of Tina Turner.) A scattered plot and an absence of the thrills felt in earlier chapters of this saga make this film much less enjoyable, and frankly, not a very good movie.In this edition of the trilogy, Max finds himself banished from a dystopian city called Bartertown after refusing to kill a man in an arena called the ""Thunderdome."" Left for dead in the desert, he is found by a band of children who believe he is a godly figure. It's kind of hard to really explain what happens next, because the plot doesn't seem to know where it's going, but somehow they all end up invading Bartertown. The plot itself is where the film runs into the most trouble. It's very hard at times to figure out where the hell this thing is going and what it is trying to say. The film also does not contain the valuable action sequences found in the first two. It does have a somewhat nice sequence near the end, but it's also overrun by over-used, unfunny attempts at comedy. Speaking of the end, it kind of give us the ""what the hell?,"" unsatisfied feeling. Mel Gibson still plays Max well, and Tina Turner really isn't too bad as the villain, but they can't replace the genuineness that somehow is lost from the series in this installment. The film is either not weird enough, or just plain goofy instead of weird. Either way, it is not effective by any means.George Miller gave us an intriguing little action film in ""Mad Max,"" as well as a classic with ""The Road Warrior."" But unfortunately, ""Beyond Thunderdome"" is a misfire. Hell, I'm not even sure why they went with that title, as I didn't find ""Thunderdome"" to be very essential to the film itself. Maybe I just missed something, but I think a more suitable title for this film is ""Sort-of-Mad Max and the Land of Misfit Children.""",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Without a doubt, one of the worst in terms of plotline, dialogue, and characters that I have ever seen.For the love of God, don't waste your time on this garbage - it makes no sense, and even if you can piece it together, it's so completely not worth your time.I found myself uttering the words, ""What the f**k?"" over and over while watching this one. I couldn't believe that such an acclaimed movie could be so awful.My first 1 rating on IMDB for this flick: it earned it.If I wanted to be tortured for 100 minutes I would watch 5 episodes of Full House back-to-back.

But unlike the movie ""Hook"" (which has more of the same) this film carries a 15 certificate by introducing scenes where 2 men battle it out with chainsaws (while attached to a bungee, as you do).So as you can suspect, one man and 50 kids didn't provide the most interesting scenes, and was the main reason why this film sags so much in the middle. I guess the end road race could be considered a minor highlight, but it was too little too late for a film which starts with a midget and a mentally challenged giant ordering a towns villagers around.Mel Gibson has done a lot better then this. As I said before, the whole tribe-kids bit in the middle bored the hell out of me. If you want to make a kids film, do it properly. If you want to make an adult one, get rid of all this pantomime action.It's probably the right time now to say I hadn't actually seen the first two mad max films, before seeing this one. But after this effort, I don't know why i'd want to.And i didn't even start on Tina Turner.

""Alien"" 1,2&3 fit the same pattern, except Alien 3 was a ""goldfish"" sequel.I just read IMDb's Trivia about ""Beyond Thunderdome"", and discovered some backstory about how the ""lost children"" was a stand-alone idea, and then Max was attached to the concept. That was the biggest mistake of this film. It's never worked for me, trying to meld two essentially separate stories into one film. Not woven together, spot welded, and the joint is weak, very weak. When you come from a film thinking about the many ways you wished it was done differently, you don't have anything great. The ""Lost Children"" thing never worked, they should have kept the whole story focused on Bartertown. It could have been great.And few chases will ever compare to Max 2 (the Road Warrior), but what I found lacking about the finale chase in Thunderdome was that - it was on a TRAIN. HUH???? Part of our hero Max's strength is his cunning behind the wheel of a mean V8. Or a damn semi. Crashing, ramming, shooting, outwitting, and crushing the opponent. But Mad Max is not a commuter, WHY A TRAIN? Both Alien and Mad Max were, in modern parlance ""franchises"" that were killed by a weak script.

Taken out of comparison with the other two, this movie is still solid post-apocalyptic fun, but it's lighter and slightly less violent than ""Road Warrior"" (as is evidenced by the PG-13 rating.) The actors' performances are perfectly adequate for the action, and the chase scenes bear all the hallmarks of Miller's craftsmanship (which contemporary directors should seriously consider studying and revitalizing.) You just won't see any arrow-riddled bodies slamming into the pavement at 60 mph or watch manned motorcycles sucked under the wheels of a big-rig. This one is about the kids.

172,Rosebud815,Five bags of popcorn,10,7 August 2016,"Beyond Thunderdome is the most expansive and broad Mad Max film. It goes from a cut-throat capitalist society to a far-off place where one group has no knowledge of the complete obliteration of civilization. Also, Beyond Thunderdome has different action scenes than just chases (i.e. the Thunderdome where two men enter and only one man can leave). And yet again, another insane chase scene exists at the end, this time between Entity (Tina Turner) and Max (Mel Gibson). However, Beyond Thunderdome has the least amount of action than any Mad Max. It's action is intense, but contained until necessary for the plot. Therefore, the action enhances the plot rather than being the central focus. This is unique for Mad Max. Beyond Thunderdome is the most layered of any Mad Max story, while retaining the crazy action and insane post-apocalyptic characters and environments. While it is such a different Mad Max movie, it continues the story of a man who has nothing left inside but anger and an instinct to survive.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
173,MrP823,"A little bit too kindhearted, yet still interesting",6,24 December 2002,"Well let's get one thing out of the way right now. This film pales in comparison to the pure raw energy and action of Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior) and it definitely shows in the second half of the film. In the Road Warrior, there was little need to explore in great detail the reasons as for why things went to hell. That film's explaining was done through the use of violent action sequences and it is one my favorite movies of all time. This film appears to be more thought provoking, which normally I would embrace in film yet in this movie it leads to too much talk and not enough action (good action anyways).One thing I did enjoy and continue to enjoy about this story is the different cultures and ways of life that we are exposed to. I have no idea what director George Miller was doing when he dreamed up this post-apocalyptic world that operates under its own set of primitive rules but he has created a world that is every bit as interesting as Star Wars. Bartertown and Thunderdome are some of the greatest ideas ever conceived for a film. The battle inside the domed arena is one I don't think I'll ever forget. I also enjoyed being introduced to a completely different subgroup consisting of children that have survived in a lush, green strip of forest that has a source of water.However, it is here where coincidently things get hampered by childish- like action. The rest of the movie's action scenes are like something I would expect to see in Ghostbusters or Indiana Jones. Which would be fine if this film didn't take itself so seriously in the early goings of the story. The final sequence is truly disappointing because it attempts to go for too much comical action and it just can't compete with the final chase in the Road Warrior. I would still recommend this film to those who enjoy sci-fi or action movies but beware of its flaws.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Not only it is awful, but the contrast to the previous one is so big as the Road Warrior was so great...It's like the film makers have thought that let's put more of everything and it should be great. Certainly the it's not the resources that are missing, but the fresh ideas and the atmosphere of the two original movies. The plot is stupid to the point of ridiculous. The characters are caricatures to the point of boring. Action is sometimes hard to follow or just illogical. Everything is underlined as if they think film viewers as morons...In the Road Warrior action was also brutal with (mostly) no round edges. In Thunderdome it's rather cartoonish as if trying to keep it not restricted.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

I'll never forget that night at the theater, packed house, midnight showing, Friday night, 70mm six-track presentation. Everyone was expecting an ""Empire Strikes Back"" sequel with ""Gyro Captain"" from ""Road Warrior"" getting caught in a situation with Max again. Not unlike ""Hans Solo"" to ""Luke Skywalker."" Indeed when the ""Gyro Captain"" first showed up in the plane, knocking Max off the wagon, in the beginning of the movie. The whole theater audience broke out into cheers and applause. When everybody realized later on, that Max and Gyro had no previous knowledge of who each other was...my heart sank! In fact, I think everybody's heart sank that night. Why would ""George Miller"" do this? If this was a sequel, why would they not know each other in the ""Road Warrior"" film? My feeling that night was ""George Miller"" blew it! He could have had a mega-blockbuster franchise not unlike ""Star Wars."" I had the strange feeling Mr. Miller wanted to deliberately kill the series. If that was his intention, he succeeded.To this day,I long for the classic Mad Max blockbuster series that will never be. Good going George!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Dean Semler's camera-work  and the production design are awesome. Maurice Jarre does a great score.

The story and script completely undermine the character development from the first two films.

A must-see,a true classic (Just like ""Road Warrior"") .This flick is contested by some few MAD MAX purists and reviewers that obviously wanted a pale copy of the previous movie like third installment...The real point is that MM2 and MM3 are extremely different 'cause Max is a character in constant evolution, just like a real human being. ""Mad Max beyond Thunderdome"" is pure poetry mixed with conceptual violence and a lot of ingeniousness.Sorry,but ""Mad Max 2"" is not so complete,and the first one is nothing more than a very good movie. In this third movie,we can see the ascension of the character and his real changing.Mel Gibson is wonderful.Tina Turner is unforgettable.The setting shows what's happened to Australia after that Nuclear exchange occurred few time before the ""Road Warrior"" ' events (in my own chronology ).Forgive ""Star Wars"",this is the sole real TRILOGY !!!!!! The fight into the Thunderdome is the best action fighting sequence i ever seen ! . The tribe of lost children is the masterstrike of this third chapter.The end is cathartic,awesome,incredible: Pure poetry... This is the best of series,almost all the MAD MAX fans think this.However,It was a very great box-office hit,the 21 th grossest film of 1985,Tina won the Naacp award like BEST actress,and the MAD MAX and ROAD WARRIOR/MM2 cult turned into a MAINSTREAM LEGEND thanks to this third chapter...11 stars out of 10 !",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
183,Gulag-2,THE REAL TRUTH about the MASTERPIECE - NO spoilers,10,6 January 2001,"An excerpt taken by the unofficial site of the movie (my site) to explain to all the IGNORANTS the real truth about MEl Gibson and his relationship with BEYOND THUNDERDOME,the greatest POST-APOCALYPTIC movie of all the times and the best flick in the trilogy !!!!!!! : ""Before the making of MMBT, Mel Gibson was excited about returning to the Mad Max role for the third time. He gave his own contribution to the original screenplay by choosing to keep his character alive at the end of the movie. In fact, Miller had written a much darker ending where Max gave himself as a final sacrifice. Later, in a tragic helicopter accident, Byron Kennedy died. This caused Gibson to feel enormous mental pressure. The terrible loss of Kennedy started a personal crisis for the legendary actor, causing him to become a virtual alcoholic. During filming of ""Mrs. Soffel"" on location in Toronto in 1984, Mel was cast opposite Diane Keaton. Gibson ran a red light while driving drunk and collided with another car. He was arrested and fined $300.Mel Gibson hit his personal low-point during filming MMBT. His state of mind was so deranged that - a time in which he was as drunk as a lord - Mel declared to a PEOPLE magazine reporter. ""I don't want to be doing this interview. I don't even want to be doing this film. It's a piece of s--t."" In reflection, everyone agrees his third performance as Max was the best one of the series.Ultimately it was Tina Turner who saved Mel from the damaging effects of alcohol !!! Halfway through filming, Turner handed Mel a picture of his face with the message ""Don't screw this up"" written across it. Even today Mel concedes ""It was quite a loving gesture and it really made me stop and think."" Ironically, in the movie it was Max who made Tina's character ""Aunty"" stop and think. Proving once again, another miracle of this wonderful epic! ""Okay ? And remember,the chase scene at the end is very very very COOOOOL. How you can forget the JUNKMOBILES ? Come on !!!!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
184,gabriel@arq.net,Another Great Abandoning,9,27 January 2004,"(* Spoilers Ahead *) In Mad Max, a single police department with a few highway cops and patrolmen maintain civil order in a desolated region of Australia, apparently post-nuclear apocalypse. ""Max"" ends up losing absolutely everything civilized in his life -- everything. Not a drop of heart's blood is spared ""Max"" as he rips himself apart, trying to free himself of the chains and bonds of civilization in order to take revenge on the men who stole his world away. When it's all done, he wanders away from absolutely everything.Mel Gibson's ""Max"" character returns in ""Road Warrior"", where the remnant of civilization has been left behind in favor of complete anarchy in the middle of the desert where an oil well refinery is the strongly-defended holdout of some kind of corporate collective, against growing bands of interested investors who would like to trade bullets and lives for the thinning lifeblood of petroleum. The leader of the wackos is absolutely cartoonish, sort of a psychotic pro-wrestler genius, while the leader of the recluses is dripping with ignorance and a desperate need to maintain his egotism. Every single person knows why they are in that desert, fighting -- because they can't get away from the the vehicles and the combustion. It's everything in their life. The distance between meals and drinks is dozens of miles. The distance to the nearest ""real"" civilization is not even survivable. Those who hold the vehicles hold the supreme power. ""Max"" delivers the oil-barons into salvation, but at a heavy loss, then once again wanders away from all that has come to pass.Finally ""Max"", come into his own with a well-outfitted gravy train, is wandering the desert apparently finally convinced that he is the beacon of civilization, not some building or crowd. His delusion is sorely broken right at the beginning of the movie, and with nothing but his boots and a flute he's forced to rejoin humanity, but why we aren't exactly sure. He's been through it before and he knows what will happen, but still he saunters into ""Bartertown"" where he meets the sexy ""Auntie Entity"" (Tina Turner) who rules with elegance and ferocity, and agrees to scratch her back if she'll rub his.Tina Turner's delivery as ""Aunty Entity"" is passionate. When she is stood off by the uppity ""Master-Blaster"", you can hear the hurt pride in her voice as she admits her humility. And when the real loser of Thunderdome is swiftly decided, you can see the fear in her eyes as everything, all the orders of civility she has cherished and sacrificed who knows what for, falls apart right under her hands. As the chaos grows, she looks above for guidance but sees only the mindless crowd, just as desperate as she and even more powerless. Her delivery from the middle of thunderdome is moving, but short compared to the brotherly storytelling of the very artful ""Dr. Dealgood"" (Edwin Hodgeman.) Nevertheless, what small part Turner is given to play is played from the bottom of her heart and you are thoroughly convinced that she is who she portrays. Her chain-mail suit could have been a little more transparent, though. The rest of the characters in ""Bartertown"", some recognizable from the earlier films, are real in a faery-tale sort of way that seems to follow naturally behind the previous films: in ""Mad Max"", the characters' selves were all dying like lights on their way to burning out; in ""Road Warrior"", their selves were completely gone, wasted with nothing but animal behaviors left; in ""Thunderdome""'s ""Bartertown"", the desolation of the human inner being has proved to be merely a loss of luxury and comfort, and we see that deep inside these layers of modern dross most man and women really are larger than life, in their hopes and dreams and their achievements. ""Max"", unable to abandon life on his own this time around, is forced out into the desert wilderness to die.We soon see the inherent human worth proved again in ""Thunderdome""'s ""Crack in the Earth"", where little people, who never grew up with the bleak realities of technology and its apocalyptic inevitabilities as anything but faery-tales, are all as large of life as nature can provide for. The gorgeous ""Suzannah"" (Helen Buday, rhymes with boo tay,) drags ""Max"" back into life in a veritable Garden of Eden where children and children's' children, who are absolutely hysterical, spend every day of their lives in summer-camp dreamland. Finally, ""Max"" chooses not to abandon but to stay around and support -- whether because he's too tired to fight any more, or because he's learned to see a good thing when he's got it and not drop it for something better, it's hard to say -- maybe this is where he was on his way to in the first place. And yet none of this matters. Somehow, once again, humanity goes wrong over the same superstitions and arrogance as before, and a schism in the valley dwellers leads to calamity and a reconciliation with the recent past. ""Max"" decides to abandon the valley after all, proving finally that he really, truly is ""MAD"", sacrificing everything to return one more time to the truth that he and every man carries his best civilization with him wherever he goes.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
185,poldemol,This is not how I like my Max.,5,29 July 2005,"Mad Max is rough and tough, and the previous movies were rough and tough too. This one is overproduced, this one is trying to be a blockbuster, it's all too pretty, not enough real dirt, it all looks too new, nice and fake. Too many illogical jumps(like when they're in the tube(trying to rescue Master), and Max punches one guy trough the fence of the tube, and they shoot at him, he pulls back in the tube, and the guy that just shot at him, goes up to look trough the tube, and he just looks and goes away? I mean, it's a straight tube, why didn't he shoot trough it, you'll always hit someone. Things like that occur throughout the movie.), Mel Gibson, looks too friendly in this movie, Tina Turner doesn't quite convince, but she isn't given much of a chance to convince either. Still, compare her to Lord Humungus and his disciples, and you have a good notion of all what is wrong with this movie. Actually, it isn't so much wrong, as it just isn't what Mad Max is about. It even reminded me of Spielbergs Hook, and that is not a good thing for a Mad Max Movie. And the race at the end starts of promising, when it starts, I had this, 'Yes, finally'-feeling, but it just didn't deliver. It never got me, yes yes yes yes-ing. Considering the brilliance of Mad Max 2, this was very disappointing. This was made only a couple years after the brilliant Mad Max 2, but somehow looks and feels as though it was made in the 90's 10 years later or something.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

187,Whackooyzero,Just kinda... average,3,16 November 2010,"Or at least relatively. I must admit before I continue on in this review that I've never really ""got"" the Mad Max series. I knew I needed to see them because I'm a huge fan of Mel Gibson(Gallipoli, Braveheart, and Lethal Weapon 1 especially), but I suppose it just doesn't appeal to me. Now I will admit that ""The Road Warrior"" was a fine enough action film with a high octane chase scene I sure won't forget anytime soon, but the rest just didn't catch my attention. Likewise, the original ""Mad Max"" had a similarly memorable chase scene(though not quite as good) and some interesting ideas(certainly the sets and backgrounds were better in that film at least to me personally) and story elements, but still didn't quite do it for me. Though I would still probably give a fair 7/10 for both(though the first one was a bit better).So you may ask, why even bother reviewing it then? Because, from my point of view, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is a disappointment to even someone like myself. Why? How? Read on folks, read on.In the beginning I mentioned how relatively speaking, this film is simply average. And by that I mean, if you come into this film wanting action, thrills, and a few laughs you'll get them, but all rather routinely and without the drive and energy the previous films had(basically the strongest points of them). But it's below average because of how the rest of the film basically insults the audience's intelligence as well as just overall being painfully inconsistent with the rest of the series.But first I should probably mention the few strong points in the film: 1. First of all, the opening section is interesting, when we first get a view of Battertown(the place in which the film takes place) we are intrigued. 2. The early scenes between Mel Gibson and Tina Turner, which contains cliché, but well delivered dialogue, and a nice fight scene between Gibson and some of the guards. 3. The great, and famous thunderdome fight which is inventive, clever, and exciting. 4. The ending monologue, which has some fantastic visuals, and the words spoken are interesting.I suppose one could count the obligatory final chase scene, but it just struck me as a watered down version of The Road Warrior's chase scene.Now onto the obviously bad, WHAT IS UP WITH THOSE KIDS!!! Now I realize that George Miller was probably trying to broaden the popularity and appeal of the series given the unexpected success of ""The Road Warrior"" in America, but he could have done that without throwing something as far left as kids asking Max to help them find ""Tomorrow Morrow Land""!? They drag the story down, and also have no character development or purpose(so we never feel anything for the characters), so in the end it was just them borrowing the Ewoks idea: Throw in something cute, and you'll make more money.But also, it's just kind of annoying. It's all second rate stuff. The acting is hardly there a lot of the time, the costumes and sets could have been cool but just come across ugly and unpleasant, and the action scenes are tame and more importantly mind numbing.There's little else to say. It's a very unpleasant film to watch, annoying, treats it's audience like they're all idiots who'll just gobble up whatever is thrown at them, and lacks anything that can't be found done in other movies better. Like the original Highlander(and I'm not even one of those Highlander cultists, it's just a pretty good movie), or the earlier Mad Max films.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
188,Dan_the_DutchMan,"Bigger action, more positive tone, still Mad Max, but a small step back",7,14 January 2008,"Every Mad Max is a new experience. Making objective comparisons between all three movies is more difficult than it seems to be. There is however a great underlying continuity to the entire trilogy. The first one sets up the universe en presents Max' personal challenge. The second one represents the struggle and the first step towards mending. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome represents salvation, for Max and the rest of the world.In some aspects, Beyond Thunderdome is the best of the trilogy. The action in this movie is the biggest and most spectacular. More in number and more extravagant chase vehicles. Faster and meaner. It is also the most positive and fun of the three. The first two being considerably darker. The future lies with children; a concept executed quite nicely in this movie, with a few very familiar references.Than why is this movie a step back, after the superior Road Warrior? The first part of the movie (taking place in Barter Town) with Tina Turner's character is considerably less interesting. Still entertaining, but without much credibility, partly due to some bad overacting and partly because of the cartoon characters. I know, much is possible in this universe, but even here you can go too far. But, it was great to see Bruce Spence back in the air, now as a different character. Turner's music at the beginning and end of the film is a nice addition too. Especially ""We don't need another hero"" at the end.A visually stunning production, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome delivers a good ending to a memorable trilogy.

190,macedones,Did I just watch Hook: Beyond Thunderdome?,3,15 May 2015,"I am really confused with what I just saw. Was it a Mad Max movie? Wasn't it supposed to be an action film? Well, apparently not. I don't know what happened inside the director's mind, but he took a huge turn in the direction of the franchise and completely changed its genre. Instead of continuing to be an action packed movie, it became a children's tale.The movie itself is really strange. It is split in two parts that makes you feel like you're seeing two different movies. Movie A, that starts with Max being robbed by some random pilot and ends with Max escaping Bartertown after defeating Blaster in the thunderdome. And movie B, which starts with dehydrated Max being saved by a girl who lives in a children's desert village and ends with Max being left alone by the children and the same pilot that stole his truck at the beginning of movie A. If someone thought that this was a good idea to tell the story of the movie, this person couldn't be more wrong. The movie is running OK and suddenly stops to show Max laying low in the desert with a bunch of kids. It makes you bored in the blink of an eye.As for the other flaws of this flick, I don't even know where to start. I'll try to be as less vocal as I can and just point out the most annoying things about it.Can someone tell me what in the world was Max supposed to be to that children? Some kind of a step father trying to fulfill the emptiness in their hearts? He went from ""legendary road warrior"" to worried nanny - ""And I say we are gonna stay here. We'll gonna live a long life and we'll be thankful."". What the f*** was that? It is like George Miller's manual on how to f*** things up and ruin your badass hero.I am gonna be quiet about the ""complex plan"" for rescuing Master and the stunts performed in this so called action movie because it pisses me off. Seeing children taking down marauders with a frying pan is just ridiculous. Like I said in the title. It felt like I was seeing some kind of Peter Panish version of Mad Max.What about the bad guys? Have you ever seen an action movie with no villains and no sense at all? No? Come here and I'll show you. Movie A states that MasterBlaster is the big threat of the movie, but then the tables turn and in movie B, Aunty becomes the villain. It seems to be some kind of plot twist, right? Nope. Just before going after Max, Master, the pilot and the children, Aunty gives a command to her servants and says - ""Find the little man. Bring him back to me, alive!(...) For those who took him, no mercy!"". Good line for a villain who is about to kill everyone on its way just to retrieve what belongs to her. But right at the end of the movie, when Master flies away to his 'happily ever after' with the children, Aunty approaches Max just to say - ""Well. Ain't we a pair, raggedy man?"". And leaves! What the hell is that supposed to mean? You said you were going to kill all of those who terminated your plan of rebuilding Bartertown. It just doesn't make any sense.And I am not even gonna talk (like I did in the reviews of the first two movies) about the fact that Max is, once again, not mad at all. At this point I simply gave up trying to figure that one out.After I was done with this movie, I was shocked on how bad it was. It has mediocre acting, poor editing, bad screen writing and an idiotic plot. A movie that has Tina Turner (despite being one of the hottest pop singers at the time) in its cast as one of the main characters, cannot be taken seriously. And I am sorry if I hammered down one of your favorite movies. I just had to.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

It supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the Mad Max franchise(bad idea). The casting was not exactly the best, I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter! Nothing really even happens, if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick (can it even be called that?) make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better yet both. Another problem with this film is that there are too many people, even the Thunderdome battle sequence is dull, Max doesn't even kill anyone!

It's like all the Ewok bits of Return of the Jedi but somehow longer and boring-er. Picks up again at the end, although it does rehash the Road Warrior a bit.

The crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for 'awful.'

195,liamolf,Mad Max?! Peter Pan more like.,1,7 October 2005,"I am going to keep this review of this film short and to the point. This film was a mess. Which is a shame because it had all of the makings of a good Mad Max film... For the first 5 seconds.We start off with Gibson's character Max in this latest incarnation of the trilogy. He plays a broken nomad, the type of person to which he once scoffed at in his days in the Main Force Patrol (Mad Max - 1979). His family and his best friend are brutalised by gang members of a nomad biker clan, making good of turning the highways of Australia into a living hell. All of which is portrayed onto film in a very violent fashion.We progress onto Mad Max 2, which sees our character roaming the 'wastelands' of Australia. These desolate and baron lands become Max's home, as he has nothing left for him in civilisation. He comes across a populated Oil refinery, which is being marauded by a viscous army of scavengers, pillagers and murderers. He brings back a half dead member of the small tribe of people within the grounds of the fortified Refinery and cuts a deal with them, a truck cab for as much Fuel as he can carry. The film progresses and again Mad Max saves the day albeit being left alone again.Then this brings us on to Mad Max 3, if you can even call it Mad Max. This could have been a good film, had they have named it 'Peter Pan and the Quest for Tomorrow-morrow Land.' This film is completely out of sync with it's predecessors. In comparison, this is a tame and softened film of a franchise to which violence is its main selling point. Mad Max with children humming all of the time is not only slightly cringe inducing to watch, but it is not what Max is about. They call him 'Mad' Max for a reason, in this, he is more like a stressed out Babysitter. The most violence you are likely to see is Blaster being shot with a Speer, and Max knocking Savannah Nix out with a single punch, as well as a tribes-man of Bartertown being knocked out with a frying pan a couple of times. That's it. No people being impaled with spears, no kneecaps being shot out, nothing. Even Aunty Entity escapes Max's wrath, compared to her predeceasing king-pins in previous films being blown up, ran over, and blown up again.This film is nothing more than a joke to a brilliant franchise, and not a particularly funny one at that. If I were you, I would just watch the first two films and call it quits there. Pretend that Max is still wandering the Wastelands, helping tribes-people out when they are needy, etc, etc. Although I cannot help but think that this way of thinking is only going to be made harder with a fourth member to the franchise with the pipeline. Lets hope that the directors have learnt from their mistakes made in this dog.1/10. There nothing for you here...",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
196,Zeltaebar,"A bloated, watered-down minor Max Max",7,19 July 2016,"Perhaps the weakest link in the Mad Max series, Beyond Thunderdome is sharply divided into four acts. The first act is superb! Production design, world building and action are all interwoven into a great tapestry of Mad Max greatness and the cage fight is the highlight of the entire movie. Then act two comes along, drags the tempo down, and even though it delivers a lot of interesting mythology and world building, it just lacks the intensity and tempo which has come to define the series as a whole. Act three is the return to Bartletown which has little to offer in the way of spectacle and both the simple, slap-stick humour and the new supporting characters (a bunch of children) suggest that the movie in fact tries to target a broader demographic, as the new PG-13 rating also suggests. Finally, in act four we finally get the trademark car chases, but they aren't anywhere near as good as those featured in The Road Warrior with the exception of a few breathtaking stunts. The ending does not satisfy at all, and we are left with the impression of a bloated, watered-down, minor Mad Max entry. That said, even a weak Mad Max movie is better than most other action flicks, and Mel Gibson is always interesting to watch, especially here in one of his signature roles.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
197,skyglide,"Watchable, but not a patch on the first two",5,29 August 2011,"After the brilliance of George Miller's first two Max outings, the main feeling after watching this was one of sheer disappointment. Not that Thunderdome is a terrible movie by any means, it's just an average Saturday night popcorn piece that doesn't really push cinema's boundaries like the Director is easily capable off.Once again, we are thrown straight into it from the beginning. Max, now scraggy haired and older is knocked from his camel led cart, by a well filmed ariel assault. His transport and belongings taken to be auctioned at the nearby dwelling of Bartertown. Ran on methane from pig excrement, anything can be bartered here, including 24 hrs of your life, which Max gives to get his camels back. Here we find a few interesting individuals. One being Auntie Eternity, played by Tina Turner. dressed from head to toe in futuristic garb, she looks pure Amazonian. Another being Master-Blaster. A seven foot simpleton with his 3ft Boss played by Angelo Rossito strapped to his enormous shoulders. The Thunderdome, a futurist semi-globe of welded iron where people of Barertown do battle, is only shown for a single fight scene, making the movies title a cool sounding yet redundant choice.The second part of the movie, does get stranger. We are introduced to a tribe of Children, not to far away from those of Lord Of The Flies or The Emerald Forest. The pace then seems to drag and although intriguing, it just doesn't fit with what was an interesting first act. A big problem with Miller's third movie, is that the tone is completely different. Therefore it's more of a standalone piece. Max could have really been portrayed as any drifter passing through an unruly part of the world. We presume Max is still in Australia, yet the accents are largely American, with a few native and even some English. Just where on earth are we? Gone is the apocalyptic high octane horror and action of earlier. Here are vehicles ran on pig crap. The violence is more comical, with lots of slapstick, and you never really feel Max is under threat from the bizzaro bunch of Henchman. More comedy than cannibal culinary. What I would have given to see a Wez-like predator or another Lord Humungus of the wastelands. The picture is peppered with rehashed moments from the others, which does hint that George was sticking with what has worked in the past on an older, more exclusive audience. Repackaged, toned down and offered on a plate as a popcorn flick. Bruce Spence, The Giro Captain from Road Warrior appears to play a similar if not the same character, we are never quite sure. There seems to be a moment of recognition from Max, but not mutually. Credited as Jeradiah this time, but then again he's not flying a Giro-Copter. His son, a chip off the old block sporting a shaggy mop of blonde hair, a similar shade to the target off Giro's affections from the oil compound? -possibly. Another being the Tribe of children, like fifty Emil Mintys, but less Ferrel like. The big one though has to be the ending of Thunderdome, without giving away any spoilers you will have seen a similar chase before, whilst it entertains, it's nowhere near as brutal or as exciting. But having said that, the third Max instalment does have it's positives, just don't go in expecting car chases and punks galore. Cinematography is nice and the score is as good you would expect, plus Gibson continues the development of Max, from cop-Road Warrior-Hero.What I would give to hear that V8 supercharger again!!",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
198,madmaxzack,Why this should never of happened,6,23 May 2007,"The Madmax and Madmax 2 are some of the best films ever to come out of Australia, I think they are brilliant and they made Mel Gibsons career.As Mad Max 2 is my favourite film ever i was truly disappointed with this attempt at turning a Vigilante cop film into Sci-fi genre.I think that George miller (the director)tried to make a film that was kid friendly and failed.I am not a fan of Censorship certificates and that is one of the main problem with cinema these days.Lethal weapon,die hard and mad max all produced disappointing sequels when their age ratings were pushed from 18 to 15,Not that children should be forced to watch them but i watched the series when i was 12 and i loved them all but this one. The film has its moments but overall this is a sinking ship that needs a 4th film to redeem itself after this comedown.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
199,matty-tildesley,a film that ruins the franchise built by the first two films,2,15 October 2008,I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment. it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic Australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't. Let the story end with the road warrior and save yourself a very painful hour and a half. (spoiler alert) the other major issue i had with this film that truly left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. we had already seen him in the road warrior where he had helped max and yet when he reappears in thunderdome it looks like the two had never met. whether he was supposed to be a different character or a relative of the road warriors gyro man i do not know. however it was not explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film. 2 out of 10. doesn't get a 1/10 because of the thunderdome fight.,Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

In the fight between Max and Blaster, right at the moment when Max is about to put the finishing touches on Blaster, Blaster's helmet falls off and we see someone who looks just like Benno from the first Mad Max movie (could this be the reason why Max didn't kill him off---'cause he knows him?).As for the next movie (Fury Road?), I would like to see some of the characters from the first movie reappear, such as some of Max's fellow policemen (especially FiFi--he seemed like a cool boss to work for), and possibly relatives of some of the members of Toecutter's gang out looking for revenge. Possible? Stimpy7898@cox.net (...for any comments on my posting..)",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
202,betafett-176-53500,More Pathos than Petroleum...,9,18 May 2015,"Mel Gibson's final outing as Max Rockatanski comes in for a lot of undeserved stick. Following on from The Road Warrior--a film which created a much-imitated cinematic aesthetic of its own (I'm looking at you Waterworld and Steel Dawn)--Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome finds Max having to shoulder a mantle of responsibility he doesn't want.Lacking any of the high-octane action of its predecessors until its final act, Beyond Thunderdome is a noticeably more emotional affair. This can perhaps be attributed to George Miller famously losing his passion for the film (after the death of his long time friend and producer in a helicopter crash while scouting locations for this movie) and standing aside to let George Ogilvie take the reins, though Miller would stay on to direct the action sequences. The pathos of characters like Pig Killer (enslaved for trying to 'feed the kids'-- a man whose life means less than swine) moments like Blaster's 'reveal' and Savannah's tell of the children escaping a 'Pox- eclipse' (especially the children chanting Captain Walker's final message, literally carved in stone, before he set out into the wasteland with 20 other survivors-- presumably the last adults--to seek help) and the arrival in the ruined dust-bowl of what was once Australia's Sydney Harbour, particularly tug on the heart strings. Despite this, Beyond Thunderdome's action is still excellent. The Thunderdome sequence may be the most unique spin on gladiatorial combat ever conceived, and the final chase, though short and literally 'on rails' is still an exciting, brutal pursuit.By introducing the children at the oasis and changing its focus, Beyond Thunderdome has come in for the same criticism levelled at Return of the Jedi: going cutesy. But the kids of Crack in the Earth become a responsibility Max has to shoulder, when--in their naive optimism--a small group of them leave in the night to find home, he follows them into the wastes to save their lives. In his choice, Max completes a character arc, from a vengeful husband and father, to aimless, selfish, burned-out drifter, to a man who literally leads a small exodus and whose self-sacrifice saves the others. Perhaps due to American dollars helping finance the flick, some goofy humour drips in--some slapstick skillet-to-the-face jokes, some schadenfreude moments (usually at Angry Anderson's character Ironbar's expense, though a poor spectator of the Thunderdome match also springs to mind as I write)--changing the tone somewhat compared to its beloved predecessor. I love this flick and genuinely think it's on a par with The Road Warrior. It has its own identity and emotional arc which I find really satisfying. Maurice Jarre's score is superb, from the clanging, jarring (no pun intended) percussion of the entrance to bartertown, to the orchestral strains of skyraft and the lament for Sydney Harbour, Jarre helps to heighten the emotional core of the movie. All in all, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a fitting end to Gibson's tenure as Max: it has heart, it has action, it has a few surprises (like the fact that Tina Turner can genuinely act) and deserves to be viewed in a better light.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Now the word that was judged too long was never identified.After numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually I got the sneaking suspicion that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically.Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself.But after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again,also words that weren't judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelled!The pc police are everywhere.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
204,dhyttinen,Perhaps the most quotable movie of all time,10,11 August 2002,"I love this movie.  It has such an amalgamation of culture and bizzare style that makes me watch it repeatedly.

205,Scientician,Deepest of the three movies,10,4 September 2007,"The other two are of course better for raw action and thrilling car chases and this movie could not exist without them, but here we really expose a deeper story that was lacking, particularly in the Road Warrior which only hinted at a love or surrogate family angle (the Warrior Woman and feral boy).Max finally regains his humanity and succeeds in rebuilding civilization through his sacrifice.The villains are fantastically rich characters here, far more interesting than the antagonists from the first two movies. They also provide the foil for Max to grow beyond his mere drifting. Both Auntie and Master reveal themselves as far more human than Humungous.The dialog is fantastic, particularly the idiomatic modes of speech for Master and the lost children.As mentioned in another review, I do agree recasting the gyro-copter captain as yet another scheming pilot is a bit strange, but you can get past that.The movie reminds us that ""society"" is much more than reliable electricity (pig sh*t), a system of trade (Bust a deal and face the wheel) and a mechanism for dispute resolution (two men enter, one man leaves) and while Auntie has succeeding in creating the basic elements of a functioning ""society"" in Bartertown it remains just as awful as the world seen in the second movie.I think it was outstanding to conclude the series this way rather than trying to somehow ""top"" the first two in raw violence, action or car scenes.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
206,allankendall,Mad Max is Dead!,6,29 December 2008,"This film is a bit mixed up within itself and to be honest I am surprised Mel Gibson signed on for this project. While the quality of the movie cannot be questioned, the storyline itself is without consistency.We open with an Ariel shot of the wastelands to which Max is trawling through on a vehicle pulled by camels (I don't know about you but I am still heart broken about the loss of the V8 Interceptor in The Road Warrior). He reaches ""Barder Town"", meets Auntie (Tina Turner) gets involved in a deal for camels and water / food etc in exchange for him fighting a control freak that resides in the pig pens (Master Blaster). He breaks the deal when he see's that master blaster is not all that meets they eye, he is then sentenced to die in the dessert, is then found by kids (lord of the flies style) and the whole things intertwines from there and loses itself.What you're looking at is the attempt to develop Max Rockatansky even further but it fails horribly. If you cast your mind back to Mad Max where we have a biker gang (lead by Toe Cutter) that kills Max's family driving him to go a bit insane and seek revenge, Mad Max 2 you see max developed into a scavenger (which works well) and a good proportion of his inner demons are addressed and you leave with a sense of ""is he still our there or not"" which makes the intro of Mad Max 3 so enjoyable when you realise it is Max. The problem lies in that the story is so far beyond the originals, max is non recognisable and carries with him none of the ""im mad, leave me alone"" mannerisms that you come to expect from him, references to family or live are few and far between.I would openly suggest that had this film never happened, Mad Max might have had a future, but it did kill the license by not lending itself to the original Max Rockatansky inception. The only redeeming feature is they did not kill Max off. For that I am thankful :)",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
207,Bonesly,Mad Max: Beyond Shoulderpads,9,7 March 2011,"***THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***It is a commonly held belief that movie sequels are never as good as the originals. Until Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, while the previous movies in George Miller's saga are great action films about good cop who loses his humanity (Mad Max) and becomes an almost heartless wanderer, willing to trade lives for petrol and supplies (Road Warrior), this third installment is more of an adventure in which Max regains most of the humanity/soul that he lost. However it is also a tale about the world Max lives in and the people who inhabit it, from the dirty and depraved denizens of the ""civilised"" Bartertown to the simple, innocent and clean tribe of children living in the oasis and the contrast between the two societies. This film also features an abundance of shoulder pads and comic relief characters not present in the previous two movies, from the seemingly invincible Ironbar (Angry Anderson) to Blackfinger the bumbling mechanic (George Spartels, of Playschool fame) and Jedediah the slightly odd pilot (Bruce Spence).This movie has some of the best scenes in any movie of its time as well as a soundtrack composed by Maurice Jarre that befits the general mood of the film. As with Road warrior, this film was written by George Miller and Terry Hayes ensuring the continuity of the overall story and the character of Max, a role Mel Gibson was born to play. All in all this is a fantastic sci-fi adventure that surpasses its predecessors in almost every aspect, from storytelling to characters and soundtrack.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome
208,DebatingSun1,A Great Opportunity Missed,4,18 May 2012,"The first 30 minutes of this movie are utterly mesmerizing, the bleak post-apocalyptic setting was captivating in its chaotic detail and rich gritty texture, the harsh reality of this insane self-destructive world really draws you in. This film paints a stark picture of the desperation, depravity but also resilience of humanity as it struggles to carve out some semblance of order and civilization in a world torn apart by the apocalypse. The sheer amount of effort and creativity put into the setting of Bartertown is just mind-blowing and I was utterly convinced that this movie would be a more than worthy addition to the Mad Max series.Unfortunately for fans of the previous films, after the 30 minute mark this movie transitions into a cheesy PG 13+ family-friendly Lord of the Flies/Peter Pan remake, the storyline becomes steadily more erratic, clichéd, poorly thought out, unrealistic, the movie as a whole becomes B-grade, melodramatic and dumbed-down, the characters and atmosphere become unconvincing, and while some popular elements from the previous movies are blatantly and shamelessly recycled in an attempt to win the support of fans, this movie fails to deliver on many levels.This movie had epic potential and I do not understand how this movie was allowed to sink to such a low level as it did.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

There are basically two different parts of this movie and I missed all but the very end of the first part.Anyway, I watched the rest of the movie and it intrigued me enough to go out and rent it so I could watch the first part. I'm really not sure what to make of any of the Mad Max series of movies. They're obviously fantasy but the dude who wrote them must've been really out there.

Radioactive water, half-forgotten English, a blind Asian man playing saxaphone in a diaper...we accept it all because Miller treats them with the offhand interest that just assumes they're part of everyday life.  Gulag anyone?  Every time I watch it I see something new, and I haven't found the movie yet with more memorable lines.  He wraps all this around a story that leans on one of the oldest mythological archetypes we have--the wandering anti-hero, Max.  Mel Gibson has never done better, and neither has Tina Turner, for that matter.  'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' drips with imagination--it's my creative fix when real life starts to look old.

But Mad Max I and II are original, classical movies. Why not to stay in the same path? The third part is more or less ruined for me, Max was more like a beating-all-up hero and running around like Indiana Jones.There was something special in first two films, but not in third, as it was rather usual action/fantasy film.

As a kid with a short attention span, I didn't really appreciate the film at the time sadly. Fast forward to now, being a fan of Fist of The North Star and having seen the first two films I decided tonight I'd watch the three back to back to prepare for the new film. The first 2 films were absolutely incredible, so good in fact that I decided to save my after movie pee until they were all finished. I thought it would be the most epic restroom break ever, but I should have done it after the second film was finished. This ""third installment"" (If you can call it that) was passable at best. There were very sweet moments in the film where I admit I got a little teary eyed, but there needn't be any sweet moments in a series like this. It should be mayhem, constant mayhem and tragedy. In my opinion, compared to how dark and sadistic the first and second films were, this movie lacks. But it doesn't just lack, it's quite the opposite of the first two; trading apathy for hope. It's a whimsical spin-off and at several times in the film I seriously thought I was watching a Hook knock off(Robin Williams, great film for that genre). Now I wouldn't say I'm a film expert, but I do enjoy a good film. I cannot stand when films flip- flop the content and lore. It's paltry, and it almost ruins the series. I think I counted one death in this one, and it wasn't even a justifiably good/bad death. It's also the longest of the three films. Watch it if you want, but don't expect to get your post-apocalyptic fix with this one. Watch it if you want to get your sandy, light- hearted Mel Gibson as Peter Pan fix.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Sure, it is completely different in tone from the first two films, and so in that respect, not as good, but it takes the idea of Mad Max and transcends it to a new level for PA movies. Mad Max is the original and best of the PA franchise and will always set the benchmark. The thing is with these films is they grow over time and MMBT definitely grows. It takes on different meanings and angles than the first two films, deciding to concentrate more on character and perspective than downright nitty-gritty action and violence. This is its weakness but also its strength, and it is why it gets such a bashing but I really think those who hate it should watch it in a different mindset and I think they'll like it.How can you not appreciate George Miller's vision? the scene with the kids sitting on the crashed aeroplane in the desert, against the sunrise backdrop is astounding cinematography and epitomises the film I think. Even if Miller was less involved, it is still his vision and it is why he is making a 4th film.Heed the warning that this film is different in tone, but also acknowledge its greatness in its own rights, its ability to stand on its own feet and further evolve the Mad Max series.",Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome

Even if you wanted to throw Bruce Spence a bone and give him a bit part cameo type deal, don't make it that one. Or if you must, make it the same guy.

Max grows a conscience in the blink of an eye. I get that this film is about his redemption, but its too sudden. Max enters Bartertown the same badass he was in the the first 2 films.

Don't get me wrong, there are movies that i like to analyze for their technical prowess, their cinematic techniques, the acting ability and scripting. Those movies have their time and place and I love quite a lot of them for their artistic merit. HOWEVER, I do not believe that all movies can be panned under one system of discretion. I mean, seriously, can a gem like Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome be compared in the same means as, say, Seven Samurai? I feel it's like comparing a Leonardo to a Lichtenstein. Though of the same medium, they are from different times and cultures, different budgets and directors.Ultimately, what I'm saying is that sometimes I need fast zany action with kaleidescope colors and costumes, a not so complex plot, corny one-liners, and post-apocalyptic entertainment.
