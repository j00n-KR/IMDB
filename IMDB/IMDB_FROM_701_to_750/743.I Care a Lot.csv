0,TheLittleSongbird,Wanted to care about this a lot more,6,5 August 2021,"Watched 'I Care a Lot' some weeks back with a lot of anticipation. Really like Peter Dinklage and Rosamund Pike as actors, likewise with Dianne Wiest. All three have been fantastic in other things. The premise was a great and interesting one, if very nasty and one that would make anybody unsettled. The film is also in a genre that has always appealed to me and looked great from the advertising. Even the overwhelming negative ratings here didn't dissuade me from seeing 'I Care a Lot'.After watching, 'I Care a Lot' is to me not near as bad as has been said here and not deserving of so many of the lowest rating votes that indicates no redeeming qualities, which actually goes against what most of those that have given it that rating have said. Having said that, 'I Care a Lot' did disappoint me and certainly wanted to like so much more. It is a film of two halves, one being great and the other being pretty bad. Uneven is a good word to sum it up.'I Care a Lot' does have a number of good things. The best thing about it is Pike, on killer form as a character that manages to be even more amoral than her Amy Dunne in 'Gone Girl'. She really did make me feel uneasy, just as her role required. Dinklage has never been more sinister than here and his chemistry with Pike in the second half really chills. Eiza Gonzalez has allure and intensity in her acting, her chemistry with Pike sizzles and personally don't think what it represented was laid on too thick. Was also impressed by the always great Wiest, who is moving as the one rootable character in the film.The visuals are stylish and have an audacious thriller action look, almost looking at times like it was homaging spaghetti westerns. The music is very atmosphere-filled and pulsates with energy without being too over the top. The script in the first half is taut, darkly comic/satiric at times and often chilling, effectively making one feel uncomfortable at the nastiness that goes on. It even has a voice over eerily reminiscent of 'Gone Girl's' ""Cool Girl"" monologue.First half is truly great. Fast-paced, intriguing, tense and appropriately makes one feel uncomfortable and scared, this kind of deceit does happen and the film does very well at showing the full horrors of it and how easily it can be fallen for. The direction in the first half was clever stylistically and had the right amount of tension.Sadly, 'I Care a Lot's' second half is nowhere near as good and actually felt like a different and vastly inferior film. It was mostly pretty bad, and at its worst it was close to awful and saved only by the acting, the chemistry between Pike and Dinklage, their performances and the visuals. The tautness is lost and the intrigue and tension go too and the trashiness goes well overboard. Evident in some truly implausible and very strange moments , and it feels over-stretched (this could have been twenty minutes shorter easily) and downright silly. The murder attempt especially has to be seen to be believed and not in a good way.Also overkill was the bumbling ineptitude of the mafia, while the dialogue loses its flow and becomes cheesy and self-indulgent. The direction also suffers in quality and became dumb done for the paycheck action thriller-like. While the very end satisfies, what happens comes straight out of nowhere and is rushed through.Concluding, started off so well but the second half was a real let-down. 6/10.",I Care a Lot
1,SnoopyStyle,a question of reality,6,28 February 2021,"Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) uses the legal system to get assigned as the guardian to vulnerable and unsuspecting seniors. She claims to care but in reality, it's a legally sanctioned scam to kidnap these perfectly functioning seniors and milk their net worth. Marla and her lover henchwoman Fran (Eiza González) have their sights set on their next victim, Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest). At first, she seems to be a cherry prospect and then, her Russian mob boss son (Peter Dinklage) shows up.This movie takes an outlier premise and pushes it slightly into unreal territories. I'm willing to buy the general premise of elder abuse but there are problematic overreach. It could be solved if the judge had been bribed and the seniors have no family to fight for them. I can't see any judge willing to keep these seniors from their immediate family. These issues make the main premise problematic. The Russians are also problematic for a different reason. They are generally stupid and aren't doing reasonable things.I love Dean Ericson going to Marla's office which is probably the best scene in the movie but it's really stupid to not at least forge Jennifer's signature on a retainer agreement. Apparently, he's fine with being a mob lawyer threatening to kill people but forgery is too illegal for him. The first target for the mob is obviously the doctor. They have to force her to recant her diagnosis before faking her suicide. In fact, they should force her to out her fraud with Marla as the reason for her suicide. Instead, they decide to shoot up an old folks' home and the security guard shoots first. There is no reason to go nuclear right off the bat and alert the feds which is the last thing they want. Also, why would the security guard shoot first and am I to believe that the guy gets taken down by a bag over his head? All of this is a little silly in a bad way. Later, Fran should be dead. There's no point not killing her off. A gas explosion would not suggest suicide when her face is beaten to a pulp. It's a murder either way and they may as well truly murder her. Despite all the nagging problems, I like two villains facing off against each other. I like Pike and Dinklage. There is a fun tension with them for the most part. More could be done with Wiest. She could take over if she's allowed to. At least, she gets to choke a B out. This movie would work a lot better if the writer thinks harder and works over the script.",I Care a Lot
2,nogodnomasters,She needs my help,6,26 March 2021,"Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) runs predatory senior care facilities looking for healthy people with large sums of cash who will live a long time. She has a doctor in her pocket to make recommendations. Marla lands a big fish in Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest ) is not as alone as she seems. She earns the ire of the Russian mafia.From the beginning we were all hoping for the demise of Marla, a soulless person feeding off old folks. I found myself rooting for Peter Dinklage playing a ruthless killer. The issue I had with the film was the topic.Guide"" F-word. No sex or nudity.",I Care a Lot
3,kosmasp,I hate a lot,9,3 April 2021,"Rosamund Pike ... if you know the spanish word ""cojones"" then you will know what I am talking about. We may never be able to fully look inside a character or their mind, but this is as close as it gets. Even without her having to say many things about it ... we see her, we understand what she is! We may not like what we see ... but it is there.Having said all that the movie is really straining and draining .. and while some may argue that it is tough to feel sympathy for one or the other, I saw the whole picture and was clearly rooting for one side to end the other. Now of course a great movie would not be great if it didn't have a (social) message it delivers. And while it seems quite clear even from the very start in the courtroom or at the very least later when Pikes character is back at her office, the story and the tension it builds may make us forget about a truly horrible thing that in one form or another may go on. Especially in America ... even if not though, there is the care of our elders ... or well not that much care we may give them.And even that is not all ... because while I understand that some may have issues with how the second half of the movie develops (and there are certain aspects of it, I did not expect would go down like that - which is not necessarily a bad thing in my book - apart from a few cliches). The way it ends, also shines a light on another issue America has ... which has to do with accessibility to certain ... objects! Not sure if that will make it a satisfying journey for you or not ... but it is what it is. And it is a really good movie.",I Care a Lot
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Well that was different.,7,23 February 2021,"It's worth a look, simply for the acting of both Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage.This going to be a film that you will love or hate. As a Brit, I am absolutely horrified by some of the events in this film, and I know that they embellish, but I'm told by American friends that such circumstances can arise, absolutely horrifying, especially as there are people out to profit.The first twenty minutes will make you angry, and will make you feel like you want to switch off, but stick with it, as it's worth the ride, you will want to question a lot of what you see.I have never wanted a central character to receive a nasty fate so much, Pike really did an amazing job in the lead role.Different, irritating, but I enjoyed it. 7/10.",I Care a Lot
5,classicsoncall,"""Don't get fooled by old people!""",6,22 February 2021,"My son gave me a call and asked if scammers like Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) actually exist and get away with fleecing old folks who are none the wiser. He was looking out for his grandmother, but I think he was secretly worried that someone might take advantage of me using the legal system like Marla and Frances (Eiza González) did here. I'm basically the same age as Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest), so I guess he was concerned about his inheritance. No worries there since I'm going to spend it all, but I guess his fears were legitimate. Marla was one of Rosamund Pike's more despicable portrayals, and as the movie gets rolling, one begins to realize that there weren't going to be any good guys showing up any time soon. I think if the Russian mobsters had any competence at all, the film would never have made it into the second half. That underwater crash scene was particularly irrational, Marla had her mouth open almost the entire time trying to escape the car and get back to the surface, and would have taken on enough water to drown a couple times over. It got to the point where the film was getting ready to wrap up and it looked like Marla and her new partner Roman Lunyov (Peter Dinklage) were going to get away with the ultimate con job. Should have known better though, since the poor sap who couldn't get his mother out of the nursing home in the opening scene showed up to make Marla a gone girl.",I Care a Lot
6,Tweekums,A delightfully amoral thriller/black comedy,9,26 February 2021,"Marla Grayson works as a court appointed legal guardian to a large number of elderly people who have been judged unable to look after themselves. Once the court has made its order she is free to sell off the person's possessions to pay for her costs and wages. She doesn't wait for people to get unfit to look after themselves; her girlfriend, a doctor declares them so, the judge signs the papers and the care home management help keep the patient isolated. For her it is the perfect crime. Then one day she picks the wrong victim. Jennifer Peterson is a wealthy old lady with no known family. Once she has the court order Marla sets about liquidating her assets... including a safety deposit box containing unregistered diamonds. This is surely her biggest score yet; just one problem... Jennifer isn't who she appears to be; she has a son. Marla has just made an enemy of a mobster who will do whatever it takes to get the diamonds back... which of these two dangerous people will come out on top?In the opening scenes I took an instant disliking for protagonist Marla, it was immediately clear that she was a predator preying on the elderly and hiding behind the law. As we see her treatment of 'Jennifer Peterson' my dislike grew... she was going to deserve whatever she got. Then something strange happened; her tenacity made me hope she would survive despite still finding her morally bankrupt. It help of course that Rosamund Pike did such a fine job in the role. Her antagonist, mobster Roman Lunyov, was equally impressive thanks to Peter Dinklage's fine performance. The comedy of the film is pitch black; and all the better for that. I was a little unsure about the ending but won't spoil it by giving any details. Overall this certainly won't be for everybody but if you enjoy your thrillers with a dash of black comedy then it is certainly worth watching.",I Care a Lot
7,searchanddestroy-1,Saved by the ending.....,8,17 March 2021,"This thriller hesitating between drama and light hearted action flick finally finds the good link in the last minute. For the rest, I was not bored, far from that, buecause I expected the worse. But it was eventually saved by a very good ending, very moral, and surprising. Rosamund Pike is excellent all long the movie, exquisite evil but fascinating in the same time, battling against as evil characters for whom we may have some empathy. After all, where are the true good ones and the bad ones?",I Care a Lot
8,CinemaSerf,"Could have been much, much, better if it had stuck to it's original guns...",6,20 February 2021,"Could this really happen? ""Marla Grayson"" (Rosamund Pike) is a scheming, manipulative creature who takes advantage of folk in difficulty (real or otherwise) so she can put them in managed accommodation, drugged up their eyeballs, whilst she realises, and disposes of, whatever assets they may have had on the outside. It's a clever network of conspirators - reliant on a justice system predicated on respect for the professional opinions offered to it by doctors, care home managers and, of course, by this thoroughly odious woman. She and girlfriend ""Fran"" (Eiza González) alight on their latest mark - ""Jennifer"" (Dianne Wiest) and all is going to plan before we discover that she wasn't quite the woman they thought, and that powerful interests have taken an interest in getting her free and her possessions back... Enter Peter Dinklage who manages to illicit a sort of comic menace (there's a fun scene where he shields his face from a bank camera as if to hide his identity, - amongst a great crowd of other men of his height - not!?) Anyway, he determines to have the woman freed and is a man of some considerable resource. ""Grayson"" fights back and what was, until now, quite an interesting story descends quickly into the realms of silliness. Her character is clever and shrewd, but as so often happens with these kind of films - she quickly acquires the skills of a trained ninja whilst he, the fearful gangster, ends up looking little more dangerous that yesterday's milk. It is almost as if someone wrote the first forty minutes or so, then went for a tea break and his 5 year old child finished it. Eventually, the ending did provide me with the result I wanted, coming from the left-field for a tiny twist and Pike is pretty good at the start - she depicts this heartless woman skilfully, raising heckles as she goes - it's just a shame that it all fell to pieces so quickly, and so thoroughly...",I Care a Lot
9,Calicodreamin,"Terrible people, but I was surprisingly invested",5,20 February 2021,"I have a love/hate relationship with movies centered around terrible people, and on this one I was surprisingly invested in the storyline. I felt compelled to finish and the ending was kind of poetic. Decent acting and a wildly over the top storyline.",I Care a Lot
10,evanston_dad,No I Didn't,6,11 March 2021,"The title of ""I Care a Lot"" is meant to be ironic, since the woman it's about, a professional ward and guardian for the elderly played by Rosamund Pike, uses her business as a way to bilk vulnerable people out of their assets. But it ended up being doubly ironic, because it also applies to the feelings I had watching it. Everyone in this movie is so vile that I didn't care about any of them.Except for Dianne Wiest. I did care about her. She plays the mom of a Russian mafia boss and the latest victim of Pike's scheme, the one who sets the plot of the film in motion. Wiest is a sweetheart, and she was no nice to Kevin Bacon in ""Footloose,"" and she has a brief moment where she puts Pike's character in a bad-ass chokehold, which is what I wanted to do to her, that she had me really rooting for her. I also found myself rooting for her son, the mafia boss, played by Peter Dinklage, and that tells you something right there about how morally vacuous this movie is. The Russian Mafia boss is the good guy. Let me repeat that. The Russian Mafia boss is the good guy. Ok, so he cares more about reclaiming some stolen diamonds than he does his stolen mom, but still. The terrible things he's probably done all happen offscreen, so we can pretend that he's basically nice.Pike clearly has a ball with this role, and it's a huge testament to her abilities as an actress that she could make this movie even as watchable as it is. But I don't know what I was supposed to take away from this film. I felt extremely anxious and shaky watching it. I just wanted really bad things to happen to her and her partner because they're so deplorable. I wanted them to be tortured and killed, because people as awful as they are deserve to be punished for their awfulness. But I felt really bad being made to feel that way, and that's the only thing this movie made me feel.The movie is pretty poorly written too, but it's so snappy and admittedly entertaining while in the middle of watching it that it's not obvious how poorly it's written until after you've had a chance to mull it over afterwards. I mean seriously, would a Russian Mafia boss (who, by the way, is the good guy, or did I already mention that?) be this inept at killing not one but two women who, no matter how smart and ruthless they might be, still have literally zero experience dealing with Russian Mafia bosses?Rosamund Pike really needs to jump back into a period gown and do another Jane Austen movie where she gets to be gentle and sweet because otherwise I'm going to be too terrified of her to ever watch her in a movie again.Grade: B-",I Care a Lot
11,Uriah43,An Entertaining Comedy,7,19 March 2021,"""Marla Grayson"" (Rosamund Pike) has invented the perfect scam in which she has a certain doctor of her choice declare an elderly person mentally incompetent and then has a sympathetic doctor order that person into her care as her legal guardian. Once that happens she carefully places her new ward into a specially selected senior care facility and subsequently drains them of all of their life savings. Needless to say, however, she has to be very careful which specific elderly person to select as her next victim because things get more difficult if that person has friends or relatives who might complain. So upon learning of one very wealthy elderly person named ""Jennifer Peterson"" (Dianne Weist) who has no surviving next-of-kin she becomes especially excited and moves in on her new mark very quickly. What she doesn't know is that Jennifer does in fact have an extremely close relative who happens to be a Russian mob boss by the name of ""Roman Lunyov"" (Peter Dinklage) and although he insists on anonymity he is willing to do whatever it takes to get his mother released. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this turned out to be a very entertaining comedy which benefited from good performances by both Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage. Admittedly, some of the scenes lacked realism and the story got a little ridiculous towards the end but I liked this film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",I Care a Lot
12,blanbrn,Dark hearted comedy mixed with drama a twist and turns fair game play satire a mix and match of wits.,8,20 February 2021,"""I Care a Lot"" is one dark hearted thriller comedy action drama with twist and turns of suspense and cunning means.

And things get complicated with twist and turns.A secret connection with Jen's life is uncovered as this then takes this movie on a tailspin a high drama cat and mouse game that involves cunning and clever outsmart and wit like moments! The underworld is well within play with a man named Roman(""Game of Thrones"" Peter Dinklage) who's small in stature but big and wide in his violent means!

Tricked out in fetching attire and unflappable towards any threats shot at her from the other sex, her Marla is 'Amazing Amy' with a vengeance and irrefragably batting for the other team (her affection for Fran is genuine, a viewer might second-guess Marla's unspecified backstory, how her reprehensible carapace could be the outgrowth of the malefic influence inflicted by the world at large, and Fran's female warmth becomes her only safe haven). Even in the absence of cordial redeeming feats, it is still riveting to watch Pike's Marla in action, her fearlessness is both scary and inspiring, you hate her guts but also crave for her guts (or maybe just a part of) ambivalence is here to stay.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",I Care a Lot
14,FeastMode,fun!,7,11 May 2021,"I saw the netflix logo on the cover and assumed it was a netflix original, so i went in with super low expectations, especially after some of the netflix trash i've seen lately (the devil all the time, santa clarita diet, spenser confi-garbage, umbrella a-garbage-y).Fortunately netflix just acquired the distribution rights. And to my pleasant surprise, i had a great time with this movie. It was interesting, had me hooked throughout, and never felt predictable.My two favorite things in this movie are the performances and the music. Rosamund pike is her usual awesome self, aided by great character writing to make her a bad-ass. And wow peter dinklage. Dude's performance made me not want to blink for every moment he was on the screen. After some of his movie performances lately, i am convinced that he's not a one-trick tyrian lanister pony. I hope he continues to get good rolesthe music is AWESOME. And i loved the numerous times when it gets loud with some stylized non-dialogue scenes. It set the tone so well.My only issue is a few times when these really smart characters make a stupid mistake, but i let it slide because i was being thoroughly entertained.

15,Cineanalyst,Puts the Con in Conservator,7,20 February 2021,"Is there something sinister going on with conservatorship or guardianship in America? I viewed ""I Care a Lot"" the same day as ""Framing Britney Spears"" (2021), which is partly about the controversy over her conservatorship. I suppose if private practices and corporations, never mind relatives, are involved for profit, there probably is corruption. Regardless, we never get a very good look at any of the supposed victims of this practice in either movie. Dianne Wiest's Jennifer Peterson is rather capable of handling herself in her Kafkaesque nightmare. The other kidnapped old people here are but photographs on a wall. The result is to be allowed to revel in the immorality.A legal con or heist picture turned gangster battle and consistently a dark comedy, it's surprising entertaining and well made--coming as it does from the director, J Blakeson, of the atrocious ""The 5th Wave"" (2016). Part of that is the excellent cast headed by Rosamund Pike and including Peter Dinklage as well as Wiest. Pike, already nominated for a Golden Globe, does the fourth-wall-breaking bookending narration and faux feminism well and plays a character we're meant to love-to-hate. Yes, the ""Gone Girl"" comparisons are apt. But the rest works, too, including some good scoring and an unpredictable plot. It's hardly a realistic movie, so any concerns with actual laws hardly apply to this scenario, where, besides for the opening case of the son not allowed to see his mother incarcerated in a nursing home, the action is to be enjoyed as battle between baddies. In that sense, we the audience do become what Pike's Marla Grayson advises: forgetting good and evil, looking out only for ourselves--in this case, from the safety of our enjoying a movie.",I Care a Lot
16,The-Sarkologist,Just So Painful,3,7 March 2021,"I'm going to have to agree with another reviewer in that the only good thing about this film with Peter Dinklage, and even then his character wasn't that great. Like, yeah, it is one of those films where we have an anti-hero, and about halfway through I realised that we were sort of wanting to work out who the lesser of two evils was - Myra Greyson or the Russian Mafia, and we really aren't supposed to like the Russian Mafia, but I tell you what, there isn't anything all that great about Myra either, to the point that I wanted the Russian Mafia to get her.You see, Myra runs this scam where she gets a doctor to declare that an elderly person is no longer capable of looking after themselves, and Myra becomes their guardian. She then pretty much imprisons them in an old folks home, and proceeds to sell all of their property. The thing that I really didn't like was that it just felt too close to reality, and the thing is that I really didn't want to watch a film where Myra seems to pretty much get away with it, along with all of the other brutal people that are in her field of influence.What happens is that she is told about this old lady, who is very wealthy, and has no friends or family, so Myra decides to play her little game with her. It turns out that there is a lot more to this woman than meets the eye, and Myra suddenly discovers that she has made some really dangerous enemies. As such, it becomes a cat and mouse game between Myra and the Russian Mafia, and in reality, I really didn't want Myra to come out of this predicament with her pride in place. In fact, I wanted to see her fall, and fall really really hard.Okay, there are lots of films where the protagonist goes up against the Russian Mafia, and you generally want the protagonist to win. However, in this particular case, I really didn't want that to happen. In fact, I wanted Myra and all of her co-conspirators to be found out, and exposed for the frauds that they are. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen.Mind you, I did like the lawyer though - he was pretty cool.",I Care a Lot

19,Thanos_Alfie,Interesting but...,6,15 June 2021,"""I Care a Lot"" is a Comedy - Crime movie in which we watch a woman working as legal guardian and taking advantage of elderly people to drain their savings. A lot change when she does the same to another elderly woman but she is more than she appears.I liked this movie because it was different, it had an interesting plot and some good interpretations. The only thing I did not like it was the way the plot was presented and how it was changing through the whole duration of the movie. At first I though that it would be a crime, thriller movie but after some time I understood that it's a comedy. The interpretation of Rosamund Pike who played as Marla Grayson was simply amazing. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Peter Dinklage's who played as Roman Lunyov and Dianne Wiest's who played as Jennifer Peterson. To sum up, I have to say that ""I Care a Lot"" is a nice comedy movie to spend your time with but do not expect much otherwise you will be disappointed.",I Care a Lot
20,cruise01,Fast moving thriller drama that delivers Rosamund Pikes striking performance.,8,20 February 2021,4 out of 5 stars.I Care A Lot is a good thriller drama film about Marla (Rosamund Pike) who runs a business by scamming elderly to giving her access to being there guardianship while putting them in an assisted living place while she has access to there funds and banks safe. Marla has access to a judge who is always in her favor. Contacts with doctors who are in her favor in writing a slip saying the elderlies cant live on there own. Marla knows the game of making lots of money and getting away with it. Until one of her clients she put into a home Jennifer (Dianne Wiest). While she found diamonds in her bank. And a false identity that Jennifer has been using. While her son Roman (Peter Dinklage) who is a mob boss and on a desperate search for those diamonds and will hunt Marla and her girlfriend Fran (Eiza Gonzalez) down.Good and fast moving plot. Marla is not really a likable character which she cons her way of gaining guardianship and taking away everything that person owns. Things start escalating when Roman shows up and is willing to kill and torture anyone to get what he wants.Rosamund Pike and Eiza Gonzales delivers with a striking performance. Peter Dinklage was also good as a mobster.It was an entertaining and fast moving thriller. The music score also made it energetic with its electronic score.I Care A lot is an entertaining thriller that is worth watching. Even if the characters are unlikable.,I Care a Lot
21,matthewssilverhammer,Morally Questionable,4,6 March 2021,"There's a thin line between morally ambiguous and morally bankrupt, and this movie spends much of its time walking that tightrope with sleazy pleasures. With scary implications about (yet another) poorly regulated area of American life, it's full of dirty fun and fantastic performances (Dianne Wiest is queen).

That's the start of the story. Quite a promising start, BUT...The bad: soon into the story, several plot turns were not very credible. And more and more plot turns afterwards became increasingly NOT CREDIBLE AT ALL, to the point that I just couldnt take it seriously any more.This movie is not meant to be a full on comedy, perhaps it was meant to be a dark kind of humor, but even then there still needs to be some sort of a credibility to the story. Unfortunately there was NONE.Not any good? The start is good. The acting by Dianne Wiest is excellent. Rosamund Pike however fails at portraying a believable character, because the plot and dialogue are simply completely SILLY and UNBELIEVABLE.",I Care a Lot
24,wandernn1-81-683274,"Thanks, It's Been Fun.",6,3 April 2021,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this. +1 Star for the attention grabbing openingGetting into the movie reminds me a lot on Intolerable Cruelty. Lawyers exploiting people for whatever she can get out of them. Nothing like using the law to screw people over.Lots of unexpected twists in this one. But a HUGE -1 for the pliability of the Judge in the Mother's case. I mean what JUDGE would allow so many things to happen to the Mother without the Judge ever having the mother brought to his court room.And the acting...top notch. Tyrion is fantastic as usual. And Rosa Parks, she seems to get better and better.But like some other reviewers pointed out, the movie started strong and got 'farfetched' and 'unbelievable' It would have scored an 8/10 but with the short comings I saw I can only give it a 6/10.And this movie is Oscar nominated???

25,jtindahouse,Who are we supposed to be rooting for?,7,25 February 2021,"'I Care a Lot' was a strange viewing experience for me. The reason for this was that I had no idea who the movie wanted me to root for. The main character is Rosamund Pike's 'Marla', however she is a ruthless con-artist who cares about no one and simply wants to make money out of destroying people's livelihoods. And I thought that's fine if the movie wants to tell its story from the antagonist point of view. But then Peter Dinklage's character 'Roman' came into the story and he was an even worse person than she was. Who am I supposed to be on the side of in this mess?The movie is actually quite well made outside of that problem. It's well-acted, has some decent dialogue and moves at a snappy pace. It's a very watchable movie if you are willing to shut your brain off and just take it for what it is. Admittedly there were some pretty idiotic character decisions written into the script and it does feel a little over the top and unnecessarily cartoonish at time. A lot of that did help with the pacing and keeping things interesting though, so maybe it was a necessary pay-off.I don't actually know if this film was aware it had no one to root for or not. The final scene makes me think maybe it did realise this and that was it trying to make amends. I'm not sure. I needed that final scene personally though otherwise I would've been very angry. It did feel like a tacked on scene filmed at a later point, possibly after test audiences pointed out their flaw. This was a strange film is all I can say. It's not bad, but it is very unconventional and hard to fully enjoy without a protagonist.",I Care a Lot

27,alindsay-al,An Above Average Film with Wasted Potential,6,23 February 2021,"This film made its way to Amazon Prime over the weekend and last night I had the chance to watch I Care A Lot and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a crooked legal guardian have her life turn upside down when she tries to swindle a mob boss's family.Main Character
Really ever since her amazing performance in Gone Girl, Rosamund Pike has been on the rise and she plays the lead character here and I thought she was really good in the film. I must say she plays one of the worse and most despicable people ever put on screen but somehow she makes you kind of care about her and want to see her succeed. Pike is enigmatic in the lead and delivers some great monologues, I think it is interesting seeing her character and how she works and Pike again delivers a really good character here.Supporting Characters
The great Peter Dinklage plays the bad guy here and of course he is good, his character is one note but Dinklage seems to be having a good time in the role and he provides a nice contrast to Pike and provided an interesting enough angle though there wasn't enough uniqueness to the character. Eiza Gonzalez plays Pike's partner and I thought she was good too, their chemistry together is good and I like how she is influenced by Pike and they work together with a nice relationship being built here. But the rest of the cast that are here are pretty bad or just not given anything to do, it feels like these three were the only people they cared about and the rest of the cast are nowhere near as strong.Story
The story of Pike's character is really interesting. It reminded me at times of how I felt watching Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul and I love those shows so it was onto a win there, the world is interesting and the lead character is interesting as she tries to build this business. But this show has some weak characters, there are good actors like Dinklage and Gonzalez who aren't given enough to work with and feel a bit wasted. Also the third act is absurd and feels like it is from a different film and really feels strange and has a really bad ending in my opinion. It is similar to another film that I am not a huge fan of and it just felt weak for me.Script
The script is okay, it does a good job of making Pike's character interesting and the whole idea interesting but that is about it. The rest of the characters are poorly written and as I said above the story just falls off of a cliff and that is a major disappointment.Style
The style of the film feels energetic and exciting as it introduces these characters and the world we are in and gets off to a good start. But similar to the rest of the film, the style gets more absurd and I just kind off wish there was more nuance to the plot and the pacing and gave the characters more interesting things to do.Overall
Overall, this is an above average film with a really good lead performance. It had real potential but falls flat in the last act, there is enough intrigue for people who watch a lot of films but those who don't probably give this one a skip.",I Care a Lot
28,henry8-3,I Care a Lot,6,6 March 2021,"Pike plays an ambitious, morally bereft business woman who 'cares' for the elderly and strips their considerable assets to pay for this. When she takes on Dianne Wiest, she fails to realise that she is the son of a ruthless Russian Mafia gangster - Dinklage.Starts out as a relatively conventional thriller / drama demonstrating the strategies of the evil Pike within the law. When Dinklage gets involved it shifts gear into more aggressive territory with both parties determined to win the battle between them. This is very nearly hard to swallow as it occasionally comes close to stretching what is believable within the rules of the film. What saves it is the sharp, confident and compelling performance from Pike, who is quite sensational, backed up impressively by Dinklage. A nice black stab into the heart of the American dream with much to enjoy.",I Care a Lot

Pike is a grifter of the highest order (she has a scheme going where she becomes a guardian for an elderly person then parks them in a nursery home & depending on how long they last, she milks them for all they're worth; selling their properties, etc.) w/a network of subordinates (Alicia Witt plays a doctor who provides marks for Pike, her right hand woman & lover, Eiza Gonzalez, is a strong enforcer, Damian Young runs a retirement home which provides berths for Pike's charges & even a judge who presides over Pike's petitions, played by Isiah Whitlock, Jr. (from The Wire) seems to be part of the gang as well) but when Pike gets her new 'client' , played by Oscar winner Dianne Wiest, someone who purportedly has no family & very well off, is put through Pike's grist mill but then when a cabbie shows up to pick up Wiest at her home (which is in full renovation mode), flags start going up. It turns out Wiest is a mother of a Russian mobster, playing by Peter Dinklage, who is none too pleased about the abduction & wants his mother back...now. What follows is a mirthful back & forth between Pike & Dinklage as they try to one up on each other to get Wiest back into rightful hands escalating into violence which doesn't seem to faze Pike. Pike, along w/her other show stopping Oscar nominated performance in Gone Girl, shows she's the alpha woman (is that a thing? Trademark'd!) to beat on screen. Her performance reminded me of Linda Fiorentino's (come back, will ya!) 1994 role in The Last Seduction, where a woman holds all the cards & woe be upon the male who think he can snatch them from her.

34,aidanratesmovies,What is with these negative reviews?,9,19 February 2021,"Rosamund Pike shines in this bright little thriller, that is truly misunderstood by many audience members alike. Posting reviews on IMDb for some time now, I decided to check the reviews on this film on the website once it was released, and many of the top reviews are anything but positive. I feel the film is largely misunderstood by these reviewers, the film is a dark satire based on people in real life who take advantage of poor elderly citizens only for their own financial gain. I will admit, the film does feel a little bland with it depiction of the Russian mafia throughout the film, not to mention it feels a bit out of place, but Pike's performance and the otherwise tight script is truly something to behold, and proves to be very entertaining and very enjoyable throughout all its runtime. I also was in love with the look of this film, there was such a cool style to all of the costumes and set design, that it not only proved to be fun to watch, but pretty to look at as well. As for supporting performances, I really enjoyed Ella Gonzalez and Dianne Wiest in their roles, but Peter Dinklage and his gang felt a little too on the nose for me. Perhaps it was simply the script, but I feel like a larger effort could have been made in taking on these characters. In the end, I really enjoyed I Care a Lot. It's not a perfect film, but a very enjoyable, very clever, and very stylish thriller I wouldn't mind catching again sometime, plus it has a stellar soundtrack. And if you need a reason to watch the film, watch it for Pike. As this is easily her best performance since 2014's Gone Girl.
My Rating: 9/10",I Care a Lot
35,valleyjohn,Absolutely Fantastic,9,3 March 2021,"When i think back , i struggle to think of many female movie characters who i really hated because they were just plain nasty . Annie Wilkes from Misery is probably the obvious one i can think of so Congratulations must go to Marla Grayson , you've just gone to the top of the list !Marla Grayson has made a mint selling off the assets of the dozens of senior citizens who are trapped in her permanent care. She and her partner Fran stumble upon a veritable golden goose in the form of Jennifer Peterson , a mark with no apparent family or debt, only a tidy fortune to be mined.However, while their scam is underway, Marla and Fran discover that Ms. Peterson is not who they thought she was, and that their actions have disturbed the designs of a crime lord , who will stop at nothing to protect his mother.I absolutely loved this film.It's been a long time since i watched a movie where i could physically feel my blood pressure rising while watching it. Not just rising but boiling at times!
Rosamund Pike is fantastic as the Marla. A real nasty manipulative woman who i was hoping would meet with Karma throughout the entire two hours .
Even when she came up against a Russian gangster played by the brilliant Peter Dinklage , i was hoping he would cut of her fingers or chop her up in little pieces. I didn't care that she was a woman and that's thanks to a great script and some outstanding acting.Although its a thriller / Black comedy it's also telling a social story on the healthcare system in the US ( it's the same here in the UK) and how old people are just a commodity to milk of their money and perhaps that really what made my blood boil.Highly Recommended.",I Care a Lot
36,jadepietro,A dark Comedy That Takes You In,8,4 March 2021,"IN BRIEF: A delightfully wicked performance by Rosamund Pike makes this well-made dark comedy quite memorable.JIM'S REVIEW (RECOMMENDED) Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) is a glib and amoral con artist whose random acts of evil are not random acts at all. They are malicious and calculating schemes to bilk the elderly out of their life savings and profit her lifestyle in J. Blakeson's clever dark comedy, I Care a Lot.Marla sees the world filled with ""lions and lambs, predators and prey, those that take and those that get took"". We follow her plans to take over guardianship of a healthy Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest) and are rightfully appalled by her unethical behavior and her den of thieves. In fact, no one in this movie has an iota of conscience, especially Roman Lunyov (a good Peter Dinklage) who becomes Marla's chief adversary. As events spiral out of control, the plot does become contrived and falls into the LOL category (Lack of Logic). But the ever resourceful Mr. Blakeson's innovative direction keeps the pace and the film is loaded with some fine comic turns.Ms. Pike plays our villainess with aplomb. She gives her unlikeable character and air of anti-charm qualities that somehow endear her exploits. Her scenes with the great Ms. Wiest crackle with comic tension, as does a sequence with Chris Messina as a very unscrupulous lawyer. One wishes both supporting characters had more screen time. Other performances by Alicia Witt and Eliza González as Fran, Marla's cohort in crime, add to the toxic complications.Mr. Blakeson also writes the screenplay which is loaded with zingers and witty one-liners. His dialog is sharp even if his plotting gets absurd. Those aforementioned leaps of logic and an uneven tone creep into his well-written narrative. If he would have care a bit more with his concept and did a few re-writes with his storyline, his film could been even more effective. That said, he is definitely an emerging talent and I look forward to his next endeavor.I Care a Lot celebrates wickedness with glee until its pat ending reversing its dark comedy roots and erodes the film's cynical edginess. It might tie up all the loose ends but the movie itself gets tied up in its own sense of morality, wanting to become a crowd-pleaser when it should relish in its wicked ways.

38,arungeorge13,"A wild ride for the first 80-90 minutes, followed by a preposterous climactic stretch! [+57%]",6,31 March 2021,"I Care A Lot, the Rosamund Pike starrer directed by J Blakeson, carefully builds up an intriguing universe of ridiculous legal plausibilities, grey-shaded characters, a generous dose of lesbian girl power, some neatly packed thrills, and a strong antagonist (played by Peter Dinklage) - only to rush into a poorly conceived climactic stretch. Pike is an apt choice for Marla Grayson - a character that's selfish, morally unlikeable, and lives off swindling rich old-timers. Marla wants to make it big in the entrepreneurial world dominated by men, referring to herself as a lioness in a world of lions and lambs. Eiza Gonzalez plays Fran, Marla's aide and (irresistibly gorgeous) partner in crime. Their chemistry is kickass!The antagonist, Roman Lunyov, has his own sinister intentions. He meets his gangsta' match in Marla and the duo set fires blazing on the way. The first hour is swiftly paced; I'd stress on 'swiftly' since the film doesn't give us time to study the nuances of legal guardianship - by the time we understand Marla well enough, she is already pinned as the legal guardian to multiple geriatrics. The threats start to pile up, the thrills begin to heat up. It's a wildly entertaining ride until the 80-minute mark or so.However, the climactic portion (where the ladies enact revenge on Roman and whatever follows) is where the film slowly disintegrates. It goes a bit far-fetched for its own liking and does so in the least convincing manner one can think of. The character arc comes full circle in the end, but one gets the feeling that Marla's instantaneous evolution did not come across well on-screen (as it may have, on paper). There are several aspects that still make you 'care', however - the cinematography and the musical score - right up there.",I Care a Lot

This fictional movie had a way-out-there premise of the elderly getting ripped off by a good con artist team. They had amassed a network of people in healthcare and the law to keep their con going. Their system consisted of becoming legal guardians of their elderly targets, put them in a nursing home, and, while in there, drained them of everything they owned. They had a good thing going for them 'till they targeted the wrong old woman (Diane Weist), who they thought had no family, etc., just like their previous targets.

Eliza Gonzales plays her right-arm and lover, while Peter Dinklage plays the (hidden) son of the elderly mom they shouldn't have messed with.

Through the manipulation of the Boston legal and medical systems, Maria arranges to be appointed the legal guardian for numerous older people. Packing them away to a drugged up life in a care home, the pair then plunder the estates of their wards, turning a tidy profit. The weatlhy and unattached Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest) appears to be a ""cherry"" that can take their fortunes to a completely different level. But all is not as it seems, and Maria and Fran's evil but comfortable lives are about to be turned on their heads.Positives:
When I say the comedy is inky black, I mean it. It's unusual to find a movie without a single character that you can relate to or even remotely like. For some reason, it reminded me of the Michael Douglas / Kathleen Turner vehicle ""The War of the Roses"" in that regard. And yet, once you let the evilness of it sink in, it becomes a rip-roaring story that delights to the very end.Rosamund Pike delivers yet again another superb performance, making Maria an icy cold villain. The role could be summed up as ""What Gone Girl did next"".Peter Dinklage delights in portraying an evil character which, for reasons of spoiler avoidance, I shall say nothing further about. But it's a cracking performance and brilliant to see a script that steadfastly ignores his physical characteristics.Dianne Wiest (""The Mule"") and Eiza González (""the sexy one"" from ""Baby Driver"") also deliver strong supporting roles.J Blakeson - who did ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" - directs with style, and hopefully his truly novel screenplay will be suitably recognised through awards. There are some clever twists: one near the end which (Smug McSmuggerson from the University of Smugchester) I saw coming, and another one soon after that I didn't!Mark Canham - not a composer I know - delivers a really engaging and bouncy score that's top notch. Loved it.
Negatives:
The plot is just SO inky black at the beginning, that some may get through the first 15 minutes and think ""Nope, not for me"". You should stick with it: after Peter Dinklage appears, the movie shifts up a gear and changes in tone.The plot occasionally stretches credibility beyond breaking point. In particular, all the characters seem to be wholly incompetent at 'dispatching people' when they have the opportunity to do so. The repetition of these failures I found to be a bit tiresome.Summary:
Finding a movie with a novel storyline is an unusual thing these days, and one that combines that with a taut and engrossing screenplay is a gem indeed. It's probably not one recommended for very elderly people to watch.... then again, perhaps with so many evil scammers around in real life, it might be considered required viewing! But, if you have one, you'll probably want to have a chat with your granny after watching this.(For the full graphical review, check out the full review at One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

Indeed she uses the courts, and medical profession to support her cases but fleeces people out of their savings, brreaking up family ties and relationships and rehoming the patients in a nursing home more akin to a prison.However she meets her comeuppance when she takes on the case of Jennifer Peterson (Dianne West) who is not your ordinary elderly client as such but whose son is a Russian Mafia boss,Roman (Peter Dinklage).Now here is where the film confuses the viewers emotions and proves so frustrating to many. The viewer (or I did anyway) feels repulsed by the actions of Grayson and feels no sympathy with her when she is hunted down by Roman. Indeed I wanted him to succeed!Towards the end of the film we see Marla actually escape the death attempts and actually become the legal guardian of Roman after an accident that leaves him hospitalized. In the process Roman actually hatches a plan with Marla to become business partners in her treacherous enterprise.The film to me was all about greed and what lengths people will go to to get money or fleece helpless wards.The film was set in the United States. Do these kind of things go on?",I Care a Lot
56,tm-sheehan,Original fun Comedy Crime Drama Rosamund Pike is delightful,7,28 February 2021,"My Review - I Care A Lot (Streaming on Amazon Prime)My Rating. 7/10This movie was close to home seeing I'm in the age group that Maria Grayson a con artist who gets herself appointed Guardian by The Court then sends her Wards to an Aged Care home and then embezzles all her victims of their finances.
Sound grim ? It's not really it's a very slick and fast moving story with some great lines and some fun comedy tongue in cheek moments.
Rosamund Pike a versatile actress I've enjoyed for years in films like ""A United Kingdom ""(2016) one of my favourite modern movies and Gone Girl (2014) is cast as Maria Grayson a character who is poised with sharklike self-assurance.
Marla is a professional, court-appointed guardian for dozens of elderly wards whose assets she seizes and cunningly appropriates through dubious but legal means. It's a well-oiled racket that Marla and her business-partner and lover, Fran, played by Eliza González . They both plan their biggest heist with brutal efficiency on their latest ""cherry,"" Jennifer Peterson - a wealthy retiree with no living heirs or family.
Jennifer Peterson is played by the wonderful Dianne Wiest I'm glad I enjoyed her latest film after rubbishing her recent movie ""Let Them All Talk.""
Jennifer the object of Maria and Fran's swindle turns out to have connections that the Crime divas never counted on.
Jennifer and Fran's plan starts falling apart quickly when their victim turns out to have an equally shady secret of her own and connections to a volatile gangster,
The gangster Roman Lunyov is played by Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister,Game of Thrones"") he's develishly delightful as a villain trying to get his Mum out of the clutches of Jennifer and Fran and reek revenge.
Written and Directed well by J Blakeson I was thinking "" I Care a Lot "" may have made a great series but it looks like it will stay a movie feature only.
It refreshing to see these women in such strong roles and especially the depiction of same sex relationships that don't necessarily define the characters or the movie.
It's just a fact no more important to the plot than if they were a heterosexual pair of crooks, just two people in a romantic relationship facing the consequences of their crimes.
Good luck to Rosamund Pike who is nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy and there are some funny moments in this film.",I Care a Lot
57,DarthVoorhees,A fascinating failure in character study and representation,1,25 February 2021,"'I Care a Lot' is extremely well made and features Rosamund Pike in peak 'Gone Girl' form. Conceptually it hits all it's targets and is never boring. I hated it however. The film has a clever concept and plot but the entire film goes down in flames because of the decision to turn a villain into an anti-hero.Pike stars as the ice cold Marla Grayson who opens the film philosophizing about dividing the world into lions and lambs. Marla is not shy about being proud of her almost sociopathic tendencies to succeed and she has found a racket to hurt the most vulnerable in order to make her fortune. Marla is a caregiver who gets power of attorney over demented senior citizens in order to drain them of their assets. She has perfected the system to a science with connections to care homes and doctors and an easily manipulated judge. Pike has to deliver a lot of exposition and she revels in the villainy of the character. Pike's Marla is bold and intimidating. You have here the prototypical villain you love to hate.And then the movie makes a decision. Marla is a despicable character. The movie comes to a point where she becomes the anti-hero. I can't get on board with this. 'I Care a Lot' is an interesting capsule of the times and how we view characters through gender and class. Marla is meant to be a feminist anti-hero, a proud ""lioness"" who threatens to cut off balls. We get sleek and cool glamour shots of her working out and vaping on her pen. Sure she's evil but when we place her up against Peter Dinklage's Roman she is meant to look better in comparison.Marla has ambition. I feel so icky dissecting this. There's no more tired and sexist trope than to use a female character's ambition as a way to showcase sinisterness. Marla and 'I Care a Lot' is on the opposite extreme. Ambition is the be all end all. Marla isn't criticizing the world for being divided into losers and winners. She embraces it. We're supposed to admire Marla because she has that drive. I can't make the leap especially because the movie is so effective at showing the evil of her plan. You see ambition is too broad a concept. It matters what our characters aspire to do.",I Care a Lot
58,skepticskeptical,Note to self...,5,11 August 2021,"Every time I watch a Netflix production I end up concluding that they are basically churning out material so fast that there is no quality control or inspiration anymore. I Care a Lot is a case in point. It is something of a garbage pizza of a movie, which would have done better with less ridiculous ""bright ideas"" and more focus on what appeared to be the central theme. The Russian mafia? Really?",I Care a Lot
59,msbreviews,"I Care a Lot is one of the best Netflix films 2021 has offered so far. Rosamund Pike is phenomenal, but J Blakeson's clever screenplay is the indisputable spotlight.",8,15 February 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)When it comes to Rosamund Pike, it doesn't really matter the type of film she's doing, I'm always in. Her constantly dedicated, incredible performances strongly grasp me to the screen every single time, so I expected I Care a Lot to follow the same path. From the most recent Radioactive to one of her most famous roles in Gone Girl, passing through numerous other memorable displays, Pike just can't deliver a bad interpretation. Being this my first viewing of a J Blakeson's movie, and with Netflix offering their pristine production value, I must state that I'm surprised with how much I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Let me begin with what I think really makes this movie so attractive: its screenplay.Pike and co. all deliver outstanding performances, and I'll get to those, but Blakeson's script is both crazy and smart. If the premise isn't clear enough, capitalism is a significant theme throughout the entire runtime. From the rich-poor depressing yet realistic comparisons to the ruthless competition between the so-called sharks of this economic system, I Care a Lot provides excellent parallelism to the real world. The not-that-implicit messages regarding this topic are mostly delivered by Marla Grayson, a protagonist who doesn't shy away from assuming her lioness status.Possessing cunning knowledge of both the pros and cons of capitalism and its borderline legal cheats, the viewer accompanies Marla through her exceptionally captivating process of acquiring and profiting from a new target, just like hundreds of companies and CEOs around the world do without most people realizing it. When Marla finds a worthy competitor, Blakeson risks its grounded story, replacing it with an absolutely lunatic second half, characterized by absurd, out-of-this-world character and plot decisions, which would be a major issue if its purpose wasn't precisely to show the ridiculous - and criminal - ambition of top-tier capitalists.I can't deny it gets a tad too mad and irrational for my taste, but having in mind the context and Blakeson's goal, I consider it a mostly successful play. Plus, the entertainment value doesn't drop, much on the contrary, it skyrockets to a point where I welcome some of its craziness. The third act boasts tremendous tension and suspense, slightly unexpected developments, and a shocking yet utterly perfect ending that will make most viewers say ""karma is a b*tch, right?"" It's a quite enlightening story about the real-life guardians who exploit their wards. Blakeson brilliantly educates the audience on the power of bureaucracy, the moral compromises overly ambitious people must make, and how to profit for some means lack of freedom for others.Marc Canham's score is the technical standout, delivering an electronic soundtrack that I usually don't appreciate that much, but it played the right type of tracks at the perfect moments. From the score alone, the viewer is able to understand the importance of certain scenes, and that's a massive achievement. Doug Emmett's cinematography also allows for a few gorgeous shots with exquisite lighting, but I need to move on to the fantastic performances from the cast. I already approached Pike's performance, and at the time of this review, she's already received a Golden Globe nomination, so I don't need to further compliment her display.However, I can't let the rest of the cast go away without mentions. Peter Dinklage (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, Avengers: Infinity War) offers one of my favorite performances from his film career with his slightly over-the-top yet intriguing interpretation of a dangerous gangster. Eiza González (Bloodshot, Hobbs & Shaw, Alita: Battle Angel) is also pretty good as Fran, Marla's lover, and her chemistry with Pike is on-point. Their sparse yet impactful emotional moments are quite compelling. Dianne Wiest is a total badass as Jennifer Peterson, a not-that-innocent old lady, and finally, a shoutout to Chris Messina (Birds of Prey), who hands his charm as an attention-grabbing lawyer.I Care a Lot is one of the best Netflix movies this year has offered so far. Boasting an intriguing premise, J Blakeson brilliantly expands his idea through an enlightening screenplay that tackles the sometimes cunning guardian-ward relationship in real-life. Packed with clever analogies to real-life capitalism, Blakeson transmits impactful messages about the power of authority, excessive ambition, and the moral compromises one makes to gain wealth and success at the cost of other people's freedom. Rosamund Pike impeccably leads a film that starts as a realistic take on the process of acquiring and profiting from a new ""victim"" and then evolves into an absolutely crazy second half of absurd outcomes. This ridiculous development does get a bit too irrational, but its purposeful objective of demonstrating capitalists' immorally ruthless behavior regarding competition is undoubtedly accomplished. Outstanding performances across the board and a surprisingly effective electronic score only make this movie better. I couldn't recommend it more.Rating: A-",I Care a Lot

Peter Dinklage is excellent in his role as well and is a good foil for Pike's character. This film is pretty much always moving and entertaining, it just runs into some real lack of believability near the end. The entire premise is a bit shaky to believe, but the ending really goes overboard. It's also pretty hard to root for anyone in this movie because all the characters are so horrible and not super fleshed out.

64,bregund,Zero payoff,1,8 November 2021,"One implausibility after another, idiotic premise, unlikeable characters, hackneyed, turgid, exceptionally stupid. Need an example of any of this? Armed security guards in the old folks home (why?), or any of the courtroom scenes, where a plaintiff is allowed to interrupt and directly question a defendant and the judge doesn't bat an eye. The old lady at least deserves a competency hearing, and she doesn't even get that? THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. You need to make it believable for me to buy into it. Another laughably idiotic scene is where the guy spits on her and she holds back her one-hundred-pound bodyguard, who could really do some damage with those tiny fists. Why didn't Tyrion Lannister just shoot the main character and petition the court for his mother's release? I know, diamonds, but come on man. The icing on the cake is the main character's whirlwind rise to the top of the corporate world (hey look she's on the cover of Forbes magazine!), in a dopey denouement.

the end it just ended up being a bit of a mess.

Not something I'd watch again but not a bad film. 6 stars.",I Care a Lot
68,sweidman-28016,Really Fun Watch,7,23 February 2021,"I've seen I Care a Lot twice now and there is much to discuss. J Blakeson returns to direct a film for the first time since The 5th Wave. His story follows a crooked legal guardian who drains the savings of her elderly wards meets her match when a woman she tries to swindle turns out to be more than she first appears. This gained some buzz upon its premeir at TIFF. Most of it disappeared before Netflix released the trailer and those who saw it at the festival recommended it highly. First thing that we need to make sure is clear is this is SATIRE. It's not meant to be taken literally like some are interpretting it. Obviously what Rosamund Pike's character, Marla Grayson, is doing is awful. That is made evident from the beginning. Marla Grayson is an anti-hero and if you can realize (which I don't think it's that hard to) you can get into the story. I've been reading some reviews from people who have turned it off after 20 minutes because they can't handle her character. To that I would say don't review something if you haven't watched it or gave it a chance. To branch of that, don't also give it the worst review possible unless you see no positives. Rosamund Pike, nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance, is fantastic. You can't simply watch this and think she did an awful job. This might be her best since Gone Girl, obviously not to that level. She has a way of playing anti-heroes and making them likable and interesting. I should say all the acting is good in here. Peter Dinklage and Dianne Wiest give some fun charcters/performances. One of the best characters is the score. The score acts as its own character in the movie and honestly drives it even more. It sounds like something out of a Safdie film and a Fincher collaboration with Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross. The sound is droning throughout and making it such a fun experience.I Care a Lot is wickedly entertaining (yes, I'm using that overused quote you see on every big-budget movie poster)! I went it sort of blind only knowing the basics. It takes a turn and that's when I realized what it was actually about. Many points it goes crazy and to places you wouldn't think it would go. I loved that the first time. Watching it a second time, that affect isn't really there unfortunately. Those parts are definetly still fun to watch, but it's not like rewatching Parasite for the third time and still getting that thrill. The screenplay is where some are accusing it of being awful. It's clever and has things it wants audiences to understand, but if you don't go in open-minded I don't think the movie will work. The first act sets up well. Not too much happens and we're still learning about Marla's scheme. The second act is where things get interesting. It takes that turn and makes the story a lot more interesting. Sometimes it tries too hard to be one of those 'shocking' movies that it loses touch of what it should be. Still, its entertaining and fun. That second act does want to accomplish so much that it can drag in the middle and towards the end. But the end of that act is stellar! The third act is another main criticism. I like most of it. There's a final blow, revenge kind of plot going on and I liked it. Where it faulters is the finish. The movie overstays its welcome. Right after an incredibly made scene with the score's best track, we get this other scene. It should've ended right there, in my opinion. There's even a perfect line and shot that I genuinely thought was the end. Had it ended there it would've been perfect and given us a good laugh with it coming full circle. Yet, it continues to something else. My personal opinion is they tried to setup a different ending for those who might've felt differently about the events that took place earlier. I thought a character decision was ok and it might end, but then it goes on to another scene. The ending ending is fine with me and I think it works, but at that point I already thought it should've ended at three different places. That bugs me a little but I can understand. It's an unsatisfied ending for me and most, but some will be fine with it. Really it boils down to if you like Marla or hate her for what she's doing.When discussing this movie, it's hard not to get into spoilers. Everyone has criticisms for I Care a Lot. Some are understandable regarding the script, but when there's many saying ""there's too much lesbian propoganda"" it makes me think how stupid some people are. If you're going to review something, have some evidence to support your reasoning other than your own homophobia. Honestly, many negative reviews I've read were homophobic. So if you want to get angry, look at some negative reviews for the movie. Overall, I liked I Care a Lot. I'm conflicted on some plot points but it's such a fun watch that it will be hard to forget.",I Care a Lot

70,ethanbresnett,An incredibly fun watch!,8,3 March 2021,"I Care A Lot is such an enjoyable movie experience. It has a few flaws sure, but for the most part its fast paced, intelligent, thrilling and well executed.The biggest triumph of the film is that we are treated to one of the most deliciously evil characters I've seen in a long time. Perhaps even too evil. One of my (minor) criticisms of the film is that they lean a bit too much into this aspect of the character, which can be a little off putting at times since she is our protagonist.This is to take nothing away from the spectacular performance by Rosamund Pike. She was so steely, determined, fierce, and magnetic whenever on screen. I couldn't take my eyes off her as every facial tick, every dart of the eyes told its own story. She really seems to relish in these sorts of roles and shone massively in this film.Peter Dinklage was another real highlight of the film. He didn't have as much screentime as Rosamund but whenever he did take to the stage he was equally triumphant. The scenes with the two together were the highlight for me. With zippy and well measured dialogue, the exchanges were a joy to watch.What else really impressed me was the whole production value of the film. The costumes were great, the score complimented the themes and drama perfectly, the direction was spot on. Everything seemed to fit together so perfectly with each individual aspect heightening all the others.The only reason I didn't score this film higher was because, as mentioned above I feel they failed to add any redeeming features or humanity to our protagonist, which made following her a little gruelling at times. I also think the film took a few directions in its plot which didn't quite seem to fit in and which were a little frustrating.Other than this I was very impressed with I Care A Lot. It had such an original and gripping premise which it executed very well. I was entertained from start to finish, which in my book is worthy of an 8/10",I Care a Lot

Even after her girlfriend told her to end it.The first half was better and then it became really ridiculous. If you for a second believe that someone can just be taken away without anyone being able to visit them you are delusional. The way she talked and acted toward the mob was just RIDICULOUS and ruined the film. Like I said, NOTHING was believable. How did this ward become James Bond?I could NOT care less about the two female leads and actually wanted them to get killed. This was just some feminist gibberish. NOTE: Anti-heroes are NOT unlikable. They have flaws and not perfect beings, but never unlikable.How do you have a movie with the main protagonists so unlikable that you wanted them to fail and get killed?

This one sees her royal iciness raking in dollars via a care-home racket. It's a good premise, and one day someone might make a good movie based on it. But this is not that movie. On the one hand, we're invited to be critical of Ms Pike's character because she's so unfeelingly exploitative of the elderly, while on the other hand we're encouraged to root for her because she's got romantic dreams that she needs to finance, and we're clearly supposed to love that she will follow her dreams at whatever cost to anyone else. When she inadvertantly gets on the wrong side of the Russian mafia, in the person of Peter Dinkelage, the nice premise dissolves in Tinseltown acid, credbility evaporates, and it's one ludicrous plot turn after another till the end credits set us free.

Poor estate planning and competency issues are real. Perhaps some viewers are upset at the exposure of the dirty secret that elders in America are often neglected or warehoused by their families. Perhaps a callous lawyer who manipulates that social weakness for profit is no different from a nanny state leader who pretends to work toward social equity but is simply trying to take control of people and resources?

81,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,A swing and a miss,5,20 March 2021,"I watched this because of all the hype around it, and the polarizing opinions about it. I definitely ended up on the negative side. This movie gets worse as it goes.Towards the beginning of the film, it has 7/10 vibes...it seems to be maintaining a pretty serious, scandalous tone, then Peter Dinklage and his henchman enter and it becomes really really campy in a way that doesn't really work because it doesn't match the seriousness of the concepts or the other characters and their performances. Dinklage was definitely the weakest part of the entire film - I did not buy anything about his character for a second. Second worst part was Eiza Gonzalez's character - she's beautiful but they give her literally zero personality and zero back story? It's like, why is she even there? Ok, so she's Pike's lesbian lover, which makes Pike's character ""more interesting"" (not really) but their relationship has zero depth.... so later in the film when they present these love scenes as if you should feel something for them, you really, really don't - instead, by the time the movie gets to this point, it has dipped down to 5 out of 10 status, and you begin to wonder how the movie managed to get so off track.Pike's performance is strong but also predictable, just like her character, and like most things in this movie, her character lacks serious depth and dynamic. It feels like a shell or parody of a character. We get it, she was amazing in Gone Girl, so you cast her for this, but hey - Gone Girl was a great movie. This is embarrassing in comparison. It's not her fault.The best part of the movie was the presence of the legend Dianne West. Her character was the only one who presented true depth and dynamic and she was wildly amusing to watch. She was also the only one to conjure up emotional resonance! You truly felt for her and she was the only character you really wanted to root for! Chris Messina also made a really strong impression on me - his scenes were fantastic. And it's always a pleasure to see Macon Blair and Alicia Witt.The music score was really cool but sadly I felt that half the time it didn't fit the tone of what was occurring at all. In fact, it really made some of the scenes that otherwise would have been pretty effective feel like more of a joke. Whoops.There's a little bit to admire in here but overall I would avoid! Stick with Gone Girl - or if you want a movie that nails scandalous weirdness that sits somewhere between seriousness and campy absurdity, watch something like Inherent Vice instead!

82,Mike_Devine,"So much caring, so little time",6,1 March 2021,"The nefarious business schemes throughout the healthcare world aren't typically the subject of major Hollywood films. In J Blakeson's boundaries-pushing dark comedy 'I Care a Lot,' however, a corrupt homecare system takes center stage with the court-appointed legal guardian of vulnerable elderly people as the face of the enterprise.'Care' is really all about it's star, Rosamund Pike. Her Marla Grayson is the center of gravity, from her feigned concern and sincerity to her ""don't give any F's"" attitude. The interactions she has with those in her orbit - from the head of the Berkshire Oaks retirement home, Sam Rice (Damian Young), to her partner in business and life, Fran (Eiza Gonzalez) - are captivating for one reason or another.

It's a well made product.But for these kind of movies, I would have liked memorable dialogue, instead of serviceable lines that move the plot along. Something I can take from it. There's not much to discuss once done, not much to tell others about. If there is a problem with the movie, is the story itself. The belief of dirty-doing is nothing new, but to paint it in such bright colors? I can imagine it wouldn't sit well with most. There's no likeable lead, no ""satisfying resolution"". I would dare say there's a lot of incompetence, which is very dissatisfying.Additionally, there are many small parts that can easily be skipped if you aren't really invested and just want to know ""what happens next?"".. but aside from those pacing issues, I'm sure it has a market. Can't say it's a dumbed down story.. they told it the way the wanted to tell it. Sadly, it's just not appealing to me, and it was juuuust fine. It's a great example of the sentence : ""consume.. move to next product"". And worst of all, you know how it's going to end.",I Care a Lot

Uncomfortable to watch at times with one of the most unlikable character - (amazing performance from Mrs. Pike, who deserved not only her golden globe but hopefully also gets her academy award (nom. at least). Same for Mrs. Wiest, playing an elderly woman who is not at all what u think she is.... It's most certainly not a feel good movie (hence maybe the ridiculously low ratings) with a clear hero vs. anti hero and a Happy End (understandable everyone is desperate for something bright and positive these days). Instead, I care a lot is a bitter, sad, twisted, intense and terrifying satire. The only glitch I can see are the exaggerated girl power scenes which are in my POV not necessary to transport the message... anyway, if u are looking for something special and are prepared for a thriller meets pitch black satire, I care a lot should be your choice.",I Care a Lot

Apply at the same time, we have a mix that goes from ""Demonio de Neon"" to even ""Scarface"" but nothing works well, and every two minutes we have a different direction. GRADE 6/10The script doesn't help much either, despite creating a great dislike in Rosamund's character, and having a good construction and a good ending, her second act is disastrous, in addition to the constant need to develop a strong female character, such a point is so insistent that at one point we only see a very insecure character, the director can't hold the tone of the film in any respect.It's not all grievances, the costumes are cool, the humor is fun, the acting works very well although they aren't able to save the work as a whole, which has a good beginning and a good conclusion, but everything in between doesn't work. . J Blakeson showed that he is a director who has references in cinematography, he just doesn't know how to apply them yet. GRADE 6/10.",I Care a Lot

87,DeBBss,Could've been better with a reworked script,4,13 April 2021,"I love the concept of I Care a Lot. It's interesting and unique, and it talks about the issues of capitalism and exploitation of power. The only issue is the script. You have the protagonist (Marla) and you have the antagonist (Roman Lunyov), both are pretty bad people. You're either cheering for a mobster or a sociopathic manipulator whos steals from the elderly. I think most people rooted against Marla, but it was just so strange because both the antagonist and protagonist are bad people (albeit one worse than the other). I think it would've been more interesting if we followed Feldstrom (the guy from the beginning with the red hat). It could've been a character study, and it could've showed the struggles of be exploited a lot more better. It could've showed how Feldstrom eventually cracked and then murdered Marla. But instead we get a mobster who is pathetically bad at killing people.The only good parts were the acting and production quality. Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage were great, which is no surprise; and I really liked the way this movie was filmed and edited. And that's about it. I Care a Lot doesn't really offer anything new, and it can get really boring at times.

Sure there have been movies made where you might not be fond or you might dislike the main character. But Rosemund Pikes (Marla) role took the cake for me by far.With that said its hard to really truly enjoy a movie when you so strongly dislike the lead. Thats the expierence I can imagine most felt hence the bad reviews. Yes, I found myself completely rooting for the bad guys in this movie the entire time. Something I've never done ever. Without giving away any spoilers, the ending though was so amazing, satisfying, and relieving that it makes it all worth it.Besides all that I would to explain other reasons why I reviewed the film a 6 out of 10. The movie itself pacing wise isn't bad, I diddn't find it to be draggy at all by any means. The visuals were pretty good and acting was as well. However the film listed as comedy wasn't remotely funny at all and I diddn't crack laugh the entire time. Not to get political as well because I'm not that type of person. But the film was trying extremely heavily to push a feminist agenda. I have no issue with this normally if it wasn't used in way that it was in this film.

Yet it then drags for a long time, slowly getting worse, until it then significantly drops in quality as it gets ridiculous. Not a single likeable character, completely illogical survivals, and then somehow a simple con-woman becomes 007 to take down a top crime ring.

94,pkpera,We need to care - that such things do not happen,7,25 February 2021,"Movie starts with little life philosophy about predators and preys, or takers and ... And even if we did not hear anything really original here, it is now probably more actual than ever. In the beginning I wondered how realistic is all that factual imprisoning of old people. Nope, and this movie is satire, some kind of black/curved mirror. That's why they cast dwarf Peter Dinklage for maffia boss role.I probably never seen so much rates 1 here, like for this. I guess that people could not get that main character is not to sympathize with, especially when it is attractive younger female. Well, there was lot of it unlikable, and not just her way of getting money - like constant smoking, deeper voice ..I would rate this higher than 7, but some actions just were stoopid, like leaving him on middle of road in middle of night. Then asking 10 M bucks from him ...
Another reason for low rates is probably that movie did not take clear genre.
Comedy, satire, crime, thriller ... Thriller part was just bad. And maybe unnecessary, and made movie longer than should be. Or then should develop whole scam part better. That would be much more interesting by me.The ending was pretty good, starting with sudden fusion of 2 villains, presenting briefly the result ... Oh yeah, that's something what goes closer to our sad days reality now. Superman, where are you now ? (Quote from famous Genesis song) . Well, as new Superman serial just started, I need to say few words about what we need to care: surely not childish need for superheroes. There are much worse things than falling bus. While superman saves 40 people in bus, thousand of other people World around die, and some because some destroyed their life.

95,Thrashman88,They Care a Lot,8,14 March 2021,"I watched this on Netflix last night because a friend recommended it and it has Peter Dinklage, whom I'm a big fan of and I still find ex Bond girl Rosamund Pike still hot.I was unaware of stuff like the one that's portrayed in this movie is possible: assigning a legal guardian by the State to mentally compromised elderly and put them in a nursing home. I'm sure the red tape behind such a thing must be more complicated than what is shown here, where it seems to be a rather simple maneuver. Once the elderly are at the nursing home, the legal guardian can dispose of his or her clients assets in the name of maintenance.Rosamund Pike plays the shrewed and heartless Marla Greyson, a ""legal guardian"" that has made tons of money by sending elderly people to nursing homes and ""administrating"" their assets, to the point of even avoiding close relatives from seen their moms, dads, etc. At the nursing home. Marla has close knitted connections with the doctors who dismiss the elderly as mentally unstable, with the directors of Nursing Homes, with judges and lawyers. Her business looks quite legit and even ""caring"" but all she wants is to become as rich as possible.Things go sour when she wrongly sends a mentally lucid Jennifer Peterson (Dianne Wiest) to a nursing home. Miss Jennifer has never married, has no next of kin, has no criminal records and has been a very productive woman, amassing quite a fortune along the way, a fortune that Marla intends to keep for herself when she shows at Miss Jennifer's doorstep with a court warrant saying Marla is her new Legal Guardian and that she must now reside at a nursing home for her own good.What Marla is unaware of is that Jennifer is not who she thinks she is: a powerful figure within the local Russian mob, and that she actually has a son, Roman Lunyov, played gracefully by the great Peter Dinklage.I'm sure healthcare people all over we're appalled at their portrayal in this film. I'm sure there ARE some doctors who are heartless and corrupt (I know this for a fact, working in the pharmaceutical industry for years). What hit me as odd was Marla and her lesbian girlfriend (Eliza Gonzalez), and how the two went from one place to another WITHOUT at least one bodyguard. After receiving several threats throughout her career, she should know better that her work is prone to cause the rage of elderly's relatives if they are forbidden to have contact with their loved ones. Early in the movie, we see such a relative who is banned from seeing his mother. After a court hearing, he goes after Marla and curses her and even spits at her face. That should've warned Marla to be more careful, but her self assured attitude dismisses the incident as just another angry relative ... a grave mistake as you will later find out in the movie.While ""I Care A Lot"" has some comedic elements (mostly at the beginning), they fade away fast as the movie progresses into a violent thriller. I had fun watching ""I Care A Lot"" despite the obvious implausibility of the story. Usually, Netflix original movies are a mixed bag. In this case, I enjoyed ""I Care A Lot"" very much and, unless you're in the healthcare business, you will also enjoy it.",I Care a Lot

107,TheVictoriousV,The better out of the two neo-noir titles I've seen discussed lately,6,4 March 2021,"I kinda want to turn this one into a double review; one of Netflix's I Care A Lot and one of Flinch. Why that selection? Because both films, as different as they appear, ape similar voices from the neo-noir genre (bear with me; this post will be about ""neo-noir"" as I've come to understand it) and I've heard some conflicting opinions on which one is actually worth seeing.I Care A Lot has music, plotting, and a sense of chromatics that bring to mind the Safdie brothers. Flinch is similar (especially as it stars a prominent actor from the Safdies' Good Time and Heaven Knows What), but leans more toward the neon underworld of Nicolas Winding Refn -- the story is not as eventful, the pacing is slower, and the soundtrack features Synthwave pioneer Miami Nights 1984 doing his best Cliff Martinez (the synth maestro who usually composes Refn's stuff).Of the two, I prefer I Care A Lot, even though people warned me of how it's basically the tale of two vile and unlikeable factions trying to destroy one another, while Flinch was supposedly worthy of Refn's Drive. Basically, I Care A Lot was over-hyped; Flinch was an underrated treasure. I can't say I'm on-board.With I Care A Lot, I got an original and oft-surprising story about fairly horrid people. With Flinch, I got an extremely horrid person thinking he's a part of the Drive universe while he's really in 365 Days. If both Flinch and I Care A Lot are indeed poison, forgive me that I pick the latter.It may be that some of the angrier critics turned I Care A Lot off after the first scene, where shady legal guardian Marla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) gloats about being a woman making progress in a man's world, even as what she's revealed to be succeeding with is both cruel and dishonest. These days, a scene like this creates the expectation that the film shall invariably condone this woman's actions, the same way Captain Marvel will seem justified in breaking a man's hand and stealing his motorcycle (without any sort of ""Terminator 2 moment"" where she learns that we don't operate like that on Planet Earth), long as any female-on-male violence is framed as vengeance toward the patriarchy.However, it becomes pretty clear that we're not exactly meant to admire Marla as some infallible Girl Boss (not that certain viewers won't do this regardless, the same as they've already done with the vengeful Cassie from Promising Young Woman). We learn of her elaborate schemes, where she forges documents to make it seem as if various elders can no longer care for themselves, and so becomes their legal guardian as they're forced to rot in a retirement home. One day, she puts away the wrong person and soon has gangsters and assassins following her every move.The story takes many interesting turns (albeit not always convincingly) and the supporting cast is fun to watch throughout, with Peter Dinklage, Dianne Wiest, Eiza González, Chris Messina, and a deliciously hammy Nicholas Logan having one helluva time in their roles. The score, as I've implied, has a major Oneohtrix Point Never feel, which is certainly fine by me, even though a few sections sound outright derivative -- or like slightly-too-similar homages to the Uncut Gems soundtrack. Flinch might get more clicks from me on Spotify, I'll give it that. Happy now, film bros?",I Care a Lot
108,danybur,A film that inevitably derails towards the implausible after its gender turn.,5,28 February 2021,"AbstractIt is a shame that after a powerful and fast-paced start on the interesting (little known) theme of the official guardianship of the elderly and its abuses, the story experiences a gender shift that subjects its protagonist to a series of unbelievable incidents (which some will still enjoy). For this reason, the promising character of Rosamund Pike ends up becoming a stereotype lacking in depth and with little credible decisions, even for a genre film, and that ends up trivializing what it represents.Best: Dianne Wiest's acting and character.ReviewMarla Grayson (Rosamund Pike) has set up a system of medical and judicial contacts and a company to obtain legal and official guardianship of elderly people without relatives who are declared incapable and thus be able to manage their assets to pay for their geriatric hospitalization and stay with the rest. But her oiled state-backed plundering mechanism will encounter unexpected complications when she takes it over as Jennifer Peterson's (Dianne Wiest) tutor.J Blakeson's film has a powerful and promising beginning, as it informs us of a little-known legal procedure regarding the intervention of the state in the face of unprotected elderly people and does so with harshness, good rhythm and a certain tone of black comedy .Serious problems arise (for the protagonist, but also for the film) when characters from Peterson's environment appear on the scene, producing a narrative twist that takes the story to the terrain of the mobster thriller. It is in this long segment where the initial problem is lost sight of (almost reduced to an excuse) and the story begins to accumulate incoherencies and implausibilities that make what happens very little credible, even within the conventions of a genre film.Also because of this, the unscrupulous villain of Pike ends up consolidating a stereotypical character, lacking in depth, with little credible decisions.

In reality, I'm not totally sure what incensed people so: sure, it's not amazing, and I have certainly seen better, but it is also not unenjoyable, a whimsical film as much as it is violent and depraved.I will certainly give credit where it is due: the plot was unusual and therefore engaging, tackling the murky idea of legally-appointed guardians in a ruthless world. The world in which this occurs is bright and sharp, a pleasing aesthetic that complemented the tone without trying too hard. Pike (Marla) is indeed strong in the titular role, although not a patch on her unbelievable performance in ""Gone Girl"", plus her relationship with co-worker Eiza Gonzalez (Fran) is unconvincing. It was good to see Dinklage again as a baddie, playing a semi-comedic antagonist who has everything but craves more. The rest of the cast is decent too, so no real qualms there.The story does change tone quite aggressively about halfway through, shifting from a more cerebral legal tussle to a slightly orthodox action thriller; I wasn't a fan of this, but I understand that the legal principles they were taking liberties with could only stretch so far without becoming incredulous. The much-maligned ending I honestly found to be a nice way to wrap the story up, so I am confused as to people's discontent there.Overall, will I remember this film fondly?

115,cordenw,I thought I was being too critical until I read some of the reviews,2,28 February 2021,"Sometimes I think I'm being too harsh and that my expectations are too high but I came out of the movie feeling much the same as lot of reviewers did...... and that feeling is one of disappointment.It could have been a great movie but I got flat acting from Rosamund Pike and a storyline with movie tricks that stretched my imagination beyond snapping point.It's about a sleazebag woman who uses a gullible legal system to allow her to get control of the finances and lives of well-off elderly victims. In this movie she picks on the wrong one.Sure, the storyline has a good premise and potential but it's really ruined by ridiculous events and the portrayal of everybody but the anti-heroine as bumbling fools. The courts, the staff, the hospital personnel, her enemies, they're all unwitting, clueless idiots.There wasn't much room for anyone other than Rosamund in the plot and therefore she takes up most of the screen time... and although I think she's beautiful, I think she was badly miscast.Talking about movie tricks....there's a scene borrowed from ""The Poseidon Adventure"", (anyone remember Shelley Winters?), where Rosamund is trapped in a car underwater. It is so cringingly bad, with a plot addition so unnecessary, that I wonder how the people in the editing department managed to get through it. ......Just terrible.Overall, a good story ruined by a bad director, a bad script and over-the-top unbelievable escape scenes.It's sort of blemished the memory of the perfect role she played in ""Barney's Version"" but not so bad that I won't watch her in another film.... pretty darn close though.",I Care a Lot
116,aprilsfriendorin,Entertaining dark comedy that deserves better reviews,8,21 February 2021,"I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews here. I'm sure most of them are from a) people who didn't understand the movie, b) people who are mad that the main character is a woman, or c) people who take things too seriously. Yes, some parts are not all that realistic, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyability of the movie. I've seen some people complain that the main character is ""too evil,"" but honestly that makes it more fun to watch. I think going the ""Joker"" route and making people feel bad for her would be too cheesy.Ultimately, the movie was exciting, interesting, and definitely incited emotions. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a stick up their ass.",I Care a Lot
117,coasterdude44,"I didn't like it, and this is coming from someone who can like almost anything",3,21 February 2021,"This film has a few redeeming factors. It's very well shot and directed, the music was good, it had some good acting in it, and it had Peter Dinklage in it.Apart from that, everything just quickly fell apart for me on this one. For one thing, the main character played by Rosamund Pike was a complete manipulative sociopath and didn't have a shred of likeability or any factor to root for because she was just so shallow. There was no backstory about her or nothing about her to feel sorry or bad about, or anything complicated or well thought out that could make her an interesting villain with any human tendencies. She was just a ruthless little b*tch who wanted to see just how far it could get and that's it.There was no character development for anyone in any point of the movie. Peter Dinklage's character was the only character that came close to that, and was the only one I felt bad for and was rooting for, simply because I wanted to see his mother get back. I also don't think him constantly acting pissed of was all that hard for him either, with his history on Game of Thrones and how his character on that show was left in complete and utter shambles with just how that show ended with 8 years of build up.Anyway, this movie is just plain bad and is a disgraceful message to actual real care homes and nurses who actually care for sick and old people, instead of it being forced upon them by sociopaths masquerading as real catersI cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone.",I Care a Lot
118,Mivas_Greece,"A light, a bit humorous perspective of a common social issue, frauds against aged people. Highly entertaining film, but with many social messages too. Worth a watch.",6,11 April 2021,"Social/crime movie with some humorous elements. The film shows in a light-air way the exploitation of elderly people who have either a good pension or some assets, by circuits of legal guardians. There are plenty of such examples in reality, but here it is presented with a light element and some humorous elements. The dynamic protagonist among a world full of predators and preys, prefers to be herself a great predator, a lioness, having set up a profitable and organized business of exploiting the elderly, where for their ""good"" they are locked up in a nursing home, without any freedom or communication with the outside world, without contact with family and while they now manage the property of their victims. But for her bad luck, her last victim is the mother of a godfather, so a ""war"" begins between two immoral sides where the viewer cannot support either of them. The evolution of the story is quite light without becoming a thriller or drama, and we have a conflict between a cruel and ruthless homosexual crooked legal guardian on the one hand and a dwarf Godfather on the other. So which one of them is going to win? Is there justice after all? Is a draw perhaps fairer for such opponents? The ending is quite surprising and generally worth a watch without being a naturally serious or dramatic film. It is primarily entertaining movie, but it also has social messages.",I Care a Lot

120,hunter-friesen,Devilishly entertaining,7,4 March 2021,"Have you ever stopped to think about how we treat our elderly in America? Once they reach a certain age and things start to get more difficult, we ship them off to a glorified daycare that they never return from. It's a process we never want to think about, as it gives us a guilty conscience. But that exact feeling of guilt and shame is something that writer/director J Blakeson wants you to confront in his new film ""I Care a Lot"", a part social satire, part crime thriller.""I'm not a lamb, I'm a (expletive) lioness,"" says Marla Grayson as she opens the movie shunning us, the audience, for thinking we're good people when we enable her to do so much evil. Marla is a state-appointed legal guardian who looks after elderly people that are deemed too unwell to care for themselves. Marla swoops in, ships the person to a secure retirement home, and seizes all their assets for herself. It's a lucrative occupation that is buoyed by an American public unwilling to care for their own.""I Care a Lot"" is as black as a black comedy can be. There is not one single nice character within this whole movie, and not one single nice deed is done. It's two hours of theft, manipulation, and in some cases, murder.The first half of the film dives deep into the scandalous nature of retirement care, which is treated as a crime ring. The process starts as Marla uses her doctor contact to scout patients that are both wealthy and healthy enough to be a perennial cash cow. In exchange for a monetary sum, the doctor recommends to a judge that Marla be the patient's guardian. Marla then auctions off the patient's belongings, using the funds to pay herself and the exorbitant retirement home fees she's negotiated under-the-table with the manager. It's a grueling process that becomes harder to stomach as time goes on, but Blakeson doesn't want us to look away, he wants to see what we're complicit in.Rosamund Pike plays Marla in a role she was born to play. Sporting a sharp blonde bob, stunning suits, and taking huge drags from the world's largest vape pen, Pike commands the screen every second she's on. It's a towering performance similar to that of her Oscar-nominated role in ""Gone Girl"". She's certifiably crazy, extremely ambitious, and scary as hell. Pike has already been Golden Globe nominated this year for Best Performance in a Comedy, which is ironic since the only kind of laughing I did while watching this was nervous laughter.With the second half, Blakeson takes a sharp turn away from social satire and into an increasingly wild crime thriller. Marla has taken a ""golden goose"" under her care, someone named Jennifer Peterson (a perfect Dianne Wiest) that has no living family and a lot of money to spend on medical fees. But, the predator quickly becomes the prey as it is discovered that Jennifer isn't who they think she is. Turns out she's connected to the Russian mafia, run by a sadistic Peter Dinklage.This is the part of the movie where you will either throw your hands up in disgust or gleefully delve into the chaotic mess. The second half is inferior to the first as it trades its bite for conventional plotting. It also tests your connection with Marla as you instinctively root for her to win against the mafia, even though she clearly is the villain in the grand scheme of things. At times you wonder who is worse between the two of them. Even then, there is a lot of fun to be had watching her get out of this deadly situation. You do have to suspend some disbelief, but what movie doesn't make you do that?The score by Marc Canham takes a lot of inspiration from the Safdie Brothers' ""Uncut Gems"". Like the tonal shift of the plot, the synthesized music starts playful, but gets darker as Marla descends into the criminal underworld.""I Care a Lot"" is a pitch-black comedy in the similar vein of ""Gone Girl"" and ""Uncut Gems"". It's both a scathing satire on the retirement system in America and an entertaining crime thriller boasting a terrific performance from leading lady Rosamund Pike.",I Care a Lot

Marla here is absolutely not a heart-of-gold Robbing Hood, openly declaring she's out for herself only with a single minded goal. Basic grift of ripping off boomer seniors is tasteless and has no redemption arc but a last minute resolution of sorts.

For a while that fun story line holds up. Then, like a raging rapids, plot holes galore spring up everywhere. Greyson is kidnaped and tied up. She knows where millions of dollars of diamonds are hidden. Roman, a Russian Mafia boss describes how he cut off fingers during one of his prior interrogations. He asks, where are the diamonds. Greyson won't tell him. Does he cut her fingers off? Does he use acid on her pretty face? No, Roman does not torture her at all except for a few seconds of torture 'light' bag over her head Instead Roman tells his men to take her away and kill her. What happened to the guy who cuts off body parts especially here where knows where his millions of diamonds are? At the same time his men fine Greyson's pretty sidekick/lover. Do they kill her? No. Do they take her to Roman so that Roman can put a gun to her head and tell Greyson, you have ten seconds to tell me where the diamonds are or I blow off her head? Nope. They beat her up and leave her ALIVE. Where any run of the mill mafia execution would be a simple bullet to the head and a coup de grace here his inept men go thru all the hoops to set Greyson up in her car and then send her, still very much alive, into a lake. Then, the make no effort to wait to confirm she died which allows her to simply escape from the car and swim to the surface. Roman's attorney gets a hearing regarding Roman's mother except the attorney does not represent the mother so such hearing is not possible. Even the final scene is inept. We know that many people have survived multiple gunshots and here Greyson is shot once in the chest. Did she die? At this point no one knows and no one cares.",I Care a Lot
126,repojack,Where's Jimmy/Saul Goodman from Better Call Saul when you need him?,7,21 February 2021,"Seriously, this was fun to watch. The director J Blakeson has matured a lot as he channels the Coen brothers. After writing the horrible Descent 2 and directing the forgettable The Fifth Wave, he gets most of the pieces working for I Care a Lot.All the acting, from headliners to cameos, were great:
* Macon Blair in the beginning -- totally felt like several deleted scenes from Blue Ruin* Rosamund Pike going full evil in her best role since Gone Girl.* Dianne West as a fantastic bad-ass senior. She's an excellent match for Rosamund Pike.* Peter Dinklage as a surprisingly muscular mobster ripped from John Wick. (Wait, maybe Pike's character is related to Wick? Now that would be interesting.)The soundtrack is excellent, from the opening song to the Carpenter-esq synths.But there are a few plot holes that don't make sense ... if Rosamund Pike's character is so suave and clever, it seems to me she'd drop the case once the sleazy lawyer started threatening her; and Peter Dinklage, as the nefarious crime lord, employs completely moronic goons.This is a divisive film based on other reviews. Fortunately I was able to take it for what it was -- outrageous and entertaining.",I Care a Lot
127,howboutthisone_huh,rosamund pike is such a pioneer,5,23 February 2021,"I agree, it's long overdue to change the image of women from saints to sinners. It's refreshing to see that a woman can be just as despicable as a man. A woman can be a wolf of wall street, only in this film, there is no fall from grace; no karma biting. Unfortunately in real life this happens quite a bit but this film is not a public service message. It's just another example of the new right order which says that bad behavior is okay so long as it's for the right reasons like changing traditional stereotypes. What's next for Ms. Pike, the biography of griselda blanco. Sorry but that's been done already by catherine zeta-jones. To be fair, there are no likeable heros, or anti-heros in this film. The only moral message you come away with is that it's okay to rob the elderly of their lives and leave the carcasses in the street. But the producers are clever about it because the film is not about the elderly. The care homes in this film are concierge, cadillac care homes compared to where most elderly end up in real life. I mean if they showed actual care homes, the public might actually think part of this film was about the elderly and they don't want that.

Also, she explained well that if you want to be successful, you must be ready to walk over a lot of dead people. However, when she did the same to a mother of a Russian mobster, she was in trouble. The Russian mobster wanted to kill her and her girlfriend but he failed because they were American so they had superpowers. Against American, gay and merciless ladies - Russians stood no chance. In the end two of them beat Russian mafia. Being so impressed, Russian mobster boss begged them to become their partner in crime. I wonder why America didn't use such brilliant women to conquer the world and not spend billions of dollars for US army instead? America lost lots of good soldiers when killing helpless people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Korea, Serbia ... should have sent two of them and had no losses because they are merciless and undefeatable.

It's twisted, yes the characters are as much twisted but they are fun to watch. There was not a minute without a thrill. I mean in the beginning it hurts to be rooting for the bad character and you wonder if she has a good side as well but then the clients she rips and dupes....and then twists and turns until the end. Won't spoil it for tou. It's a great watch and definitely recommended. Watch it for slick script and the awesome Rosamund Pike in the lead character. She shines in this one, throughout....!",I Care a Lot
131,plasticanimalz,Mmm...,7,19 May 2021,"Despite how unlikable Rosamund Pike's character is, you start to get into the film, despite her despicable actions. I mean, we all have mothers, so, you really hate her and want the worst for her. The script is well written, and it's well done, so, I was actually enjoying it for a bit...until the last 20-30 minutes, and, that's where it starts to unravel. The problem with sociopaths as your anti-hero is that it's really hard to wrap it up. Sure, with a TV show they've figured out the formula to make unlikable people likable by developing many facets to the character. This tries to make Rosamund's character likable by saying she does care about one person...but, that's just not enough. At that point I was like, ""This is written by a dude."" It just had dude all over it. I mean, there were some signs earlier on it was a dude, like, suddenly she's a lesbian, and, what does it really have to do with the character? But, I was willing to let some things slide. Like, despite the gratuitousness of it, it actually became a plus for me...but, again, it's just not enough for me to like her character.Basically, it just kind of felt like a cop-out by the end, like, the writer didn't know how to finish it, then he wrapped it up in a bow. I just felt if he was going to work that hard on the first 90 minutes, why not make the whole thing work?. Grant it, it does all seem pretty unrealistic, but, I was willing, and hoping that this can not actually happen.Also, the writer, basically must not have a soul. Like, sold out for a buck. You know some people are going to look at this and look up to her character in some way. I think the writer could have written a movie about a dark, terrible human being and still made it work by the end. The Wolf of Wall Street, the dude is human garbage but it's a good movie and has a good ending. The Founder is a really engaging movie and you actually admire Ray Kroc by the end, but then take a step back, and say, wait, Ray Kroc is garbage, but the movie still makes you like him, despite...you don't like him. Eat, Pray, Love is a great book, but by the very end, you're like, she's a terrible person...but, she has no awareness of how terrible she is, but you like the book anyway. So, it is possible to make terrible people likable, this just didn't do it. Maybe 'cause she messes with old people? I don't know. It would be hard to make someone who messes with babies or animals likable, so, sure, he had his work cut out for him ending this script, but, still, meet the challenge or do something else, dude.",I Care a Lot

Early on we are all rooting for the Russian mob and loathing the arrogant guardian. But the film is ridiculous in almost every sense and takes full advantage of artistic freedoms, not even bothering to make the premise believable starting with a dwarf crime boss, comedic strong-arms, and a masculine blond with a severe haircut who always has a vape pipe in her fingers, not to mention there is no such easy way to scam elderly (and sadly many foreign reviewers think it's a real thing after watching this comedy -- well, there's no pill for common sense). There are zero cases of one doctor who has never seen the patient causing them to be a ward of the court for a for-profit institution. I think the actors all did a great job but in saying that, I do think they all played it as a cheesy comedy -- with a bit of satisfaction finally at the end.

134,Nightmarelogic,A story about bad people doing bad things,5,28 February 2021,I read a bunch of reviews of people wondering who they were supposed to root for like they never watched a movie about bad people doing bad things before. If you need someone to root for and hope wins there really isn't any and this isn't the movie for you. Is it realistic? Maybe maybe not. If you think things like this can never happen just look at Britney Spears who has literally been declared incompetant by her own father and has all her money in his care. So whoever says something like this cannot happen is a fool. The right person. The right judge.Now was it a good story? I don't know.

135,phoenixinvictus,I don't care to watch this ever again,1,17 April 2021,"Rosamund Pike is a great actress and I doubt that anybody could play a more villainous character better than her. I liked this movie for about two thirds of the way until I saw that it was going down the same road as Gone girl.This movie claims to be about a broken system that allows evil people like Marla to profit at the expense of helpless people. Right from the beginning we hear Marla's speeches about being a Lioness, that she is a strong woman in a world of threatened men. She isn't a Lioness she is a scavenger more like an ugly hyena. The writers tried to cheer her on as a woman gets the upper hand on a man... This would be okay if she were likable and not stealing from the elderly. This is almost as bad as asking the viewer to cheer for a child murder. It's obscene.The writers actually forget all about the Dianne Wiest's character and focused on the cat-and-mouse game with a Russian mobster. Peter Dinklage's character is a mob boss who exploits innocent girls and I can't like him. Nobody in this entire movie is ""likeable"" except maybe for Feldstrom (even then I can't like him because of his offensive comments to Marla about being violated) who in the beginning is trying to rescue his mother from the evil clutches of Marla. Feldstrom's fate is the saddest of all who will go to jail for doing the right thing by killing her. Marla manipulates the system and going through the legal channels would take too long.The mob lawyer claimed to Marla that she'd ""be uncomfortable until you're not able to be uncomfortable or comfortable ever again"" seems like misdirection because we never see that promise. In the end what made me sick was when Peter Dinklage's character suggests they should become partners after putting his mom (and his character) through hell. As a mob boss he's incompetent. I wish I hadn't watched this movie.",I Care a Lot
136,Golden_Hope,Takes Swing but Missing Them All,4,22 February 2021,"This film has lots of issues.I think the biggest issue is that lead character. I think the writer was trying to create a anti-hero character that was so fabulous and like cold that everyone would love her, someone like Miranda Priestly from Devil Wears Prada or Chanel from Scream Queens. Someone who is a bad person but is so fabulous that you kind of forgive them. And this character just wasn't that. She wasn't cutting enough like the previously mentioned characters, that isn't the fault of the actor, it is the writing and filmmaking. The thing that both the things i mentioned have that this movie lacks is Camp. They are both dripping in camp and that is what makes them work. This movie doesn't have that. It doesn't have them campy lines that make you laugh and stick in your head. I think this movie would have been improved so much if it just had that sort of cheekiness and really sharp cutting one liners.Because the character isn't strong enough or likeable enough it makes you disconnect with her. She does horrible things to these poor old people. That single line there is her whole character. We know nothing about her and we don't really learn anything more than that. This make it incredibly hard to sympathise with her when the one thing we know is she is awful. She is incredibly one dimensional.I also think the pacing if pretty bad. It got to a point in the movie that seemed like the climax then i checked and it still had 40 unites left.It doesn't look too bad so that is one positive. I think i didn't like that it devolved into such a played out thriller trapping.I actually think that there is a great idea in here, however i think that it should be flipped. I think that it would make a better movie if we followed the story of someone who had been conned by this woman or maybe a family member trying to save their parent and the villain of the story was the woman who is taking advantage of these people.

The film is based on a true story, but tells it in its own unique and entertaining way. With a runtime of just under 2 hours, the film straight up makes it clear who the villain is. Marla Grayson is a legal guardian who is taking advantage of the often weak minded elderly people. The whole operation she is running is totally a scam. The court system is corrupt and are incredibly naive and dumbfounded.The story progressed rather quickly and eloquently. It never felt slow paced. With each passing second, you want to know more. You become totally immersed in the story.Rosamund Pike's character Marla Grayson kind of resembled Amy Dunne in David Fincher's ""Gone Girl."" Both of the characters are strong, independent, rebellious women who have gone against the system.Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage stood out in the film. Their performances were truly top notch and Oscar worthy. In the end, the bad guys (or dare I say gals) won (kind of). It was truly cathartic when Mr. Feldstrom shot Marla at the very end. She did ruin his life and his relationship with his mother. It is understandable why he wanted payback.To conclude, ""I Care a Lot"" will certainly entertain you, but it will also leave you shocked and utterly speechless. It is truly horrific and sad that this film is based on a true story. No human being should be treated that way.

Then the crime parts came in and it didn't really feel realistic anymore. But that's not to say that this film isn't entertaining as hell.
(I was cheering for ""the bad side"" with Peter Dinklage for the majority of the film because of the scummy scandalous things Rosamund Pikes ""Marla Grayson"" was doing in her business.)
The film is filled with great cinematography, a very synthy electronic score that felt like it was almost out of Stranger Things, and some amazing performances by almost all parties.
There was some weird scenes of Marla Grayson just working out randomly spliced in throughout the film which I felt had no point of really being there, but other than that it stayed pretty grounded and never strayed too far off it's plot. Although there were some points that just felt unneeded and probably could've been cut in the end.
Overall a great movie that's just solid all the way around, especially for a Netflix film.",I Care a Lot

This movie has a lot of surprising plot twists, it keeps subverting expectations and the inherent will of anyone watching this hoping people like Marla get caught.The acting is amazing, A1, and the cast is very well picked.The only problem with this movie is that we get away from the very thing this movie is highlighting, legal guardians taking advantage of the people under their care.",I Care a Lot
145,ScoobySnacks66,Few redeeming qualities,3,8 March 2021,"Rosamund Pike does an excellent job bringing a character to life that nearly every person who's wasted their time watching this train wreck of a film, truly and completely hate. She plays a despicable, sociopath bent on rinsing old, retired elderly people of their money and estates by placing them in care facilities while she moves in like a filthy leech, draining them of their savings and selling off their possessions and homes. The film actually does a good job bringing attention to a horrifying practice that is likely happening to many elderly citizens across America but the trouble is, there is no one to cheer for, there is no hero, there is no light, there is no virtue, there is only a bunch of assholes with zero redeeming qualities and while it's positioned as a dark comedy, my girlfriend and I hated the characters so much we couldn't finish watching it. We turned it off in disgust. Although I know this level of organized crime exists, and there are many sociopaths willing to destroy other people in pursuit of their own sick materialistic goals, I'd rather see a well written documentary on the issue, and not have it thematically masquerading as what I originally thought might be a fun, comedic diversion for 90 minutes.",I Care a Lot

Even if we won't take into account the whole impossibility of such scenario in real life, in order for the scam to work EVERYBODY needs to be in on it. Down to the last nurse or cleaner. Even if law enforcement is as incompetent as shown in the movie and obviously ""fem power in police supports one another"" in that movie, this kind of scam would easily draw attention of multiple organizations whether private or state sponsored for any number of reasons.Funny enough they mentioned Russian mafia, as in the post soviet era of the 90'th, there was a practice of stealing the apartments from lone elderly people, while the whole country was in complete and utter disarray.So another thing, even though the whole concept is ridiculous this movie fills you with actual disgust towards main anti-hero. Yes, she get what she deserves at the end but it should have happened before.The only reason i didn't give this one 3 stars is because of Pike's performance. It's rare that you feel such a disgust against anti-hero in a movie, and she fitted perfectly to the role.It's sh... all the way.",I Care a Lot

She s not alone, a whole business is on: a retirement home director, a doctor and her lover, a young woman.
Everything goes wrong after she is ,,sold,, a cherry case, as they say, of an alone woman who has a son who faked his death because he is the head of a ruthless mafia org.This is not intended to be o moralizing movie. It was filmed just like an action movie with Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal. But the trick is that it is done so that people get tricket by its tropes.

There's also the option that you just find it entertaining so you don't care either way.By the rating I've given the film not only did I not enjoy the main character but I didn't enjoy how the story carried out. I gave up with 20 minutes left of the film. It almost feels like several different people wrote,directed and filmed this movie. The first quarter of the movie was good but after that it just becomes like HomeAlone meets Mission Impossible meets Tyrion Lannister. It's just bad. I'm upset at myself for sitting down to watch this movie.I just don't get what the creators of the film were going for and where they were trying to lead the audience.

But as it went on I started to lose track of who I was supporting. They were all nasty. So it was a test of the worse baddy.I liked the story arc to a point. Until the last act. This is where I faded a little and the story lost me. The story had lots of strands to pull on but surprisingly some of the characters, who had a great intro, just faded into the background. They had no end to their story. You just never saw them again.The last act reminded me of the amazing film Layer Cake. But the ending in this one never quite hit the mark. A film that kept me guessing defaulted to a whimper at the end. It wasn't bad, but I expected better.The quality of this film was great. The cast and cinematography was top notch. Very visual. Great lighting. Powerful colour grading. Lovely scenes. Nothing negative here at all.I gave this a strong 6.

Pike is great, the story takes a lot of great twists and turns and the dialogue is always snappy and enjoyable. The direction is good all round and the characters are really interesting, if not particularly rootable as I mentioned before. The costumes are great and, as much as I thought the third act was weaker, the final scene put a great cap on the film as a whole. It's also really, really funny.

Now comes ""I Care a Lot,"" and finally we have a a wildly entertaining twisted work of art. Sure, the movie infuriates these negative reviewers because the victims depicted are innocent, helpless, and easily manipulated. But herein lies the first dark twist - in this world, the ""victim"" is the opposite of helpless, making the point even more that a greedy, corrupt system can make mistakes which exposes their fraud then karma is on the way. That karmic justice is the underlying theme in this movie, putting you in the uncomfortable ride of rooting for bad people. Just ride with it and see where it takes you!As much as all the acting is superb - from Pike, Dinklage, Messina, Wiest - the storytelling of this dark comedy could easily become even more excellent under the nuanced stylings of Quentin Tarantino.

159,cappiethadog,Marla and Fran,8,22 April 2021,"This is the scene from ""Thelma and Louise"" that sealed the deal for Callie Khouri when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences bestowed her with the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 1992. This is the scene that filmmaker Ridley Scott, then known for high octane sci-fi/action films such as ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"", needed to get right. Louise Sawyer(Susan Sarandon), wanted for questioning by the FBI in the parking lot shooting death of a notorious lothario, sits alone in the passenger seat of a blue 1966 Thunderbird, while her partner-in-crime, Thelma Dickinson(Geena Davis), walks across a dusty road to pick up a few things at the grocery store. Unbeknownst to Thelma, two old women, from their picture window, have been monitoring the sad woman with self-recognition, ever since Thelma turned off the engine. Her disillusionment with life is visible with every breath she takes. They don't need to know the particulars of Louise's story, intuiting for themselves that it's the same story women of a certain generation were fed as girls: Find a man, get married, rear children, settle down, and happiness will follow. At first, Louise rejects their unwarranted pity, using her lipstick as a weapon to put some distance between her relative youth and their inevitable disintegration. But the waitress' reflection in the rearview window is a rude awakening; she puts down the tube and succumbs to the outreach of sisterhood with resignation. Louise, in essence, meets her future self, an aging spinster, because she didn't settle for Jimmy(Michael Madsen), her off-and-on boyfriend, betting wrong that there would be other men, other marriage proposals. Conversely, in ""I Care a Lot"", directed by J Blakeson, a woman, a senior citizen, admiringly winks at Marla Grayson(Rosamund Pike), epitomizing the liberated woman in this post-""Thelma and Louise"" narrative of feminists gone wild.""I was once like you,"" confesses the self-described lioness, at the outset of ""I Care a Lot"", an origin story that is only hinted at, in a rare moment of introspection when Marla wasn't so super. Some life-changing event, we suspect, flicked on a switch in Marla Grayson's mind that transformed her from ""prey"" to ""predator"", a health care professional with teeth, all pearly white and sharp. The first-person narration coincides with the arrival of a man, an adult son, at a nursing home, being wrestled to the ground by security, who denies him, not for the first time, apparently, the right to visit his mother. Whereas Marla's years as prey is only hinted at during the guardian's interior monologue, in the Ridley Scott film, the audience watches Louise, a rape survivor, turn into a predator before their very eyes. After intervening on Thelma's behalf in the parking lot, she shoots Harlan(Timothy Carhart), her best friend's attacker, dead in cold blood after he utters one too many obscenity-laced insults. Harlan had presumed wrong that a woman wouldn't pull the trigger. As a point of emphasis, in ""I Care a Lot"", Marla never carries any firearms; her mouth is a lethal weapon, a gun. Feldstrom(Macon Blair), the adult son who was denied his visitation rights, confronts her mother's legal guardian outside the courthouse, where he failed to extricate the statutory looter from their lives. Fran(Eliza Gonzalez), Marla's partner-in-crime(and life partner), stands idly by while her lover emasculates Feldstrom, whose projectile spit unleashes in the lioness a maelstrom of expletives that annihilates the overmatched man without any blood spilling. Strong women, both, intimidating even, women to be reckoned with, Marla and Fran, despite being free from the systemic patriarchy which took their predecessors awhile to untangle themselves from, these unprincipled ladies are more post-feminists than feminists. Thelma robs the grocery store out of necessity; she didn't want to beg Daryl(Christopher McDonald), her husband, for money. Thelma makes the policeman cry out of necessity, not pleasure; he posed a roadblock to Mexico. Thelma and Louise blow up a gas truck out of necessity; the driver had made obscene gestures and off-color remarks on each road passing. For Marla and Fran, crime is fun and games. That pensioner who winks at Marla sees a heroine, a real man-eater, never guessing that this predator cannibalizes her own kind, too.People are commodities. A wealthy retiree with no known family; no pesky relatives who come out of the woodworks to claim their inheritance money when the oldster passes on, is coined a ""cherry"" in the lexicon of lionesses. The term encompasses both sexes, male and female, because in the eyes of insiders like Dr. Karen Amos(Alicia Witt), and others of her ilk, old people are less human than living breathing banks. The latest cherry, Jennifer Peterson(Diane Wiest), turns out to be a mock bing. Jennifer Peterson is an alias for the mother of a Russian drug kingpin, Roman Lunyov(Peter Dinkage), who precipitates Marla's retrogression. Prey, once again, tied up in a chair, Marla forgets how to play the victim, openly mocking her apprehender's dwarfism. It's suicide, in a sense, six degrees of Louise driving the Thunderbird off the cliff. She doesn't want the little Russian person to see her cry. Like Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer, fugitives of the law by circumstance, Marla Grayson would rather die than compromise. Prison time, real prison time awaits them, but their lives, women's lives: one, a waitress pining over her non-committal beau; the other, a homemaker taken for granted by a cheating husband, the regional manager of a wholesale carpet warehouse, were prisons in their own right, servants in a patriarchal hell. Marla, on the other hand, can't bring herself to be acquiescent when Roman gives the ""brave, but stupid woman,"" an out; release Jennifer Peterson from her malfeasant guardianship or die. The predator, who used to be the prey, has come full circle, sentenced to death by a person, a man, with more power than her, a lion.Both women were armed, the housewife and the waitress; they could have gone down shooting, just like Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid(Robert Redford), outnumbered, but with the same fatalistic and determined us against them mentality. The year, however, was 1991. Women in movies didn't do that, kill indiscriminately; in this case, policemen just doing their jobs, so Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer made a spur-of-the-moment suicide pact, then drove their car into the Grand Canyon. Both films end with a freeze-frame; we know that the two desperados go down in a hail of bullets; we know the Thunderbird will not be needing any body work when they find the flaming wreckage at the bottom of the canyon. The men look strong. The women look weak. Marla is the opposite of weak and performatively speaking, the opposite of female. Marla wakes up from her drug-induced state in the midst of a staged suicide attempt. The trees don't get her, but the lake does. Marla's determined swim to reach the water's surface retells the origin story in miniature of her climb up the American corporate ladder. It's harder for a woman. She put in the time, though; all those hours on the exercise bike at the gym with low-key lighting; all those hours in the office fending off unwanted sexual advances and being passed over for promotion by idiots. Most women would have drowned, but most women are not Marla Grayson. The lioness emerges from the lake, reduced by her near-death experience; a dislodged tooth, soaked from head-to-toe in dirty lake water, and the humiliation of being born again; a damsel in distress.Marla walks into a convenience store. She could be prey, an assaulted woman, but the man behind the register could care less. He asks no questions. An opportunist, the cashier doesn't wave Marla's offer of fifty dollars for the use of his cellphone. For warmth, Marla leans her face against the hot dog roller, a reflexive memory, perhaps, of days past when she was a child; poor, with a mother, possibly abusive. What muse be eons for Marla, who has been self-reliant for so many years, asks a man for help: ""Can you call me a cab?""A little oral surgery and Marla is back at the top of her game. In short order, she sells out, teaming up with Roman to monopolize the nursing home industry. Marla may be a lioness, and Fran, the lioness' mate, but man is still king of the jungle; a sharp-dressed dwarf with a well-manicured beard. And although a lion, even a lady lion, is a fierce and intimidating animal, there are men who hunt big game. Feldstrom doesn't have a trophy room. He's not a (wo)man-eater. In the hunter's eyes, his mom, in her prime, was a lioness, too. Marla broke up his mother's pride. Marla thought the judge was the law, and the courtroom, a jungle. She forgot about poachers. She should have known better than anybody that rules were meant to be broken.""I Care a Lot"" punishes the woman. But not for the usual reasons that you mostly see in horror movies. Marla is punished for acting like a lion. The kingdom belongs to Fran.Fran is the final lioness.",I Care a Lot

A dark, hilarious, disconcerting satire, so fiendishly clever that it has gone right over the heads of at least 80% of IMDB reviewers. Scan the reviews for this movie and you'll find apoplectic rants about how ""disgusting"" the movie is, as though it's actually advocating elder abuse on a corporate scale. Or lamenting how appalling and unlikeable the characters are, as though we're supposed to like them. In fact, I Care A Lot is based directly on a number of disturbing trends in the aged care sector around the globe, in particular the increasingly corporate face of ""care"", which is increasingly a code word for exploitation and callousness. The movie viciously satirises both corporate aged care in particular, and unbridled capitalism in general. With Marla Grayson, Rosamund Pike creates a character as chilling and monstrous - and as timely - as Faye Dunaway's Diana Christenson in Network or Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Dianne Wiest is, as ever, excellent as the client who becomes Grayson's worst nightmare, while Peter Dinklage adds an absurd edge to the crime boss determined to take Grayson down. The barrage of one star reviews for a film that may well be a timeless masterpiece and is certainly one of the best scripted and most intelligently executed films in ages is, to put it mildly, disconcerting.

To think that such things happened in real life makes me want to lose faith in humanity. Organized crime at its 'finest'.
And then, the tone of the movie changed real soon. A few twists here and there, it was no longer an anxiety-stirring, impressive but disgusting movie but it became predictable and clichéd. They did do some damage control towards the end but overall, interesting first half, so-so latter.
The plot though, you'll have to given the movie some ""cinematic liberty and conveniences and play along, so it was.....slightly messy, IMO.

Rosamund Pike's performance was Marla Grayson was very good, but we know from her role in Gone Girl that she can play a sociopath extremely well. No one else really impressed me though in relation to performances... The writing was nothing amazing sadly and I just felt this film was a missed oppourtunity to be something very unique.

With only ten minutes left in the movie, I was tempted to turn it off and not even finish it - it was that bad. I mean there were lesbians and they couldn't even get that right. There are plenty in Hollywood so why not pick a couple of real ones? Next you have Americans who are somehow Russian? It's as bad as casting white dudes as Bloods, Crips, or Sureños.As of now the rating has obviously been inflated by people who feel the need to do so because it ""represents.""

176,levybob,I knew it is bad. But I had to be sure.,3,1 May 2021,"I knew 'I Care A Lot' is bad. Friends said so. Other reviewers, too. But the set-uo is intriguing. Rosamund Pike plays a scam artist who steals money and property from unsuspecting senior citizens who have been placed in her care. But her latest victim, a sweet old lady played by Diane Weist, is no one to mess with. And if the scammer had known this she likely would have sought out another victim. But she doesn't realize this. Until it's too late.Sounds good, yes? Add Peter Dinklage as the reason that the sweet old lady is no one to mess with, and you'd think you've got a great thing going. But then, somehow, the film goes wildly off-track. Wildly so. There is a comedic interlude during which three fearsome gangsters mess up a caper like The Bowery Boys. Or the Keystone Cops. Ms. Pike develops what can only be called 'super powers' (of a physical nature) as she somehow escapes meeting a horrific end. Certainly she has no super brain power as even after she learns that she's made a mistake, even after she's offered big money to undo her scam, she decides ... no. The reason? Well, if she did, there'd be no movie. And I'd have saved a couple of hours.But don't feel sorry for me.It's not like I wasn't warned.And now, so are you.",I Care a Lot

185,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A nasty film that lets you walk in the shoes of a unlikeable sociopath. It's not for everyone!,7,14 March 2021,"It is a general consensus that when writing a screenplay, the screenwriter should always have a likable protagonist the audience can relate to and subsequently root for.Writer-director J. Blakeson deliberately challenges this convention in I Care A Lot, a dark crime comedy from Netflix, that centers on an awful, unredeemable con artist Marla Grayson. Marla works as a court-appointed legal guardian for the elderly. She and her lover Fran routinely locate rich senior citizens, send them to old folks' homes through dubious legal means, and then seize their assets and milk their life savings.Marla's latest target is Jennifer Peterson, a wealthy retiree, who Marla has falsified as having dementia and unable to take care of herself. Jennifer is immediate sent to a home. It turns out that Jennifer Peterson is the mother of Roman Lunyov, a crime lord tied to the Russian Mafia. Roman isWatching I Care A Lot is like watching a trainwreck. What unfolds is an impending disaster that's spiraling down for the worse and one cannot seem to look away. The tension stems solely from ""Oh my, what's going to happen next?"" and not from how much we care about Marla or any of the characters for that matter. Audiences who are able to look away after the film's opening would probably be better off watching something else more uplifting on their Netflix recommendations. This isn't the film for you.The people who are still watching after the opening intuitively understand what's gross and stomach-turning about I Care A Lot is precisely its selling point. Marla is unlikeable and does increasingly heinous things to undeserving people. The entire film is an uncomfortable walk in Marla's shoes. The film's major selling point is it offers a rare glimpse into the psyche of a low-empathy con artist. If you were to encounter someone like Marla, it may as well be a fictitious character from your Netflix subscription and pray to God, not in real life.Rosamund Pike's performance makes the movie. Marla's face is a perpetual mask and projects a sense of plasticity and artifice behind a blank yet hungry wolf-like stare. Everything Marla does is a calculated chess move. When Marla cracks a smile, it is just enough to telegraph some form of happiness towards her prey. She is always carefully within the realm of good manners, but never genuine. Rosamund Pike's recent win for this performance at the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy is well deserved.Her performance is chilling to watch and yet fulfilling. Pike has given a face to what a functional sociopath is like and it had me reviewing and counting how many of them I have encountered in my life. It is shockingly frightening when we learn the ropes of Marla's elderly scam at the beginning. Imagine the scam happening to a grandparent or you; the idea of someone knocking on your door and completely stealing your life away from you.I was locked in and thoroughly entertained for two-thirds of I Care A Lot. Director J. Blakeson does a genre switch in the last third, while still entertaining, didn't pack the punch of what came before it. This lead to the ending, which made me realize that Blakeson was evening out the initial bitter sour taste by being crowd-pleasing.It was an okay ending. I have thought about it and discussed this with two friends and realize it is hard for this film to have a satisfying ending, due to the main character and everybody else being that unlikeable. Not to say ""I told you so"", but that's why it is a screenwriting rule.I've seen satisfying endings in stories with unlikeable protagonists achieved before, like Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood or The Safdie Brothers' Uncut Gems. I can't pinpoint what exactly it is that I Care A Lot lacked at the very end, whether it is a plot, pacing, or performance issue. I just believe there's a better way to stick that landing story-wise out there in the ether. If I read an entertainment article about the director having another ending that he was toying with for months but didn't end up doing after this review, I wouldn't be surprised.Nonetheless, I enjoyed I Care A Lot very much. It's too nasty for everybody's taste but people who enjoy the crime or noir genre will definitely enjoy it.",I Care a Lot

190,lucifer_over_tinseltown,Caring is Creepy,6,9 March 2021,"This is a polarizing one. I can understand why. Many will care an awful lot and say it is blindingly brilliant, much like Rosamund Pike's big, creepy smile (which is constantly on display in this movie). Many others will not care a crap's worth and say this one is yet another turgid turkey from hipster writer/director J Blakeson. For me, the truth lies somewhere in between. I suppose it does go too long and could use a good 20 minutes or so of scalpel-sharp editing. I know Pike received all of the accolades, but she was completely out acted and outshined by Eiza Gonzalez (reminiscent of a young, less witchy Asia Argento), Chris Messina and the always phenomenal Dianne Wiest. Gonzalez, in particular, was truly a luscious-lipped/hipped revelation. It was good seeing Dinklage in something half-way decent again, too. He balances his Lilliputian stature with Brobdingnagian talent. This film was highly publicized as a lesbian thriller, which is kind of reductive. Sure, there are a few brief, artful depictions of this, but nothing hot and heavy. Also, I think more than a few negative reviews are due to a strong female lead; and Pike is a powerhouse here. She's got a brass set. This tends to intimidate beta men who masquerade as alphas. Sheep as wolves. It's 2021...get over it, bra!",I Care a Lot
191,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,I Care A Lot But She Does Not,6,27 February 2021,"S2S: Hey Streamers! Last weekend was full of new releases once again. The one that caught my eye was I Care A Lot. On first glance, I thought I wouldn't want to watch this, but the trailer pulled me in pretty hard. Check it out below. Either way, I Care A Lot is about a ruthless businesswoman, Marla Grayson played by Rosamund Pike, who has figured out a scheme of being appointed as legal guardian for dozens of elderly wards. Grayson uses her position as a way to seize the wards' assets and cunningly use the legal system to her benefit. All is well until Marla and her business-partner and lover, Fran, take on the wrong ward who has some powerful friends. From here, we have to watch Marla figure out her next move to stay in control. Let's see how this turned outFor the most part, I Care A Lot is a standard dark comedy with a twist. Rosamund Pike plays Marla with a cold precision that's necessary for such a prickly character. She wears the power suits and has a blunt haircut that lets you know that she's all business. She does whatever it takes to get her way and line her pockets. There aren't really any redeeming qualities. Pike seems to revel in playing this character and she's quite good. There are funny moments because hijinks do ensue especially with Peter Dinklage's character and his slick lawyer played by Chris Messina get in the mix. The film moves at a good clip and is never boring, but may be frustrating for some if you don't buy into what Marla is selling. The problem is that it becomes disjointed as the plot machinations take over and the movie begins to search for a way to wrap up. It feels like storylines and side characters get dropped because there has to be an ending and Marla's motivations aren't really explained - if you even need that.Trip: Let me interject! I, too, watched I Care A Lot, and it sounds to me like you are generally favorable on the movie. While I think the movie hits all of its marks for something promoted as a dark comedy and crime thriller, I struggle with how morally questionable the main character is and the fact that the movie asks the audience to sympathize with her. Ultimately, I could not get beyond disliking this woman so intensely for taking advantage of the legal system, but more importantly, taking advantage of innocent, elderly people some of whom may not even need guardians. I had such disgust for Marla Grayson most of the movie that I could not enjoy it. Yes, there is something to a character, who is a ruthless, capitalist and she's using the system to win at all costs, but she blithely hurting people who do not deserve it. I really don't like her and it makes me dislike this movie.S2S: Sorry, you feel that way, Trip. I know a good therapist for you. You okay?Trip: ...S2S: Well... Yes, overall, I enjoyed this movie but I'm conflicted on liking the main character, too, but I guess that's the point. One might say Rosamund did too good of an acting job. I can't tell if that's good or bad in this flick. Judging by Trip's overreaction I can only tell this point is supremely highlighted and intrigues me more.Long story Short, I Care A Lot is an interesting movie that was fun to watch, in a way. If you like to root for the bad guy, then this is a movie for you. I Care A Lot is led by two solid actors in Dinklage and Pike, but the story felt heartless and devoid of soul.

And yes, movies are fiction and they're not obligated to be factual but the premise here was just so infantile that it was an insult to the viewers intelligence. Things just went downhill from there. There's been much talk about the ending but I can't speak to that because we didn't make it that far. About 30 minutes before the ending we both decided we'd wasted enough time on this annoying, unfunny, annoying (did I say that already), offensive, tedious piece of crap. It is very seldom that I will bail on a movie so close to the end thinking that after investing 90 minutes I should at least see how it ends. This movie was so bad I just didn't care. And I was angry with Netflix for inflicting it on me at all.Netflix makes some good movies and once in a while a great one....this movie is neither of those.

The amount of potential she poured in her performance it makes us wanna ask that what's the next thing she is gonna unfold. Other than her, the other actors Eiza González and Peter Dinklage also tried their level best to pour out their potential.

201,movieliker1,It's a dark comedy. Not a realistic drama.,6,25 May 2021,"Wow, this movie got a lot of bad reviews !!!I like Rosamund Pike. I found this movie entertaining. I know, it is not as easy as this movie suggest to commit an elderly person to an old folks home, and steal all their money and assets. But unlike most of the bad reviews, I knew it was a comedy. Not a drama.Most of the bad reviews this movie got are because all the main characters are bad people. And/or because how unrealistic the premise was. It's a dark comedy. That's often what dark comedies are about --- bad people and preposterous situations.Yep, the main characters are all bad people. I was appalled by Marla and Fran's lack of morals, ethics, and their lack of sympathy and empathy for their victims. And the premise is unrealistic.But it's about something many of us may not think about until we are in that situation. So, it did make me think, ""Why is this so unrealistic? Could this really happen?""First of all, it takes more than one doctor and one judge to commit a person to an old folks home and appoint a guardian, if and when that elderly person objects. (I know the elderly are taken of advantage of in real life. But those victims are unable. Jennifer --- played by Dianne Wiest --- was plenty able.)Most elderly people with money have family, friends, associates, lawyers and a team of doctors. And anybody can get a second opinion. She supposedly had no family. But she did have a hotline to the Russian mob. One phone call, and that attempt to steal everything she had would be blocked --- without any violence.Nobody can just take away the cellphone of an elderly person without allowing them to make any calls. Even if they are arrested, they have the right to one phone call.Secondly, Marla (Rosamund Pike) had a wall of about 30 to 50 victims. At best she might be able to ensnare one or two victims. But not 30 to 50.She went from one location with approximately 50 victims in the beginning of the movie, colluding with a doctor, an old folks home and a clueless judge. To going nationwide in the end, partnering with the Russian mob. Where and how was she going to find all the doctors, old folks homes, and judges to assist her in continuing her scam nationwide? Not possible.And in real life, the Russian mob would not be so easy to deal with. If you crossed them, they would either kill you, torture you, or start cutting off fingers, toes, hands, feet, take one or two eyes, (castrate a man), etc. She got off way too easy.But --- it is supposed to be a dark comedy. That is the way IMDb lists it. That is the way Google lists it. That is what Netflix has it listed as. As a comedy. That was the way I took it. I enjoyed it. But I knew it was unrealistic.I only gave it a 6 out of 10 because it wasn't terribly funny, and it was extremely unrealistic, unbelievable, and somewhat offensive. But knowing it was supposed to be a comedy, I was able to enjoy it --- a little.",I Care a Lot

THIS IS ONE OF EIZA'S GREATEST PERFORMANCES SHE HAD DONE IN I CARE ALOT!!! The movie, please don't get me wrong, the movie and rest of the cast were terrific. From start to finish, the movie was spectactular. But eiza! Eiza 100% truly owned & dominated the whole movie. I love eiza's character ""fran"". She was marvelous. She has more heart & soul then anyone else in the whole movie, even more then her sociopathic gf Marla. Though ironically, fran helped with the cold hearted cons. Truthfully, that really speaks to me. Fran is neither bad or good to me,. She is complex. And will do anything for Marla. I felt so terrible for fran at the end, after her wife Marla got killed. It was heart wrenching & heart breaking to see fran so heartbroken & crying. If I was there, I would give fran a giant hug, support & comfort her no matter what.After that incident (though this part is up to her), I don't believe that fran will be doing cons much anymore.I care alot was great and eiza out did herself once again and was the greatest of the greatest.

203,PerryAtTheMovies,"I don't care a lot, but it was a decent watch....",6,1 March 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
This movie has me torn. It ended how I wanted it to, but not the way I wanted it to. ""I Care a Lot"" offers promise of a good movie within the first hour, but once it hits the peak of tension, I felt like it came tumbling down. With this film I'm going to talk about the storyline and the actors.First, to the storyline. It's about Marla Grayson who targets vulnerable old people who seem to have no one to take care of them and she moves them into care facilities. At which point she takes their assets and auctions them off, taking the money for herself. This is done both legally and immorally. In the film she gets so greedy one day that she targets Jennifer Peterson, a woman who is loaded with money, and seems to have no one to take care of her.Once Ms. Peterson has been moved into a home of Marla Grayson's choosing. The drama shortly begins afterwards when an unknown man comes to pick Ms. Peterson up from her house to discover that she's not there. Within this first hour the drama unfolds between our three main leads of Marla Grayson, Jennifer Peterson, and Roman Lunyov. Unfortunately, all this build-up of tension comes crashing down, and not in the good way, in the second hour when things such as wasteful, personal attacks start to happen that cause the first hour to be wasted. What seemed like a good, solid story in the first half becomes a dull, meagering mess in the second half. While I don't want to write about the second half of this movie as it would be full of spoilers I will say this. The ending was not what I expected nor was it for how I had hoped for. That last little bit got to me and didn't give me the proper closure that I would've liked.The second piece of the movie I wanted to talk about was the acting. Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage each had powerful parts to play in this film, and while Peter wasn't stellar. He still gave a performance worth noting. Though short in stature he gave a tall performance as this ominous mobster who just wants to keep his cool and make things right. It was Peter's ominous persona in this film that made me root for him to come out on top. Opposite him though was Rosamund Pike who actually gave a good ""no care in the world, I'm going to win"" performance. She truly gave the performance from the very first moment I met her. I wanted her to burn. I definitely hated her throughout this film.Overall:
A decent film as a late afternoon viewing. While the story faltered between the beginning and the end it was still enjoyable. I don't regret watching it, but I would've liked a stronger hate between characters that should've broiled over into personal chaos.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes'.Enjoy the show!",I Care a Lot

211,homeflash,Not good enough.............. Many things dont make sense..,4,3 March 2021,"When i first looked at the summary, I thought the legal guardian is some sort of care take that takes care of the people directly.I have no idea about this professional exists that they can be legal guardians they want and take possession as they want. Whether it is true or not, this movie does not produce enough elements for viewers to enjoy. However, it does drag viewers to watch it whether you like or not.There are few things i don't like about this movie, here is why i am giving 4 stars.
*spoilers alert*1. Cursing - I am not sure cursing is a new culture of movie making. However, this movie just has too much unnecessary curses
2. Bad Plot - In the beginning, till almost the middle, it may seem good but as you watch along, many many things don't make sense.
3. Scenes don't make sense -
a. after Marla survived from draining, she went to a store and got her stuff. The store clerk basically stared at her. No cursing at this point? No yelling, she just took stuff and went home? I was like what the heck, and no logic at all
b. Marla's partner said ""we lost everything"".. and they are running away. I was like what does that mean?
c. after Marla dumped the dwarf or Mafia boss in the street, some guy called , and how would she know he is recued? why would she appear at hospital by him all at a sudden
d. Marla made a bargain with Mafia boss and be a partner. At first the Mafia boss said those diamonds are small potatoes. Then whey the heck did he care so much about it and looking for it?
e. Ending was even worst - they arranged the first guy to come out and shoot Marla dead and end the movie, Bad ending. I wish they could set up differently like have her killed when she was in hospital with the Mafia boss or something.The whole story is bad when you think about it. It just does not make sense at all. Yes, if you are a viewer, you may want to see the outcome of Marla - death and she deserves to die. However, as a viewer, I would rather see her lost to the Mafia then die like that....Again, i give 4 stars, just because the movie does drag you to the end",I Care a Lot

This film is by no means so bad that it deserves a rate of 1.0. It seems to me to be a coordinated movement. I think it's class I HATE NETFLIX or a bunch of ultra-conservative, unbearable radical Christians who don't accept that the world has changed and want to go back to the 18th century and can't stand to see two women kissing.

She's terrific. So is Peter Dinklage as the equally ruthless gangster who opposes her. And the plot is original (and as nasty as Pike and Dinklage).But the story goes off the rails in the second half, when what begins as a compelling and (mostly) cerebral duel of wits between two competing villains - crafty female con artist and vindictive Russian gangster - becomes an exercise in borderline-farcical, Coen Brothers-inspired mayhem. And it simply doesn't work here. And the VERY end (last 15 minutes or so) is a total mess.So the first hour is fun and compelling and rates a solid B or B-plus, while the second hour rates a ... well, see me after class.Two strong performances, though - particularly Pike's.My score: 5.",I Care a Lot

It's a crime drama with a smidge of action, with characters who are morally devoid fighting over money. Who do you root for? No one?Here are your main characters. (Protagonists. Antagonists. Both?):Marla. She's emotionally and morally lacking in every respect, she gets seniors locked away and drains their money. Her girlfriend sees something in this? I dunno what. They never really develop her girlfriend so we don't know. We do know Marla wants money. She acts like a jerk talks down to people, blows her vape at people either to look tough or come off as a jerk (probably some combo of both), and is just overly unlikeable.So then there's Roman. Marla locks up his mother. Then she steals her diamonds, only they're really Roman's. He's a Russian mobster. What does he want? Money and his mom. He's apparently supposed to be the bad guy. But you really don't want to root for Marla cause she's scum. Roman's a scum too, but he's harder to dislike because he doesn't really commit the worst of his atrocities here, you're left believing he did as a mobster.The plot is implausible to start and becomes outright ridiculous. They seem to want you to root for Marla in some tough girl power type of way but what exactly would you? She's essentially a shallow money grubbing thief.The best points are it's well acted and filmed. It's not grossly boring.I would really only watch this if you're in the mood for characters you want to dislike. And again, expect no comedy. It's a mostly a crime drama with just enough action to distract you from the hatred you are sure to have for the characters.",I Care a Lot

I have really grown fond of her as an actress. To give a nuanced performance in something that Nick Hornby wrote, for 10 minutes of TV, to a full blown ""will not lose at any cost"" individual in this. She really is good.It's a great feet of filmmaking to make something like this where technically there isn't a protagonist. And when you sort of think, well that person is less of an A Hole than that other person, well you end up changing your mind.Very much cat and mouse.

227,svtcobra331,"The Biginning sucked, but the comeuppance?",8,24 February 2021,"The beginning of this movie was like being subjected to a Harry Potter dementor; it sucked all the joy out of the viewer's soul. I fast forwarded to see if this was an exercise in ruining seniors or if Marla would receive payback.
So the payback starts, lots of posturing, very dramatic presentation by the boss, Roman, and the menacing attorney. Then the movie goes into Wednesday Thursday Friday land. The boss is throwing a tantrum like a kid... is this why they got a little person for the role? Then the mafia try to kill two people but fail... not a very professional bunch I guess. Then they get their butts kicked by a girl whose character was not defined as a fighter, so at this point I'm figuring it's a dark comedy... so was the beginning supposed to be funny at some level? Because it was about as funny as the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan.
Then the payback... what is the lesson? Society doesn't care in general, but if your loved one is affected, go ahead and pull the trigger... but you'll be the badguy.
At this point the film is not actual entertainment for the masses, but as a case study of ""film as an artform"" it is interesting if for no other reason than the fact that it is unsettling. A film that makes you think and or feel is accomplishing something. Film students might do well to consider how the beginning could be better constructed... I'm older so the film's beginning horrifies me, but maybe gen Ys are laughing at it, so maybe that was the target audience, which,, if they are laughing at it, shame on them. True shame.

It caught up with her in the end.Peter being an adversary then partner was the best part of the movie.

229,cristinalinderman,A bold-brilliant psychological thriller.,8,3 March 2021,"* There is no end credit scene *The director J Blakeson and crew brought a bold-brilliant psychological thriller. The story sets when a shady legal guardian meets her match when she deceives a person who has a powerful background. What a daring film, to have a main character who lacks morality especially towards the elderly giving some of the viewers no room to feel for her. Upon watching her I did have anger for what she was doing but somehow my feelings change due to the strong beautiful relationship she had with a woman. What she was doing was wrong but I still managed to root for her because the heart she lacked was represented in her partner. I don't think I would have rooted for her if it wasn't for that particular relationship, their chemistry was undeniably moving. The film wasn't about their romance but I was still in awe with their scenes together it showed so much emotion in a dangerous setting.The message of having an unstoppable ambition and the lengths one goes to achieve it was significantly represented. The only slightly negative thing about this movie was the ending. I felt that it was too cliché due to the irony of the situation, it would have been perfect if it ended a few minutes back of not knowing the decision of the character but even though I didn't like the end the film was still amazing. This is the kind of movie everyone needs to watch, it is what the cinema needs, a movie that battle's one inner emotion of whom one will choose to stand behind and for what reason.The composer Marc Canham created the perfect atmosphere for this story. Everything unfolded with such a wicked grace thanks to the music's electrifying synth vibe. The song chosen for the opening called Dirge by Death In Vegas was perfect because it represented the extent of how ruthless was the main character.The cast was solid especially the main cast Rosamund Pike, Eiza González, and Peter Dinklage, all of them gave powerful performances. Rosamund Pike had a strong sinister presence, she was such a wicked character making her so interesting. Peter Dinklage's performance was great as always, I like when he portrays this kind of role, it really suits him. Eiza González! my gosh she took my breath away! what a magnificent performance I yearned to watch more of her scenes. The chemistry between Eiza and Rosamund was so sensually vibrant. When I watched her in this film my first thought was ""who is this talented female actor?"" when I searched I was shocked because I have watched her in other films like Baby Driver, Alita: Battle Angel, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and Bloodshot. I think I didn't recognize her because I have watched her with straight hair and in this film she had curly hair, it was like she was a different person and I was completely amazed by her performance. In the past films, I felt that she wasn't really given the opportunity to shine because her roles either were small or the script was bad. Finally, in this film she had the opportunity to fully shine, I'm so glad she was in this incredible story written by the same person who directed it, J Blakeson.",I Care a Lot

Rosamund Pike confirms herself as a very good actress, Peter Dinklage is excellent as always and the film is definitely not bad, perhaps the IMDb users are too subdued by the crap & furious Marvel rubbish or by the 1200 episodes of that nonsense of walking dead and therefore they do not have the intelligence to understand well-made movies.",I Care a Lot
234,fatcat-73450,At Least Good as a PSA,6,26 October 2021,"At first I thought this was a post-modern movie. It had all the indications of it - the main protagonist is unabashedly amoral, money-driven, a woman, a lesbian, etc. However, the ending shows that the mainstream US still isn't willing to let go of its old concepts of morality in art.Also it's a black comedy. That implies that it's not to be taken too seriously and the antihero isn't someone the audience should necessary admire.Specifically, a black comedy about a woman who uses the legal system to legal prey on old people as a ""conservator."" Specifically, she gets corrupt doctors to sign off on the senility of propertied old people, then gets corrupt retirement home managers to play along. All the while she takes quick and complete control of their assets for a profit. Of course everyone involved gets his cut.I looked it up and apparently this does happen in real life as well. Although it probably doesn't happen often, it's an important thing for the public to be aware of, as you don't have to look abroad to find the US elderly preyed upon by opportunists and scammers. Legal grey areas that allow people to legally steal are also interesting. These types of schemes make for great movies as they qualify as ""more interesting [stranger?] than fiction.""Anyway, long story short, our antihero gets mixed up with the wrong people (criminals) in one of her swindling episodes. She's given the opportunity to give up her prize but refuses and from that point on it becomes something of a crime/action type of affair.Peter Dinklage is in this movie but I would say it's one of his weaker performances. He plays it a little too thick.The movie effectively turns the lead antiheroine into a character that might elicit a mix of admiration and repulsion in most people; the old lady who plays the main victim does so in a way that's an effective mix of irreverance and pitifulness. But aside from them, the acting is on the weak side. Furthermore, the events are implausible and not in a good way. The ending is also a bit of a retraction into the shell, so to speak.It's decent as an action-thriller and a good PSA for such legal scams, but it ends up feeling inane on the whole.Honourable Mentions: White Tiger (2021). The first post-modern movie I have seen. It really goes all the way into a world of egocentric amorality in a thoughtful way without hesitating or hiding behind the guise of black comedy.",I Care a Lot

236,Chance_Boudreaux19,Frustrating beyond belief,3,20 February 2021,"So first of all, I feel like the movie actively pushes the viewer to root for the morally reprehensible and utterly despicable character of Marla. From the very first scene in which she asserts her female dominance over a man, I felt like the film wanted to make her out to be an anti-hero of sorts. The idea that scamming poor elderly people is in any way badass and bossy is preposterous. Throughout the whole movie I just wanted to see Marla get murdered. It's a rare movie which makes the Russian mob, which at one point holds a conversation about choosing new drug mules look like the good guys. Hey, maybe I'm reading the movie wrong. Some say the movie is a black comedy. To that I say, at which point? It wasn't funny at all and felt like a straight up crime/thriller movie. Others might say that there have been other movies in which the protagonist is a monster. And whilst that is true, most of those movies weren't pushing the viewer to want the monster to succeed and if they did the character had at least some motive that made the viewer connect to them. Additionally, even if the anti-hero was sort of glamourised, there is a huge difference between seeing guys like Henry Hill or Tony Soprano mainly kill other mobsters and someone scamming defenceless old people.Furthermore, this movie should've been over an hour in. As soon as the Russians get involved that should've been all she wrote if the movie didn't make them out to be complete buffoons. They can't kill anyone due to their incompetence and then the boss somehow gets kidnapped by two women like it's nothing. At least, Rosamund Pike basically plays the same character as she does in Gone Girl and she does it well. If the movie made her out to be a straight up villain and pitted her against a likeable character instead of making her a ""lioness"" then it would've worked out much better. At least, she dies in the end which I didn't expect. At that point I gave up any hope of her getting her due comeuppance and was resigned to accept that I won't get any satisfaction. However, lo and behold she gets shot by the guy who was trying to save his poor mother but which we were meant to think was a stupid pig at the beginning. Well, that definitely made me add a star to my rating at least. Apart from that, everything about this movie was seriously frustrating and for the most part I hated the experience of watching it.",I Care a Lot

The film started off in a great way, a great introduction to what this film will be about and to the characters. The first and second acts were more than great. But, the third one took a big turn.The story took a really sudden big turn in the third act of the film. I didn't expect the story to go that way or to end like that. And by the way, I loved what happened at the very very end of the film it was a bit shocking to me especially that I didn't see it coming.The third act focused only on the two evil characters and the war that was happening between them and not the main story that the film gave us in the first and second act. The film didn't give the audience any reason that would make them choose one side.
There were some things that happened in the third act that seemed to be nonsense and felt like they just wanted to make the film longer and things slipped away so easily.The cinematography & music were so fantastic and fit that thriller vibe that the film has perfectly.Rosamund Pike's performance was of course amazing and she really deserves that Golden Globe win. Her performance reminded me of her role in Gone Girl (2014).

Then, we root for the mafia crime boss to take her down. Good so far. Then, half way through the writing style changes and it becomes a feminine piece of a woman not being railroaded by her male counterparts. I'd be great with that, too; problem is she is the villain, not the hero, no matter how much the writer wants to make her a sort of anti-hero tough as nails figure. She isn't likable, isn't relatable and is heartless... you cheer when she gets injured. You don't want to see he succeed. You want the old woman in the home to become empowered and save the soul of the narrative, but no... the film is determined to show the villains dominance at al coat wearing down a very bad-at-his-job mafia crime boss. Finally, she does get a quick, gutless comeuppance in the form of karma, but it is not fulfilling for the pain she caused. The writer assumed that just because she was a strong female lead it would be just as fun to see her succeed as fail, assumed they had a House of Cards character or Nurse Ratched or Malefeciant character we love to hate... but no, the background empathy for her is not shown. We don't like her. Thus it's a failure of a narrative. The film is wonderfully acted and directed, shot and edited... accolades for all of that.

I definitely got Gone Girl vibes from Rosamund Pike. Overall, the movie was easy to get hooked on. The mystery of the characters made me want to know what would happen next and as it got more and more intense and crazy, I was just sucked in. There's something about watching psychopaths that is just so interesting. However, I do understand where all the critics are coming from. I wasn't exactly pleased with how this movie ended. First of all, the old lady's mystery was never really resolved or revealed and I felt like the ending was written on a whim. The climax was so high, and the ending was rather disappointing compared to the rest of the film. But I also don't think this movie deserves all of the bad ratings. People were complaining about the pointless plot, and the unlikeable and shallow character, but I thought that in this case, an unlikeable character made the story much more interesting to watch. I understand that the character was a bit one dimensional and just plain evil, but something about that was interesting to me. I was waiting for the moment where she would finally come to her senses and reveal her vulnerability, and even though that never came up, it was interesting to figure out that she is truly evil through and through. I thought this movie was exciting and suspenseful with quite a unique premise. Don't listen to people who give this a low rating because it's honestly not that bad.

Now, was it realistic or probable? No... But it IS a movie. The concept of the main character and her role in what she does as a con artist itself is realistic, as that kind of stuff happens all the time, but there are a handful of elements that coincide with it that are pretty far fetched. All in all though, I thought it was a fun watch. I'm not going to pump my fists and shout that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen by any stretch of the imagination, but it was good.

Not really much comedy in it for me, but it is a reflection on what people will to today to get their hands on your money, a really horrible person, but she does pick the wrong mark and soon realises it.

The twists are terrible, with how Peter Dinklage's character is able to be outwitted by two people he had no qualms about killing five minutes earlier in the film, even after having committed multiple murders earlier in the film. Instead, he just contrives ridiculous, overly dramatic and slow faked deaths for Rosamund Pike and her girlfriend's characters to survive so the movie can go on. Also, how could the girlfriend have memorized the license plate of a Black Yukon randomly in a city, especially one she never saw, as she was inside of their home at the time she was assaulted? How would they even know they found the right house, if the mob man wasn't wearing a suit and standing in the garage at the time they arrive? Idiotic choices on the part of the writers to prolong and make a dumb movie have a 'gotcha' moment. I think it would have been a fitting end if the girlfriend was beat to death, Rosamund Pike discovers her, and then she's burned or drowned to death, the end- a fitting end for a relentlessly evil character.2.5/10 flips between boring and frustrating to watch.",I Care a Lot
261,northernpaladin,So much potential,3,21 February 2021,"This utter waste of time had so much potential. It could have been the film that exposed the corruption of elderly health care in the US. It could have been a C21st 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' where the mark is a very bad choice. It could even have been a straightforward con artists take on the wrong people and it gets very scary thriller.
But it's none of these, what we get instead is a celebration of extreme awfulness and a message that clearly says 'everyone is horrible and being successful is about being the most horrible person on the planet'. I hope Pike and Dinklage were well paid because I would be feeling pretty dirty after having been in this.
Really there are three films going on here.
Film 1. Sexy, sassy, females are making a fortune out of exploiting the elderly health care system by inserting themselves as guardians for wealthy elderly people with the connivance of health professionals and care home providers and incompetent local judges. First of all, look this up, in no way could what we see actually happen. Willing suspension of disbelief is fine but asking the audience to be complicit in a lie? Anyway, our sexy hustlers (and Pike does this well, no complaints there) pick another victim, go through their routine (so we can see how corrupt the system is and so it's not really that they are horrible) and consign said victim to a care home while they loot the estate. Unfortunately said victim, Diane Wiest utterly wasted here, is related to some scary people who send along an oily lawyer who offers a lot of money to reverse the guardianship, Pike refuses and....Now this is where it could have segwayed into darkly comic tug of war over Wiest whilst poking fun at a broken care system or a dark thriller with all that goes with depictions of the Russian mob. Nope. Instead we get...
Film2. Enter Dinklage as Russian mob boss with a penchant for pastries and smoothies whilst running a sex trafficking ring who faked his own death years ago and created a whole ghost identity for his mother, Wiest, to protect her. Surrounded by the dumbest henchmen ever he proceeds to resolve things violenty; there is a shoot out and failed abduction at the care home (henchmen are questioned and full details given to Pike - wtf?!), crooked doctor is killed (this doesn't move the plot forward at all and quite frankly she could have been bribed or threatened into writing a new report that said Weist was fine), Pike tries to get more out of Wiest who turns on her - nice evil turn here, so much more could have been done with this character, so off to the nut house for Wiest. Stakes are now raised, Dinklage abducts both grifters, long boring conversation with Pike which shows her as an unbelievable (cinematicly speaking) sociopath and Dinklage as the most underwhelming mob boss ever - at no time did I ever feel threatened by this character. End result is two of the worst most elaborate murders made to look like accidents I have ever seen, no wonder Pike and her partner survive. Really, if these guys were anywhere near the Russian mob they would have tortured Pike and partner into signing over guardianship and then killed them and disappeared the bodies. All credibility lost and the plot had nowhere to go except...
Film3. Having narrowly survived our grifters decide not to cut and run with their wealth and several million dollars worth of diamonds they found in Wiests safe deposit box - yes there are diamonds but it's such a macguffin that it serves no purpose, but instead seek revenge. On the Russian mob? In an elaborate and utterly unbelievable plot they trace the car of Dinklages driver, follow it to Dinklages office, overpower the driver, then overpower the bodyguard as he escorts Dinklage, drug Dinklage strip him and dump him on a jogging route to be found later. Let's just pause there because it gets better! We are asked to believe these two city grifters are going to go all FBI undercover and then one of them is going to take out two mob enforcers built like wrestlers? Next we have Dinklage awake in hospital with Pike waving a guardianship form saying that John Does are made a ward of the court and she has been appointed as his guardian; just like that, no fingerprints (he's a missing mob boss for christs sake!), no 'how did you happen to wind up at this hospital at just the right moment Ms Pike?' After some fencing over pay offs and diamonds and being safe, Dinklage proposes they go into partnership (I told you it got better) to establish a nation wide chain of guardianship business, tax free, off shore accounts, blah, blah, blah - remember this is from a guy who is running a sex trafficking ring and can't expedite a simple murder. Cue the future, Pike, looking every inch the successful female CEO being interviewed on network TV and magazine covers for Forbes etc and none of this done with any sense of irony, we are indeed asked to celebrate with and about this odious piece of humanity.
Upside (big spoiler) as Pike and her partner kiss and bask in their designer clothes by their designer car outside the studio up pops distraught son, who we saw in the opening scenes battling them unsuccessfully in court after they had shut him out of his mothers affairs and looted the estate, ranting about his mother's death and shooting Pike dead. Cue lots of blood on white designer clothes (what a cliche) and buckets of tears from partner.

262,paulmcuomo,The whole is lesser than the sum of its parts,5,19 February 2021,"I saw this movie today, and I really had to think about what to rate this movie, because there's so many good things about it, but there's also so many aching problems that really hamstring it with what it wants to do and be.Starting with the positives, they really lie a lot with the acting and music. Rosamund Pike, in the central role as Marla, is a vicious force of nature, and while it's not a particularly big leap to make comparisons to her role as Amy in Gone Girl, there's enough differences to make it seen. Eiza Gonzalez is good enough as her lover Fran to where she's not a scene stealer, but isn't an unwelcome presence. Peter Dinklage as the gangster Roman is an intriguing and intimidating character (for the most part) and is a great watch, and Diane Wiest as Jennifer is also a marvellous little character who isn't put to waste. The music, which I mentioned I liked, goes with the visuals nicely, in that it feels big, cinematic, and guides you well from scene-to-scene.Now, what I didn't like. This is where I talk spoilers, because honestly, this is a movie that needs to be talked about for why you do/don't like it, so if you want to watch it, stop here.
The three biggest problems in this movie are the tone, characterisation, and attitude towards the main characters.
Starting with tone, this is a ""comedy-thriller"" but a lot of the comedy is undone by the fact that Marla, Fran, and what they're doing is monstrous, and the comedy falls flat. In fact, I would say honestly the true villain of the story isn't Roman, but Marla. In case no one knows what Marla is doing, she is taking legal guardianship of the elderly of America, and then milking their assets - property, cars, jewellery etc - as well as getting paid by care homes to commit people, isolating them from their families and abusing their care. She takes clear sadistic glee in this, and the movie treats her as if she's always in the right; like we're looking at a monster presented by people who don't think she's a monster. The linear narrative, and the fact we're never given a moment to humanise with her does nothing to help this, and when she was getting tortured by Roman, the Russian mobster, I was rooting for him (and that's a problem).
The last 30 minutes of the movie are particularly problematic and suffer a lot from plot armour and reverse plot armour. When Roman catches Marla and tries to get her to release his mother from her care and she refuses, he tells his men to kill her. They knock her out, pump alcohol into her stomach, and send her car down a cliff to make it look like a drink-drive. They also beat up Fran, and leave her unconscious in a pool of her blood in a flat filling with gas. Marla somehow survives all of this, and she loses a tooth in the process. Then, not only is the tooth fixed immediately, but Fran lives with minimal damage, which ruins the stakes of the story because it makes them immune. They then get their revenge on Roman that is so contrived, that if one part fails the whole thing fails, and is dependent on a smart gangster becoming suddenly dumb. All of this leads to an ending that, to its credit, takes a massive risk out of left field, but honestly feels like an afterthought as it doesn't really link to the rest of the film.I've seen a few 1 star reviews here. It's not that, as there's too many good parts to be 1 star. It's also got a lot of problems. It's OK; nothing exceptional, but not terrible.",I Care a Lot
263,fishwhisperer-31845,Shocking,1,27 February 2021,"I'm absolutely shocked that this movie has 6 stars due to the overwhelming, and accurate, amount of negative reviews here.
The premise that Marla is able to have the elderly put in a home while she fleeces them is absurd. But, it's a movie so I'll let that slide.
Marla is instantly unlikeable. Are we supposed to be rooting for her?
The attorney is introduced, and all I can wonder is what kind of person would hire this guy? Its like he has an office in a strip mall. Implausible that the next villain (Peter Kinklage) we're introduced to would hire this person. Surely he could've afforded a better attorney.
Her girlfriend is savagely beaten, and she only has a black eye to show for it? Seriously?

264,TruView,A one-time watch dark comedy,3,19 March 2021,"No one likes to hear, much less see, women being taken advantage of in their golden years by scheming cutthroats. This film was going to be a tough sell - if only for that reason! That being said, it is a dark comedy and so a different set of standards must apply. Even so, the only one redeeming quality of this picture is Pike's performance. Indeed other reviews confirm this by complaining how morally bankrupt her character was, which contributed to their disapproval of the film.In my case, the reason for the three stars rating was because there just wasn't enough meat on the bone. Despite it's nearly two hour runtime, the movie took a while to get going. The tug-o-war between Marla Grayson (Pike) and Roman Lunyov (Dinklage) did at times provoke laughter but not very much of it. The Game of Thrones actor, Peter Dinklage was brought on board for nothing more than the potential viewership he'd bring to the project. His character just wasn't given enough runway to blossom. Nor was Eiza González's character, Fran (or Frankie) allowed any substantive exploration even though this was clearly a female-centric movie.Marla Grayson was a monster who so happened to be a white female. She gave one line zingers that were impressive and even thought-provoking. But the whole time I kept thinking, she represents the most extreme version of the ""Me 2 Movement"" that's being propagated on the big and small screens. If this is to be the new mold going forward, then the future is going to be a very scary place. That's how great Rosamund Pike's delivery was.

266,trelerke-politics,"I care - not at all, a hot mess",2,25 February 2021,"I wanted to love the movie, what a great setup! and it just fizzled and became some kind of hybrid dark comedy, ultra violence soaked, not funny, evil super villains fighting it out for most evil, super obvious, and sure, one glorious moment when Dinklage, in an attempt to appear anonymous, hides his face from the surveillance camera. But then there is the ""wacky"" scene at the hospital where the wacky russians mobsters shoot it out with the very capable and well armed hospital staff and merriment ensues, and death. There is no one to root for here, in an even vaguely interesting, anti hero way and there isn't one but two McGuffins, one standard - diamonds, and the other - an entire actor, Diane Wiest, who is very poorly used, mostly forgotten. And then, the almost killed characters, someone, Bourne level, escape their deaths, those wacky Russian mobsters again, and come back to do some very Bourne level stuff against the Russians, but this is not a female empowerment turning of the tables like in ""Lucy"" it's more like battle of the socio-paths - women can be socio paths too!. So, it's not believable within the framework of it's own construction, misuses actors, blows a very promising premise and finally, and this is the cherry on the crap sundae the evil woman socio-path is gunned down in the last 30 seconds of the movie, an obvious last minute addition that only serves to confirm this as a movie does not have the courage of it's convictions, and I'm not even going to talk about how this is related, or not to the whole B Spears conservator issues.

What they were doing to those elderly women was not right. Out and out stealing and using the courts to make it look legit. It angered me. Then when the mob boss was trying to kill her, I was elated. But then I got sad, because she lived. But there was a happy ending, when Feldstrom/Macon Blair's character shot & killed her, that just made my day. She & her girlfriend deserved everything they got. Now the mob boss/Peter Dinklage will now be sole owner of her corporation, instead of co owner. So it's a win win all the way around.

They were all antagonists in their way, just Peter and Dianne are more believable and likeable I guess. The movie draws you in, the story is unique, something even unheard of but it is also filled with minor loopholes (also the movie has made a joke out of the Russian mafia and US Courts). It's slowly paced for most of the movie and then everything is rushed at the end, like the directors were told to wrap up when 2 hours are completed, no matter what.The movie made my blood boil at so many parts and I kept switching sides so often, all worth it.

276,pseawrig,Unsettling. . . not in a good way,6,20 October 2021,"This movie is extremely unsettling.Part of the reason is because its premise is so upsetting. The movie tells the story of a hateful woman (Rosamund Pike) who works with an unethical doctor, a willfully stupid family court judge, and a cruelly unethical senior living center to strip solitary senior citizens of their wealth, their freedom, and arguably their lives. I had never heard about this kind of grift before. It is scary and very real: state and local family courts throughout the US will sometimes appoint legal care guardians to care for elderly people, often against their wishes and against the wishes of their families. These court ordered ""guardians"" will then get rotten doctors to declare their wards unfit, so that the legal guardians can send them to corrupt overpriced nursing homes, while they of course get kickbacks. The guardians sell off their homes and assets to pay for the nursing homes and to pay themselves exorbitant hourly fees for giving such care. If you don't believe me, Google ""legal care guardian.""Sounds like a great topic for a social problem film or maybe even a horror movie. But, that's not what this movie is. Instead, it's mostly a caper movie, which tells the story from the point-of-view of the rotten woman who makes her fortune by cruelly abusing vulnerable old people. She's in a romantic relationship with an equally rotten woman (Eiza González) who helps her bilk senior citizens, and at times the movie seems to want us to care about their love story. That struck me as odd since these women are such disgusting examples of humanity. In fact, the move goes to great lengths to try to get us to root for its soulless main character by putting her in dire situations like needing to escape from a rapidly sinking car. It even frequently seems to celebrate her chutzpah, which imo is just sick. I mean she wantonly abuses the elderly for profit. What kind of chutzpah do you need to abuse the enfeebled!There are a couple of sequences in the film that go for a dark humor approach. This might have worked well if the movie had sustained this tone throughout and sweetened it with an ending that somehow set things aright. That's how dark comedies work. The dark humor of Heathers works because in the end Veronica sees where she has gone wrong, achieves true contrition, and makes a valiant effort to undo the horrible events that she has put into motion. The dark humor of Fargo works because, in the end, justice prevails. This movie metes out justice of a sort, but not in any satisfying way.In the end, I'm not sure what to make of this movie. It made me aware of an important real world injustice, which is important work for a movie to do. But then again, its flippant tone arguably minimizes this injustice by glamorizing the movie's villain and forgetting its victim (which seems doubly wrong since this means forgetting the amazing Dianne Wiest). In fact, the cruel grift at the center of the story ends up getting replaced by a very stupid Russian mob subplot. All in all, I'd say that this movie has gravitas, mostly due to its subject matter and several great performances (Pike, Wiest, Chris Messina, and Nicholas Logan). It's worth watching. But, be prepared to end up feeling queasy and unsatisfied . . . A lot.",I Care a Lot

You're introduced to some despicable characters, everything seems plausible, and I was anxious to see what was next. I really try to avoid spoilers, but the ludicrous events that lead to the denouement need to be called out specifically.Unfortunately what was next was sorely disappointing. A heavily drugged woman survives her car being driven into a deep lake. She then somehow hikes back to a gas station in the middle of nowhere, and is able to make it back to her partner who herself was heavily beaten (apparently to death) by gangsters and save her seconds before her apartment explodes.Then, with no sleep, they hatch a haphazard plan to kidnap a mafia boss. One woman armed with a taser and syringe manages to subdue two mafia henchmen and the boss. Apparently she has some super taser that renders large built men unconscious.She then proceeds to simulate an overdose and somehow become the legal guardian of this mafia boss (yes this is seriously in the movie). Said mafia boss then conveniently forgives how she tried to fleece his mother, got multiple henchmen killed/arrested, and decides to propose a partnership with her.I could make a better plot over my lunch break. Seriously, who is writing these things, and more importantly who is approving them? People are getting paid to create this garbage from a major production company?

289,Chris_Ego,I tried to care,5,22 February 2021,"Nowadays it's hard to find a movie as polarizing as this one is. I can truly understand other reviewers creating a profile just to tell us how bad their viewing experience of ""I Care A Lot"" was. The same incident happend to me last year with a different movie. But let's start at the beginning.I started to watch this film late at night and had to stop the Netflix film around 40 minutes to the end for sleeping reasons. Next day I told my friends how great this film was. The premise is substantial, daring and also close to the truth. I worked in social service and I know from personal experience how helpless patients can become when they are in heavy treatment. Especially in the psychiatric field it is very hard for them to make their own decisions because other ""caretakers"" take over. I watched an interview with director J Blakeson and he pointed out that he did research on cases where people were robbed of their freedom by people like the ones shown in the film. Also he wanted the audience to decide which person is the actual bad character here. That is very thoughtful and in the first two thirds of this movie the interplay is well executed. Of course we might sympathize with the cold and tough Marla, although she is fooling everyone for her own profit. The film starts off with a funny incident at the care home and the director puts some humor in all this madness that the plot is about. The acting of Rosamunde Pike and Eiza González is refreshing and enjoyable. Everything is put into place. The soundtrack is mostly electronic and different from other scores. I loved the way the picture is portrayed so far. As soon as the Russian gang comes in, things are getting awkward, but it could have been a funny, but violent change.The next day I was looking forward to watch the end of a glorious movie. But little did I know it could turn out so disappointing. After Marla gets caught by the ominous Russians the story deviates from its original run. Suddenly it becomes a violent survival thriller with hilarious moments. She gets tranquilized and they brutally instill a bottle of vodka through her nose, put her in her car and move it into the water. Suddenly she wakes up, frees herself and swims to the surface. After vomiting liquids she is like reinvigorated and starts a revenge cruise. I could tell you how I would feel after vomiting one litre of vodka, but I am not in a movie, so nevermind! Not only she manages to bring her girlfriend back to life, now they both head on to a revenge race. They easily track the Russians down and suddenly the couple are also professional assassins. So much for legal guardianship! The next ten minutes are filled with absolute nonsense, but we are not done yet dear friends. The real cracker comes near the end. At the scene where evil Russian, played by Peter Dinklage btw, refuses to kill her and actually offers to team up, I was like ""you gotta be kidding me!"" After all we've been through the plot twist was already a hard thing to swallow and now you are enraging us with this bs? The very ending is just as disappointing as foreseeable. Why, but why, did you mess up this good time of one hour and a half? The film should have just ended with the lioness drowning in her last fight underwater.5 Stars for the phenomenal first half of this film.",I Care a Lot

It is quite rare that I have wished karma so strongly upon a villain, and the film almost robbed me of the satisfaction until the big payoff.

301,Davidon80,Nasty and unsatisfactory,6,30 March 2021,"A head strong business lady who believes that being rich is the be all and end all of life, creates a business venture which dupes unsuspecting elderly people to sign off all their worldly possessions to a care giver and then profits from the sale. Events take a turn for the worse when they nab the wrong kind of old lady.There something to be said about movies with anti-heroes who scheme their way through the story. Movies like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Wild Things and The Last Seduction come to mind when we think of female led movies with characters who scheme and manipulate the world around them. However, to succeed in making a ""con gone wrong"" movie requires a deft touch from the director, a witty script that fools the audience as well as the characters in the movie and a premise that is half plausible. We have to believe that the lead character has planned their actions five moves ahead like a grand chess master.Now, the problem with ""I care a lot"", is not that the lead characters are NOT smart, nor that their plan is somehow flawed, but it is simply that the audience has to believe that the ""world"" is stupid. Also it hangs its story on the belief that simply being determined to ""not lose"" is enough to get you through life. This is just a few of the many flaws inherent is this movie, as the world painted is not one that the main character has to navigate or con her way through, but her path is strewn with idiots who clear a way for her to succeed. Take for example the slick lawyer, who is so slick he walks away from a negotiation, then there is the Supreme Court judge who after being in court with her at the beginning for a complaint from a concerned family member rules in her favour. Then is called on again halfway through the movie for an identical trial with a similar accusation and again hands her the case, and then a third time.Add to this the Russian mafia. Yes, I said it, the Russian mafia. In this movie world we have to believe that the Russian mafia are also inept at what they do. Now, Russian mafia (or any mafia for that instance) is usually a short hand in cinema for instant trouble, usually signifying death. As any mafia movie can attest, once the mafia are involved all negotiations are off the table and some mild mannered headstrong business lady is quite frankly a blip on the radar. Now our lead character doesn't out smart the mafia, she out mafia them. She goes full Jason Bourne on them.The most interesting scenes in the movie come when Rosamund Pike's character has her conversations with Dianne Wiest character, here you can see both actors doing a lot more with a shaky script then the movie deserves, and you begin to see the conflict in the two women, but the biggest crime in this movie is how it wastes Dianne Wiest, leaving her as a side character in a movie in need of some real substance.The music is also confused, as the heavy synth tends to favour our protagonist, but the line between hero and villain is already so thinly veiled that at many points I'm rooting for the mafia.Did you notice something there, it sounds like I'm talking about two different movies right? One a satirical jab at the care givers industry in America and another a Mafia hit gone wrong movie...well that's what this is, and the parts just don't add up.The problem inherent in this movie are that the seams of the movie are too obviously stitched and the viewer is left thinking, ""that wouldn't happen"". Which is fine in a knock about comedy, but this movie has aspirations of making a larger comment about America and the pursuit of happiness. Well, in America it ain't about just wanting to be rich, you have to out think smarter people, the likes of which will be a lot smarter than the characters portrayed in this movie.It's a movie with some high aspirations, the business narrative of getting to the top by any means is a good crux to hang your story on, but is somewhat undermined by a mafia movie, which then isn't given time to breath. The two side by side do not compliment one another, as they both pull in different directions.",I Care a Lot

The feeling of unease and stress. I do not think that this is necessarily a bad thing, it just makes for an uncomfortable moviegoing experience. The main character is incredibly vicious and sadistic, but the manner in which Rosamund Pike sparks this character is horrifyingly convincing. I have to agree with some other user reviews on the aspect of the film's lack of likeability, because Pike's character is as far from that as possible. Knowing some story or drive of this character, or at least an extra dash of humour would have really helped with all the discomfort. At around an hour in, the film manages to pick up the pace, add some humour, and introduce a couple of new twists, which I really liked. And the film's costume design is very slick and stylish, which gave it a contemporary and appealing aesthetic. However, the pacing and plot are all over the place and the dialogue is really generic at times. Overall, the film elicited severe emotions and contained style, wit, great acting, and a couple of surprises. It's just a bit sad that the concept could have been explored better, the main character is so unlikeable, and the plot is often just all over the place.

However, it still employs the most absurd developments and extraordinary events to occur, and in fact these are essential for the advancement of the plot, with no regard for reality... or even a semblance of acceptability.This is coupled with a protagonist who is impossible to like and only alienates the audience and further, only progresses in stature throughout the screenplay with no consequences or retribution.

Only problem is, it's applied to scenes that simply don't warrant it.

No person in this industry would risk their lives for financial gain - at least no one who is not completely insane.I gave it 5 stars because I liked Peter Dinklage's character and thought he was funny - unbelievable, ... but funny.Hollywood sucks right now and this is just another good example to prove it.",I Care a Lot

""Yes, sure. Do I get to show my t*ts as well?""
""Hadn't thought of that but we can throw in a gratuitous wet T shirt scene if you like.""
""Great. Count me in.""

I thought it was very good how the director had portrayed the powerless situation that the elders falling prey for the scam were in.On the other hand I think some scenes were a bit too narcissistic and not useful at all: bad attempts to make the viewer take her side (I was basically rooting for the dwarf Russian mobster the whole time until he decides to make a joint venture with her).The ending is good: despite everything she did to turn a bad situation into a huge win, she was careless (!) with some loose ends and they get to hunt her when she was not expecting any of it: exactly at the peek of her success.Hell, I ended up rooting for the guy that kills her!In comparison to Gone Girl, where Rosamund Pike shined in her performance, this movie falls way down in rating, but taken by itself is a solid 7 in terms of thriller/dark comedy.

There is hardly any character development and we only get information on what characters are doing at the moment instead of background information (other than they're all awfully unlikeable people) nor the reasons why they do what they do. Also most characters feel like they have been put in this film just to support the story and they're later brushed off from the script. Rosamund Pike's lover (Eiza González) is poorly written and is just in here to make out with Rosamund Pike and just goes along with her orders.

It is well acted, and has an original plot. It starts off very strong, with an interesting premise, but halfway through takes a turn toward very unlikely events, which is one problem. But the bigger problem is that the main protagonist is also the villain. Sometimes that works, but not here. She's such a horrible person that we simply don't want to watch things like her romantic life, or toot her own horn about what a great person she is.Now for those of you who think guardianship abuse like this can't happen, just Google the names ""April Parks"" and her partner in crime ""Jon Norheim"" in Nevada a few years back.

I thought the old lady was going to be a lead player in the movie and kept waiting for her role to emerge. Instead its just a fight for power between the two main characters.Peter Dinklage did poorly in this and looking less and less the great actor I thought he was.

And as many have pointed out correctly, this isn't a comedy.

The rest is my original comment.Great cast with good acting. Rosemund is looking her most gorgeous, even though you want her character dead, & just prior to the story turning stupid, you'd accept her if she was tortured by Nazis! The writer must have been drinking, & the whiskey caught up, & Marla (Rosemund) starts becoming a somekind of supervillain that lethal drugs apparently have no effect on. After following the story off the deep end, you just accept what comes next as just crooks joining forces. You even forget about a character from the beginning, who returns to snap you awake, to give a standing ovation at the long awaited satisfying conclusion.

After the long introduction to this awful woman we finally get the antagonist, and he's also not likable. I was hoping that someone was going to put this woman in her place, but the movie wants me to care about her? After this we stop being a comedy (which wasn't that funny), and starts being a spy thriller drama movie? I think this movie was like six different genres and none of them were fully fleshed out.

The American legal system doesn't work the way described, and while senior citizens are being exploited, the process isn't quite that simple. So the satire fails. Also, Rosamund Pike's character is so repulsive, are we supposed to root for her as she goes head to head with Dinklage's mob boss? No way. So the thriller aspect fails, too.

At one point of the movie when Marla is captured by Roman, he could have used Fran to get the info out from Marla. Instead, he goes on a search-and-destroy spree.Anyway, Rosamund Pike did a really good job by portraying a smart and vile female protagonist/antagonist. Movies often portray women in simple and innocent way as if they are the innocent pretty things unable to do bad things. This kind of movies showing women in real life roles where they can be as brutal as males and show that once you remove the thin veil of societal discrimination the likelihood of getting murdered, mutiliated conned and raped by a woman is the same as that by a man.

Another film that gets hate bc it has female leads,8,17 July 2021,"I put off watching this because of the negative reviews but gave it a shot and quickly liked it. Solid 7.5-8/10. It's DEFINITELY a film that gets extra hate because it has two female lead actresses. Those always garner more hate, they just do. So adjust the rating at least +1 to compensate for the unchecked and unconscious obvious sexism the reviews show.This had multiple parallels to the Wolf of Wall Street and if the lead was swapped with DiCaprio, it'd be praised (not bc he's a better actor but because he's a dude-the lead who played Marla is a phenomenal actress and killed this role). Leo was just as evil as Marla and just as cunning and suave. Everyone loved to root for a greedy and sociopathic capitalist in that movie but not in this one when it's a woman.Also, ""wHo Do I rOoT fOr?!"" Why do you need to root for anyone? You want a basic movie, GOOD GUYS versus BAD GUYS...boring and overdone. I love when movies have you checking yourself and wondering if you really are rooting for a villain? Noo you can't. The movie pushes you to try and not sympathize with the actors, keep you torn but firm in your disdain for their lack of morality, but confused when you can't help emotionally feeling invested in the villains success-but NO they are BAD! But it'd be cool to see them live out a wild heartless life in this FICTITIOUS film. But also face the consequences of their actions, right? The conflicted feelings are great.The film as a whole pushes you to see that you are so much more empathetic of a person than Marla because even when it's a psychopathic kidnapping money hungry devil in sheep's clothing, we can STILL find ourselves on their side at times because we can't help but not want others to suffer, unlike Marla who has a level of sociopathy most of us can't comprehend.They spared no one in this real life industry-the guise that what they're doing is caring-HA. I love it, they made these monsters out to be just that and fictionally even worse (involving dark money and truly the worst of intentions). Apparently this has gone over people's heads though.Calling out a vicious industry that is in real life destroying lives-that should've been a takeaway but people are saying the most absurd things about the movie. She DIED at the end (justice?) but you know what didn't? The system that allowed her to get where she did-the LEGAL system! The healthCARE system! These messed up systems that are 100% real but people hate on the characters more than the industries and I feel like that summarizes up pretty well how much this film was misinterpreted (there was little interpreting to even do-it was obvious in your face takeaways).Also, just because it has female leads doesn't mean it is trying to be a feminist film. The fact that they got to be leads is in itself feminist, but why does every movie with women have to achieve perfect feminist ideals? It certainly did nothing against feminism but we're way too quick to criticize feminism when it doesn't deserve it. Why can't this movie just exist in a neutral state? It did not do anything to suggest it was pushing feminism-including female leads alone does not accomplish that lol, thick skulls in these reviews my god!There were two lesbians as well but you know what people aren't saying? That it pushed LGBTQ+ ideologies onto viewers or that it portrayed it damagingly to the cause, because they were just allowed to be lesbian without being scrutinized for it being anything other than that! Cant women just exist without people saying we're too much or too little? This film did a great job of just letting the leads lead. It was clever, with a unique story, great acting, interesting insight into an industry that doesn't get called out enough, solid production, and garbage reviews.",I Care a Lot

There is no one to root for.The Russia Mafia guys are inept and evil. The two women scammers are mean, heartless, distensible and evil. Even the old women, who we initially sympathize with, turns out to be part of the Russian Mafia.This was a potentially really good story had it gone in the right direction. The two villainesses could have been rewarded with some deserved consequences, and their victims could have been released and revenged.It was not to be. The Russian Mafia guys have unlimited cash and power, yet they are unable to convince a family court judge to reconsider his ruling.

This movie was made to trigger people, especially males. Yes, the main character (a female and her partner) pulled off a lot of completely unbelievable things, and I mean to the point that I nearly stopped watching about 2/3 into the film.I Care a Lot is a dig at late stage capitalism and the worship of money as a god in the USA. But it also has strong themes of female empowerment that almost ruined an otherwise very well directed/produced movie. I say almost because at the end we all got what we wanted (no spoilers). This wasn't a ""Funny Games"" by any means, but it evoked similar emotions as we saw the bad guys (girls) get away with increasingly brazen and unbelievable actions and by an hour in, I was thinking there would be no satisfying resolution (not that filmmakers owe us one, Funny Games being a strong case in point).Nice dark little film. Numerous funny scenes. Great acting by the entire cast. Seeing Clay Davis as a judge was particularly awesome for me.

The opening scene was a big clue (The ""my name is so-and-so and I'm a blah blah blah"" line has been done countless times).The Mafia should've won. Not because she's so evil that I want her dead, but because it's a bitter suburban mom type vs. THE MAFIA (or ex-mafia according to the movie, but who cares). It's like the movie made up a bunch of nonsense to help her and her 80 lb. sidekick/girlfriend defeat a bunch of gansters. Instead of just shooting her, they pumped her full of knockout gas like she's James Bond and rigged her car to fall in a lake to ""make it look like an accident."" Luckily (and conveniently), the knockout gas (or liquid, I'm not sure) only lasted a few seconds and she managed to get enough strength to get out of the sinking car and swim to the top. It's as if the thugs were helping her escape.I was expecting a brutal, but intriguing battle of wits, but instead it was stuff I've seen before. The movie was surprisingly watered down.But the movie did a great job of showing how evil she and her henchmen are. The way they treated the mob boss's mother was heartbreaking.The ending felt like it was added at the last minute to calm people down. The son of one of the elderly victims (who was in the film earlier) showed up seconds before the film ends and shot her.

391,felix-wyderka,Rosamunde Pike's best work and a dark comedy that really keeps you glued to the screen,8,23 February 2021,"""I Care a Lot"" is the new dark comedy starring Rosamunde Pike and Peter Dinklage.
Pike is one of those actresses that can make a completely evil character, very likable.
She has much talent and this is her best performance yet. Some might argue it is her equally brilliant turn in David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" but I thinks she has a little more to work with here. Her acting is on point and is only matched by the equally brilliant Dinklage. Before I go into more detail let me tell you a little about the movie.
Rosamunde Pike plays Marla Grayson. Marla is a legal guardian for elderly people that can no longer take care of themselves, or that are ruled incompetent by a judge.
Marla is a despicable human being who has a wall full of pictures of ""clients"" she is guardian to. She sees them as her investments. She takes over guardianship and then sells all their belongings or takes them for herself. Her girlfriend Fran (Eliza Gonzalez) assists her in this cruel enterprise. Fran really is the only character in the movie that has at least half a conscience.
One day Marla gets a call from a doctor that regularly pawns off patients to her for a cut of the profits. The doctor has found what the girls call ""Cherry"". An elderly rich woman with no apparent living relatives and a touch of dementia. Which means they can take the entire fortune for themselves. Of course Marla jumps at the opportunity and soon the woman, Jennifer Peterson (played with much finesse by the always brilliant Dianne Wiest) is in her care.
However, Marla soon finds out that this ""cherry"" is not as innocent an old lady as she appears, when a mysterious hitman in form of Peter Dinklage starts to come after her.
I know Dinklage might seem like an unusual choice for this kind of role be pulls he pulls it off brilliantly. The the danger he exudes throughout the movie makes everybody shudder.
""I Care a Lot"" is a movie that might offend and shock some people. The arrogance and casualness with which Marla exploits the old people in her care, is truly horrible. This movie is inspired by real events and to think someone as evil as Marla Grayson exists in the world is a thought that saddens me.
But let's get back to the movie. Directed by Jake Blakeson this movie packs a punch from the beginning and I have to admit for the first one-hour and fifteen minutes the movie is flawless. There is not one wrong choice. From the music to the impeccable wardrobe choices and the often more than brilliant dialogue the movie glues the viewer to the screen. Every single detail is thought out well. Then about forty-five minutes before the movie ends the quality dips a little.
The events happening over the next twenty minutes were very infuriating and I sat on he couch very angry for a moment that a movie as good as this is getting spoiled that way. Not because the next scenes were badly executed but because they seem rather pointless and illogical. There were things happening on the screen that were inexplicable. Timeframes that did not make sense. Most of all there were a few choices that just felt too safe, too set up for a happy ending. I would have much preferred to see Blakeson stick with his run of risks and unusual choices, he had so well execute for the last hour.
Luckily the movie's quality improves soon after and we get a satisfying yet bittersweet ending.
I have to say, that Pike's Golden Globe nomination is warranted and she has very good chances of wining the trophy in her category this year.
So if you are looking for a movie to overcome the boredom in these trying times or just a purely entertaining film, then you should definitely see this one.
It is worth it in every aspect and it draws attention to an important aspect of society that might have been largely overlooked before. I like when movies make a statement especially when it is done this well.",I Care a Lot

427,Brent_P,The definition of bad movie.,2,28 February 2021,"I don't understand the buzz, award nominations and overall score of this movie. This is truly a bad movie. I've seen a ton of bad movies in my time but I don't remember the last time a movie like this left such a bad taste in my mouth. Sure, I've seen some stinkers in my life, but when it comes to the capable actors in the movie, potential and hype...this was infuriating.For starters, what as the point of this movie? I'm not talking about the payoff of the plot, although that itself is a problem, I'm talking the messaging or theme. Is this supposed to reflect to one of the cavities of capitalism? Greed? Feminism? The push and struggle for more female, self-built CEOs with Pike's character to the real-life pariah Elizabeth Holmes? The broken justice system? The lack of true elder care and the pitfalls of retirement communities? All of these questions are set up and left unanswered.Who's the protagonist and antagonist? The movies sets up Pike's character as the devil's incarnate going through great lengths to squeeze elderly out of their wealth with zero remorse, yet tries to flip the audiences disdain for her in setting up another antagonist. As well, the McGuffin of the movie played by Dianne West, is completely tossed aside and ignored despite a pretty good set-up. Who do we feel sorry for here? Who had a story arc? Who learned anything?This movie literally left me angry, to the point where I am scrounging to find another movie to watch to push the movie down in my short-term memory bank.",I Care a Lot
428,dazfiddy,A Very black comedy,8,19 February 2021,"Rosamund Pike shines in a comedy that proves yet again that she can play cold blooded and ruthless with style. In this film, Pike plays Marla Grayson a conwoman. She finds wealthy elderly marks who are placed in care facilities. Marla gets herself appointed the legal guardian by the court and then cleans the marks out. Along with her partner, Fran( Eiza Gonzalez) , Marla has the system rigged in her favour. Her problems start when she targets Jennifer Peterson played by Dianne Wiest. Jennifer is no helpless senior citizen. She has underworld connections.This film can also be a commentary on the capitalist system. A society that allows people like Marla flourish must be corrupt. It is a testament to the script that we find yourself rooting for Marla even though she is a complete monster.",I Care a Lot

Diane Wiest is great but the screenwriter and director throw it all away to turn this into a Sting like farce with Rosamund Pike going from the courtroom to a sort of female Jason Bourne. Sure, she could survive the murder attempt. Sure, she can kidnap her attempted murderer in broad daylight. Sure, she can be appointed the legal guardian of a Russian mobster. Sure, of course this beautiful woman is lesbian...with a beautiful co-conspirator...who is also her girlfriend. That seems more like a fantasy of the screenwriter.

The dialogue seems to have been written by an angry teenager. The plot is full of absurd holes, that just make the movie unbearable.Avoid this at all costs.

If a corrupt judge was in cahoots, it would take a fast second for them to be reported by an attorney or social worker. So, the premise is nonsense. But this movie is a hot mess for many reasons.

I suppose they'd rather simply steal off each other's reviews than actually sit through this (who can blame them), so maybe it took only one practical joker to cause a chain reaction and propel this turd to 60+ on Metacritic.
At least most of the actors realise they're in a crapfest and they gurn and mug accordingly like office workers auditioning for the Christmas panto.

She did a fantastic job. I had never seen her acting before and I look forward to watching other things she has been or will be in. The plot is average - it's fun watching bad people trying to outgame each other, but it's been done before many times.

Instead the movie goes full force rendering her a evil villain. She is not some con stock broker who is scamming people off their money, she is downright harassing, kidnapping and mentally torturing innocent elderly people and making the last days of their lives horrible!Sorry, I tried really hard but how am I supposed to be on her side? Just because of her identity? Rosamund Pike is a great actress, this is not a critic of her, she just did what was asked of her. The movie however not only fails to build her up as an anti-hero but instead keeps enforcing how evil and dangerous she is!And then the counter villain was so incompetent and soft that it was laughable! It was unbelievable to see how years and years of mafia experience got bested by armature teenage prank methods. Peter Dinklage better got paid well for such self humiliation.Then her love interest was just a damsel in distress posing to be a badass with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is very difficult to sympathise with posers.The ending was a moral hackjob clearly giving out the signal, ""Sorry we just had to do that, but you got the point! She is an awesome anti-hero"".

Most should meet your expectations and be enjoyable enough. 6-7. Really good ones should be 8, great ones 9, and all-time classics that you can re-watch over and over - 10. Average to mild disappointments are 5, 4 is ""not very good"", 3 is mostly bad, 2 is horrible rubbish, and 1 is a high school freshman's first shot at making a film with a cell phone camera.Too many bots - and, it seems, teenagers - rate everything ""1"" or ""10"".

It is a The Onion article that failed to be grotesque enough to be recognized as satire.The movie portrays the most vile and ruthless protagonist, a woman so obsessed with being rich that not even her own life seems to be more important. Perfectly portrayed by Rosamund Pike, a care giver that rips people's lives apart with a smile on her face, and an eerie phrase that serves as the title: I do this to help, I do this because I care. A lot.Then the movie asks the obvious question. How ruthless? How vile? How much power does she have to do this much damage? And to portray the answer pit her against a caricature of a gangster, a Russian mobster.The rest of the movie is a fable of fantasy to bring a point home: success as we know it in a capitalist society is for psychopaths.

The judge is a complete idiot. There has to be admissable evidence and signs of patterned abuse and mistreatment.. why didn't the lawyer fight harder or present better evidence?? Again, I reiterate.. the mob folks straight up murder some characters or attempt to at least and leave other up to chance and once again, who are we supposed to be rooting for? The horrible caretaker who takes advantage of seniors or the son of a mob enterprise? Completely idiotic. Like how is this guy a mafioso, but not infiltrate the nursing home like Joker in Batman movie.. like send 10 guys in there and take out the security.. and torture the caretaker woman til she tells you where the stones are.. she's a civilian.. she would flip with the right tactics.. she's not CIA or trained to not tell.. and the mob did a bad job tossing the house looking for the diamonds. The girlfriend should have died to make the the stakes worth while..

Basically we feel relieved when she is almost killed. From that point on the movie derails, after surviving she goes after the mobster, an act to turn the tables in her favor. After reaching a even more unlikely greedy deal with the mobster, she is finally killed in the last minute of the movie, to what other avail as to moralise? Why this derailed story?

494,aliahmedashraf,Beyond horrible,1,24 February 2021,"As soon as I saw Pike was the main character in the movie, I went ahead and rated this movie 1 star. She was equally, if not more terrible in Gone Girl as well.I do not understand how this movie was green-lit. But it was and here I am with my ""list of things I did not understand"" pertaining to the movie:Is she the ONLY guardian, ever? Are there no others in the city/country?Girl power was rampant in the film and men were put down. The doctor, the guardian, the jewel safekeeper at the pawn shop, the lawyer, Tyrion Lannister etcIs there no cap on how many old people a single state-appointed guardian can have? Refer to Daddy Day Care when Eddie Murphy is told the 5:1 ratio and then later on they need a bigger placeSo Marla just takes ownership of people's assets and then sells houses under her name and as her own properties? Isn't that striking to anyone?With many old people she's busy swindling, one would think that she'd be shot dead a long time ago.If Tyrion was not bothered about the diamonds at the end of the movie as he'd suggested splitting 50-50, why wouldn't you just kill her when you kidnapped her initially and make it easy on yourself?Tyrion instructs his goons to make the death look ""organic"". Wouldn't it be more organic to just inject her with alcohol in the middle of the woods and leave her dead with a bottle in hand as opposed to the elaborate car accident?Why is it that in EVERY movie that promotes girl power, there's a less-efficient Russian mob that are not even able to kill two regular women?Speaking of killing regular women, why didn't Tyrion just kill Marla's mother as a warning shot?Courts can appoint legal guardians for old people without them even knowing that there has been a guardian assigned to them by a court? Sure they claim that the woman has been forgetting things and has possible Alzheimer's but wouldn't there need to be medical tests for that to happen?Guardians cannot access medical records but they take on Tyrion's mom saying that she has Alzheimer's? What proof do they have?Pretty sure that guardians cannot access safety deposit boxesMarla is drugged and set up in a car to make it look like an accident but wakes up before the car drowns AND has full and complete consciousness?

496,Sam_M_Antony,"Cersei Lannister would make Rosamund Pike her ""Hand""! Brilliant Movie!!",9,1 May 2021,"The only way to understand this movie is to compare Rosamund Pike's character Marla Grayson with Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones. You immediately get annoyed and man you will hate her right then and there. There are moments that you get the feeling that you hate her so much and that you don't want to watch the rest of the movie anymore. This happened just exactly to Lena Headey for her portrayal of Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones. Don't miss this movie. It's a brilliant one you will hate.Rosamund Pike's acting in this movie is same as good as the acting of Lena Headey in Game of Thrones and that's why people are rating this movie with so much negative reviews. However this is a must watch movie. It's a brilliant story, different approach and uncommon and well written story with bit of hiccups here and there and might be bit unrealistic too but then again this is a fiction and that's how the writers want us to feel. So get that to your head when you are watching this movie. You are supposed to hate Marla. She's evil. There are no good guys in this movie. All evil trying to fight for a common goal. So don't expect a typical good fighting evil concept in this movie. Expect a evil ride till the end, not a joy ride!The fact that you are supposed to favor the old lady is complicated. You will understand what I'm saying when you watch the movie to the end. Rosamund Pike's acting is terrifying and you will just hate her for it. It's as terrifying as her portrayal in Gone Girl. She's really good. Ending could have been better but it's a simple ending so you get a brief relief at the end. Nevertheless, this is a brilliant must see movie.Ignore the negative reviews. I'm sure Rosamund Pike is reading all these negative reviews and laughing at them while admiring herself for her portrayal and she should.

1. Interesting plot
2. Rosamund Pike's actingwhat I didn't like
1. humour
2. storyline
3. absurd choices leading to poor executionThe movie right from the start states its intention clear: the creation of a criminal who sees the world through binary ""predator-prey"" lenses. Rosamund Pike is carrying the entire movie on her shoulders. It tried to be smart by mentioning Milgram experiments, exploitation of the vulnerable, the rich and their sadistic selfishness. But in-progress, it lost its sensibility and made absurd choices which compounded into poor execution.From gone girl to promising young woman to now I care a lot, we have this wave of creating female anti-heroes. I'm specially mentioning this because all these movies made sure to multiple times talk about how much they hate mansplain and emotionally immature parents. This idea acts as a redeeming arc for their anti-social behaviour. I enjoy them for the sheer thrill of it, but I don't feel comfortable categorising them as an allegory, because their behaviour is extremely toxic. (I'm a girl who hates the stated issues too)So I was in the least expecting a thrilling experience. But it was completely tarnished because of illogical theories. (The backbone of every thriller is its smartness and eccentric boldness.) It also tried to add some humour: silly overdramatic reactions by Peter Dinklage. But that was such a wasted opportunity, it almost felt like a caricature of cartoon villains. It does give a farewell by completing the circle of ""bad people should die"". Creators could have done a lot better, it was cartoonishly paced and incoherent.",I Care a Lot

504,fortionat1,An Interesting (and Distrubing) Story but I Did not Care a Lot for the Characters.,5,2 March 2021,"I wanted to like I Care a Lot (2020) as I know much about the adult living care business and nursing homes and the horrors. I had also just watched The New York Times Framing Britney Spears (2021) that makes relevant the issues of wards and conservatorships. But this is a fictional movie where none of the main characters have any redeeming value and therefore there is no ""good guy"" to root for. The acting was hit and miss, probably because of the screenplay or writing and directing but there were some notable standouts by Dianne Wiest and Rosamund Pike. Most of the men appeared to be incompetent and, as is standard in movies today, the main characters' relationship is gay.So from the get go you feel outrage and frustration with Marla Grayson's callousness as she just takes over sweet old (or so we think) Jennifer Peterson's life and sends her off to a nursing home meanwhile taking over her financial accounts and assets such as her house. This appears to be a regular routine for Marla and her partner. Jennifer's son Roman (Peter Dinklage) is a cliché bad guy eating danishes in a covered parking lot while talking to his incompetent lackey using bad guy jargon. We are not sure how Roman becomes so successful when all the guys working for him appear to be morons including his attorney Dean (Chris Messina).
The first quarter of the movie I was ready to give it a 2 or 1 but the movie was somewhat saved by the last half and ending. There were two notable scenes, one when Jennifer and Marla are talking outside in the patio of the nursing home and second when Marla and Roman have a conversation at the hospital while Roman is in a wheel chair. In the first scene Dianne Wiest does an outstanding job of showing her strength and subtle evil power with the ever slight smile. And in the second we finally get to see the great acting skills of Peter Dinklage when he finally acquiesce to Marla. But again who do you root for? A woman who controls, abuses, and steals from the elderly or a mobster who traffics slaves? Those are your choices and in the end while certainly making wards and conservatorships a concern there is no body you care about or want to come out ahead. It could be a statement about today's society and whether the government should control all aspects of your life, or a statement of the lack of concern adult children have for their elderly parents, but I think it's more about evil people getting ahead.",I Care a Lot

This is supposed to be enjoyed as a flick, not as a drama. Comedy is literally is one of the tags.It's fiction, not reality. Go into this movie without the expectation of seeing real criminal stories.And yes, the movie is about a villain as a protagonist from a society point of view. She's absolutely immoral and unethical, movie never denies this from the get go. Yet she is the protagonist of the story and it's narrated by her and with her point of view. However this doesn't mean we're supposed to root for her.In my opinion this movie is a fun movie with great acting. Cinematography is fun and there's some nice action/tension scenes. You'd be disappointed if you go into this movie waiting for a criminal, legally and realistically accurate masterpiece yes, but if you go in with an open mind and accept that it is fiction, I'm sure you'll like it.Solid 7/10, good fun to be enjoyed as a watch at night over food like I did.

We aren't supposed to side with Marla or endorse her actions. It's a commentary on the exploitation of the elderly (which is awful but undeniably a truth of life) and an entertaining action thriller. The ending very clearly shows we are not supposed to be on Marla's side. As for those who are upset she's not a straight woman with only good things to say about men... your cries of outrage are at best tiresome and at worst pathetic.

The murderous 'Russian' (we wear leather jackets, tracksuits and naff jumpers, so we're totally authentic!) gangsters or the evil people who prey on the elderly? I had hoped this was going to be some sort of satire about the callous way we treat old people or one of those torture-porn-type things where the victims show unexpected skills and turn the tables on their predators, but sadly no.Instead it became a contest of wills between two loathsome psychos where both alternated between being nearly superhuman and unbeliveably stupid - seriously, is some low-rent con artist really going to take on a gun-toting criminal organisation and are the Russian Mafia going to bungle 'kidnapping' a WILLING pensioner from a old people's home?Do old people's homes usually have armed guards on the door for that matter? And are mob lawyers really unable to outwit the courts with millions of dollars of money at their disposal? Can trained assassins not manage to kill an unconcious woman? Is it so easy to section Russian mob bosses who can give away millions of dollars to a woman they profess to hate but can't seem to afford a lawyer/bribe someone in authority?However, fundamental stupidity aside, the cast are very good. Weist and Pike put in top performances in a film that doesn't really deserve it, while Dinkage would undoubtably be commanding 20-million-dollar salaries if his roles weren't unfortunately somewhat limited by his small stature.However, it's warped morality - what a missed opportunity to show old people in a more complex light -, increasingly illogical plot twists, and, most ridicuously, the fact that we're supposed to see revolting degenerates who force old people into care homes and take their homes, savings and dignity as some sort of feminist icons, left a rather bad taste in my mouth. As did the fact that Russians (indeed any other Eastern Europeans) are now continually stereotyped as gangsters and prostitutes these days in a way the film industry would never do for any other ethnic group.Stop trying to be edgy Amazon; you're not Netflix, you have an older and more family-orientated demographic, and you'd instead do better making movies that would have the maximum mass appeal.",I Care a Lot

The viewer doesn't want her to triumph, and as the action becomes more and more unbelievable, the story more ridiculous, you realize you've been tricked into watching a terrible movie.

The story, while not entirely original, kept me on the edge of my seat especially with its many twists and turns along the way and I applaud the writers for making me interested from beginning to end. Although, let's be real, Rosamund Pike's performance is what carried the film proving once again that the woman who portrayed one of the most cynical characters in film can do justice one way or another.

Our protagonist is no mere con artist or huxter - she's deeply thoroughly reprehensible and irredeemable. So, okay, I'm ready to watch her do her thing, and then get what she deserves in the end, right?But somewhere along the way the film begins to treat her not as the bad guy we want to see go down in flames, but as a feminist anti-hero archetype. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely game for a movie with a feminist anti-hero archetype! But this character is simply not that. She's so horrible and insidious that I found myself willing to handwave the literal sexual slavery that the Russians were doing, just so I could have SOMEONE to root for! The movie seems totally oblivious to this issue, and plows ahead for a much too long runtime, all the while assuming I was hoping this wretched person would pull through. I just didn't buy it, and I was not at all in the headspace the film seemed to expect me to be in (and, really, who would be??).That being said, it's quite well-shot and well-acted.

The difference is that 20 years ago I would have rejected it outright. Now, it's more astonishment. Yeah, the movie does make it way too simple but the premise is realistic. Some people HAVE done this and gotten away with it! It's not meant to be a full examination of the legal system. Yes, it's dumbed down a bit and overly simplistic. It's not a documentary folks.

567,supertaz80,Sociopathic con artist abuses system for profit - intense drama with some comic moments,9,26 February 2021,"Great story - fairly original idea for a con movie- great acting- horrible characters - an indictment on society and the legal system.I really enjoyed this film. It has some fierce and determined characters who use whatever type of power they can (financial, social, legal) to play the game of life.The main character Marla narrates at parts about being the lion or the lamb in life - and she has determined to be a lioness. That is, she relays how life is brutal and playing fair doesn't get anyone anywhere.So you know from the start this film is going to be about brutal, callous behaviours. It's about a sociopathic woman who has determined to be a lioness in life, to play the system of society, and will take our nearly anyone to achieve her goal of financial power. Not just rich. Really stinking rich.I wouldn't say it's a comedy but it has funny moments. Like when Marla realises her latest conquest was not the easy mark she was hoping. Or when that easy mark laughs in her face (no spoilers).The acting was great. Pike convincingly plays a conniving, manipulative, sociopathic horror of a person. The cons she pulls, the tactics- are awful. Those that help her? Unbelievable. Dinklage was also awesome as the mafia boss who hates that someone is messing with his curated life. Wiest is fiesty as but is pretty much marginalised in the film. I agree with a review I read that said it would've been great to see her play a larger part, though her disempowerment at being made a ward, was perhaps central to the story of systemic flaws and the fear of being deprived of independence when you're older.I'm not sure the extent that such practices happen in real life, but, obviously the treatment of elderly persons and the aged care systems are highly questionable. This just adds a level of scare really. Is this what awaits us?

574,RageQuitLeigh,I wish I cared more,6,27 February 2021,"It's hard to decide whether this is a good or bad film. If you look reviews you'll generally see one end of the spectrum or the other. That's because it looks great and is well acted, but the opening 40 minutes is a real slog to get through and really gives you nothing to like or root for moving into the second half.The premise of the movie is one of Marla Grayson, a con artist, who's hustle is to identify wealthy older people with limited attachments and along with doctors who are in on it to have them put in care homes under court orders with the responsibility to care passed to the guardianship of Marla. Once in the home all the patients assets are sold and the person is effectively in a medical jail with no outside communication and no way out. It is once they cherry pick an exceptionally wealthy single woman who seemingly has no family that things start to unfold.The core of the story has been told in different guises multiple times in modern cinema and to name a few of them would 'spoil' the film and ending. That being said it was somewhat predictable. However it is more a case of the story not being told well enough here. We essentially have a story of all bad people, but typically we are given reasons to want one or more to succeed in their goal. The script does nothing to assist this. As the story progress whilst certain things happens you never feel that there is any jeopardy of any of the core characters and because of this you really don't care. I suspect that many people will give up in the first 20-30 minutes, its boring and spiteful with no clear direction.It is a pity because visually the movie looks pretty good. It's a well shot movie with well chosen music. The cast is fantastic and the acting is top notch from the core cast notably Pike and Dinklage.It's possible that the subject matter of essentially incarcerating elderly people and fleecing them of all they have is so grimy that it's hard to look past this, when there are no redeeming features or values of the core characters.Ultimately this movies feels like a missed opportunity. I feel that somewhere there is an exceptional memorable movie thats could have been made, they just failed in doing so.",I Care a Lot

People get drugged or beaten to being killed, but -they not only survive- they get on admirably. An inebriated woman suddenly wakes up in her car, which has fallen in a lake and she manages to break the glass of her car, hitting it which her legs (which had apparently gotten superpowers), swim, and survives.

Or so I thought.When Marla Grayson survived the car crash and Fran survived the home invasion, somehow everything just doesn't matters anymore. Because I knew I'm not goner get what I hoped for as a viewer. Doesn't matter that Marla did died in the end, it's how it was being done. One of my favorite actor was made to looked like a small time mafia boss who couldn't get things done right despite his very intimidating and convincing big boss aura and act. This is the biggest disappointment in the entire movie. Roman Lunyov is made to look CHEAP here.I understands that Marla ain't supposed to be killed off so easily like that (during the made-up car crash) and I also understands that as a movie, certain things are made to be unrealistic. But the truth is there is a uncomfortable amount of FANTASY here. Marla and Fran ain't even believable. They shouldn't have this much connection and power in the film.

Awful, stomach-churning, uninteresting antagonists. And the supporting characters are also awful. What's worse is when they don't even try to give you some redeeming qualities. The only thing you can do is decide which character is worst in terms of the story, which one is ""the bad guy"" who actively victimizes others characters, and which character is ""the bad guy"" in another story. Here, you root for the murderous Russian (???don't get me started on this gaffaw) mob. And they are terrible. But their story is not being told here, so... ehhhh (shrug)?But still, usually in this scenario the story forces you to challenge your own values, what you believe is ""right"" and ""wrong,"" ""good"" and ""evil."" This does not do this. This movie made me uneasy. This movie made me feel sick. This movie made me sad. And then when I thought I didn't have anything left bad to feel, I thought, wow, these characters would not do this. Unbelievable. The writing just drove itself off a cliff and into a lake. And it didn't smash the window and crawl out to safety. It stayed on the bottom of the lake, where Marla should have stayed.Yes, after the car ""accident"" the story becomes contrived. I no longer even believe these characters are real. It's absurd. Every little thing that happens after the lake is completely unentertainingly unbelievable. Many times I said, just turn it off, but a part of me thought, maybe if something happens to ""the bad guy,"" the movie can redeem itself. But it got so awful that the end wasn't enough. I actively disliked this movie until about :45 to the credits.Were I you, I would not watch this movie except for sheer curiosity, and sadly, it's not worth it.

Clearly they know that people are only happy with the same old predictable nonsense. Rosamund Pike is fabulous in this. Peter Dinklage did a great job, too. I loved how they made both main characters villains for a change. I hated her character with a vengeance and felt sickened by what she was doing. But that is what made the film so fascinating. It was cleverly done because there were times I feel a teeny bit of empathy for both antagonists. I did start to wonder if the film would fail to completely condemn Marla's actions, especially as at one point it seemed to revel in the ""girl power"" of Marla and her sidekick. The film really gets you thinking about how cunning, manipulative people can abuse the system. It really opened my eyes to what corruption and injustice can go on if you are able to use the law to your advantage. Yes, there were flaws and aspects that were unbelievable (especially her escape from the car and the overly idiotic henchmen) but I was riveted throughout.

On later realising that it was a thriller along the line of Gone Girl had me interested and then with the Golden Globe appreciation, it found itself in my watchlist.The first part of the movie until the introduction Peter Dinklage had me genuinely disturbed, fearing for my future, my parents future. The idea that our life and how we spent our later phase of life was not entirely upto us had me really scared. With shift in dynamics with Dinklage's character, there was genuine dilemma as to support. Even though we see the evil nature of Marla, Roman is not a hero or anti-hero either. It was just two villains squaring off against each other. But after a few more minutes it was clear that movie was not going to be as grand as I expected.Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage are easily what holds this movie. Rosamund Pike seems really comfortable playing characters that are inherently twisted but puts on a glossy sheen over themselves. Peter Dinklage also gives a genuinely intimidating performance. Its a marvel to see how he embraces his limitations to become a character that embodies menacing bossy villain. I would love to see him try out his range, since this seemed to be an extension of his Tyrion Lannister character.The concept behind the movie had great potential and that is exactly was made the first part of the movie gripping, but then it seemed to end too soon without properly exploiting the characters and their capabilities.",I Care a Lot

In 6 of these 20 cases, the courts failed to adequately screen guardians ahead of time and appointed individuals with criminal convictions or significant financial problems, and in 12 of 20 cases, the courts failed to oversee guardians once they had been appointed.In October 2017, The New Yorker published an article looking at the situation in Nevada in which professional guardians sometimes have a number of clients, and argued toward the conclusion that in a number of cases the courts did not properly oversee these arrangements. In 2018 the investigative documentary ""The Guardians"" was published, alleging ""legal kidnapping of elderly people"" in Nevada by private guardianship businesses with no familial or other preexisting relations to their wards, seeking to economically profit from seniors' savings.",I Care a Lot
634,xenomorph_uk,Immoral and Repugnant,3,18 October 2021,"Rosamund Pike plays the part of a Guardian, a person assigned by the court to care for elderly people. Pike's character targets easy victims who are wealthy and who are unable to fight back. She takes control of their finances and assets through a network of equally corrupt associates such as doctors, care home staff, police etc, most of whom are portrayed by females.On the other side of this story is Pike's latest victim, a wealthy elderly lady who they falsely detain under a mental health act. Unbeknownst to them, their latest victim is well connected as her son, the amazingly talented Peter Dinklage, is a former mafia boss with a propensity to violence.The movie is framed in such a way that the viewer is expected to feel pity and sympathy for Pike's side of the story by providing an even more evil and depraved character and utterly fails in this regard. In reality, any sane viewer would desire an equally horrible ending for all parties involved.Modern Hollywood type movies are by default, woke. The obsession being outright attacks on traditional western values, and this movie is no exception to the rule. It's no coincidence that almost everyone on Pike's side of the story is female whilst everyone on Dinklage's side are males.The message here is that women are better and more powerful than men in every way, yet this movie portrays the female characters as evil and deeply immoral. Hardly a standard anyone should aspire to.It's a shame really.

646,StoryLover10,"Yes, It's Dark Satire",5,1 March 2021,"For all those trolling and panning the movie, let's be fair. It's not the ""worst movie ever."" Nor is it brilliant by any stretch.I found myself unimpressed by Rosamund Pike's portrayal, but am not convinced it was her acting as much as the script and her character's role. That said, most everyone else I the film seemed to deliver their lines without making me cringe. Peter Dinklage and Dianne Wiest were tastefully campy and villainous as the quasi protagonists. The girlfriend, played by Eiza González, was a believable performance. However, as the antagonist, Pike was detached and over the top. A few of her lines angered me a little, for e.g., when you have misbehaved badly, and are deservedly called a pejorative, albeit a chauvinistic one, you should never appropriate faux outrage and cry sexism. As an older woman, I would have called her a B too. Also, the car escape was a bit nonsensical as was the subsequent kidnapping and retaliation of Dinklage's character.Now for the worthy: This film is a statement on capitalism, greed, senior abuse, and can be personal for some of us who approach the vulnerable age for whom unscrupulous guardianship and elder care is an uncomfortable possibility. I was a little pissed that Dinklage's character acquiesced, but upon reflection, that would not have been farfetched and consistent with the characters' inclinations. In the end, we're conditioned to film endings filled with righteous indignation and retribution, i.e., the Hollywood ending. ""I Care a Lot"" provided this satisfaction. It reminded me a little of ""The Player"" in the way the film kind of turned into itself. I would not likely watch it again, but it is not worth all the contempt either.",I Care a Lot

Not even one time... how is that remotely believable considering this is their daily full time job? Makes ZERO sense. Especially after countless ppl talk him up like hes this brilliant king pin. Even the lawyer is terrible at his job...as a comedy its not funny at all save for a few lines early on. None of it plays out like a comedy so i cant imagine this is what they were going for but... if so... bad.It feels like a half fleshed out black mirror future episode where theres like this tiny story around a world that is never explained and entirely impossible.Oh.... theres also about 30 mins wasted of literally just wathing ppl work out in slow mo?

666,joshuarenealvarez,I Care a Lot (2020),7,1 June 2021,"I Care a Lot is a black comedy thriller written and directed by J Blakeson. Oscar-nominee Rosamund Pike returns
to the screen as a Massachusetts-based con-artist posing as a legal guardian by the name of Marla Grayson.This is an individual who makes a living off the exploitation
of elderly citizens without any ounce of remorse or sympathy for their livelihoods. From this character's first introduction, Pike has proven once again why she is a favorite actress of mine and quite simply one of the greatest actresses of our time. Completely dominating her role as a soft spoken wolf in sheep's clothing who will
do anything to achieve her desires. She has masterfully perfected her craft within the acting business, and this feature leaves the viewer yearning for her next release.Without her involvement, I do not believe this
film would have been as captivating.Behind her beautiful exterior is a vicious and conniving figure who is unwilling to lose. This is why she receives more than bargained for when she becomes the overseer of a wealthy retiree named Jennifer Peterson whom she seizes all assets from. We come to learn that this woman isn't whom she appears to be. Having ties to the Russian mafia with her son being the head of that organization.Peter Dinklage delivering a strong performance as the second antagonist. This film devolves into a story about how to sharks are willing to go head-to-head and rise out on top. I found this film to be very engrossing during it's first half as it's tone was grounded in realism. It was only until the second half that the film starts losing a bit of it's momentum and stretches implausibly. However,
it didn't completely take me out of the film.The ending of this film did leave me dissatisfied due to the direction of where they took the main character's story arc. I personally felt it was a cop-out to convey
that we all receive our day of requital.I Care a Lot - [7/10]Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

Just because she is a conniving witch does not make her some kind of survival expert. Anyone in her position would have folded when the lawyer approached them and been smart about it.As for the basic story, all the Dinklage character needed to do was to send some people into the care facility at night, extract his mother and if necessary burn the place to the ground.

Her well-oiled scheme has a bit of speed bump when she sets her sights on Jennifer (Dianne Wiest) who seems like a slam dunk case with no relatives or friends to vouch for her. Marla soon discovers that someone out there has Jennifer's best interests in mind and they'll make her life miserable until she lets Jennifer free.I Care A Lot is a film without a truly sympathetic character in sight and, if that turns you off, I suggest not seeing this movie. It'll probably just make you angry and you won't get a lot of dark humor sprinkled throughout. For those with slightly more open minds, there's a lot to enjoy here but especially the performances.

Instead the storyline flails about wildly with no logical progression but then ties itself up neatly at the end, by which point you don't care and have stopped believing in the characters anyway.I've given it four stars because despite its failings I think some people will still enjoy it and the start of the film is quite good.",I Care a Lot

685,Blightman,a glaring spotlight on real world issues turned messy crime drama,7,2 October 2021,"The massive quantity of low ratings on this film from suspicious accounts tells you all you need to know about the central core of this film and its role in the healthcare industry. Particularly egregious in the US, these guardianship scams are absolutely real and happen to people all the time. Elderly folk are particularly vulnerable to scams as it is, be it fake tech support, government imposters or robocall scammers, many older folk are overwhelmed and confused by predatory tactics of such awful people. Guardianship scams are just as bad, if not worse, because the programs that involve these bad actors are often appointed by court and legally bound.While the events of the story are not true, there are many cases of such things happening. Take, for example, the case of Rebecca Fierle-Santoian, who had 450 guardianship cases assigned to her when she was arrested for elder abuse and neglect. These are the actions of someone who does not value human life outside of her own- just like Marla.I see this film as a more accessible way to raise awareness of an issue without going full documentary and losing half your potential viewers. The final quarter-to-third of this movie is ridiculous and requires some suspension of disbelief as it departs from the central core of guardianship scams to focus on Marla and her rapidly spiraling control over her own life. It doesn't make me feel cheated or as if the movie was ruined, I believe they made a decision to back off from the topic to focus on the cinematic climax of the film. Whether or not it was the right call is up to you. I thought it was silly but I like documentaries myself and American cinema is American cinema.

There's like...massive, unbelievable plot holes here, and the stuff happens just because the director wants them to, not because they make any real sense or are believable, even in the context of the story.I really enjoyed Peter Dinklage, but that has a lot to do with his own personal charisma, because again, the writing kind of fails him.I mean, I commented to my wife (who'd already seen the movie and her primary comment was that it was ""just weird!"") - that I wasn't sure who I was supposed to be rooting for in the movie!

The film missed Marla's back story, like how did she get into guardianship, and realised it was profitable? From there the audience are expected to tag along, so tag along I did, as. This isn't a film that expects the audience to think. It all seems a bit two dimensional, Roman doesn't really seem to hold a grudge, he starts angry, but seems to settle when he should be most angry.

However, the script seems to be lazy in details and they saved themselves a lot of work by extremely simplifying real-world processes and taking enormous shortcuts. Because of all these details, the movie felt unrealistic and like a complete fantasy which is a shame.Also, the main protagonist and her partner are unlikeable, not just in the sense of their character role but that you do not even enjoy seeing them in their bad roles. I mostly felt like I am wasting time by watching these characters on screen all the time and wished the movie was more about Jennifer who is played by Dianne Wiest - probably the only likeable performance in the movie.The ending was just as lazily done as the whole movie and did not bring any remediation. Do not get me wrong, technically speaking, the movie feels nice, fluid and done well, it is just the script and actors that you will probably find so boring.I can appreciate satire, comedy, drama and difficult movies but this does not hit the mark in any of these categories and kind of just taps a little into everything.

The beginning was great and had they stuck with that story- or maybe Weist (the mother) outsmarting Marla or someone bringing their scam to light we all would have felt more satisfied. There was absolutely no background to Marla's character-why did she hate her own mom and have no fear? Where did she get a wig, taser guns and drugs? Overnight? And after breaking out of sinking car? Way too improbable. She wasn't a lioness... she was a monster preying on innocent elderly people. At least in the end the saying ""what comes around goes around"" came to fruition and that son (who never got to see his mom) had some sort of justice or vengeance...though I would have preferred for her to go to jail or end up in someone's custody (preferably Jennifer's that would have been ironic)...in a psych ward or facility like she did to so many.",I Care a Lot

But watching a couple of 30ish female Medicare grifters outthink, outmaneuver and plain old outmuscle an international multi-million dollar Russian drug ring is ridiculous.The entire story is riddled with plot holes and improbabilities, mangling the suspension of disbelief through the vehicles of inept mob lawyers, paper tiger bodyguards and timid gangsters who apparently fail to consider the possibility of just putting a bullet into the heads of their adversaries. Laughable coincidences, impossible escapes and plot twists are all required to drive the story forward. When that's all done and the utterly amoral main character has gotten away with all her vile deeds, the tale culminates in a deus ex machina in some sort of weak ""see, crime doesn't pay after all"" moral after the film just spent 90 minutes showing us that it unequivocally does.

There were so many plot holes and implausibility that it was the ONLY thing comical about the movie, in spite of this being mislabeled as a comedy. I mean between the grossly incompetent judge and mafia members, to the ridiculous notion that some white collar suburban criminal not only has the sophistication but the BALLS to successfully take on a mafia boss, is lazy and childish writing at best. So basically the FBI and all the alphabet agencies with their immense resources don't have nothing on this woman? Also, while I get the writers wanted to play two bad people against one another, I don't think it makes for good movie when the viewer has to suffer watching this character abuse, steal, manipulate so many people and systems, especially against the elderly. I know this is just a movie but I was so enraged and wanted Pike's character to die a horrific, painful death after being tortured! Yeah twisted but that's how pissed I was. So to see that she wasn't outwitted or wasn't overpowered by the Russian mafia the entire time was painful to watch. And then we get this clumsy ending. Sure I was happy she was murdered but it just wasn't enough to make up for all the destruction she caused with the lives of the elderly and their families. Plus she really didn't care about living or dying so it would have been better id she was beaten at her own game.Also I felt the pacing was off at times, and overall the movie felt too long! 30 minutes could have been shaved off without losing anything from the movie.",I Care a Lot

To be honest, The second I saw Macon Blair's character I knew how this despicable woman would meet her end. IMO, the writer/director knew that the audience also felt a sense of relief at seeing this device. It certainly helped me calm down enough to enjoy the cat and mouse game that they threw at us. Yes, Ms. Pike is typecast in the role she had already played in Gone Girl, but when you are good at something, give the people what they want. Her character got away clean in Gone Girl, but this is a much different, less cerebral but clever story.
Suspend your disbelief. Put your politics (sexual and otherwise) aside for 2 hours and enjoy a film, that, if you let it - will have you thoroughly entertained, and the first half hour is an education in the ghoulish behavior that can legally take place in the elderly healthcare racket.

It is dark material about systemic abuse, not unlike 99 Homes, but don't blame the movie or shoot the messenger Remember that, unlike 99 Homes, it is a comedy. Maybe it is the stellar cast that is confusing everyone into thinking it is something it is not. Maybe it was the trailers (I haven't seen any for this particular film, but I have seen some very deceptive trailers for other films.)

The most disappointing for me is the 'character' played by Peter Dinklage.Oh how the mighty have fallen. Peter was outstanding in Game of Thrones. His character had depth and intelligence. Not so in this flick. Here he plays a gangster who expresses himself by throwing objects at his office wall. I've seen cartoon characters with more gravitas than this. So much wasted potential. Early on there was a character who played the victim. She could have been the person the audience rooted for but no that opportunity was also squandered.The theme of this movie was promising.

But Dinklage is very likeable and loves his Mum and is not hiding anything. He did not seek out these women and was protecting his family. Whereas the women are involved in activities that make them the lowest level of humanity preying on the weak and feeble. There was an opportunity to redeem this when Ms Pike thought the only way to fight was legally and she challenged Dinklage in her arena seemingly unaware that not everyone fights fairly.

I was hoping for more based on the cast.The movie's plotline seems like it was written by taking a bunch of random ideas written on pieces of paper, thrown into a hat, and then drawing a few with the intent to tie them all together somehow.The characters are all horrible people with no development whatsoever throughout the film. Who are they? Why are they doing what they do? We really don't have much of an idea.The movie is an aimless trainwreck that includes pointless montages over cheesy upbeat music, a shallow love story between two women, random gun shootouts, various druggings that seem to almost work, a ridiculous car crash scene, and an ending that is completely unbelievable. The ""villians"" in this movie are secret members of some Russian organized crime syndicate, but seem to be completely incompetent when faced with dealing with a sociopathic suburban white woman. One would think that they know how to kill and dispose of a body after drugging her and rendering her unconscious. Instead, they develop some over the top scheme to make her death look like a car crash. Why didn't they kill her first and then crash the car?Why does it seem that these tranquilizer drugs are readily available at the local pharmacy since everybody seems to have them when needed? How are the judicial system and the caretaking facilities so inept at dealing with their ""wards""? The major plot line of the story relies on the viewer believing that the state would kidnap a perfectly healthy older woman and without any sort of serious medical assessment and then hand her over to a caretaker without allowing family any sort of access.The acting is sub-mediocre. Peter Dinklage is certainly no Tyrion Lannister in this bomb.

795,clairekalsto,"Hey, here's an actual review",4,22 February 2021,"So yeah, this movie is... not good. It started off strongly, with your typical anti-hero (Maria Grayson), who has a high determination, low moral grounds and no limits whatsoever to acheive her capitalist goals in an unforgiving society. She's basically praying on lonely elder and takes over there possessions through court process under the desguise of ""caring"". Its pretty clear from the get-go that she is NOT the good guy in this story, and despite the sheer disgust for Maria's actions, for the first 20 minutes or so, the catarsis is DEFINETELY REAL, and you're actually invested in the story. I didn't watch the trailer in its entierety to not get spoiled so I was expecting some kind of great dramatic/a bit comedic mix between Gone Girl and Wolf of Wallstreet, with Rosamund Pike being perfect for this type of role.Sadly, the movie takes a strong thriller turn after that and everything goes downhill from there.
We basically learn that the elderly woman our protagonist took advantage of is in fact link with even wrost people (Russian Mafia whom every single member speaks perfect english, they didn't even tried) and from there the movie basically tries to turn the narrative into making us feel like we should somehow be rooting for Maria because...the mafia guy attacks her entourage to get her mother back? The character is not challenged once in her system of beleif. People do go in her way, her girlfriend questions her, but not once does she sitback and actually asks herself if dying for the sake of living the american dream, solely through praying on the most vulnerable part of the population on top of that, is actually worth it. It actually took me like half the movie to realise we weren't meant to root for the mafia guy who just wants his mother back.
I won't spend too much time into the details of the péripétie, its basically full of plot armor, incompetent vilains, and a ridiculously fearless protagonist who at the start of all this is just supposed to be your average crook who takes advantage of people weaker than her. With a different dynamic it could've been an interresting movie. Painting Pike's character as a bit cowardly yet kind of stubborn and determined, eager for her part of the cake and slowly realizing how far she's willing to go to get it. Then in contrast you could have this big scary russian guy, who got all this power but at the end of the day just wants to make sure his family's secure.
But instead we have an overconfident, awfully corrupted protagonist versus a kind of nice, but ridiculously unorganised and under-armed russian guy, which really just makes it feel like she's bullying him and his family into giving her all his money the whole time.And then, well, long story short, she just gets what she wants. We basically have to sit through the movie and follow this horrible character hoping she eventually get some sort of redemption only to see her get rewarded for basically being the wrost in the room. SPOILERS she eventually gets shot, after of course a very under the nose 10 minutes speech about doing the right choice between being the prey or the predator, which in retrospective really just seems like a poor way to make her pay for her actions since you know she never reflected once during her journey and even stated outloud she didn't care about dying.Tho I think this movie IS a syndrome of a certain wave of ""white exceptionalist feminism"" (reminder that being gay isn't a personality trait, cause its literaly the only thing that characterise the girlfriend. She just keep watching Maria in a horny way and worries about her, that's about it. Also needless to say there's close to no POC in this movie, the entierety of POC characters must have around 8 lines all together), I don't think it should be judged as such. Its obviously a bad movie, but it'd could've genuinely have been a great, and no, overall politics don't have anything to do with this movie's flaws. The characters, especially Maria, are intriguing but poorly develloped. It just kept missing, and missing, everytime they had an opportunity to turn this right. Its really just, imo, another case of writers putting to much of themselves into a character and thus refusing them to have even one flaw or some room for them to grow throughout the film. Making inevitably their opponents strong on paper, but weak in practice, because there can only be one ""badass"" in the room. It happened before and it will happen again, regardless of the gender or orientation of the protagonist.So yeah, in conclusion: eat the rich.",I Care a Lot

People saying that this and that isn't realistic are right but nitpicking. You're forgetting this is taking place in the suburbs, not in a big city. Things like this happen.Regardless, Rosamund Pike delivers another top tier acting performance and that's all there is to say about the movie. An excellent soundtrack on top throughout the film. What else do you need?Dianne Wiest plays someone who is being taken advantage of and also being pumped full of drugs very convincingly. I almost actually felt bad for her. The ""bad guys"" in the film lack character, especially Dinklage but I can look past it, it isn't about them. It's about the star, Rosamund Pike as Marla Grayson.The ending was unexpected, not in a bad way, but I still have mixed feelings about it. Take it how you will.""I don't loose. I won't loose.

The intensely dislikable protagonist couple are the key problem here.Because of that fact, it's extremely difficult to take any interest in their unbelievably far fetched and inane story. This lowers the film from being a standard dire mess to being an exceptional dire mess, because you spend a lot of the movie hoping that things will end badly for the main characters as soon as possible.That really does bring the movie squarely to rock bottom for viewing entertainment. In fact I'm writing this review as the movie enters its final 20 minutes as I know full well what is coming, so I can at least use some of this painful 2 hours to warn others off from making the mistake of watching this exceptionally poor and thoroughly unenjoyable film.",I Care a Lot

I also enjoyed a lot from all performances, and maybe some of them could've had a little more screen time and development such as Dianne Wiest's character which I think was perfectly played and developed in the first half but she just seems to fade in the other.Another aspect about these characters that I really liked it's this very cartoon atmosphere that sometimes you get from a Coen Brothers' or Tarantino movies, that I think it's well displayed here and makes it all very entertaining and fun to watch.I think the plot is creatively written, it has some subtle critiques and a little bit of acid humor that I think works really fine here mostly because of its performances and direction. The only thing that I feel it's lacking here is maybe a little more of realism, the plot sometimes seems absurdly non plausible and that might affect you experience with it.But overall I think the movie worked really well and never failed to entertain me, I'm highly recommending it and that's all..

The thing that makes anti-heros so great is their conflicted views of the world. Witnessing the struggle of bad actions for neutral or good intentions makes characters captivating, in the way you can't look away from a car accident.
There are many instances of this being perfectly executed (above mentioned leads), as well as Walter White, AND EVEN THE PLANET MURDERING THANOS.
There wasn't a single moment in this completely plot hole ridden film where I thought, ""this character is interesting, I want to see what's she's about.""
This film filled me with many emotions: disgust, hate, loathing, wanting to gouge out my eyes and smush my fingers in a door. Maybe that was the intention. If it was, the writers need to go to time-out, and think about what they did.
There is no reason to watch this film unless you are a lawyer or care facility employee, who will be motivated to make sure gigantic turds like Marla Grayson will never have access to people their only goal in life is to exploit.

I came to the conclusion that the director/writer sympathized with the vile main character played by Rosamund Pike, Marla. Marla comes across as a super hero, except that her superpower is selfishness, self-absorption and inflicting suffering on completely innocent people.This movie is listed as a comedy, but where the humor is completely escapes me. Marla's enemy is Peter Dinklage, named Roman, and his acting skills almost succeed in making him human, but there just isn't enough of a real person written into his character. Nice try though. Marla and Roman team up together at the end which looks and feels extremely phony. Real criminals are not so forgiving.Marla has a lover who shares her ethics, and a vile philosophy which basically states that humanity is divided up between predators and prey and that is the justification for her being a predator. She is killed by one of her victims at the end, but that looks like an artificial ending tacked on to make the movie more acceptable to a mainstream audience. It doesn't work. Marla is the intended hero of the movie, not her victims.I feel sorry for anyone who has such a sick, warped, violent, sadistic view of the human race.

But there's really no good guys in this movie, it's a mess of worse & more worse. But it definitely makes you feel something.

She is relentless. She goes up against the Russian mafia with claws out.My wife and I are in later midlife, so realizing that there is an industry that preys on older people in this government-sanctioned way was positively disturbing. The water-tight tactics that the main character uses to lock people into a life of drugged-up existence where their wealth is quickly drained away brings about emotions that are difficult to shake, even a day or two later. Rosamund Pike plays this horrible character beautifully, with her severe haircut and her icy stare.Our main reason for watching was to see Peter Dinklage again, loving him as we did in Game of Thrones. He doesn't disappoint. He's evil too, by the way. Pretty much everybody is. Dianne Wiest probably has the best line in the movie. When she finds out what Pike's character is up to, she thinks of her connection to the Russian mafia, smiles and squeals ""You're in such trouble!""I somewhat understand the negative reviews, actually. This isn't a happy-go-lucky Hollywood plot. It doesn't play nicely with all the various ""rules"" of a story, particularly that anyone in the story should be likeable and trying to do something good (no one is).

She did play the character very well, not as nuanced as in Gone Girl of course but that's hard to achieve anyways.Dianne Wiest and Peter Dinklage played their characters very well. So, the acting was not what disappointed me about this movie, it was basically everything else.The Movie starts of quite interesting, it had an interesting premise. That is, until it becomes more and more ridiculous by the minute. Things happen, that are not just unlikely but downright implausible. This makes the premise; which is rooted in reality and quite a serious subject for that matter, feel like it doesn't even connect to what the movie becomes later on, only to be rebooted at the very end.Now a movie does by no means have to be realistic or plausible, but if it chooses to go along this path it should do it well or at least commit to it. In this case the ridiculousness is just topped by further ridiculousness.Lastly, I didn't enjoy the very saturated and quite vibrant color grading but I could've lived with that if it wasn't for the other problems.All in all, I don't recommend this movie, it is not necessarily a waste of time or a 1/10, but it isn't worthy of a viewers time either.",I Care a Lot

When I saw she was starring in this film, I was looking forward to another great job on her part. I got it. She's always good in everything she's in. As to the movie itself, I came away disappointed. I gave the film a higher rating than it probably deserved, just because of the acting.It starts out promising, but as others have noted, changes halfway through and puts Rosamund's character into that of an avenging James Bond type, who after surviving an assassination attempt, heads out to take on the Russian mafia. It seems the writers wanted us to sympathize with her, when we've already become invested in hating her for confining rich seniors in nursing homes, becoming their court appointed guardian and stealing everything of value they own. Her mistake was in unknowingly confining the mom of the head of the Russian mafia, played by Peter Dinklage.Rosamund was, as always, magnificent, but the plot line was horrendous.

863,nikosxen,Absolut Garbage,1,20 February 2021,"This film is just garbage, absolute garbage. I had high hopes from the premise. But five minutes in and and the movie starts pandering with social garbage. Our protagonist has just destroyed a woman's life and her son comes after her calling her names and her reaction is to respond as if the cause of his outburst is mainly propelled by the fact that she is a woman, which of course automatically means that he thinks of her as being inferior...What? I mean, what kind of garbage is this? Let me give you some advice. If you want to portray someone, as a sexist pig, you have to give some context, some background so we can get behind our protagonist and her claims, or else she just becomes an obscene dislikeable mess. Generally the protagonist has to have some sort of redeeming quality, we as an audience have to care of her/him in some way, even if it's minute. What we got was probably the most dislikeable character ever made, to the point where the movie becomes a cringe mess. I watched this movie because of Rosamund Pike, I think she is a terrific actor and I just keep comparing this movie to Gone Girl. In contrast to this garbage, what we got there was a perfect balance between someone who was kind of an anti hero, kind of a villain, BUT you understood her background and there were times were you felt sympathy for her and even routed for her, even if she was a psychopath. Also, all the social commentary about genre stereotypes was perfectly portrayed and spot on and you could clearly see the problems. This is what a good script is supposed to look like. I just don't get why Netflix would greenlight a garbage like this and I have an extremely hard time understanding who would find this movie to be even adequate.",I Care a Lot

Marla had her bad bxtch moments which I liked but they were watered down with nonsense. Events were choppy and there were no moments where we had the chance to reflect on the character or the plot (especially with no character nor plot to reflect upon).Reminds me of the nightcrawler with Jake Gyllenhaal.

It did exactly what it wanted to do. I only give it a 6 because that's how enjoyable it was to me. We got hints of backstory with a few characters and no arcs, but they didn't want to do that, it seems. It's more of a story of a bunch of people playing a game, not their personal developments. The thing is, it's not that fun or interesting of a game, and maybe that's because most of the characters are dislikable, so I'm not rooting for what happens, filled with tension as they almost get what they want, I'm rooting for what doesn't happen (don't want to comment on ending). Overall I think it's a neatly put together plot and does have interesting twists and turns and a lot of cause and effect. It just feels a little like the last few episodes of a season of something. I would be more on board if I knew these characters well enough to care (a lot haha) about all this. It jumps into the action a little early for me.

I'm not giving anything away that the trailer didn't already showcase. You have Marla Grayson the ice cold protagonist who is stealing money from senior citizens that she and her partners concoct a fake report that they're unfit to care for themselves. Marla and her girlfriend Fran choose the wrong person to victimise, one who has ""powerful friends"".
The promise of the evil ice queen and her goopy girlfriend getting theirs falls short around an hour and 20 minutes into the film.
I really hated the ending. I wish I could have my hour and fifty eight minutes back. Really? So dumb and unbelievable.
Also I couldn't help but notice that the main characters were all white (save for Fran) and all the ""help"" roles were people of color. But it makes sense in that the whole message was about capitalising on those who can't speak for themselves.

The concept is great and catchy - but the execution unfortunately starts to feel like a cheesy lifetime movie pretty quick - and there isn't a single redeemable quality about any character in the movie - so it's tough if not impossible to get behind any character at all. I love a good anti-hero - but there are no anti-heroes in this movie. It's just a contest to see who can be the worse villain and it ends up feeling cheap.

The third act isn't as tight as the rest of it, but it still ends well enough. I think people are missing that this is essentially a comedy, and perhaps people sensed it would go in a different direction and were disappointed that it didn't focus more on a war between Pike and Wiest (which would have rocked).

952,bvalmsick,Not for this movie,1,19 February 2021,"I guess Pike is doing a good job, and so do Dinklage and Gonzalez, but the characters are too shallow, underdeveloped. I'd say though, that these characters request so little form their actors, that it does't really matter, who the actors are. I don't judge a movie by the actors though, but mainly by plot, theme, perspective, etc. In that sense this movie offers nothing. The director has probably managed to create the most hated protagonist in a decade or more of filmmaking. At least I never hated a protagonist so much from the beginning. That's probably an achievement by itself, but also points heavily towards the shallowness or one-sidedness of the character. The film tries to overcome this by showing the main character in a relationship, but that doesn't work, because that is an accomplice and it doesn't manage to show real love, it rather shows a shared goal with added affection. That is not enough for good character development. Dinkage's character (antagonist) is only slightly better developed but not impactful enough. This movie, or the theme, could have great potential. It is set up as suspense with action elements. It's evil fighting evil with evil winning, and at the end we have a screwed on scene where a foil character kills the protagonist, but I would assume that everybody would have expected this or a similar scene. I would have been a surprise, if the film would have just ended with the total success of the protagonist, and make the whole thing probably even more disturbing, but that couldn't save the film either. Unfortunately the serious of events leading to the climax are entirely predictable and boring and so is the climax. If you are looking for some shallow entertainment in form of underdeveloped suspense with light action added into the mix, you might like this. It does deliver on anything else.",I Care a Lot

The 'villains' are comically incompetent in moments that ruin the immersion and the protagonist has so much plot armor that had she been shot point blank at any other point but the end of the film she would have redirected it.The story tries to set itself in a firm reality with the antagonist of the film being the head of veteran head of the Russian mob but every action he takes against the protagonist is defeated by sheer incompetence by his men or the people he hires. He speaks of brutality and the film hints at the monster the antagonist is but when the time comes to demonstrate just how savage and brutal he can be, he does nothing and goes with the trope where instead of just killing the protagonist he decides that he would kill her using an over complicated plot.Then he gets overpowered when it conveniently failed.Imagine if in Scarface the shooter that finally kills Tony Montana suddenly forgot to load his gun. That's the kind of convenience that this movie uses to protect the protagonist and sabotage the antagonist.The acting by all parties is phenomenal but other wise the film as a whole suffers from poor execution.

977,furmbym,A great story on Karma,9,26 February 2021,"I have to admit 3/4 of the film I had no idea what direction it was going. On the one hand you have a couple of lesbians robbing elderly helpless people of all their possessions all while justifying it because women get treated badly by men all the time. But I had read the description and it said that the conwoman would meet her match in this film which does seem to be the case when the russian mob get involved but then again the film takes an unexpected turn and it felt like the conwomen could not lose - this was a big point in the film she kept making , never back down, never accept defeat, no matter the consequences. Well, it wasn't the russian mob that is ultimately her downfall, I would say it was Karma but it was unexpected and tied the film up perfectly. I can see why some people have given this film bad reviews and at times it did feel like these women could practically get away with murder if they wanted to as long as they smiled nicely enough. But I believe the director didn't want to make the russian mob end the film and I actually appreciate that and think it made for a great twist. I'm glad it ended how it did - if it had ended any other way I would have been seriously disappointed like I was with that drivel I watched recently called Shadow in the cloud. I think this film deserves watching again now that I know it has a good ending so I would recommend you give this film a chance, it is a dark film with a strong message of do the wrong thing and bad things will happen, but I find the message this film shows is good, no matter how the conwomen want to persuade themselves that their actions will have no consequences, eventually one of them did and as we saw in the film all it took was one person to mess things up for her in the end.",I Care a Lot

The kind of people the protagonist embodies do exist in this world and a light needs to be shone not only on their deeds, but their motivations, drives and even their tactics. We are given a glimpse into the machinations of a psychopath who isn't a serial killer, but is instead much more insidious, because she achieves her goals under the guise of the law. It's eye opening because, whether many viewers want to believe it or not, what she is getting away with, though exaggerated, is entirely possible and happens all of the time. Guardians abuse their wards all of the time, but the theme of the movie goes well beyond that. It shows that anyone in a position of power can and often is as criminally connected and motivated as your typical thug.This country (the US) is under the control of greedy people with no empathy for the common man, and lives are ruined, broken and ended every day for the sake of greed. This movie sheds just a tiny light on that dynamic, in an interesting, if not frustrating way.",I Care a Lot
998,houghtonconnor17,Toothless Lioness,2,24 February 2021,"I fail to grasp how most critics love this movie; the film basically fails at everything that it tries to accomplish. What starts out as an interesting premise is almost immediately cast aside for a three stooges style Russian mafia tangent that never pans out. The film is rife with plot holes and has no main character with any sort of redeemable quality. Pike, the 'lioness,' preys solely on defenseless people and yet we are for some reason supposed to be rooting for her. Unfortunately, the competition is so inept (and awful as well) that there is no way to root for them either.The acting in itself was not the main problem, but there is no way to reconcile the characters' actions in the beginning of the movie with the decisions they arrive at toward the end. Rosamund Pike also really does not convince in the evil protagonist role, partially because it is not a part that she can fully carry but also just because of poor screenwriting, dialogue, and direction. Dinklage, Dianne West, and Chris Messina all put in strong performances, but they are either limited (in the case of West and Messina) or inconsistent in the case of Dinklage' character. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty forgettable.This movie tries so desperately to portray strong female characters, but does so in an absurd and haphazard fashion. All of the 'strong' moments for Pike's character revolve almost entirely around either incomprehensible ineptness on the part of the male characters she is fighting against or her being allowed to do whatever she wants by a hapless judge. She never shows any true physical strength, intellectual rigor, or strength of character; it is always outside forces or superhuman suspensions of belief that move the story forward rather than a brilliant or impressive plan of her own.In the end, it would be difficult for anyone to pull off the anti-hero elder abuser, but Rosamund Pike is not the one to pioneer that role and it does not help that the toolbox she was given is so limited and superficial. It is a shame that such an interesting premise is ruined by such terrible casting, directing, and screenwriting decisions.",I Care a Lot

All I am trying to say is that this movie is purely villainous with no ""hero"" to save the day. The only thing we get is 120 minutes of watching horrible people getting away with horrible things. This is a hard sell.. I'm surprised it was even made but it felt bold and original. I've watched a lot of films and TV that centers around an anti-hero who either redeems themselves in the end or overcomes impossible odds to save something, of someone, or descends far enough for the audience to want justice.. and this one had me rooting for nobody. Something about that made me like it because it felt like something I haven't seen. Yes. I enjoy watching movies that might seem to follow a certain formula and carry that all the way through. But the whole movie you seriously want both parties to lose.

Justice is served finally'.But hats off to Rosa for acting such brilliantly and evoking strong emotions in the audience. And not to forget Peter Dinklage too. Seemed like the only same person trying to do some good.This movie is about a con-woman who feeds of vulnerable elderly people by becoming their guardian. She uses the court to get her name registered as the guardian and subsequently shifts the elderly to a care facility. With the homes and assets of the elderly in her hands, she auctions them off and keeps the proceeds. Things seem to go well until she takes a woman who is connected to the mafia. Things start going downhill from there. She does get back up and does fight back and at some point gains more than she had financially but at what cost?At the end of the movie, one wonders was it even worth it? To how much extent one should be willing to go to earn money? What lines should not be crossed? Who decides what are those lines? What constitutes ethics and morality in financial dealings as the former and latter are different for each of us? These are the same questions which have left the capitalist system ponder over. But who and when will we get the answers?The movie is overall good albeit a couple of inaccuracies.

While it was certainly entertaining, whatever early promise it had disappeared by the time it turned into a Russian mob action film and ended with a plot twist for plot twist's sake. The performances are generally strong, especially from Pike and the iconic Wiest, but by the time we reached the final act I just didn't care anymore. I thought the first half was a lot better than the second one and the payoff, while extremely satisfying to some of you, felt somewhat underwhelming for me and left me with a bittersweet taste in my mouth.All that aside, I would applaud the film for shedding some light on the American conservatorship system but even that's handled poorly and basically thrown away in the second half along with Dianne Wiest's character. It's a confused film in that regard and sadly loses focus just when it was building up to something promising. I also had trouble understanding why this is considered a comedy (what exactly is being satirized here?) as it is rather too dark and melodramatic at times to be considered a comedy, black or otherwise.Don't go in expecting a compelling critique on capitalism and the American legal system, then you'll probably enjoy it more.",I Care a Lot

They are both easy to hate and profiting off the elderly. Interesting start!They scam the wrong lady and cross paths with a violent/mob-oriented criminal. Ooh, now they will get what they deserve! Right? Well...long story short, the main character kills all tension by being completely unafraid of death. And when evil faces evil you have a few choices...one side wins, both sides kill each other, or neither side wins. This move takes the ""neither side wins and they become friends"" approach - which would make sense if both were likeable heroes, yet they're the exact opposite of that! Bleh.So this movie sets the main character - and her sidekick - up to be killed. If the plot had guts it would have followed through. But NO, as soon as she awakened in a car driving into a lake I feared the movie was going bad. It sure did! She manages to swim out of a submerged car by kicking out the window?! Has anyone tried kicking anything while under water?? You can generate hardly any force, try doing that upside down while drowning. And has anyone tried exerting themselves while holding their breath?! It crushes your ability to hold your breath, so this took me out of the movie completely.Ok fine, male action heroes do similarly incredible things so - even though she isn't likeable - I'll try to give it a pass. She gets free impossibly and then goes to visit her sidekick. Now the sidekick will be dead giving her a revenge plot and maybe some sympathy?! Nope, she manages to save the sidekick too. UGH. Just stop watching now.What will follow is more illogical moments than I can recall. A giant parking lot which the main character can enter and find a random car in effortlessly, a taser that works through clothes, and the ""bad girl"" lesbian ""hero"" team taking down a hardened criminal thug/group with I guess their wits, tranquilizing drugs, and a lot of unbelievable happenings?

I watched it because it was recommended by the BBC's Mark Kermode who thought it was enormous fun - and it is.Yes there are plot holes but you forgive them for Rosamund Pike alone whose character's maddening amorality is so off the scale that you want to throw the moggy on the TV, claws unretracted. In fact all the leads are unlikeable, unethical and vindictive, which is what makes the film so pleasurable, as you watch open-mouthed in disbelief asking yourself: How Far Will They Go? (Answer: Further than you can imagine).Yet the most gratifying thing about the film is its conclusion. How do you wrap up a movie where everyone should get their come-uppance?

And I didn't notice it during the film, because I don't live in USA and I don't know how elderly care systm works there. But what I can tell all these critics is that this situation is totally possible in some underdeveloped country. The one where I live, for example. And I've heard a lot of situations when elderly people with mental issues were robbed of their homes and property by some crooks in similar fasion.Really, people, critisizing this movie for being unrealistic is the same as criticizing batman movies, because fighting crime doesn't work like that in real world.And this movie is really good.",I Care a Lot

It was deliberately unpleasant to watch, but that by itself is a good setup for a vendetta story.Now the movie itself, it starts strong with a catching premise very well delivered, then it delves onto unrealistic action and even though I get the point they were trying to make about how vicious Il intended people can be, the whole final section of the movie was poorly scripted and failed to deliver what the audience was expected in a convincing way.In short the movie is actually frustrating, but not for the reasons people are complaining in most of the reviews.

Another positive is the music choice. The music fit the tone of the movie quite well and added to a mess of a movie. Now for my issues.The main character was annoying and shallow, the movie seemed to be confused and lost with both its story and its message, and while there were some parts in the 2nd act that were decent, the 3rd act was atrocious and ended the movie off on a bad note. There are countless bad things about this movie I can point out like the unbearable voiceovers or the laughable ending but I would rather get this movie out of my head and watch something better.

And then we have bad person B who is the head of the Russian mob. Bad person A messes with bad person B's mother and their cat and mouse game begins. Which basically means that they try to kill each other once and then become best buddies and business partners. And I just assessed all the happenings of the whole 2 hours. In 3 sentences. That says a lot. The characters are so cliched that I cannot even have the right words for it. They have no background, no character development, nothing, only some very superficial characteristics. You cannot root for anybody, you can root against them but you cannot even hate them enough to really root for that because they are that boring.

The team... (Screenwriter, Director and Producers ) that delivered this atrocity should never be allowed to make another movie. EVER!! Clocking in at nearly 2 hrs this was painful in so many ways. It could have easily been trimmed down to 90mins by removing the implausibilities and dumb as hell and unnecessary plot twists that did nothing for me but anger me and cause me to grind me teeth. The ending could have been richly satisfying had they followed the setup they gave in the first 1/4 of the movie. But NO! They refused to deliver any satisfaction to the viewer and literally tortured you for sticking with it in hopes of an acceptable resolution... THAT NEVER ARRIVES. The ""ending"" which is supposed to see the villain receive payback is just too late and too miniscule and really feels like it was tacked on in hopes of providing a hint of the relief to the pissed off viewers that the movie promises at but never delivers.

Because, no doubt about it, it is a failure despite the efort of the cast and crew or the director the main female protagonist is a charicature, the russian mob, too, (actually I think that the charicature of the mob is the charicature of the angry birdwatching russian group and not the real russian mob). The judge is cartoonish, done extremely bad and the rest of the cast is just prop. Both Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage are not used at their full potential and the script has such large holes in it that the film becomes laughable.
I think that the original idea was to show the real society as it is, in its honest ugliness and emptiness but the writer/director has no intelligence or talent to do it so, he is shallow, superficial and whithout real meaning.

The character of Rosamund Pike, Marla is a swindler who works within the system, assuming guardianship of old people and their assets. She works with corrupt doctors and care facilities to drain the money off old folks.She has no problem being the bad guy, In fact she believes it's the only way to get ahead in life. She has a nice thing going milking money off old people that is until she scams the wrong person.Jennifer Peterson, on the outside seems like a lady who has retired rich, has no family who'd get in the way and is showing early signs of memory loss. But apparently, that's just a cover. She apparently is the mother of a former Russian mobster. Enter, the delightful, Peter Dinklage, Roman Lunyov ... who first sends a shady lawyer, Chris Messina, to pay off and when that doesn't work, threaten Marla to release his mother.Marla is, well, ""a Lioness"" is not easily going to give up on a cash cow which leads to Roman employing increasingly deadly measures to get his mother.
Even though both are bad guys and not likable, I was rooting for Roman to win and get his mother. The ending surprises when Marla proves that she is a competent bad person and Roman ends up partnering with her, helping in expanding the guardianship scam.And I'm glad that at the very end, there is comeuppance for her deeds.

Maybe trouble accessing money, or she gets pulled over and there's no record of her drivers licence in the system. Authorities start to investigate, and it turns out that the Russian mafia have set up a completely fake history for her where it appears she's stolen the identity of someone else. Authorities come in, completely take over her operation and shut her out. She decides to come clean and starts talking about how she made a deal with the Russians and that they're in on it.

I'm just so disappointed that it just did not end as wonderfully **SPOILER** even though Marla got shot, it was hardly a satisfying ending. It just lacked any real sense of justice or real punishment that she actually deserved.

But alas, the greed and God complex (of the main character) finally consumed this character in the end. There is nothing likeable about Marla Grayson. This woman had no soul or humanity, so why should we care. She is the worst part of the society we live in. The only justice to this whole story was the final scene. People think there are no consequences to their actions. Well Marla Grayson you might have thought you were a lioness, but no one gets away from Karma.

1114,MJC_42,"Not a satisfying story - some characters too competent, others not competent enough",3,7 March 2021,"The movie actually starts off well enough, setting the stage for what would hopefully be a satisfying tale of a villain getting their comeuppance. Rosamund Pike plays a professional guardian who supposedly helps those who are unable to care for themselves. She arranges for them to be put in care facilities while she manages their affairs and finances. She, of course, liquidates their assets and steals their money.At the beginning of the movie, we see her in family court where the son of one of her marks is trying to get his mom out from under her care. She expertly talks the judge into siding with her and also preventing the son from having visitation rights.Later, she is talking with a doctor who offers up a particularly good mark - a wealthy woman with no family and showing early signs of memory loss. Pike's character and the doctor go to family court and argue that this woman, Jennifer Peterson, should be remanded to her care. The judge is convinced. The woman had not been informed of the hearing and had no representation. Pike's character then visits her house, shows her the paperwork saying that she's now under her care, and she's taken away and basically imprisoned in a facility while Pike and her crew sell off the woman's assets. Pike even finds her safety deposit box, which has millions in diamonds.It turns out that this woman is the mother of a Russian mob boss. Both have fake identities, so Jennifer Peterson is not really Jennifer Peterson, which is why no relatives turn up.So, we have here a situation where a truly repugnant woman, one who is also extremely smug and sees herself as a lion who never loses, has, unbeknownst to her, picked a very bad mark. In the real world, the mob boss would probably torture and murder Pike's character, either before or after getting their mom out of this facility. In this movie, however, things do not happen that way.First, the mob boss sends his lawyer to Pike, requesting that the mother be released, though he doesn't tell Pike who he works for. He also makes oblique references to her being tortured and murdered if she doesn't comply. She is unconcerned. He then offers her a briefcase of money. She refuses and demands much more. Now, a person in the real world would probably realize by this point that maybe they screwed up and would probably take the money and release the woman. Not this lioness, though. She doubles down. She visits the woman in the facility and asks her who she is. The woman tells her that bad stuff is going to happen to her. Pike doubles down again and has this woman confined to her room and given reduced care.For whatever stupid reason, the mob boss sends 3 goons into the facility to kidnap the mom. This fails spectacularly because they are incompetent, and somehow Pike happens to be there with a baseball bat. I can't think of any logical reason for why the mob boss would have done this. Why not go directly to the guardian? If she wouldn't accept money, maybe she's accept keeping all of her fingers and toes.Later, the doctor who lied to the court is murdered. Even this does not persuade Pike to change tactics. She keeps digging deeper. Eventually, the mob boss has her kidnapped and her girlfriend beaten and left in their house with the gas on. The mob boss has a conversation with Pike. She demands $10 million. He tells his goons to kill her but make it look like an accident. So, they drug her, put a bottle of alcohol in her hands, stick her in her car, and have it drive off a cliff. Somehow, while the car is speeding toward the cliff, Pike's character wakes from being drugged and is immediately alert and is not in any way mentally or physically impaired. The car goes off the cliff and into a lake or reservoir, but Pike is able to escape the car and walk to a gas station. She wasn't even injured when the car crashed into the water. She eventually finds her way home and discovers her girlfriend on the floor in the kitchen with the place filled with gas from the stove. Pike turns off the gas and drags the girlfriend out of the house. Moments after they leave, the house explodes. So these two failed murders demonstrate both an unrealistic level of incompetence from the mob boss's goons, but I guess it's not their fault when they clearly did enough to kill these two but the plot demanded that they survive, and the writers didn't think to at least make the situations realistic enough where it made sense for them to survive. I guess they figure that dumb luck at just the right moment was good enough.These two ladies decide to hatch their own plot. Pike had memorized the license plate of one of the mob boss's vehicles. Her girlfriend has a connection at the police dept. who provides them with the address of the owner, which happens to be the mob boss's driver. They follow the driver to an office building. Pike goes into the office building and sneaks into the executive garage. There, she incapacitates the driver and the mob boss's bodyguard before drugging the mob boss so that she can kidnap him. Really? Where did this woman get the stuff she used, and how did she have the skill set to incapacitate these two men that should have some skills of their own?She drives the mob boss to some random location, drugs him enough to make him OD but not enough to kill him, strips him, and leaves him there. He's brought to a hospital and saved, but he's a John Doe. Pike, meanwhile, was granted guardianship of him because he was a John Doe, and apparently she's able to just lie to the court and say that he should be in her care and that there's nothing he can do about it.She demands that he give her $10 million. If he does, she'll release him and his mother, and give him back the diamonds. He agrees but makes her an offer. They should go into business together and start a nationwide chain of care facilities where they can grift billions. He'll be behind the scenes, and she'll be the face of the company. She agrees. Everything goes according to plan. She's living the high life and rich.At the very end of the movie, the son from the beginning of the movie comes up and shoots her dead. The End.Yeah, this movie was just not satisfying at all. I'm OK with them making me root for a mob boss since it's the only way to make this awful woman pay for what she's doing to people since the legal system, in this world, is completely ill-equipped. However, she never really comes to any realization that she screwed up, and she never wishes she had done something differently. She inexplicably beats the mob boss throughout the ordeal, constantly doubles down on her terrible choices, and she never pays a price for any of that. Instead, she is rewarded for it. The mob boss and his goons apparently have no core competencies, so I don't know how they got to be in the positions they are in because they're constantly making stupid, inefficient choices and not at all being ruthless. This movie should have been over 20 minutes in. Pike's character didn't outwit the mob boss either. She succeeded due to dumb luck, stupid opponents, and having a skillset that defies reason. Yeah, she dies at the end, but that wasn't nearly satisfying enough. I like the people involved, but this movie just irritated me.",I Care a Lot

There is none of that here. We do not delve into the main characters psyche. We never get a glimpse into her past to explain why she is a sociopath. She is completely one dimensional.

1136,CptFastbreak,Does not deliver on its promise,1,10 April 2021,"To me, the Netflix trailer came off as billing it as a revenge story with some social satire, so that's what I expected going in. There is none of that, but instead an uneven film that can't decide what subject it wants to tackle and what genre it wants to be.Rosamund Pike is doing a decent job portraying Marla Grayson, who games the legal system to con old people out of their savings. Her latest mark is connected to Peter Dinklage's character, who will then attempt to save her.Marla Grayson is essentially pure evil comparable to Cruella DeVille, with the exception that she is gay. Apparently this is the reason why as half of the film is over, we're supposed to root for her to defeat the guy trying saving his elderly relative. This I found the most puzzling, because the first half builds her up to be such a villanous characterEssentially, around one hour in though the first half of the move becomes completely inconsequential, and it turns into a sort of action movie. The old lady in the care home turns out to be a MacGuffin and is pretty much never spoken off again. Marla Grayson becomes a sort of Mary Sue character who is always unfazed and proves suprisingly inept at a range of things including emergency medicine and commando operations. After a series of increasingly outlandish turns of events, there is an ending which, without spoiling anything, seems yet again mostly unconnected to what happened before.I liked the performances from Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage and some of the minor characters, but overall I'd advise against this movie. The execution does not deliver in the slightest on the promise of the concept and the trailer, and it ends up being mediocre at best in all the genres it tries to play with. It is at 81% on Rotten Tomatoes which honestly makes me question the very integrity of that site.

Come on! I liked the idea of the guy killing Rosamund Pike in the end but the idea of all 3 of them going into business together is stretching. Drug lords and mafia people are ruthless.

So many people rating it low on here because a fictional movie wasn't realistic enough for them or they're on some moral high horse that the premise was too disturbing for them. Why did they watch it in the first place then? The trailer says what it's about.,I Care a Lot
1140,pingu-hash,I guess I understood what the movie is speaking.,7,23 February 2021,"I'll assume that Russian mafia guys are carelessly stupid for not killing the woman before staging her death. I'll also pass that a lawyer can single handedly take care of all the mafia men and kidnap Tyrion in daylight. This only because this is a movie not reality. And I got the point of the movie that in the end when you are dead the movie ends and you can't take anything you've accumulated. To the Russian mafia, he got his mother and got his diamonds. And there wasn't any change in the character of Rosamund Pike until she was shot probably because the movie wasn't about her the first place. But the movie would've made sense equally well if the far guy killed the woman outside the court room and shorten the movie to 5 minutes.",I Care a Lot
1141,sfxprops,A dark brilliantly written (satire? / thriller?) of a movie.,6,5 March 2021,"Do not believe all of these negative reviews!
Do not!
I looked at the reviews before I watched the movie.
I could not believe how every review was negative! Dozens and dozens of negative reviews and only one positive review!Many of these reviews say something like ""terrible movie"", ""don't waste your time"", ""I would rate this 0 out of 10 if I could"", etc.
I really have no idea what these people were thinking of when they wrote all these negative reviews, and frankly it's a waste of time to even try to figure them out. Some people like ketchup, some people like mustard!
To each his own, I guess.
But do not let all of these negative reviews scare you away from watching this movie.All of those negative reviews almost scared me away from watching it, but at the last minute I remembered how in the past, many times people would condemn a movie, I would watch it, and I would think it was a great movie.This is such a movie I believe.Is this a blockbuster movie? No.
Is this going to win any Oscars? No.
Does this have a $100 million or $200 million budget? No.
Does this have tons of special-effects? No.
But what this movie does have is a very very dark and brilliant sense of irony and satire and humor.I really enjoyed this movie! It is true that all of the main characters are people that you really just hate. And you don't really want to root for any of them.
What that means is that the actors are really doing a great job!
Because the 3 main actors are actually great actors.
And they have helped make other great movies great.
The fact that you really hate them in this movie, means that they are really great actors that were actually able to make you hate them in this movie!And even though you may not like the subject of the script, the script was really slickly written. The casting was right on. All of the acting was right on. And the music was right on.It's true that you must go with the flow and pretend that some of the things that happen in the movie could happen. Even though you know that in the real world, laws don't work that way, and various other things don't really happen that way. And a few things are a little unbelievable.But If you're going to sit and nitpick a movie, you could find fault with just about every movie made.I can guarantee that you will not know ahead of time what is going to happen.
And I can guarantee the twist at the end is really a twist.
And I think that the ending was a fitting ending.
I have to be careful because I don't want to say too much.When the movie was over, I found that I had had at good time.
If the goal of a movie is to entertain you, then this one succeeded for me.
Yes the subject matter is inhumane and wrong and improper. But the execution of the movie itself was brilliant and cynical.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",I Care a Lot

She tries too hard but her acting is below mediocre (Cant believe she won a Golden Globe for this)
You can tell she is consciously trying hard on her American accent.
Her facial expressions are just blah
Even Peter Dinklage and Dianne Wiest can't save this movie.

Good God what can you do when even the high-brows are raving about complete garbage. This film is of the 'nudge-nudge black comedy' genre which means that it doesn't have to be funny in any way. It need only be snidely sociopathic at every turn of the script and therefore any unbelievable twists will not only be accepted but somebody in the audience will always chuckle to let you know that they 'got it'. I used to hate seeing films like this in the theatre because there were always a lot of these 'with-it' people. Personally I like to see something that is actually funny, or actually dramatic.

I understand that movies have an unrealistic side to them, but this entire movie was completely unrealistic.I'm not sure Wonder Woman would have survived being strangled, drugged, car accident into the water, kick herself out-THEN- come out of the water, get a cab and save your lesbian lover (had the check off a box with that) while adding in some kissing scenes before you drive away from your house that blows up.

Most of the very specific threats, on all sides, which could have been foreshadowings just fall flat. No real winners, lots of innocent losers. Two of the early characters (the lawyer and the brother) just drop off the face of the earth with little consequence, wasting my emotional investment in them and anything they did.The main bad guy is upset that her opponents are resorting to murder rather than face her in a courtroom.

Just look around you. Mass unemployment in the world and yet the rich keep getting richer in the stock markets.The film shows that unfortunately in the world we live, the greedy can be more cunning and powerful - and hence they use the rigged system (which is also in favour of the rich) to get wealthy and KEEP that wealth.I realise this fact makes people angry. It makes me angry too. But the sad fact is that in the real world, it is not always ""honest"" hard work that makes money. The truth is that dishonesty, greed and corporatism is how the rich hold on to their power and make wealth. The film just is honest about this. No BS.I actually enjoyed this film.

The actors are in the range from being good to amazing. The characters are very unusual and interesting and full of promise. I happen to love seeing evil characters go about their business, so lang as their actions make some sense or if justice comes for them in the end. I liked seeing how the system ranging from judges, doctors and those responsible for the most vulnerable among us can be corrupt to the core, full of idiots and sociopaths. A cold chill went down my spine when the guardian was dismantling the life of the cool & happy old lady.These are the good elements that this movie started off with. It was turned up to 11 and I was enjoying it and getting ready for a baddie-takedown like nothing I had ever seen before. It would be easy, right? Wrong! We the audience are forced to watch in suffering, anxiously waiting for the disgusting main character to get her just desserts, but she gets off and kind of gets a... hero edit? What in the world. Her only ""suffering"" is getting shot in the heart and dying kind of suddenly in the arms of her loving (and equally vile and evil) girlfriend. She deserved so much more.I was amazed with the fact that a real scumbag human trafficker is by far the most likeable action character in the whole movie, and I had no difficulty with suspending my own morals and rooting for him and his stupid looking and incompetent gang. I had such high hopes for them. But.There is a point in the movie when it becomes obvious that Marla (the hideously evil ""guardian"") is not going to suffer. Neither are her willing and unwitting accomplishes. The russian mafia isn´t going to slowly torture them to death (which would have been too good for Marla really). I was clinging to the hope that maybe the old lady would take her down, but I knew at that point that it would be too far-fetched... yet, the ending and what actually happened with the ""partnership"" was even more far-fetched.No movie has ever annoyed me this much, I have to say.",I Care a Lot

What happens when you put two users together? Chaos, drama, and the escalation of tit-for-tat revenge actions.I think the movie makes many uncomfortable because American movies tend to be so formulaic, with the hero, the one you root for, getting the bad guys at the end.And here we have two villains who are humanized to some extent, and that makes people uncomfortable when they feel sympathy for the villain - there is confusion because there is no ""good guy"".The ratings of 1 and 2 seem way off the mark, and probably unconsciously reflect some fear that got triggered in the reviewers about their own mortality and fear of ending up alone in a senior home.The movie was very entertaining and the ending was cathartic, as bad deeds simply attract more bad deeds - crime attracts more crime.",I Care a Lot

There are people, believe it or not, who do what Grayson does in this movie, and the courts allow it. It is a problem in this country, and an extremely serious one. Check out Season 2 of Dirty Money, the episode ""Guardianship, Inc."" Pretty scary! However this film was not made as a documentary or even a serious drama. Maybe they should have in order to bring awareness to this problem, but instead they put it in the comedy, crime, thriller genres. If you think her ability at handling a Russian mafia guy and surviving death is unbelievable, how about ""Home Alone""? Totally unbelievable, but a big hit nevertheless. Every James Bond movie! Totally would never happen! So that argument is meaningless. It is a hard movie to watch, even though it's obviously done with tongue in cheek, just because the subject matter is so upsetting.

Thankfully I am not an US Citizen so it was an interesting fact to learn this from a New Yorker article. The premise of the movie is real. Cool enough. The actors chosen for the movie are good. Even cooler. But then, what happens? Can you really not understand why these so many 1 star reviews from people that learn about a horrible insane system, about this non human being and her network of leaches that do not suffer any real consequence? Just like in reality? Of course everyone is feeling left frustrated as we are in real life when we face such unjust systems ""for our safety"", and we need movies to feel a bit better, at least in movies people can find hope, and good prevails. We are hating the protagonist so much for her actions that we are happy she is going (we hope) to face terrible consequences, because by luck, she finally messes with the wrong person. We imagine that the other poor elderly people from her wall could find their way home after that. Unfortunately the ""Russian Mafia"" is like the two thieves from Home Alone and cannot do anything right. And then the story becomes a non-sensic turn. These could have been a real opportunity to convey a powerful message to the victims that face these problems, or their hopeless children. What is the message? The only thing they can do is kill the guardian with their own hands? This is no satire and no comedy. This movie is just bitter and unrealistic. Another writer and it could have been great!

It was somewhat believable up until the half way point. It took a dramatic turn for the worse soon after Peter Dinklage's character showed up, though that was not of his doing.While not plausible, it was still within the realm of Hollywood story telling that the elderly character played by Dianne Wiest could be committed against her will by an unscrupulous doctor and medical advocate with the help of a naïve and dull judge.The idiocy started with the botched execution of two characters that have zero survival training, zero military or police training and for all intent and purpose, are office employees more comfortable with Excel than self defense. Yes, the Russian mob, former or otherwise, have blundered two simple executions and our would be victims are now suddenly savvy enough and insidious enough to take on people that are adept (or rather should be) at killing.Honestly, I turned it off with 23 minutes left to go. I could not stomach it any longer after Rosamund Pike rescued her love interest in the nick of time before the apartment exploded.The writers went so far out of their way to create strong female characters that emasculating the male characters wasn't enough, luck and fortune had to favor them as well, contrary to all logic, even that little bit the audience hold onto when watching a movie.",I Care a Lot

Or the Russian mob attempting but failing to kill two people. Or an attorney getting the drop on two mob henchmen. Are we to assume she has a special forces background or ""a particular set of skills""? Another review mentioned that the reviewers who left bad reviews ""don't get it"". There's nothing to get. It's a poorly executed story without a shred of believability. I know there's always scenarios in a movie where we have to suspend that disbelief but this isn't a superhero or action movie.

Think of a movie about one of the bosses from Horrible Bosses, except their tyranny lands them in hot water with someone a little scarier than their idiot employees.I think if I could fault anything about the film, it's that clearly people had no frame of reference for what to expect.

It is simply inconceivable that a court order can be obtained unilaterally and then a perfectly normal person can be transferred to a care home without any further review or appeal process. Why didn't the lady simply phone her lawyer when Rosamund Pike arrived at her house? Additionally the dwarf gangster boss is not credible and the idea that two girls take on the Russian mob and throw some wise cracks whilst being tied to a chair is just too far-fetched.

I don't know why I expected a professional killer to know how to kill people professionally, but I just did.The entire premise of the film, it's literal only selling point: establish an incredibly vile and hateful villain who constantly frustrates the viewer by always having the upper hand. . . And then. . . Throw her into a completely different world with completely different rules, and to the glee of the audience, watch her meet her downfall. It's simple story telling.Having the villain constantly succeed, even in situations in which special forces operatives would fail, doesn't make for entertaining viewing, it's just implausible and annoying, and even if you tac on the ending from Carlito's Way, it's too late, the immersion has already been broken and you've lost your audience.The film should be given the considerably more accurate title of:Mary Sue vs The Worlds Most Inept Crime Family.",I Care a Lot
1329,samerkq77,very bad one,4,20 February 2021,"This movie has a very good potential, but turned out to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. could have been a lot better if they didn't involve the Russian mafia in the story, just make it a local small mob to make it more believable. also, the way Marla got out of troubles is very stupid. and it has at least 30 minutes of unnecessary scenes, just to make it longer.
don't watch it if you didn't already.",I Care a Lot

Not often do we see a villianess as evil, manipulative, and scheming as this guardian. Her tactics and devices are truly underhanded and without moral substance.

1339,udashay,Horrible mind,1,27 February 2021,"This movie is very disturbing. Making a heroes out of two twisted mind women, character the judge and the system as stupid, and behave elders as helpless.

1340,b_um_p,Stylish and Unpleasant,3,28 February 2021,"Some people will call this a searing critique of late stage capitalism. For them, lines like ""You're part of the one percent now,"" and ""Rich people don't follow the rules"" are deeply insightful. This is a film written by people who don't understand capitalism for an audience that doesn't understand it either.
Much of the film hinges on what the late Roger Ebert referred to as 'The Idiot Plot.' For the heroines to succeed, everyone else in the movie must be an idiot. Judges and lawyers are buffoons, police are practically nonexistent, and after about the 4th round of Peter Dinklage's minions bungling their assignments I began to wish the main characters would get hit by an errant bus. This isn't unwarranted. The film asks you to root for a pair of terrible woman but forgets to give you a reason why. Resentment is a more reasonable reaction, and attempts are made to quell this with aesthetic choices. The slick production and loud, edgy soundtrack give the film a stylish flair, but this is a dreadfully stupid movie.",I Care a Lot

The only one who came out of this with any credence was Dianne Wiest. Ex Russian mafia seemed to have lost their Russian accents, Rosamund Pike so one dimensional it was painful (her character is threatened by ex Russian mafia but she reacts like she is threatened with a parking ticket!) and as for Rosamund Pikes characters girlfriend!

1362,narniaru,Such a hollow movie,5,15 June 2021,"Well acted, yes but that's about it. The main problem I had was with the mafia aspect. Surely they would be better organised than this? It's great that they were beaten by two women but they are vile women. I've read that this is meant to have been a feminist piece but I think it's the opposite. It shows that to be a strong woman, you need to completely eradicate all men from your life, prey on those weaker than you and be completely hollow inside. Or is that what the writer thought would equate to a strong man? At least the mafia boss showed he had some feelings towards his mom. Marla may like her girlfriend but wasn't she just using her and her cop connections? And how convenient to be able to know so many shady people. There's got to be better movies than this.",I Care a Lot

1376,Mina_Porter,Not Good,2,21 February 2021,"Not exactly sure what category this falls in. I thought it was going to be a comedy, but it's not a comedy. They don't really set anything up to be funny, and nothing funny really happens. The trailer kind of makes it look like a snappy dark comedy, but I didn't find it anything close.Not drama. The characters are flat and mostly vile. There is zero emotional attachment, relatability, or growth.I guess action? But even then it falls flat. The plot is just basic, predictable escalation of unlikely scenarios. Plot holes everywhere. No one raised an eye at Pike's record here? No one could pick up on a pattern? Dinklage is a weird antagonist. If he's a big crime boss, why didn't he send more people to break his mom out? Why couldn't he have just paid off or threatened the same people Pike did? Why would Pike be his legal guardian when other people could have said he wasn't a John Doe?And the ending- the last 30 seconds don't make up for where they ended up taking the movie before then. Not only is the alliance between the mob boss and the character who kidnapped his mother and tried to do him in unbelievable, who on earth wants it to happen??? Rosamund Pike standing in front of that huge wall of seniors she apparently has kidnapped and entrapped is horrifying. (Come to think of it, this might have worked best as a horror movie, but it would have to be reworked to bring that out it a way that makes any sense.) The ending offers no redeeming value to that. It just seems like a ploy they tacked on at the last minute to avoid moral criticism. Since it's only 30 seconds and with no narrative tie in, it feels completely incoherent with the overall story and message. The ethics equivalent of ""and then she woke up"".Anyway, not what I thought, and what was there wasn't good. I like the actors, but they couldn't do much with this script. The plot is extremely unlikely. I'm willing to suspend disbelief, but I expect some kind of payoff in entertainment value and it just never came here. The parts of the story that are worth exploring are abandoned as minor details and never get the focus. A star for a concept that could have had potential, and a star for some of Pike's acting. The rest is just a bunch of costly, confusing, and frustrating material that should have been developed into something coherent before filming.",I Care a Lot

1378,jefferypetro,Just atrocious,1,22 February 2021,"Horribly stupid. Cemented in as the 2nd worst movie I've ever seen. I don't think anything will ever be worse than The Family Stone but this one is very close. The first 20 minutes is very hard to watch. It leaves you feeling gross and sad for the people being taken advantage of. I thought it was going to get good after the lawyer and son came in. (Where did the lawyer go btw?) It had the makings of a decent movie at first. Leaving us to think the main character would learn her lesson in the end and maybe become a better person. That never happens, instead it just takes a series of ridiculous turns.This movie had good potential in the first 30 minutes but it's all downhill after that. It's listed as a comedy which is odd because I don't think there was a funny part in the entire movie. Besides maybe in the end when she gets shot. 1/10",I Care a Lot

A woman abusing the system to pay herself good-check. But then she make a mistake when she pick up a dangerous old woman. She's obviously feminist, strong willed, and brave.I enjoy the acting, spike's especially. And for the story, to be honest my excitement goes downhill when she survived the mafia dead threat (i cringed at this) but still enjoyable.

Peter Dinklage's is also pretty unlikeable, so whilst I wanted him to rescue his mum, I wasn't overly enamoured with him either, and was wondering how the movie was going to pull this story to a satisfactory conclusion that didn't seem to reward evil people, or end as death all round. And don't get me wrong, the ending was suitably moralistic, a little foreshadowed, and nicely poetic, so they managed that. What I didn't expect was this film to give me the 'bonnie & clyde' vibe - which to me denotes a movie where you end up wanting to see how far the main characters can go - whereby I end up rooting for amoral, evil lead characters, just because they're so unapologetically so. The ending was a good shock to the system after getting caught up in that moment, to remind you that these people are evil and really shouldn't win, but that moment before was actually one I relished a bit. Not many movies manage that, and none as well as Natural Born Killers, but it was an unexpected moment in this one that pulled the story out of being drab and forgettable.

I realize we all watch fantasy films with a violent subject as entertainment but I'm on the fence with this one purely because the subject ""elder abuse"" is a serious subject. As a black comedy, it lacks the needed humor you find in many of the Coen productions and the beginning of the story is also legally misleading becoming someone's legal guardian isn't that simple.

Starting from a moronic judge who trusts Pike's character without ever second-guessing her credibility or ordering an independent medical opinion while not even getting any profit from making rulings in her favor, to a Russian mob staging sophisticated crime scenes instead of simply making the characters ""disappear"", to Pike's character and her lover mysteriously surviving attempts on their lives due to ""plot armour"" and proceeding to single-handedly apprehend the Russian mob leader and his henchmen with ""magical"" tazers, knock-out drugs and the raw power of feminism. Most of these scenes honestly look like they are straight out from some science-fiction flick, not a criminal thriller based in reality it's supposed to be. The most plausible scene of the movie happens at its very end and adds some really nice touch of irony to the otherwise entirely fictitious and almost nonsensical drivel of a plot.

1457,sandyfalls38,Detestable protagonist,3,18 March 2021,"When telling a story, you want your audience to care about something. As stories are portrayed through characters, you want your audience to be able to care about your characters, particularly the protagonist.Anti hero stereotypes are a great way to make rounded, believable protagonists. They do questionable things, but in the end they are better than the villain, they have redeeming qualities that make the audience root for them. They fight for a good cause or a goal the audience can get behind or sympathize with. How dark you can make a character and have them still be portrayed as a hero is incredible when there is contrast and understanding used to develop that character.If your anti hero does not have any redeemable or likable qualities, if they are not better than their opposition, if they do not have a good cause or goal for the audience to support, then that character is no longer an anti hero; they are a villain. If your villain does not have any sympathetic traits, they are a one dimensional character. Without contrast between heroes and villains, there is only a monotone story with no protagonist to follow.The main character in this story is a villain, and not one possessing any complexity or sympathetic traits. This main character is not a protagonist by any positive definition of the word. She is greed, that is all. Having a protagonist care about some one equally corrupt as they are does not count as a redeemable or interesting trait. If the lover was better than the protagonists, either inspiring them to improve themselves or elsewise loose that love, or to hide their darker nature--that can be compelling. That could hint that the protagonist wants redemption on some level. But the protagonist in this movie and their love interest are both evil and greed driven. This conveys further that the protagonist will be undergoing no development.The opposition was more the anti hero of the story. He was corrupt, but he sought first and foremost to care for and save his mother. That is a sympathetic cause that audiences can get behind, unlike wanting to be rich no matter the innocents destroyed along the way.Because all of the key characters in the story are villains, the story is left flat.I appreciate the effort to make a villain the protagonist, but it does not work with no goals for the audience to support from any character for any significant amount of time. The only character audiences could support throughout the movie was the mother and all those fallen victim to the protagonists and they were seldom in the film or not at all in the film.***spoilers***Audiences could not suspend belief enough to believe that two people could take out the head of mafia. First, that the driver wouldn't notice he's being followed for miles and hours. Second, that there was not some sort of tracking device in the vehicle or on the mafia head's person. Third, that response would be so slow and security so lax. These are professional criminals. That entire sequence was too unbelievable to not feel contrived.The only thing that kept me going was the hope that Peter Dinklage's character would destroy the protagonist. I wanted to see the protagonist die more than I have ever wanted to see a main character die. In fact, I have never wanted to see a protagonist die before (and I've watched Death Note. I new Light had to die, but I didn't want it).The opposition did not win, they did not destroy this detestable character, rather, he sunk to her level. He's still more likable because of his pure love for his mother and wanting to save her first. But by sinking to the protagonist's level, what little contrast there was giving life to the story was blotted out. The story is left a canvas of gray.The only reason I gave this movie three stars is because the protagonist does face retribution in the end by one of her victims. However her fall should have been more complete where she was exposed. As it stands, the one to finally end her will be punished and demonized for it. That is the only conclusion we can draw in this mythos created in the movie that is both believable and unbelievable.I will go on to imagine that she is exposed after her death and her victims are recompensed and the one to kill her gets a minimal sentence. But that is unbelievable and me forcing myself to imagine an ending that justifies my wasted time in watching this flat story.",I Care a Lot

Although some of the scenes are absolutely ridiculous but not ridiculous to make one laugh. It stirs the emotions and one's perspective. You are seriously rooting against the main character the entire time. You will not identify with any of the characters. There is a strong lack of feminine characters. There is a lot of information in the details of the story, as a viewer I enjoyed that. The costumes, the sets, lots of little details that reveal the true point of the movie. At the end, NO ONE wins. And that is why we see so many poor reviews. This story defies the expectations we all have of why we watch movies. If you are expecting a comedy, you will absolutely hate it.

This is clearly meant to be two bad characters fighting it out which, could've been a really interesting concept if done properly.
However, from the start, I hated the main character and continued to hate her unscrupulous actions throughout. No matter what she did, she never seemed to redeem herself and only made me want her to get some sort of come uppence. However, even after given a second chance to better her outcome she decides to continue justifying why she's a terrible person.

As much as all the pedestrian reviewers shun the movie, I REALLY know people as evil, clever and devious as Rosamund Pike. It's easy to call the movie ""shallow"" until your mother, your father or your good friend becomes a victim. This is certainly an extreme example of greed, meanness and corruption, but take it as a hyperbolic warning that it can really happen to YOU, starting when your well off grandmother needs to be cared for and her son's wife volunteers. I wish I had seen this movie years ago before my grandmother (and resultingly all of her relatives) was brainwashed, swindled, dominated and robbed by a woman (and her husband too) not so unlike Rosamund.

Some good acting though and very colorful, which is interesting.

The film showed focus and determination (with a heaping side of Hollywoodisms..see goofs as these are like most films....) to really question so many unexamined cultural ideas all within a black comedy genre. This is a great film that has been a long time coming - A strong female lead who beats the bullies with the head game; a featured lesbian relationship; a woman as ruthless in stalking and killing people as her fellow brutes; a man stripped and left in the woods.....all ripe for the times. These people deserve each other while the more humane side of the viewer is uncomfortable with the reality of the fraud that exists and what it does to the people whose loved ones are taken advantage of.

From the beginning the story had great promise but you quickly realize you're not there for a good movie, you've been tricked into another strong woman story.

And (3) keeping their own boss from being abducted...The ""twist"" at the end is only the final nail on this movie's coffin, being the ever-charismatic Peter Dinklage the only reason I continued to torture myself with this movie... don't bother fellow cinephiles, it's better to spend a few more minutes browsing for something to watch.",I Care a Lot

1544,himanshisobti,This movie was bad,4,2 March 2021,It was really bad too long and no one in the movie had any redeeming not a single. Marla Grayson the main character is the person that you will hate the most that's why it so satisfactory when she dies that the only reason I am giving this 4 star because this movie deserves 2. And I am fine discussing stories of bad people but how is it possible that she didn't have one good quality. The more you see her succeed the more you will feel bad. This movie neither had the depth or script to explain what was going on. Basically the storyline was so bad that the good performances by the characters were undermined. Plus one character that was totally unnecessary was fran she had no character no personality,I Care a Lot
1545,crayoncrayon,You are not supposed to root for anybody,5,21 March 2021,"I understand the complains about the illogical and unrealistic devices and processes used in the plot (e.g the caregiver system and legal processes, Marla outmaneuvering death, at the end the diamonds were just forgotten). Also I think the plot relied at some extent on many coincidences that subtracted from engagement. What I do not share is the complains about not having anyone to root for, not an agreeable protagonist. I think that is what was very entertaining, having detestable characters and create a conflict between them, because at the end the interactions and motives (although very bland around Marla's drive for riches, Dinklage's were brilliant) were the driving force of the film, complemented by great performances by everybody. In this case, I think it is actually good to don't really care about the characters, because what you want to see are consequences, the responsibility of actions, near or far, but at least a sense of justice. Marla should have been (much more) better developed, but I think in some level, her bland and raw money-thirst was intentional for making her detestable and a sort of parody, that is why the obnoxious beginning dialogue and ending success-sequence were there for, to present a very latent mentality nowadays, that thinks of itself as immune and unstoppable and end it in the most direct and simple way of a gunshot, by the same opening scene guy. At the end her worst decision was not to mess with the russian mafia lady. Everything she was doing were bad decisiones with the potency of being her worst, and even the most emasculated and uninteresting guy became her worst decision. Also, her girlfriend should have died, it would have served well the consequences theme. Missed shot.",I Care a Lot

I understand the point of view of a lot (as I share the same) but it does not make it an actual bad movie.So, as you've probably already understood if you read some of the reviews, the main character isn't very likeable. She basically takes advantage of elderly people and strips them off their freedom and pretty much steals their belongings. So it's hard to like her. One day, she takes advantage of the wrong old lady though, as she's in fact the mother of a Russian mafioso who will do anything to get his mother back. Plot isn't bad until here.What bothered me is how she easily gets rid of like 2-3 big men without really planning anything first and tricks the big boss. I mean, it was just all way too easy, especially if you take into consideration that she's a middle age woman who doesn't know how to fight and walks around in high heels most of the time.The ending reassured me about the director's and writer's morals though. I really thought she was going to get away with being a horrible person but karma finally gets her. So I guess the message of the movie was that you have to do whatever it takes to get to where you want to be in life. However, try not to lose yourself in the process.",I Care a Lot

What a nightmare scenario! I was hoping this was a film in which the elderly female protagonist was been able to outsmart her way out of this situation and expose this scheme, but no. Instead we are expected to root for the con-artist as the heroine. Such an unsatisfying, frustrating film. What frustrates me even more is that this movie is a representation of the society that we live in, in which little respect is given to the elderly. Who makes a movie in which the audience is expected to route for a woman who destroys the lives of the elderly for money??

The improbable plot and lack of realism in how the characters react/speak in high octane situations is okay, because this is acceptable in such films. But having such relentlessly awful, one-dimensional characters just sucked the air out of this one for me.The first hour is definitely strong and held promise. The style, tempo, soundtrack are stellar (hence the 5 stars). So are the actors, though there is nothing too dramatically demanding on any of them. But the second half went on to deny my expectations that evil gets theirs in the end. That wrong is righted. Wrong is not righted here. It's too much like the real world.We love that stories offer a sense of ""righting"" things, however artistically symbolic. This ideal spans across all film genres (with the exception of horror).

I rather liked it.It is not claiming to be a documentary, nor a robust critique on anything really. It does though, make you think. It makes you think about the unlikeliness of it all happening, but also allows you to muse about the vaguest of possibilities of it all.The movie is small in scale, but I think that the nuanced acting by both Pike and Dinklage is really engaging. A times, especially during the first court scene, you can see the merest hint of emotion from Pike. You can see what is going on behind her eyes. As a viewer, you may wish for something more obvious. I don't see that as under-acting, I see that as skilled acting.Moving towards the end of the movie, you can obviously see its conclusion. Once again it makes you think about that too.This isn't a blockbuster type movie, it is a quiet movie with a complex undercurrent.Get yourself comfy, relax and let the movie pull you along at its own pace.Recommended.",I Care a Lot

As it is, too many will not see this potential, and consequently hate it. And I do understand why you may feel frustrated after watching ""I care a Lot"". You are NOT supposed to enjoy the ride, to root for anybody or to feel satisfied at the end. No. The intent of this story is to upset you, pull the rug from under your feet, and hopefully leave you with a nagging feeling that things are terribly wrong. One of the main problems, reasons why it fails for so many, is that the characters of Pike and González are painted with too much cool, sassy and hot, so that at some point you may feel like you are supposed to see them as the antiheroes or the Bonnie & Clyde of this story. No. You are supposed to remember what it is that they do. There is NOTHING cool about how they make their living. They are psycopaths targetting the weakest and most vulnerable, they are the most despicable beings on earth, and they actually don't deserve to die by the hands of the people they wronged. They deserve to become the prey of someone like themselves. Incapacitated wards, drugged into oblivion. But then again I feel like I have seen ""that"" film before, and the ending of ""I care a Lot"" really doesn't matter - what matters is that you should feel sick to the bone and angry about what happens in this film.

It's usually their only review. Their account wasn't active 'til now and their profiles are empty. They're either fake reviews (ordered - yup, it's a thing) or they were posted on a anti-feminist/anti-LGBT platform.Could be the latter one. Too many comments about feminism.

The 'mob' is absurdly incompetent, being written all at once as if they are threatening and capable, all the while being easily bested by two random white collar crooks.The only satisfaction you'll find here is last few seconds of the film. Spoiler, Marla gets capped and dies just before the credits roll. So that's something I guess, but even that's done in a vaguely underwhelming manner since Marla is hardly the only awful person here.

Meaning we should by default be rooting for the marvellous Peter Dinklage, but it's hard to root for a such a gangster with out much of a light side. You'd think the writer could learn a bit from the 'save the cat' theory. Dinklage's character does love his mother, who is the always loveable Dianne Wiest, even so she has little screen time and this relationship is barely enough to redeem such a character.All this initially left me thinking the film was lacking in a likeable character, someone the audience would root for. It did worry me that the makers might have thought the audience would be more favourable towards the characters. But it becomes clear the absence of such a character is intentional, part of the indictment of the late stage capitalism it is criticising.

The film opening was so so good, that I almost can't wait to get more and more and to figuring out what will happen.
This film really knows how to build controversial characters and they did it 10/10!But sadly, with a lot of sacrifice . There are moments/scenes that are simply forced or too much surreal, although I don't know the American laws, but I can't really see that's happening in that manner, in the real life.
Little things that makes a film more intimate and believable: the relation between the two girl, who are lesbians, in the first 1 hour: they didn't kissed, they didn't hugged in a romantical way, they didn't even offered to each other kind gestures, which articulate the relationship.
What about the inquiry? Just 3 persons??? No witnesses?? No guards ???? No notary?? Nobody ?
What about these little things in such a good storyline?
Irrealistic how the BIG RUSSIAN MAFFIA, whatever it means, don't go for SURE killing two such an important person for them ... disappointing how this film uses the surviving clichès for 3 characters!Then the ending gives people relief with the death of the most controversial character. I felt that they wanted to make a HUGE outrageous catharsis, but they wanted so so much, so clearly so forced that they messed up.. at least for me !After all this is a good film, good story, remarkable character building, poor cliches in the third quarter, illogical and forced scenes sometimes with lack of depth and even the smell of reality!",I Care a Lot

Two montages covering significant events in character's stories so early in a film that are purely there to move plot and aren't in it for comedic effect or some other stylistic/artistic reason is a big no no. That was prime character-building material during prime character-building time, and we couldn't seem to get it on the page in scenes and dialogue. Strike one.-The first-person narration in the first act from the main lead character is abandoned at some point, never to be seen again. Why did we start this movie off like Gone Girl (this director wanted to do his own hacky version of that movie I think) and then ditch the first-person narration that we leaned so heavily on for early exposition? And where/when was it coming from? Our lead character dies at the end, so it isn't from the future, and she's not keeping a diary or something throughout her diamond-hiding quest, so... why's it there? Lazy writing? Cuz we're having first act exposition/character development issues and are relying on narration and montages? Strike two.-The third strike is for some of the really head scratching moments I had. These were seriously distracting from story and dialogue and were all annoying or frustrating to some degree:
1. Why does the lead very noticeably keep switching between driving a Jeep SUV and a BMW sedan as her main mode of transportation with absolutely no explanation? This seems nitpicky, but I think others who picked up on this will back me up on it. It comes across as just bad continuity.
2. Why is the vaping so weirdly prominent? If it's the writer/director's attempt at an archetypical Edward G. Robinson cigar, then that is probably the most cringeworthy character choice I've seen in recent memory.
3. What the hell was the purpose of the whole tooth in milk sequence and why did it get so much screen time in the climactic part of the third act? This was almost a whole third act B-plot in and of itself and can only be described as distracting nonsensical filler. I'm sincerely stumped on this one.In conclusion: The acting is solid given what they had to work with (plenty of bad writing and cringey dialogue to go around), the cast is surprisingly good (why did they all agree to do this?), and the script needed to be punched up big time. The end product felt like a direct-to-DVD release. This was a tough watch. 2/10.",I Care a Lot

The motive of the main character, since that star does not have any deeper inner movies, aside from man-hating and the character doesn't grow out of it. On the other hand we have Dinklage's character who starts off as the concerned son and later runs out to be a prostitute trafficker who also wants his stolen diamonds back. You could hardly root for anyone in the movie. The last dramatic scene with Pike's character's death, that is supposed to be so emotional is so blant.

I mean, I have more sympathy for the Russian mobster just trying to rescue his mother. Yet, in the end, there are no heroes, no true protagonists in this film. Spoilers ahead.Now, at least we get an ok ending in that this horrible woman we've been following around for nearly 2 hours gets her just desserts in a violent manner, but I'm just not sure it's enough. Maybe American audiences are too use to ""happy"" endings or maybe most people simply like to see bad people punished. I don't know. Anyway, I actually rated the movie pretty high, with 5 stars, due to the excellence casting and acting by said cast; however, the story is a shambles. Tonally, it jumps from dark comedy to thriller, to drama, to criminal justice biopic and beyond. Overall, the final 20 minutes is what really kills it though. The beginning and first part of the middle of the movie build towards showing us how this evil con woman is going to finally get her comeuppance, thanks to finally picking the wrong victim, but instead we get her taking control of the situation and basically winning the battle, giving the viewers a definite unfinished feeling.

Our lead character, who the film establishes as an awful human being, suddenly becomes a gritty anti-hero, so tough and cunning she can take on the Russian mob single-handedly. At the same time, the mob becomes a cartoonishly inept enterprise out of the Three Stooges. Most members of organized crime are elementary school drop-outs prone to drug use and brutal short-term violence to get what they want. In this movie, they occupy downtown skyscrapers and stage elaborate, silly confrontations like James Bond villains of the 60's and 70's. By the time these confrontations are happening, I am so beyond the point of rooting for Marla that the film becomes, well, boring. It all feels very pandering and slapped together, and the experience of seeing something so promising become so silly is frustrating.

1683,catyjes,I care a lot to warn you not to waste your time with this illogical movie,1,19 February 2021,"Such a waste of time although the trailer was so promising. It doesn't matter how good the actors are, if the story is weak, in this case really bad, the movie is already lost. I liked the idea of a female antihero/ villain and how she was introduced by being a cruel, cold-hearted b****. But as a viewer you're hoping that at least in the middle of the movie the story would take a turn and the evil protagonist will suffer for what she has done to all the elderly people. Justice for everyone!!! But no, I was wrong. The mafia is not even able to do their job right and the female protagonist is not even a bit afraid or scared. Usually, you would see how she loses her confidence, arrogance and self-righteousness in the face of being threatened to lose it all. But wrong again, she even starts to hold a monologue about feminism. But in fact, she is the last woman in this movie you'd want to hear her talk about this topic. It does not help the story at all. All I could think of was when will the mafia finally destroy her - and I do not mean physically but psychologically as well as emotionally. But they're as incompetent as the writers of this movie. I even started to think at one point that it might go in a comedic direction which wasn't the case.
If a movie makes you wanna be on the side of the real villains, it's never a good sign. I don't understand people who liked this movie as you can only like it if you're as evil and cold-hearted in real life. The end is not sufficient and does not make up for 99% of the movie where she is portrayed as an unlikable person who never for one second is sorry for what she has done. Instead she remains the same, continues with her foul play and is even rewarded. What do you want to be: a lamb or a lion? This question is raised in this movie. And in the end i think the majority will say ""lamb"", not because we like to be weak and ""caught"" but because we have a strong moral compass that rejects such cruel and undignified deeds and thinks that certain values such as freedom and justice are above others and always have to win. At least in a movie!",I Care a Lot

1687,elvase88,There are no positives of this movie at all and I never laughed once!,2,28 February 2021,"This movie is really frustrating. Within the first 10 minutes you realise the main character is a horrible person and many other people involved are horrible too. They cheat the elderly out of money and stop family seeing their loved ones through a court of law. They manage to strip an elderly person of everything they own and just simply knock on her door, take her from her home and send her to a care home.I am not from the USA and I am not sure of the laws but surely someone who is a financial guardian cannot just ask a Dr to look into cases where a patient may have early signes of dementia, have a court order to take her from her home without her even knowing this is happening? If a person can be taken from their home without even knowing about a court hearing then it's one of the most horrible things I have heard of!You then realise that the main character has made a horrible mistake by taking a women involved in the Mafia and you hope she will get what's coming to her. She manages to get hold of diamonds from a security box worth millions and doesn't even question the fact that they have taken, more like imprisoned, a dangerous woman who most likely has dangerous allies. You then start to hope the Mafia kills her, that would have been a better ending but instead they then try to make the horrible main character a heroine in a way. She survives being drowned and then has a plan to screw the Mafia.All of a sudden the main character has access to wigs and tasers and takes down the big mafia guy and they decide to make a deal in creating a whole company that specialises in taking everything an elderly person has and makes a profitable business of it.The main character gets shot and dies at the end but not after creating an evil corporation with the Mafia that will ruin many other people's lives, but at least the Mafia man got his mom back and the evil main character died!!They created one of the worst immorally bankrupt business ever but at least the Mafia woman got free and the evil main character died and all is good in the world.I don't get what the aim of this movie is, is it that career driven people are all evil? Is it that this bad stuff happens all the time so why should we care? Is it that people with money will always manage to hurt and destroy the lives of others and get away with it even once they have been murdered? Is it that the world is just messed up and if people have money and you don't there's nothing you can do about it?There are no positives of this movie at all and I never laughed once!",I Care a Lot

And they succeed in making you hate Marla. She is a conniving and cold-hearted person who robs old people to gain wealth for herself.
Then, she robs the mother of a Russian mobster, just like she had done to dozens of others. And the movie takes on the persona of a sweet revenge movie, where evil does in evil. It's all humming along fairly well in that vein, when some highly improbable things happen: 1) the Russian mobster turns out to be two-dimensional, lacking in basic survival skills as a professional killer, 2) the employees of the mobster lack the follow through they exhibited with everything else they do in the movie, 3) they force feed Marla large amounts of alcohol, but she isn't drunk, 4) they dump her in a lake, along with her car, but she wakes up, in full possession of her faculties in the nick of time, 5) and even though the car is under water with Marla inside, she manages to keep conscious and break out the rear window of the car, and then swim to the surface without passing out, 6) then, she gets to her apartment where her girlfriend has been beaten unconscious and left in a gas-filled room for hours, yet no explosion and the girlfriend hasn't been asphyxiated yet, 7) she rescues the girlfriend, resuscitates her, and gets out of the apartment all before the place blows up, dramatically, as they leave.
And then the really improbable stuff happens, where she captures the Russian mobster, taking out his whole crew, all the while where she should have been suffering the ill effects of drunkenness, car accident trauma, breathing natural gas for an extended period, and piecing together a revenge plan of her own, all within hours of her own abduction.

Well, this is one of many.As for me I like to look from the dark side every once in a while. Especially if it has high quality as this movie is. And women in love with each other without being sexualised.People argue in reviews whether legal guardians are that bad or not. In relation to this movie it is pointless. The point is, we are mostly afraid of even the probability of such things. To be left alone and helpless and become a victim of bad people at the very end of your life... That's a nightmare.

Then another big turn in the road when we realise that neither of the bad guys care about the old lady any longer and it becomes a battle of wits ending with the two finally teaming up to inflict their scam on even more old people (although you are left wondering why the gangster is so bad at killing people). Finally the narrative arc closes and the horrible person gets her comeuppance from an unlikely source. I loved the journey and it's twists and turns.

1708,danko_fett,"Good concept, good start, though from there it gets profoundly stupid.",4,3 June 2021,"I disagree with some of the criticisms surrounding this film and feel like the problems are being at least slightly misdiagnosed for why it's such an awful experience (for the most part). I do not think having a villainous main character with villainous opposition is inherently bad although I do believe it makes it more difficult to properly execute. Not only does it fail at following through it's execution of handling this task, it does so in the most inane way possible.I do have to give some credit. The acting is pretty good throughout, this version of elderly abuse is interesting conceptually, and the first half hour to 45 minutes is solid. After the first act, the film falls completely apart due to a garbage script, which is where I'd say most of the issues with this movie lie. The characters will make unrealistically incompetent decisions consistently. The Russian Mob, in particular, doesn't operate like a mob at all in this movie. Their decision making is more so reminiscent of a bunch of inexperienced gangster wannabes. It makes you wonder how the hell they've garnered so much success in the first place with how incompetent they've shown themselves to be here. Definitely the dumbest part of the movie is when Marla is captured and Fran is being set up to make her death look like an accident. Both of them escape in the most absurd ways imaginable. I guess sedatives don't work on Marla and she can hold her breath for like 2 or 3 minutes underwater while greatly exerting herself. Fran also is immune to suffocation from gas. That's cool. And um, the mob doesn't ensure their kills are confirmed too, I guess. Now that we've established that these two characters are basically superheroes (villains technically lol), the logical way forward, in the director's eyes, is to... turn into a spy movie? Yeah, to label the ideas this movie presents as questionable would be a bit generous. Speaking of generous, Roman just forgives these characters in the end. I guess forgiving someone who kidnapped your mom, stole from you, and tried to kill you is what any violent crimelord would do.As well as the story and characters poorly written, the narration from Marla that sometimes pops in is pretty shaky at best. Like it gives off this vibe that it's smarter and more profound than it actually is. This movie would've benefitted from being grounded and subtle, maybe even a somewhat satirical angle. I can see the potential in it and it needed to be handled with more care and thought than whatever the hell this was.",I Care a Lot

1710,viksnejanislv,Good until the last third,6,24 September 2021,"The premise of exploiting the system of guardianship for the elderly was fresh and exciting for me, so I was intrigued from the beginning. But when Marla met her match in one of her preys, I was definitely hooked from that moment on. Up until that moment Marla had seemed so smug and confident, that I was enjoying her being challenged. However, that quite quickly fell apart in the last third of the movie.So of course, I have to mention the excellent acting by Rosamund Pike. I was fully immersed in her character. She did give me Gone Girl vibes as both characters are sort of low-emotion, tough people. But here she had an added layer of cool to her. I also enjoyed her on-screen girlfriend - Eiza Gonzalez. A very beautiful woman, and I loved her tough yet somewhat friendlier-than-Marla demeanour. Peter Dinklage for me was less impactful. To me he never felt very intimidating as a Mafia boss. Maybe because he was showing more emotions (caring about his mother) compared to what we see from Marla.Now on to the third leg of the movie:
* A major plot-hole - why didn't the Mafia, instead of killing the doctor, force her to write a note saying that Jennifer was mistakenly deemed unable to take care of herself? That would solve the issue much easier and quicker and would leave little if any room for Marla to counter.* The movie didn't really focus on Jennifer at all during the third leg of the movie. And that's a shame, as I would've loved to see how they're treating her, how she is suffering/powering through, how the ""torture"" is affecting her, as she seemed a tough character too but maybe she would break? But I suspect they chose to not focus on this, as that would make us sympathise with the Mafia boss instead of Marla. And this uncovers one of the major flaws of the movie - it doesn't know if it wants us to root for Marla or consider her as the anti-hero. So we're in this in-between zone, left confused about our feelings toward Marla.* The failed executions of Marla and her girlfriend seemed too unrealistic to believe for a Mafia-level of criminals. Also - why did the Mafia boss not threaten Marla with killing her girlfriend as they had captured her? Marla seemed indifferent about her mother, so her girlfriend would seem as the next logical threat, and would potentially force Marla to show us some vulnerability, which would be very satisfying for the audience as so far in the movie she has left the impression of nothing being able to penetrate her character.* Also the way Marla manages to capture the Mafia boss seemed too easy, coincidental and lucky.* Finally, the ending seemed way too rushed for me - the idea of them partnering up, growing an empire and her being shot. All of that was squeezed into what seemed like a few minutes. And her getting shot seemed an unsatisfying end for Marla, as she previously had said that she wasn't afraid of death. Instead she was afraid of losing as she said she always wins. It would have been much more satisfying to see her lose something - either her girlfriend, or her business, or her dignity.All in all, it was a very alluring set up that didn't pay off.",I Care a Lot

1769,legostopmotion,Do you want to see a Satire about the Health Care System?,6,24 March 2021,"I don't think, many people understood what this movie wants to be. And this is because the movie delivers it way too late.
""I Care a Lot"" is a satire about the Healthcare System, which is quite brilliant in delivering its message. The main character is a greedy villain, which has absolutely no good traits and turns into Rambo at the end of the movie. Everything she does works out fine, nothing that happens to her has any negative affect on her life or her mindset. She doesn't change at all through the runtime of the movie.
Many people think, the movie wants her to be an antihero, but it doesn't. It is fully aware of the fact that she is a hateful villain, because she needs to be to deliver the message at the end. People hate the movie, because she seems to win at the end, but this is exactly what the movie wants us to think. It's not a simple ""She's bad at the beginning, but changes to good at the end""-movie, it wants to show how cruel the Health Care System is and that the bad guys seem to win at the end (unless the victims stand up against them).
Unfortunately it delivers this message at the ending after you watched 2 Hours of a villain mastering every obstacle faced in outrageously forced ways. (For example: She just destroys the Russian Mafia on her own, because they all seem to have gone braindead)
Understandable that many viewers didn't have the patience to think about the meaning of the ending after they watched a movie they hated the main part.
To conclude it: The movie works if you watch it as a satire about the Health Care System. It doesn't work as entertainment that you watch on a nice evening with good friends. All the decisions of the script make sense as a satire, but seem stupid in an entertaining movie.
Quite sad that the movie didn't achieve to connect the message with an entertaining and logical story, because the acting is brilliant.",I Care a Lot

It doesn't take itself too seriously, sure and that's may be why the 'movie police' are raging against it. Read a review which said Pike's character is unscrupulous and doesn't make you want to root for her. SO? That's an excellent explanation really as to how well really she has played her role. Her character is repulsive and she has done a brilliant job convincing the audience of the same. Few places the movie is over the top and illogical, sure, but it's an entertainer, not a biography or a documentary. You don't expect James Bond or Jason Bourne movies to be logical either.

2. She had presence of mind to buy milk to store her lost tooth, which is entirely a detail that a master grifter would think of.

I was frustrated often, angry at times, and I would like to think this was a goal of the filmmakers and therefore I'm thankful for the emotional response. I foresee this movie as being very divisive but among the vanilla content that is regularly pumped out I enjoyed watching a movie that didn't care (pun intended) about appealing to the masses.

Surely deserves 7-8 stars, and the acting of both Pike and Dinklage is pretty robust.
But the crowd of 1-star reviews in a short period of time makes you wonder if this review board isn't bot-infested. Would need some moderation, as most of the bad reviews are the same in content (and have a weak argument - ""I hated the character, so he has to die quickly"" - are you serious?).
The movie is worth watching, and the exaggeration both in plot and in caricature characters makes the very problematic issue of legal guardianship lighter in this case.

However, the movie was difficult to get through mainly because of the protagonist. It can be argued that there is no protagonist and they are all in a sense villains that just show the cruel parts of the system. But that's not really the case. The movie attempts to humanize Marla and frame her as the protagonist. This is clear in many scenes. Thus, the movie tries to get us to like Marla, but it horribly fails. She is an absurdly horrid human being. Characters like the Joker or Megamind were evil, but they were still sympathetic. We cared about them because they were abused or oppressed, or at the very least they had some likable quality. Marla has none of that. Additionally, many of the scenes in which she wins felt contrived. Finally, the commedy aspect of the movie was lacking.

It kind of portrayed that it's ok to conduct unethical heinous crimes if you have struggled a lot and that money is the major thing that keeps a person happy. But it never showed that Marla was actually becoming a slave to her desire to become 'highly rich' and that she lacked self confidence to earn a living by honest means when many honest people do exist in our world who have a decent happy living. Her views on human behaviour kind of seemed manipulative as if the director was trying to justify Marla's evil deeds.However, a sensible person would understand that it's not just Marla but the whole system is at fault but I really don't know how many people would rather get influenced to make money like her because the director kind of encouraged that.But the last scene was quite satisfying because in the end, you ARE going to die and no amount of money can avoid that.

The neon color schemes, the creepiness of the not-quite-Midwest accents, the riches. I think a lot of people hate this film because it takes the reality of elder abuse and glamorizes it. To be sure, that is not a noble plot, but I find that the horror from the basis in reality adds to how much it captured my attention. In a backwards way, this may make people keep watch over their parents and relatives more. Unfortunately, this is capitalism. I don't like it much myself. But to take such a horrifying look at it, let it draw you in, isn't that an argument itself against it? You can only become a billionaire through exploit, and I don't think that fact is hidden in this film at all. It is nakedly stated that this is the American dream. I don't take this film as a celebration of that. I am fascinated and yes, disgusted, by each of the characters because as intended, they are sexy, ruthless, and guileless. And in the end, the common man gets his revenge, and it turns out the glamour and success can all go away by chance, at the drop of the hat. Her own words are turned against her-- he never gave up.

Points to Rosamund Pike for really nailing the unsettling factor. Points for calling out how easy and profitable it is to take advantage of vulnerable people. Points to Chris Messina's attractive suits. It was an overall fun romp, though it periodically strained my suspension of disbelief where it comes to close calls and newly developed criminal skills. I'm confident I'd be less critical overall if we weren't living in a day and age where IRL misogynistic white guys wearing red hats are convinced they're being victimized by minorities and institutions and that guns are their last resort, but alas we are living in just such a day and age.",I Care a Lot

But the film soon falls apart and just becomes absurd: I should have switched off halfway but kept on waiting for due justice to be meted out by their foes from the Russian Mafia. Introduced early on with great portent of severe lethality, these mafiosi turn out to be more Marx Brothers than John Wick. The credibility of the movie crumbled rapidly on witnessing their feeble attempts to break out of a care home (no joke), followed by what can only be described as ludicrous sloppiness in letting their enemies get away. The movie then becomes totally farcical when the supposedly dreaded gang allows itself to be captured and incapacitated with laughable ease.

They steal lives from people and force the victim to watch powerlessly as Pike and co. asset-strip them.At no point could I muster one iota of sympathy for either the protagonist or her cohort, both of whom I found without a single saving grace. Indeed by virtue of association, those in their orbit allowing horrors to be committed through apathy and lack of perception also propagated evil.The traditionally more evil antagonist on the other hand at least had the virtue of familial love driving his motivation and this odd role reversal made the first two thirds seem of merit. Then in a ludicrous and dubious urge to pander to a twist ending all of that is just thrown out.In the final moments we are offered a form of justice almost tagged on as an afterthought and a film that could have been great simply ended up being by-the-numbers.",I Care a Lot

It was extremely unclear which characters you're supposed to identify with and root for, if any. While the cinematography and colour design were entirely paletable, the acting was lackluster and the writing worse, these mobsters definitely fell short of expectations. It seemed like the director meant for the audience to revere the main characters as hyper competent masterminds, like two Goliath's clashing, two sharks held in a stalemate through sheer ingenuity. All I could think of was how tiny the paddling pool these sharks inhabited was ""baby shark do do do do do do""I Care a Lot is a kaleidoscope of misunderstandings around criminality, human behaviour, threat sensitivity and drug pharmacokinetics. It over values the financial gain from fleecing the elderly, especially relative to almost any other large scale criminal endeavour.

1944,G_M_S_8_9,The worst film I've watched on a while.,1,2 March 2021,"Where to start with this absolute atrocity. I love a good movie, especially a dark comedy/ thriller and as this has two of my favourite actors (Pike and Dinklage) I thought I was onto a winner. The synopsis looked interesting and original, something to enjoy with a take away on a Saturday evening to unwind after the mental exhaustion of lockdown with three kids perhaps. I was wrong. The first half hour was watchable but I found the entire thing immediately unrealistic in that one crooked Dr was able to sign someone off as mentally unable to care for themselves without so much as a second opinion. Just would. Not. Happen. I'm not saying vulnerable people never get taken advantage of financially, but Pike as a thieving relative even would have been slightly more plausible. From there it just goes down hill. Pike's character is basically a horrendous psychopath who is completely unlikeable, with the idea she has any form of close relationship with any other person who isn't mentally lacking absurd, but not only that she has a committed, beautiful younger partner who is also inexplicably
totally in on the psycho business of stealing from vulnerable older people. Would. Not.Happen. For me the moment I almost just threw my half eaten kebab at the TV was when for some bizarre reason, Dinklage's character was left for near dead, drugged and naked in the road after his car set alight by Pike. Is this an episode of Dexter? Why does the girlfriend so happily go along with this? So what more could this dangerous and wealthy man, member of the Mafia, almost murdered by this lunatic want to do with her after his harrowing ordeal?? That's right,let's be business partners, yey!! No. Ney ney. And then to go on TV showing off your successful multimillion pound new business- I'm pretty sure that's a big no no for anyone working in the care sector? Literally screams exploitation right there for the world to see. The most unbelievable film I have ever seen full stop.

The movie cant decide weather she is a business tycoon/psychopath or a caring loving partner. Is Peter Dinklage a badass Russian mobster or is he an emotional idiot, are his hitman actual professional mobsters who can do a job correctly or are they also idiots. is this a badass crime film with a emphasis on capitalism or is it just more feministic garbage that makes all men weak scumbags and women invincible who are experts at everything?The acting is pretty good and the fact that she dies in the end are the only redeeming parts of the movie but even her death is unfulfilling.",I Care a Lot

1980,mishelly05,Almost...,4,25 February 2021,"I Care A Lot could have been a highly entertaining movie. If you are casting a film and need an actress to play a cold hearted b***h? Cast Rosamund Pike. Very few actresses could play a role like this and make it so believable. Just like in Gone Girl, she is captivating, and fun, to watch. She's the reason I added an extra star to my rating.
The story was lining up well. I even believed that just maybe *spoilers ahead* she was so sharp she could outplay the expensive mafia lawyer in court. But when the two hits failed and the females survived, I was done. Why wouldn't hitmen, told by their boss to kill, at least make sure their targets were dead? And then, worst of all, the film tries to elicit sympathy for the female lead? No no no. They had shown us zero humanity in Pike's character, there was no sympathy or empathy to be had and that made her fun to hate watch. I enjoyed awaiting her downfall. But the shower scene after the failed hits was even more off target than the hitmen were.
I was mostly entertained throughout and watched through the end to see how it all played out but would have given a much higher rating and offered to friends as a recommendation if it weren't for the above plot points. I think a better ending would have been for her to end up a ward. Let her live the rest of her life getting a large dose of her own medicine.",I Care a Lot

Those who don't understand the movie and the character at all, acting like sheep and keep giving it raging reviews and low ratings without understanding the structure and the overall movie, and their reviews keep saying the same thing: ""the protagonist is so negative and mean!"". Yeah. Because she is not a protagonist.
I don't understand the hate. I really don't. It is interesting and sad, the music is great, the directing is good, the writing explains a lot about the main character (example: the cuts in the gym explain the car scene in the river, or how she got the sedative she used on the russian guy) the actors do a well job, sometimes even more than well (don't tell me that R. Pike is bad just because you hate her character, please just don't do that), and the story is also brilliant with a LOT of dark humor. Mostly because it smells like life with a pinch of salt and spice.
No, it's not satisfying. It's not right. It's not happy. It's entertaining in a dark, black, disgusting way. If you can't enjoy this, and you honestly think this movie will be about an antihero who, at the end of the day, will turn into a nice lady, a beautiful butterfly, then you are so wrong and you will be sooo dissapointed, but I honestly don't know what did you expect from a story where women use old people to get rich. HOW could it be positive? How? Why? When?The end of the movie is also perfect. Loved it.My overall opinion is that this movie is VERY good - if you don't expect a happy ending and lovely characters, because there is none.",I Care a Lot

2003,acibiber53,What was that?,5,20 February 2021,"Even at the trailer, we became aware that Pike's character is going to be evil and start to wonder how will she get punished for this. While watching the movie, only thread that was keeping me in my seat was to see how she will reap what she sow earlier. I imagined some satisfying punishment from the mob she messed with, so I can enjoy the movie, as movies in general are for entertainment. Instead, this movie left my stomach curled up and led me write this review.If, according to all our prior expectations, we want to see some results, and we didn't see any of them, then could the people who made this movie had a deeper message to give here? Well, I believe by forcing the cringe in my stomach, I found something like that.Throughout the movie, background message that brought up many times by Pike, there are two ways to live, either as a predator or as a prey. She, at the beginning of the movie claims that she has chosen to be a predator. As the story unfolds, we see that she is doing the requirements of her choice. She swindles elderly without any trace of mercy, as she is the stronger one in the equation, as she deserves it more than these lambs. She fights against mob, doesn't stop even if they try to kill her, threaten her, as she, the predator, won't go down without a fight etc. We can see that she will be a predator like this all the time.But at the beginning, she is small, she knows that there are bigger fishes around who can bludgeon smaller fish with their money. She wants to get on top of them. As story, weirdly, evolves into her billion dollar enterprise, we see that she doesn't have the fears from the earlier times. She is at the top of the world, got nothing to be afraid of, can do whatever she wants.At this exact moment, just when she thinks that she is just starting, just when she thinks that she did it, that she is controlling everything, a lamb, ironically, kills her. All the predator/prey bs is out of the window. In my opinion, it is a better punishment for her, as it came when she thought she had everything.So now I can say that, the message was that lion/lamb theory doesn't get you anywhere, but she left a billion-dollar company that is swindling elderly left and right and also at the same time is backed by mafia. That isn't going anywhere. She died, the so called predator got adequately punished, but to punish her, movie people also created thousands of new lambs.At this point, I don't want to go any deeper. Even with my optimist message digging attempt, this movie feels all over the place. There is a message, you can see it here and there, but the delivery is horrendous. My rating comes from cute Russian mob and Pike's acting.",I Care a Lot

2009,808Jordan,Fun watch with wonderful performances!,7,22 February 2021,"I felt I had to put in my two cents as pretty much every review here is a 1-star review... WTF!? Yes they do take some liberties here as all movies do -and the movie wasn't absolutely amazingly fantastic... But 1-star?! I think a lot of people are just feeding off of the other bad reviews.First off, the performances by most of the characters, especially Pike and Dinklage are absolutely incredible! Forget everything else but that alone should put this movie at way above 1-star. They both have, at one point in the movie, a wonderful monologue and just overall they give a really good screen-presence, as they do in all of their performances! I mean have you seen Gone Girl or The Station Agent?! And Chris Messina, though not having much screen time, was wonderful to watch! Dianne Wiest? Always great!The story was fairly unique especially with the intricacy with which it was written and though they are certainly a couple of times where I think the story took some liberties and the situations might've been a little unbelievable, it was nothing too in-your-face in my opinion.The big thing that everyone else commented on that IS absolutely 100% true is that indeed, all of these characters are despicable! You have a couple of leads who are somewhat the protagonists of the story but they're complete b*tches and immoral human beings. Then you have the Russian mafia guy who straight up kills people and tried to kill both of them... Yeah everyone's terrible! Where I think people get it wrong is that it's not a bad thing. Every story doesn't have to have wonderful people doing wonderful things... It's a story about a bunch of a-holes doing a bunch of a-hole-ish things. And one of them gets her comeuppance! Which I think was wonderful and definitely unexpected. It goes to show that what goes around comes around...I don't know why everyone is complaining about so many things about this movie. Yeah the movie wasn't fantastic but there are so many terrible movies out there on all of the streaming services, not just Netflix, and I wonder how so many of them can possibly get made!

The fact that most of the story doesn't add up, whether it is the supposedly omnipotent mafia using underwhelmingly ineffective methods to reach their goals or the dodgy legal loophole the whole movie lays its back on, allowing Rosamund Park's character to gain total control of numerous unwilling subjects' lives, makes it harder to ignore the on the nose and lackluster storytelling of the movie.

It doesn't work.Secondly, the film is profoundly stupid. On every level. Every decision taken by every character is the most moronic of all available options.Thirdly, the film appears to be rooting for the Marla character. But the Marla character is unredeemably hideous in ways to which the film makers seem utterly oblivious.Finally, the film is as shallow as a puddle.

J Blakeson has given us an intruiging tale which is a fun ride that manages to be unpredictable throughout. THIS is the type of writing Hollywood should use, NOT using the same character arcs and narrative structures for over a century.I mostly blame Hollywood's horrifically generic film formulas for the vast amount of 1-star reviews that complain they disliked the main character and/or they didn't know who to ""root for"". A story does not require an antagonist, so why should it require a Protagonist? Also, you don't need to ""like"" a character to be excited to see what happens next: American Psycho, a Clockwork Orange, Filth (2013, with James McAvoy), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (and Netflix' recent prequel, Ratched) are just a few examples of brilliant films with bad people as the main characters. (Writing this, I notice another connection is they are all based on books, a platform slightly more liberated from the rules of following a strict narrative formula.)Another reason for low ratings is the Comedy label. This is clearly a dark-comedy, not a laugh-out-loud or slapstick film... Why can't people understand there is more than one type of comedy?To be honest, I'm only writing this review because I was somewhat irked by the copious amount of low ratings from people who clearly only enjoy simple, predictable schlock that passes 90 minutes of their time. If they get to complain, so do I!
I've now run out of steam and can't be bothered to vent anymore... so in conclusion:
I thought this was a brilliant film with brilliant twists and turns, great acting and (surprisingly) incredible cinematography - but that's just my opinion.

2066,jleaver24,"Unconventional, surprising & an absolute must watch",8,1 March 2021,"I went into this film not knowing anything other than that Pike won a golden globe for her performance. The performance thoroughly deserved the award, but this was not the main reason why I rate this film so highly.This is a story without any clear hero to root for (although, without giving anything away, I would argue that one does emerge right at the end). Instead, the writer uses the unsavoury characters to shine a light on some of the failures of the American legal system and how corporations can do horrific things whilst being protected by it.It admittedly took me a while to work out that I was not supposed to be rooting for any one of the characters, but instead, root for something to bring down the system that allows them to operate the way they do.There are a few, sparingly used, absurd moments in which you find yourself laughing at the ridiculousness of what is actually a very realistic situation. These are provided very well by Dinklage & Wiest.My one complaint with this film though, is that the rest of the cast do struggle. I am not sure of the direction that Logan received as the 'muscle' for Dinklage's character, but he came across as rather corny which did not match the rest of the film.Overall, I found this film extremely refreshing. Not just because of the unconventional storytelling, but also with the way the film handles Pike's character. Many a traditional Hollywood storyteller would have let a character like Marla cower to Dinklage's Roman and I for one am very happy Blakeson made them equal. Marc Canham's score also deserves a shout out for really helping to draw you into the tense moments.",I Care a Lot

This does not work, because nothing they do elicits any positive emotion in the viewer. Therefore, I was just sitting there, watching this train wreck unfold, and unfold it did.

I think the worst part may be that they try to redeem the situation in the end by her finally getting shot. But that was also a total disaster as it leaves you feeling cheated because she deserved much worse than a quick death.
Then they leave loose ends everywhere.
She was hate-able, that's true. She's obviously a good actress.
The judge is either in on it or he's not just the worst judge in human history, but a complete fool with an inability to tell right from wrong.

Not at all believable. It felt as if a beginner wrote it. It's not funny or scary or interesting. It's played as if it is hysterical and surprising. No. Darn. I really was looking forward to this. Some good actors in it. They just have a boring, bad script. Maybe the premise is interesting. I hope people don't really do this. But the lines are horrible.Oh - and I early on predicted the ending. (Edit: Not the ending ending but a business agreement made. That ending.) I thought it would happen sooner. I guess anybody can get a script greenlit nowadays. Great actors, well made production-wise (I'm not in the biz but I used to act so I'm more critical. ) But the concept was not made to be believable. There should have been more to make it seem plausible. Legally, it seemed too easy. Maybe because a Brit wrote it and he doesn't know how sharp and picky we are here. The grifter wouldn't have gotten away with this so easily.",I Care a Lot
2076,jorgequeiros-pt,You don't have to care to watch it! But please do.,7,24 February 2021,"Nothing special, but it's still a great thriller. Don't be fooled by the bad reviews, which only exist because someone didn't notice the satirical tone of the film. Also, the main character is a woman. If she were a man, there wouldn't be so much hate.Now, do not create high expectations. The film has a dark comic side, and has a false epiphany in its message. The characters are bad people in many ways. But that is what makes this film interesting. You don't root for anyone in particular, you just watch the chaos and the story unfold until the last minute. Without saying much about the plot, the film makes you think about how far you are willing to go to be rich, and how easy it is to take advantage of older people while abiding by the laws.Rosamund Pike is great as the cold and calculating main character, and makes you both appreciate and hate her. Peter Dinklage brings the tension, stillness, agitation and frustration that the viewer expects. Solid performances from both.Could the film be more realistic? Yes. But it would lose what sets it apart from the most popular tense dramas and non-stop action features. It's a yes from me.",I Care a Lot

I was so happy when she got thrown into a lake but somehow she survived. It was when she saved Fran when I realized we were not supposed to hate her. Are you kidding me??? She's a ""survivor""? Of WHAT? Was I supposed to be happy when she threatened the opening scene guy she would rip her private parts off? This is dumb beyond measure.

A lot of you making these poor reviews are saying ""why would I root for this woman! She's terrible! This movie is disgraceful, she's taking advantage of elderly people and ends up still being a success!!!! :( why would they make this!"" .... YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE HER. THIS IS NOT AN ANTI-HERO MOVIE. This is not a feel good movie!!! If anything you should all be leaving 10 star reviews because it clearly sparked some emotions up in all of you which is the entire point. The main character is a woman who takes advantage of elderly people through legal guardianship which is something that ACTUALLY HAPPENS. That is why Netflix made this film. You know what else actually happens? Terrible, vile people becoming extremely successful by taking advantage of others. Most CEOS & billionaires are exactly like this woman.That being said this film is great because it does what it's supposed to do. It made me angry seeing how easily this woman was able to manipulate people and become successful. The acting was great because I truly hated her all throughout the film.

2137,alecmcgrath1984,All these 1 star reviews have seriously missed the point,7,21 February 2021,"Firstly it is hard to explain this film without giving anything away so this will be a spoiler free review that may seen a bit vague.Firstly to respond to these 1 Star reviews saying that you are supposed root for the awful woman who is ripping off old people..... Well you aren't.This film is actually very clever. It has no good guys, accept for the poor guy right at the beginning who just wants to see his Mother. It's a refreshing concept, who do you root for when both main characters are pretty evil? Fact is neither. You just watch the mayhem unfold and see where it goes. Most Cinema is very formulaic most of the time. Good guy starts strong, middle of film gets weakened and then comes back to save the day. This film is a refreshing twist on the somewhat stagnant at times method of storytelling in films. Throughout the film you actually want the evil guardian woman to lose.... badly. y
You even kind of side with Peter Dinklage's gangster character even though he is not a very nice man either. But that's what's clever, there are no superheroes, no good guys, no one that you really want to win. In fact you want nearly everyone to lose, which is odd but a new and different viewing experience.I have to admit that throughout the second part of the story I really did think I was going to dislike this film. Especially if it had the ending it seemed to be heading towards. Which it kind of did , however...... the last couple of minutes made this film a bloody good film and a genius concept. Without spoiling anything this has one of the best examples poetic justice I have ever seen in a movie. I can't say more without spoiling it but the absolute end of this film not only redeemed the movie it made the whole thing make sense.Another point I feel I should make is this film brings to light the easily abused court appointed guardian system that actually exists the US. Yes in certain places in America guardians can stop family members from seeing those under their care. It's wrong, unjust and this film does a good job of showing the dark side of such an ill thought out system.Now accept for the story the good points of this film are it has great acting. Peter is cracking as he always is and Rosamund Pike plays her character well. I rally did hate her throughout this film which shows how good an actress she is. The film is shot well with some very clever cinematography.The main Negatives for me are it does get a little rushed in the second part. It could have done with another 15 minutes setting up the finale and certain points don't make sense. Also it is listed as a comedy which it really isn't. Go in expecting a comedy and you'll be majorly disappointed. It's more a reflection on society and the greed that we have nowadays. I feel this comedy tag has had a major negative impact on the film which is a bit silly. It is most definitely not a comedy.Basically my advice is watch the film. You won't like many of the characters. They're pretty much bottom feeders the lot of them, except for maybe one of two. But that's not the point of this film. Watch it, enjoy the storytelling even if you don't like what's happening and see if like me, you have a massive smile on your face right at the end.",I Care a Lot
2138,charleybmurphy,A anti-hero so nasty you want to strangle her,5,14 August 2021,"I have to give the film credit for creating a truly despicable anti-hero/villain. I haven't see one that aroused my hate so effectively in a long time. However, like many other reviewers say, the follow-through is problematic. First, the Dinklage (always great actor) Mafia character's incompetence at every level doesn't explain how he has amassed such extraordinary power. His hench-people fail at every action, while Marla's white collar crime character exhibits amazing action-hero crime skills we have to assume she learned in some other movie. I could see different ending where Marla is locked into the ""imprisoned care"" world she trapped others in. Maybe the grandmother could have taken a more vengeful role and shown us a satisfying ""old world mafia boss lady"" side? The revenge would have been delicious if delivered by the grandmother. But to give praise where it is due, I'm hard pressed to think of another villain as deserving of torture as Marla.",I Care a Lot

BUT this movie gets so unrealistic in the second half it COMPLETLEY OVERSHADOWS THE FIRST HALF! I mean how do two commoners manage to fight off the attempts off the Russian Mafia single handled I will never understand.

2142,bambabimbo,Don't expect any moral,1,22 February 2021,"This movie is so anoying to watch that I think got PTSD bc of it.
I guess the message is: there is no moral. There are winners and losers and it's up to you which one you are. So this movie describes the worst case of injustice of the history of movies.
The lead character is probably worst human being ever written ( one point to the writers ).
If you expect any kind punishment that she would deffinitely deserve, you will be dissappointed.
The ""bad guy"" only wants to free his mother and live happily, but joke's on him, he can't just beat the strongest lesbian caretaker.
She decides not to lose so she won't. And that's the end ( more or less ). No remorse, no punishment.
In fact she and her girlfriend slowly turned over to be the good guys! We should feel bad for them as we see them fight back the really bad guys, and be glad when they win, eventhought you wished the worst for the two women from the beginning of the movie.

That's the best part. The whole movie was one big WTF after another. Hated it. The script was ridiculous.Extremely upsetting from the get-go: can they DO that? No second opinion, no representation? WTF? Why wouldn't there be any oversight - ever? No reviews of the care? No checks on the facility? No outside investigations, especially of medical issues and of things getting sold off?And then, coming out ahead despite who's against her, without ANY explanation of her background or much of her girlfriend's? Why did she hate men so much? Why did she hate her mother so much? How did she get her job? Her ""skills"", as they're referred to in the movie? Was she always like this, a scammer, or did someone else get her started doing it, or did she start out straight and get twisted somewhere along the way?How is it that NOBODY who has any legal or medical power ever questions anything? They're *all* complicit in this.Last movie I can remember seeing that I hated this much, in this similar stomach-turning way (as in, they can get away with that? how is any of this legal?), was the way more misogynistic, druggier, also horrifically revolting Wolf of Wall Street.It's a shame that Dianne Wiest and Peter Dinklage didn't have more to do in the film.

2164,geniusowl,A story without a hero,8,28 February 2021,"I changed my rating from 1 to 8 because after pondering about the writer's intention I realized what was the point of the story. Granted, it's not your typical Hollywood good vs evil scenario. There's much more nuance here. After witnessing how the bearded guy (whose mom is one of Marly's victims) gets treated, you wish the folks of Jennifer will teach Marly the lesson she needs. But in my opinion what the writer/director intended to convey was Marlys of the world are so evil and ruthless that even a Russian mafia boss throws the towel and agrees to join her in her evil business.The movie also shows how ""work hard"" to become ""successful"" is just a pile of BS and most of those ""successful"" just didn't work hard, but bent or broke the laws.There's no hero in this story except the bearded guy that once appears at the beginning of the movie and once at the end to kill Marla.

Plot-wise, the movie is pretty ridiculous, but the acting is good across the board, which helps sell it. That's the first thing I'd like to address: Yes, the movie gets pretty over the top, and definitely into the realm of unbelievability. Just relax and enjoy these two terrible people fighting each other. Not every movie has to be firmly cemented in reality.The most important thing I'd like to push back on that I've seen in other reviews is that we're supposed to be rooting for the two main characters. We are not. Their righteousness is self-righteousness and reflects their characters' viewpoints, not the movie's viewpoint p. They are horrible and we are supposed to be rooting for them to lose the entire time.I've also seen reviews claiming that this movie is pushing a feminist agenda (not that there would be anything wrong with that except that in this case it would be poorly done). Again, that's just the two female characters' perception of what they're doing. They find ways to justify their awful behavior with their progressive beliefs. It's just another example of how twisted they are.I would recommend this film, but the reviews here are proof that it's not for everyone. Imo though, people just need to relax a bit.",I Care a Lot
2178,joshuagiangreco,Chris Messina stole the show!!,5,24 February 2021,"This is a bad movie. Let's start there. Once we accept that as fact it's possible to find some entertainment within this mess of a plot, writing, and character development (or lack thereof). Chris Messina absolutely shows out in this movie and makes the other actors either seem disinterested in their own roles or unable to keep up with his performance. Peter Dinklage plays his role really well but is held back by the cliche nature of his character and his dialogue. If you have a few hours to kill on a bad film, this movie might prove to be the one.The premise of the movie was enough to make me interested in watching it. Admittedly I didn't look for any reviews prior which would have made me choose something different. It's tough to decide who's the most insane character in this movie. By the end of it I was rooting for everyone to meet their karma. That's generally not a good thing when there isn't a character to connect with. None of these characters are relatable, as everyone in the film is a shallow person with selfish intentions.Potential Spoiler: The final 1/3 of the film is outright laughable but perhaps that's what the writer/director was going for. So many times I thought to myself how unprofessional these professional killers/mobsters were supposed to be: a botched murder followed by the most indefensible escape from death by the main character. Then, her lover is beat up and left to die with a gas leak in her apartment to make it look like an accident. Both scenarios were beyond implausible and really drove the ""bad movie"" nail in the coffin.If you watch this movie for anything, watch it for Messina and Dinklage.

The set was cheap and action scenes not even worthy of an 80's B movie. Great cast but terrible movie. The movie flip flopped between want to be thriller and dark comedy.

And it makes everything fall apart, illogical. It has a pretty good opening, good message, but the characters...NO.

She doesn't allow for the audience to feel that weird sympathy we all feel for other similar protagonists such as Joe Goldberg in You.There was one point in the film when she was threatening Jennifer but also asking Jennifer to ""play fair"" and allow them to battle things out in court.Which is just Marla basically saying I'm going to torture you and make your life a living hell but don't treat me the same way I'm treating you... Be kind to me because I don't like losing.Also, her beating the russian mob??? HOW?!Before you can even utter a syllable you'd probably already be dead.And the mob, liking the scam she was running doesn't mean that they need her to make the whole operation run....They could have just killed her and did everything by themselves....

2226,joejacksaff,An entertaining film with one major problem...almost,7,19 February 2021,"I Care a Lot is an entertaining film with a unique plot helped along by stellar performances from Peter Dinklage and Rosamund Pike as Roman Lunyov and Marla Grayson respectively (the latter earning a Golden Globe nod for her turn).This an amusing film with just one major problem: who exactly are we supposed to be rooting for? The murderous mob boss or the con woman taking advantage of vulnerable seniors? The character we should be rooting for is Dianne Wiest's Jennifer Peterson who for the majority of the film is being detained against her will, yet no effort is made by writer and director J Blakeson to make her at all sympathetic. Instead, our protagonist is the downright evil Marla and we are encouraged to support her in her attempts to take advantage of her victims.Just when I thought all was lost and our protagonist had prevailed, Blakeson let his true genius show and revealed that the whole film had been one massive misdirect. The whole time, our true protagonist was Macon Blair's Feldstrom and the only scenes that really mattered were the first and last. Marla Grayson finally got her comeuppance and the viewer could go home satisfied.Overall, I Care a Lot is a good film to switch off and just enjoy as long as you don't think too much about why you're rooting for a criminal (whichever one you choose). It's not an all time great but it certainly is enjoyable and gets an extra star for that incredibly rewarding ending.",I Care a Lot

That is so sick. I was deeply bothered. The movie starts out with a man who just wants to visit his mother, he doesn't care about the money being stolen he just wants to see his elderly Mom in her nursing home. She rots in a nursing home completely alone. Doesn't show it but implies it. And I'm supposed to be impressed with this evil woman? Finally this woman picks another victim only this victim comes from a mafia family and I'm supposed to be rooting for the evil woman and her partner instead of the old lady who was held prisoner in her nursing home just because she came from a mafia family? Two wrongs do not make a right. I was hoping this was the one victim to teach her a lesson. To maybe help this evil woman find a better way to be financially successful from here out. But no.

You're not supposed to like the hero, or thinj that what the hero is doing is right, they're simply showing you how ruthless businessmen (and businesswomen) will do anything to gain power and money, disregarding morals and ethics. This movie does not insulte feminism nor does it tell you that what she's doinf is right. Anyways, just thought I'd say this just because so many people were crying in the reviews. As for the movie, watch it for yourself, Rosamund Pike excels once again, and even if the story is really messy, it's an interesting watch.",I Care a Lot

2281,MrReviewsALot,Strangely interesting premise. Terrible execution.,5,21 February 2021,"Oh and a great cast, just wasted. I believe when the film's pitch was made, they greenlighted it thinking ""Holy hell. What a premise! And another psychopath role for Rosamund Pike. This is a moneymaker."" $1251 at the box-office means they're probably flipping burgers now.There are so many liberties that Blakeson takes. But here's a taste:1. The mob boss (Peter Dinklage) wants a legal way to get his mother out of the carehome. The bribe offer fails. Okay then. But later, he finds the doctor who got his mother checked-in in the first place. Isn't that great? Why doesn't he simply threaten her or try to pay her off too and make her say to the courts that his mother is doing okay now or just retract her statement or make her do an admission saying she was palming off patients to Marla (Rosamund Pike)? No, he pulls the absolute braindead move of killing her. Why? Because that's how you turn a 30-min movie into 1.5 hrs+. Take notes, filmmakers.2. The courtroom scenes are so facile that any viewer who hasn't had too much to drink would say ""Really?"" and nod in silent dismay. Marla says ""She needs care, okay?"". Judge Lomax says ""Okay, she needs care."" Has to be the best courtroom drama to hit Netflix.3. Fran is scared out of her wits and wants to pack and leave. But in the next few scenes, she's surprisingly compliant, having had no serious discussion. Did they have it offscreen, perhaps? Can I watch it in the BTS version?4. The Russian mob has to be the most inept crime mob in history. They design unnecessarily complicated ways to kill people and never seem to have taken the ""Being a Mobster 101"" course. The first chapter literally says ""Always check if your targets are actually dead, okay?""5. It's one thing to believe that Marla is a hustler to the bone. It's another to believe she has the skills of a CIA spy to kidnap the mobster. She's got 2 kinds of fancy tasers to begin with. What an amateur. She should've had atleast 3. Maybe she did. We'll never know. After having watched the film, I don't wanna know.With all that being said, it wasn't a terrible one-time watch given Pike's formidable acting, the premise of caging old people and mooching off their assets and the surprisingly good costume design and color palettes in the film.I'd give it 4 for the constant downhill trajectory after the first 15-20 mins. But the movie slightly redeemed itself with its last 10 minutes. Full disclosure, I'll forever be ashamed that I got swayed by those 10 mins.

The villain is exposed early in Marla and then Roman comes along and you get a feeling of where the plot is headed. All the schemes and plots finally come to a head and we think it's over but then it's not, and that's where things go awry. The plausibility of the film definitely takes a hit after Marla survives her encounter with Roman and then exacts her plan to still come out on top. I spent much of the film confused, questioning if I was supposed to be rooting for someone? Or am I just a passive witness to watching horrible people do awful things for 90 minutes?

The core of the movie has a chance to be a really fun and exciting thriller but then it gets ridiculous and cheap. None of the events after the first 45 minutes are believable.

2300,mircea_ion,An uncomfortable truth and more uncomfortable to watch but good with a few exceptions,7,21 February 2021,"The intent here was to uncover or to reveal even more of what some of people already knew. That is a very important mission so this movie was not created with the intention of making you feel good when in the end everything it's gonna be alright. It wasn't meant to have a happy ending though partially in the end they managed to throw in a consolation prize.
Now to make a movie out of a simple story you need to be creative and sometimes stretch reality into scenes that lack verisimilitude. Yes you won't probably come alive from such a close enounter with the mob, or at least a handful of interactions and situations are so far-fetched that they deserve a raised eye brow. It's a movie.
It was so uncomfortable I wanted to stop watching it. It was in one of the two or three moments where there are some scenes that drag for too long. But I was curious to see how they will end, Will they leave it unbearable to watch all the way to the end 'cause it's not easy to see how the only hope of that old lady (her mob boss son) falls prey to the same unlikable villain and then in the end they ... you'll see.
When I say above this is a simple story it's not to demean it, I mean it's simple to understand, some unscrupulous people use lies and a badly written law to get to be in charge of those poor old people (which all of us will be at one time) and rob them to the last penny.
No, the movie does not condone what's done to the elder people or in general to use any means necessary to reach your goals 'cause other will do it anyway so why shouldn't be you the one to reap the reward.
No, the movie points out all this injustice rather poignantly with very unlikable character to annoy you, to anger you, but not to make you give ratings of 1 or 2 like a lot of feeble minded people did. You're not rating the state you're in after watching the movie but the movie, the acting and the importance of the message, the real message. No, they do it so maybe when you are in a situation where you come accross something like this you get involved and say something. Maybe you're a neighbor of elders and you see one day they are taken. Maybe you shoud sacrifice a day of your otherwise boring (probably like all of us) life and inquire what happened.

2359,mgonzalezobenza,A Misunderstood Film,9,28 August 2021,"I hate Marla. I hate Fran, and I hate Roman. I possibly hate all the characters that appeared in this film except Feldstrom (the man that appears at the beggining of the film, and at the end) wich ironically is the only one deemed a criminal by the law...And that is the purpose of this film, to hate all of them, to see how rotten the system is that lets monsters earn tons of money taking advantage of powerless and innocent people, like the eldery or the young women that are products in a human trafficking scheme controlled by Roman.I never feel such hatred towards a protagonist, usually because morally dubious protagonists have a background that makes you empathise with them, or because at the end the protagonist reedems itself.Not here, in this film Marla is a monster, plain and flat, because is not a matter of a character development, but of a representation of the corporation behaviour, flat, merciless, artificial and robotic, without feelings (Marla does not feels fear nor preocupation even when she is threatened with his mother wellbeing, but I do concede her love for Fran). Marla is not a person, is a representation of the corporation entity.This films also talks about meritocracy. At the end Marla is talking on a TV and she is asked about how she became so rich, and she answers that she achieved that with hard work, which is a lie, she reached that status by bending the law.The judge is also a represenation of the Law in the western world. He is lied to by Marla very easily, truly incompetent. And this represents how the Law is incompetent and rules in favour of the corporations, or the lions (lionesses).This film also talks about intersectionality. Just because a person is a woman or lesbian, does not mean she can't be a bad person. This film depicts perfectly that a person that belongs to a oppressed collective can also be the oppresor to another collective, in Marla's case, the eldery and their families.Marla feels real, not as a person but as a behaviour that is true and that is happening out there while I write this, and I think that the only time a monster like Marla was featured in a film was in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with Ratched. Pure evil in a human like form and level so realistic is unsettling and distressing.If you hate this film, because the plot was unfair, does not follow the scriptwritting basic rules of character development then the film did its job perfeclty. Is not a film, is a mirror of our society, if you hate this film is because deep down you hate the unfairness and arbitrariness of our society.",I Care a Lot
2360,jonasaerhart,No,1,21 February 2021,"The first half got my hopes up, the second one knocked them completely into the ground.I liked the basic idea of the film.
A ruthless protagonist that will do everything just for money and isn't even repulsed by taking money off of old people that are defenseless to her methods.
She then finds her match when she messes with the wrong old lady and attracts the attention of a mafia-like organization and has to deal with these dangerous people who she knows nothing about.Sooo, great idea with potential, horrible execution.
Here's why:The protagonist is unlikable and i was waiting about one hour for her to get killed or hurt.The *russian mafia* (or ex-russian mafia soldiers) is portrayed as incompetent as can be, to the point where a woman who has had no experience with fighting whatsoever can take out two trained mafia-guards with ease, because she *works out sometimes i guess*.
The protagonist and her girlfriend are shown to be absolutely great at everything they do, whether or not they should be able to.I just didn't know how the movie wanted me to feel.
I was undecided in the matter of who to root for, because in the first half i was rooting for whoever was not the protagonist, because she was just that unlikeable.
The second half had me jumping back and forth because on the mafia was so incompetent that it wouldn't be fair that they'd win, but then on the other side there was this protagonist that i just wanted to see dead.I hope everyone uses their Netflix - abonnement to watch something other than this.",I Care a Lot

Every person in this movie: the judge, the hospital staff, the security, the police, and the driver, just ran around not realizing that anything was wrong... with ANYTHING.The fact that this business woman crosses such a dangerous person and doesn't get more hurt is unbelievable, and not in a good way. The film made the antagonist, a member of the Russian mafia, look like a sloppy, fool just to make the protagonist look cunning, and ""unstoppable""; which wasn't the case for the viewer.For those who like closure, it never really comes.

If she had a reason that extended beyond her own selfish interests for doing bad things, we could sort of go along with it and empathise. But there isn't one. She is the epitome of greed for no other reason than because she is.It is perfectly fine for a character to be an anti-hero - but in order to pull it off and ensure viewers empathise, it's important to give the character qualities that we can empathise with.Further; anti-heroes should be contrasted with other characters who see the world completely differently - characters who have opposing ""Moral Arguments"" / world views / beliefs.This movie lacked that intricate web.On the plus side, great performances.

And wow, what to say. I geniuenly felt anger while watching this. The way Marla Grayson is writen is just on point for what I suppose is the purpose of it all. Hate, she's so despicable in every aspect, and the way the movie shows us that she's ""the good guy"" of the story makes that feeling even worse.You have this evil woman feeding over elders savings finally put in front of someone that can actually get her down and, throughout the movie the only thought in my mind was ""when is she gonna pay ?"".And the movie takes it's time to build that hate towards her, she's awful, but at the same time really smart and manipulative, understanding every
aspect of the law that is on her side.So, when finally she has to pay for what she did, she still manage to escape sort of speak.Every. Single. TimeThe hate I felt throught the movie, and the thougts I had ""No, come on, she cannot just keep going, someone or something has to stop her""

What is the viewer supposed to take away from this hogwash? Why spend half the film building up the most vile, unpleasant, unredeemable character traits in your protagonist, and then expect the viewer to be happy when she escapes the most ridiculous ""Austin Powers"" like death scenes at the hands of what ends up being a completely inept Russian mafia?
This isn't the case of a flawed protagonist who we want to cheer for despite her flaws. There's simply nothing there for the viewer to cheer for, aside from clapping when we're to believe she's about to finally get executed and then roll our eyes when she predictably escapes her fate since there's still 45 minutes of screen time left over.

Seriously this Russian mob was successful in faking the death of at least 2 people etc... but they don't wait and make sure the main character is dead before leaving the scene, wow how did they become so powerful?!?!? If the writer/director were looking for a bad person for the audience to end up liking then it should have been the older lady, she could have been a Ma Barker kind of character.After a while the movie became more unbelievable and began to drone on and on...... I actually went to reviews, including spoilers, while watching this movie and when I found out the main character died I fast forwarded so I could see that part, which was the most gratifying part especially the person that killed her.I was really disappointed because the story had a lot of potential and it seems that it was rushed to be made before the story was fully developed.",I Care a Lot

Life is not that simple and the old movie convention of black hat- white hat easy identification of who to support and who to want to die is turned upside down in this unconventional comedy drama. I Care a Lot makes it difficult to like or even feel sorry for any of the multi-flawed characters, but having said that this is a really good story with enough well-researched understanding of the guardianship issues facing a vulnerable American aging population. The movie moves at a cracking pace and is no less believable than the hundreds of modern movie stories, so why this movie has rated so low is more a reflection of expectation rather than a true reflection of a well-written story, well-acted and well directed. Well done to Rosamund Pike for her well-deserved Golden Globes win. At least the foreign press recognized the worthy recipient.

There are some barriers one cannot cross such as the love of a mother and her son. Greed knows no segment in society. Money makes compelling partners.
I laughed. It may be due to the isolation of the pandemic. Dianne Wiest is no one's fool and she gives some looks which only a Russian mobster could deny her request.

2483,vrpale,It seems I interpreted the movie somewhat differently than many of these 1 star reviews...,8,7 March 2021,"First, I agree almost none of the characters were likable but ... that seemed to be the point. Why do movies have to be as simplistic as that? In real life many of the people in positions of power and with an obsession for money are not likable, seems a lot more realistic. She was not supposed to be liked, I think it was quite the opposite, it is difficult to empathize with someone who abuses the elderly, it hits home for most of us. Rooting for the Russian mafia doesn't appear to make sense either, since they were involved in not only drug trafficking, but apparently, human trafficking. This was not developed, but it is impressive how people ignore the signs of another inhuman activity and ignore the awfulness of these other characters. Not only is it not explicit, but there seems to be a tendency to want to ignore it.Anyway, the movie is not trying to teach something through the characters or to be realistic (which almost no action movie is), the way I see it is more like a critique. The mindset on which she bases her actions sounds oddly familiar to the ones taught in some business books (48 laws of power, for example, I am sure there must be a lot more), which are grounded in a surprising amount of people who want to thrive in the business world (now in a lot of women, who are incited to act in similar ways men in power have usually acted, which is why I believe the protagonist was a woman). She was then recognized for her ""success"", her ""hard work"" and ""effort"", maybe even idolized for it. What the people in the movie did not see was all the wretched and disgusting things, the people she had take advantage of, to get there...The worst part is that this way of thinking does not stay in books. A considerable amount of big and important companies earn their profit, at least partly, from abusing human beings (they may not directly get their hands dirty, but distance and delegation shouldn't make any difference). This happens specially to those without protection either in developed countries (immigrants and ex-convicts mostly - for example the meat packaging industry) or in ""third world"" countries (textile industry in Bangladesh, cobalt in central African countries). These situations, as well as what happened with the Russian mafia are not visible, and thus ignored. It seems these clear messages concerning some extreme capitalistic mindsets, and the way society revolves around them (IN THE REAL WORLD) just went over the head of a discouraging amount of people.",I Care a Lot

With Bond-like survival skills she takes on an equally comical Russian mafia boss. She single-handedly kidnaps him, taking down his two large body guards with just a taser!

Is the film entertaining? No, it's frustrating and infuriating. Does the film tell a moral story? Yes, that is in the writer and director's view, in order to get ahead in today's society (especially for enterprising women) you can do whatever you want, including imprisoning and torturing elderly people for money. Embedded in this hogwash that passes as a film is a fundamental hatred for society and an extremist worldview.

Does this happen IRL? Sure, of course. Does this happen as the movie portrays it? Unlikely, but it's a movie.Rosamund Pike nails the strong female role, albeit super manipulative as in Gone Girl. Partially why I like this movie so much is seeing Pike in another strong, manipulating female lead role. I'm not trying to typecast her but she just does it so well.So if you like seeing Pike play this archetype then this movie is for you. If you're looking for a movie grounded in Medical/Legal reality, it's probably not for you.Also, bonus, Peter Dinkledge, always great to see him in anything.",I Care a Lot

On one side you have the main characters able to outsmart all the men and take on the Russian mafia without any issue. Then on the other side the main characters are glorified by taking advantage of elderly. Why do strong women always need to be shown as villain masterminds?

Rarely do we see the good and bad guys antagonized to plot against each other at the outset, then end up working for each other. This film is unfairly judged with too many one stars, but it just shows that you either will hate or love the movie due to the seeming outrageousness of the film's main premise. We know that the State does step in matters of incapacity (mental or physical) of a person who has no next-of-kin or predesignated guardian. Although some of the plot elements' credibility may be a bit stretched out, that's cinema's artistic license for you, the film respects the audience's intelligence by delivering a suspenseful tale of human greed and questionable morals that in the final analysis still delivers a powerful message.

If Hollywood thinks this is the definition of a feminist or a role model, then we are better off not procreating. Giving the protagonist a badass character arc, showing her as unbeatable for 1.5hours and then killing her off in the last 30 seconds does not erase the fact that you have tried your level best to show young girls that becoming rich by any means is the right way of life. Morality, loyalty, ethics nothing matters. ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL AND DISGUSTING. I cannot believe am actor like Rosamund Pike gave life to a role like this.

2538,DoggyEatDoggy,I Care Less,4,31 October 2021,"The first act sets up a gripping, if far fetched premise, but sadly it goes down hill from there. The female empowerment theme, which initially, tantalisingly, has the courage to portray a strong female as the bad guy, becomes so heavy-handed as to defuse all tension, once it becomes clear the anti-heorine is, in fact, invulnerable. In one scene, which is shot to show the seated Rosamund Pike as being the same height as her supposed tormentor, Peter Dinklage, who is standing, it comes dangerously close to mocking Peter's dwarfism to make a laboured point about the impotence of male rage. There is also the problem that all the chararacters are so despicable, the film has an emotional vaccum at its core. In the final scene, you seem to be invited to empathise with someone you have been emotionally distanced from throughout the movie. It just doesn't work. It left me feeling robbed, wondering how much better this film could have been if handled with a little more emotional intelligence and subtlety.",I Care a Lot

2545,jtxmwczhp,Great Acting - Bad Plot Direction,1,22 February 2021,"The first half is interesting. The main character, played by Rosamund Pike, while excruciatingly unlikeable, is charismatic and engaging as she figures out more details about what she's gotten into with her latest elderly victim. However, the second half of the movie's blatant unbelievable plot progression, really does take you out of the film. Furthermore, even with such an unlikeable and irredeemable anti-heroin, the movie is structured in such a way that you're supposed to be on her side as the movie continues in the last half. This combined with the falling out of realism makes the movie extremely irritating to watch.The film lacks so much grounding that it makes the themes introduced in the first half and makes them feel less pressing and over exaggerated. The ending made it seem so you know the people writing had their heart in the right place - but simply overplayed their hand in trying to get their message across, creating an character following a sequence of events so jarring it grinds down your patience as you wait for the end.This movie has some elements that are good, but it cannot be stated more how much the second half undermines the first.",I Care a Lot

This is also about allowing women to lead a film and be bad and in the end ... well you can see. Maybe some of the negative stuff is by men not happy about that too.

The first half went smoothly and enjoyable until the plot started to loose its glimmering when non realistic sequences took place. For example, Marla had to wake up just before the car crashed the water, then suddenly she had the power to break the car's window, walk through remote place till she reaches a gas station. After all of that, Marla were able to reach out Fran and save her before she gets suffocated with the gas. Worth mentioning, that Fran was beaten to death by 2 supposedly mafia members. As a side note, the same mafia members were able to murder the physician and making it look like a homicide. I don't like going through a plot part by part trying to highlight its gaps, but in this movie the gaps are too obvious, at least for me.
On the other hand; most if not all of the acting performances were great.

Also nothing was exciting about when the people found out and went after her, it was all so bland I still can't figure out if the judge was in on it or just super stupid-that angle wasn't explored, why didn't they (spoiler in a way)take out the judge and every single person connected to it.

Rosamund Pike herself said in interviews that the character's actions are indefensible.I can't say I exactly enjoyed this disturbing story, and I admit that some plot points strain credulity, but neither the writing nor the acting were as bad as some seemed to find them.Most important of all, don't forget that the real villain of this piece is a broken system that's rigged against the most vulnerable.

B. Proving that grandmothers, mothers, and their sons can not survive the bad intentions of 2 Lesbians (so who's bad?)The movie is supposed to enable a pleasant moment across a variety of content such as action, comedy, romantic etc. But not at the point that does not talk about reality or positive fiction. instead, this movie shows a denigrating situation that is closer to bad fiction than it is to reality.

To begin with, the writer really tried to portray the main character (played by Rosamund Pike) as a badass anti-hero when in reality, she couldn't be any more detestable. Usually in stories like this one, the main character has an actual motif behind their actions, be it to protect someone important to them or to attain some type of revenge. However, in this film the main character is just a selfish, self-centered Walter White wannabe and it takes away the attention from everything else in the movie. I couldn't wait for the main character to die, my favorite part of the movie was her death. It was simply satisfying and pleasuring to say the least. Although I must say the acting was great!

Not only is it impossible to connect or sympathize but I was outright rooting for them all to die just to make it end sooner. You simply couldn't relate and none had a single redeeming quality.Second, the concept of the fleecing of people legally was interesting but everything else connected to it was implausible and outright impossible. Did they even consult a lawyer before just making up stuff?Third, how is it possible that such ruthless experienced killers could be so, so bad at it? It's like watching the Batman series from the 70's where they would put him in some ridiculously elaborate death plan and then leave the room while he escaped. 3 different times people who should have been killed weren't.

At least you'd get a good meal out of it.And my god...another movie with the lead character escaping death by the most miraculous of circumstances just because the plot can't exist without that happening. How absolutely cliche and lazy. That's when I just couldn't watch anymore.By the way, just how incompetent can Peter Dinklage's character be? It's like he got the same treatment Tyrion Lannister got in season 8 of GoT...completely, shockingly stupid. Why leave Marla alive in the car when he sent it off? It's like that scene in Austin powers where dr evil tells Austin that he has been placed in a deadly yet easily escapable situation so Austin can get away unharmed. Jesus.

The fact that some script writer decided viewers will be able to get past that and stick with her as the main heroine is beyond me.
There are no other characters with any personality whatsoever in the script, her personality is completely one-dimensional (ruthless, with no fear), no background to explain it.

So the start of the movie is quite good, but it goes into total disaster as the story unfolds. The utterly stupid judge that just takes decisions without even blinking, the Russian mafia without any Russian accent. OK, will take them as they are, but then the story goes into complete disaster. The girls were on the run, but still managed to get their hands on a wig, the electric shock guns (I still can't understand where did they get them from), the way the 120 kilos guard is put to the ground in front of the car and in the next scene he is lying down next to the car.

2688,superfatamerican,(Spoilers) Not sure how I feel,5,21 February 2021,"In the beginning, I already didn't like Marla. She just seemed like such a bad, irredeemable person. She manipulates the easily manipulatable, the elderly, taking relatively happy and healthy people and putting them in assisted care facilities to sap of their money. Contrary to her role as the elderly patient's legal guardian, she cares little for the people she is supposed to look after and sees them only as objects, throwing away a recently passed patient's photo while speaking of them as an object. She finds a cherry through her doctor contact, a potential goldmine with no relatives and a mountain of money. Marla does this with her partner, Fran, who is described as the most likable person in this movie, which confused me at first as she is just as guilty as Marla, with her conscience being not a bit better. After being met with a lawyer and refusing the money she was offered for the woman's release, he took her to court and failed to get her release, stopped by a judge that has seen many elderly patients be brought under Marla and get leeched from, even though he is likely going to get manipulated in the same way in his future.The cherry ends up being a Russian mob bosses mother, who desperately wants her back. He is in no terms a good person, but i found myself rooting for him most of the time. After a failed jailbreak attempt to free his mother, the mob boss decides to take the easy route and sedates and kidnaps Marla. Even as he threatens her with death, she remains too composed as she looks death in the eye. Marla has so far hated to lose, and in this situation she had almost no cards, it just didn't make sense for her character to act like this. He orders her killing in a natural way, with her in her car set up to go off into a water logged quarry. Marla somehow escapes this, despite being sedated right before being sent under and having her seatbelt locked in. Implausible for me, and in my opinion this is where the movie starts to go downhill.After reaching a gas station and calling a cab, she reaches Fran just in time before she dies of gas inhalation from a gas stove left on. Barely escaping, (again), Marla seems to have no real consequences to any of her actions, this seems to be the start of where you should start to root for her, but I can't find myself feeling anything but negative feelings for her. Marla and Fran decide to get back at the mob boss, so they tranquilize him and leave him naked on a rural road. He is taken to the hospital and labeled a John Doe, falling right into Marla's web, and under her jurisdiction. They come to a deal and in a couple years Marla is the CEO of a multi-billion dollar organization that capitalizes the exploitation of the elderly. In the last scene, right after a talk show, one of the elderly patient's sons we saw in the beginning shoots her in the chest, killing her.I think that I Care A Lot puts out a good enough story about two bad people that both shouldn't succeed. Rosamund Pike plays such a good unlikeable character that there is just no feeling any good about her or her success. Her end couldn't have come any sooner.",I Care a Lot

The only character you have a bit of compassion with is the guy in the opening. After he berates Pike about his mother her response is abysmal. I actually had a little compassion for Dinklage's character. Back to my point. Jr stated they would like to have seen this guy blow Pikes character away. Perfect.

They are not afraid to use counterforce when I call upon them. It is interesting to see the comeuppance of the evil social worker who is involved in elder care fraud. I took care of my dad in Canada remotely and coordinated his care with a real social worker and other assistants. I once set up a computer that I gave to dad and set up an internet account for him back in the 90s. He allowed me to use his credit card to purchase the service. He used it for a while but grew tired of it. He had an executor who became irritated with him. My cousins and I convinced him to move back home to Regina, Saskatchewan for a stay in a nursing home since one of his caregivers was trying to bilk him out of money. We had him for another three years and he thoroughly enjoyed his gorgeous nurses. When he passed on I inherited a considerable amount of money and gave my relatives 20 percent of that sum. I paid for the memorial service.This is an eye-opening movie that is well acted and highly accurate. BTW, my wife is demented and I also take care of her in our home. One of our friends is a psychological counsellor and I take her to visit her a few times each week. I vowed to take care of her until her last breath.

So, you can enjoy the movie for the comedic one liners and Marla's fashion sense but don't take it more seriously than that. The only satisfaction I got was that Marla got what she deserved in the end. But the scamming continues. You can't find a likeable character (except maybe the guy in the very very end). I tried to empathise with Marla but there was no detailed background on her that would usually allow an audience to understand their actions and perhaps invoke some empathy.

2858,dukemtaylor,You're only mad because the movie made you hate REALITY,10,24 February 2021,"Rosamund Pike was #Actress👑🔥Let me make this short and sweet. The only reason why you will hate Rosamund Pike is because she played THEE. HELL. OUT. OF. THIS. ROLE. Anytime you come away from a movie thinking you want to throw the actor in a fire pit, you must reflect on the fact that it's because the actor/actress has become the character. This is a character you will 'love' to 'hate'.Several people have given it a low-rating because they hate the REALITY that it portrays. Make no mistake. This is actually happening TO. DAY... TODAY. In our towns and cities, and most of us don't even realize it. And quite the opposite of the title --- most people don't care. So when they give the movie a low rating, I think they are being intellectually vapid about the nuance of a reality that exists TODAY in your community. You don't see it, because maybe you're not old, or maybe your parents aren't older than 75-80 --- but the premise of this movie will be coming for you sooner... or later...If you hated the movie, it's because you're human, and you have a soul. But I think what you're really saying is that you love how disturbingly great this movie is, and you're glad they made it. Now you know. This... Is... Happening...Rosamund Pike should be foisted on our shoulders and heralded for the work she did in this movie.

Which frames the entirety of the film in a deliciously refreshing way whereby there are no ""good characters"" to root for. I thought this was excellent but judging by the disproportionate reviews on this site was a little bit too much for most viewers to handle..It finally breaks away from the typical ""hero"" that gets the happy ending and allows you to watch a collection of morally unethical characters try to tear each other apart. All while being marvelously cheeky in its execution of dark humour.The underlying theme portrays the issues with late stage capitalism and often touted ""hard work leads to success"" message provided by the ultra wealthy. It unmasks the way in which people exploit systems in legal grey areas to make a profit, as infuriating as it is to watch play out, Marla and Fran still make it incredibly entertaining. You love to hate them and hate to love them. This conflict in emotions about how you feel about the characters makes a nice change for once as either ""hero"" or ""antihero"" has been done to death.I'm quite shocked to see so many viewers talk so poorly about this film and I think it is wholly unjustified.

A lot of these reviews are sketchy and repetitive.,7,24 February 2021,"I'm not saying this was the best movie I've ever seen, but I take issue with the amount of reviewers who complain that there's no one way to root for such an unlikeable main character. Feels like misogyny to me. Anti-heros are part of some of the most iconic movies and shows of all time, and no one has a problem rooting for them when they're men. And no one claims that these main characters' moral failures make the movies or shows unwatchable.I'm currently rewatching The Sopranos, so I'll use Tony as an example. Now I don't think I Care A Lot is at the same quality level as The Sopranos, but we all know Tony Soprano does a lot of despicable things and is generally going to make the amoral decision in any given situation. But that never stopped anyone from rooting for him. The masses weren't crying about him being an unlikeable character. Crime movies are often led by characters who are far from being role models, so if you're going to rate this movie so low, I hope you have a better excuse than ""mean woman bad.""I don't think that it's okay to take advantage of the elderly, but that doesn't make Marla unlikeable. She's witty, driven, and stubborn to a fault. If anything, my main issue with the character is that she isn't quite fleshed out enough. I'd have loved a little more info on how she came to be this type of person after she spoke about being threatened by so many men in the past. I'd also have liked to see more of her partner and their relationship because it seemed to lack depth and felt more like a sidekick situation in the way it was framed.The movie was entertaining. I went into it with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised at how interesting it ended up being. Rosamund Pike gives a great performance, and I'm reminded of her character in Gone Girl at some points. Was this a cinematic masterpiece? No, not really. Do I regret spending 2 hours watching it? Also no. I'd do it again.Also, a lot of these reviewers seem like bots because so many of them basically say the same thing, some even using the same words and repeatedly feigning moral outrage. Several have similarly formatted user names. Seems like someone is out to crash the ratings.",I Care a Lot

There isn't a state in the US where a stranger could get guardianship of an elderly person and manage to steal everything they own all while having said elderly person drugged in a care home with no ability to have legal representation or even make a phone call. Despite the fanciful plot it still could have been a decent movie; however the movie tries to make Marla Greyson and her female lover/business partner the anti hero's that the audience is clearly meant to root for. I was expecting a feminist ""girl power"" angle but based on the trailers for this movie I hoped and assumed that Mrs. Peterson (the main victim) was going to be the badass woman that plays cat and mouse with and ultimately outwits the movies antagonist.

Of the business she runs, why she does and how she does it. The subject of the movie was very intriguing and pulled me in. At first you give her a chance, that she is doing the right thing. But a little in, you can see that she is deceitful. The feeling of hate and anger started building up inside of me for the A-Hero of this movie as it went on. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as movies that can cause you powerful emotions are very well made. Though a powerful start has to be followed with a powerful narrative and ending that makes sense. It simply did not deliver on either of these. The entire unfolding of the events made less then no sense. The ending just left you with that anger that had built up for the last 2 hours without any satisfaction. There are many different ways that this movie could have gone and got a 10/10. Only if someone with talent had revised the script before production. I am not saying you will be wasting your time with this movie. If I weren't watching this, I would be doing something else that is unproductive. I am not upset about the time I have spent. I AM FURIOUS! The anger that built up for the 2 hours is left with me with no outlet except this comment section. Maybe no-one will ever read this. But for anyone who took the time to read this.

I found myself really just wanting to see Marla finally get what she deserves, and honestly that's not what I like to feel.Besides the lack of someone to like, the total ineptitude of the Russian mobsters is not very believable and neither is the physical and strategical abilities of a white collar criminal to win a fight against them.The end of the movie is only half satisfying because we haven't built a relationship with our hero, we saw him once at the beginning of the movie, and once at the end.",I Care a Lot

I thought this was a story in the eyes of an antagonist which would be an interesting flick cause we don't get too many of those. It would of been a more solid movie if it stuck to the legal guardian vs the Russian mafia boss but it drifts off and just gets corny.

No wonder they don't open up the movie theaters anymore. If this is all that they can muster anymore, Hollywood is done and the movie theaters would fail anyway if opened. Good riddance, the Epstein island temple colors drowned out every scene. The masonic symbolism is getting ridiculous throughout this movie, they're not even trying to be subtle anymore. The opening and main message they wanted to push in this movie is, ""the only way to get ahead in this world is to screw over everyone else. If you try to play by the rules, you'll never get ahead, so give in to being a piece of trash and being a greed ridden, vengeful, money driven spreader of negativity and harm in this world.

The main character cons old people out of all of their money and is the anti-hero of the movie. She constantly is expressing how she doesn't fear men or whatever. Fine, cool. I'm all about empowerment. But who is this empowering? And to do what exactly? Con old people out of all their money, isolate them in their final years, and let them die alone? THIS?She was so unlikable that when the mafia decided they were going to kill her, I was ECSTATIC. But no - this one small scale ""legal"" con artist was able to beat them all. They launched a half baked plan to break mama out of the old folks home and failed against mediocre security, then tried to kill her by drowning her in a car after drugging her, and STILL escapes. She then saves the girlfriend they also failed to kill.Later, she manages to debilitate the mafia boss to get appointed as his legal guardian and instead of him killing her, he offers her a legal job?? And then she goes on to live a successful career and be filthy rich? The only redeemable aspect of this movie is the guy in the beginning kills her. I don't know why the writers tried to make him the villain in this. I was glad! He had every right to be angry and fight to see his mother and the only reason they made him make those sexist remarks were to give us a reason to fight for this irredeemable, one dimensional character that the audience feels nothing for. We have no back story, no understanding as to why she is this way, nothing. Just that she is a cold, unfeeling, horrible woman.This movie tried and failed to do so many things and it was a waste of my time. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

And Fran the chick that has been questioning everything the whole movie says ""yup let's do it.."" okay maybe she got hit to many times in the head while the mafia literally beat her and left her to explode in her apartment.. but come on a complete 180° on character motives.. this movie should have ended when Roman had Marla sent into a Lake.I found myself rooting for Peter Dinklage's Character who I think is supposed to be the antagonist?
They tried to slip in some clip where one guy comes in and shows Roman (Peter Dinklage) a bunch of people maybe being trafficked? and the movie never goes back to that, it was so vague I forgot and was still rooting for his character.. it was confusing to watch.. like they humanized the villain and dehumanized the ""antihero"", when in actuality Roman was the antihero and Marla was the villain.A solid 2 out of 10, will recommend you stop like 30 minutes from the end, so the movie becomes a solid 6 out of 10.",I Care a Lot

People who think this is a dark thriller miss the comedy tag, and people who think this as comedy miss the dark thriller tags.
There were silly/unbelievable moments, but just as one reviewer said, ""Not even a very powerful force can stop a caregiver."" Satire and drama were used to get points across.
Many people also seem to miss this point:
There is purposefully no clear protagonist or antagonist. The film often left me conflicted on who I wanted to see ""win,"" and that was frustrating, but definitely refreshing.
Film had very good points and interesting insights.Quote from the end of the movie:
I appreciated the line that was said: ""There is no secret! It was just hard work."" Really takes a jab at those who tell others to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.8/10 because I am left still thinking about the movie, and it is probably worth a rewatch to catch the more subtle messages.

This can sometimes be acceptable in this kind of story, but later in the film she begins to exhibit various skills and expertise that simply aren't remotely plausible without one.2.) Storytelling that beggars belief. Perhaps the biggest shark jumping moment is when the grizzled organized crime veterans fail to kill the protagonist and her wife in ways that can only be described as vile incompetence - it's just not possible to keep immersion after this. The mafia knows how to make someone dead when they kill them.3.) In general the tone of the film feels wrong.

Let's ignore that fact that she held her breath that whole time, how could you she have broken a windshield with her legs? That isn't even possible on a regular day, mind you, in the water, with the bare minimum of oxygen. And how could she casually go out of the water and walk?Where did she get the money to pay at the gas station? I'm sure the guy who kidnapped her in the middle of the desert thought of taking her wallet off of her.Where did the Marla and Fran run off too after they left their house? What kind of dentist has a shower and a condo at the same place?
Also, what's the point of the movie? Who is painted as the hero and who's the villain? Are we supposed to take the mafia's side or the greedy corrupt robber?

The family court system however is represented very accurately. Often there is very little proven evidence on the states side and there doesn't really have to be (though the law states otherwise) and judges often automatically side with the state despite procedures that should take place. Social workers write reports and whether there is evidence or not, civil court puts preponderance of evidence automatically in favor of the state. So much of the system is corrupt and so many people do not know it. This movie is only far fetched in its story of personal details to the character. The acts of court and the social worker is sadly accurate. The other reviews on here from a doctor etc, stating it's far fetched is because we all cringe at conspiracy theories but the family courts in this country in fact can and will disregard procedures all of the time in family court and subject children and the elderly to trauma because like this movie showed, they twist the narrative and the facts to represent ""being the good guys"" and it isn't that hard to do if you act like you advocate for the vulnerable.

3135,shivan-35956,There are no good guys in this series if you are looking for one you picked the wrong movie,7,13 March 2021,"The series is a face off between two groups of people that are horrible. Peter Dinklage's character is not like he was on GOT.
On the one side you have Marla Grayson, a sociopathic who only cares about money. She works mostly within the horrible legal system of the US to retain guardianship of people by connecting with doctors and making them seem to have dementia. She then milks them for everything that they have until they die and she has to hand over what is left to family.
On the other side you have, Roman Lunyov and the Russian Mafia who transport drugs via mules who may or may not be Human Trafficked. Marla marked someone that the Russian Mafia cares about.
Both of these people care about money and the bottom line. Neither of them care about anyone else with few exceptions. Marla cares about her Gf and Roman cares about family.
People were expecting there to be clear good guy vs bad guy in this series but there is none. There are two bad people and you have to figure out who you want to win because even if one wins we still have loss in the movie.
Roman Lunyov's character is not sentimental and if there is a way of making money off of someone regardless of how he feels about him, he will do it.I do not think that this movie is far fetched. It does display a lot of what is wrong with the guardianship program and corporate attitudes towards it. Much like privatizing prisons, it is just a bad idea.

It doesn't work at all.It was basically ""Get Out"" but with old people being imprisoned and pillaged by Rosamund Pike and her team. But then half-way through the movie the writers are trying to get you to root for Rosamund Pike, which nobody wants to do because her character is a terrible human being. This is also trying to be sold as a dark comedy but it isn't funny at all. It completely missed the mark.The built the story into a classic revenge movie but then tried to pivot away from it.

Remember, this is a fictional movie! Of course its not realistic. Is Kill Bill realistic? What's wrong with everyone. These types of movies should continue to be made, and you all are killing it.
In fact this movie reminds me of Tarantino and Kill Bill a lot. The music, the editing, the female hero/antihero, the plot. She even wears an all yellow dress by the end of the movie. I think it's a hommage to Tarantino.

Ya! git it from 3 minutes in, its a candy for the brain fantasy / fiction flick. The trailer was a hint. As far as way out there fantasy flicks go, I give this one 9 stars for succeeding at just that and deserved. Odd how this movie comes out at a time when there is mounting revelations globaly , how care home abuse and neglect is out there and now with the kicked in the balls realization of how nasty it can be, I refer to the past year of those abandoned and died needlessly from Covid 19.
I do not think the movie tried to make an effort to convince anyone that what they portrayed in the movie was anything like the norm. However, it brings attention to a real tragedy in a real world. It is not a failed documentary people, it's a story of greed, heartless abuse of venerable people with a strong background of equality for woman, A lot of point was given to just how far up their asses their heads are in, ""its a mans world"" circles. Bravo! to writing and casting for a strong message there!.Cleverly dangerous leads rolls are portrayed dead on. Irritating? Ya! as it should be!. Boiled your blood, absolutely! A subject matter that would infuriate any one with a conscious. A good reminder ,how we should care more for our elderly. Setting out to pasture our elderly to an industry for profit is shameful. What the hell happened to looking after our parents and grandparents later in their life? These thoughts creep in throughout the movie.

Original story and the main character was going to get what she deserves because now she messed with the wrong people. Everything was going great up until she was kidnapped and I was really happy and I thought that I found a really good movie. It all started going downhill the moment after she was choked by that plastic bag. So you are telling me that a regular civilian that is used to a luxurious life didn't even flinch when she was facing criminals who were ready to do anything to her ? You go through a near death experience and then you start blabbing about death and how one should not fear it as if she were in some philosophy Café. You almost die by the hand of ruthless murderers and then your first thought is that you actually don't care about what happened in 1807 so no need to fear death. Basic human instinct would kick in and she should've started shivering and crying and begging for forgiveness not striking a 10 million deal as if she was on a poker table. And then it just gets worse, how unprofessional the Russian killers were (yet clinical and efficient with that doctor). How she wakes up at the perfect moment, how she has the lungs of a dolphin, how she break the rear window, how she comes to rescue her GF right 30 seconds before the whole building blows off, how, again a regular civilian, single-handedly took down a Russian mafia boss with perfect timing for her to get into the parking lot and tase the driver and the bodyguard (how did she even know that there will be just one bodyguard). Are you telling me she had all that composure and nerves to face death twice and fight her way back? Even if the hero of the movie was Captain Marvel or James Bond or John Wick, I wouldn't swallow it much. And cherry on the top, she doesn't even get what she deserves. Greed was her main driver and the source of her strength, well it should've been the factor that would've led her to her destruction, not a bullet through the chest. We deserved to see her lose her fortune, and see her life taken away from her, like she did to all those poor people. I cannot remember a movie that made me this frustrated and angry.

Maybe Aunt Lydia from Haindmaid's tale as well.When you build up such a frustrating villian, and then tease that this person is going to be taken down, and then don't deliver, you're left with just a feeling a pure hatred. Not only that, the movie seems to suggest that we should have some kind of change of heart where we are kind of rooting for the main character to come out on top, kind of like rooting for Walter White even though we know he's bad. But never, for even a split second, did I want the main character to come out on top. Again, she's not Walter White, she's Nurse Ratched. I hate this movie for even suggesting that I would want her to come out on top.Furthermore, Peter Dinklage's character was built up to be this super powerful person that you don't want to mess with. Almost a John Wick type threat, constantly hinting towards how the main character made a huge mistake. You got the sense that the main character was going to get what was coming to her. Turns out he isn't a threat at all. It's like if everyone was terrified of John Wick, and the first time we see him in action, he gets taken out by a toddler who wants his lollipop back.All I felt was anger and frustration at the end of the movie. I watched it to the end just to hope that the main character, at some point, got destroyed. Yet they didn't. This total dirtbag evil person gets everything, always, throughout the whole movie. I hated watching this movie. Literally my least favorite viewing experience.",I Care a Lot

Many scene's made myself and my mutual audience uncomfortable given how unrealistic the acting is, the story-line, and the overall plot. *Cue unnecessary vaporizer scene.* There were also many obvious attempts to appear as pro-liberal, which is fine, but the attempts were so blatant and seemed to take the focus from what could've been an entertaining, although predictable, story.This film undercuts and insults the reality and severity of organized crime (and clearly did so on a small budget) and also gives you no character to cheer for. The characters you'd like to see prevail ultimately come up short - and what a truly pitiful and pathetic ending.I couldn't tell by the end of the film if the plot was centered around a flawed guardianship landscape in Americas, or if it was based around empowering individuals to take on a division of Russian mafia because love will get them through it.

3227,yurymoskaltsov,Completely Unrealistic Plot,2,1 May 2021,"The plot of this film has more holes in it than a colander.First, her grift itself. She tricks old people out of money by appointing herself through emergency court hearing without their presence. These people mind you are wealthy and wealthy people usually have lawyers and wealthy children. Ok, it happens once in a while I tell myself, just let it go. Next thing I see she stares at 30+ photos of people like that. Let me make it clear, she takes the custody of old people without letting them know or giving them a chance to appeal and she sells their assets within a week. They didn't show that the judge is bribed by her and I doubt she would reimburse him enough to pay off the risk. That means she can direct every case to her and to the same judge, who is an idiot by the way, because he doesn't see that this guardian sells assets of their clients within a week and restricts the visits of children. It would take one case to break this grift down but she manages to have 30+ people like that. Jumping ahead, at the end of the film she will make a billion dollar company out of this grift. You read it correct, it's like if Pablo Escobar came up with an IPO. It's so dumb it makes me want to puke.But we don't stop there. Then we see the mother of a russian mafia boss easily comply when a complete stranger (Rosamund Pike's heroine) comes to her, shows her some piece of paper and kicks her out of the house. She doesn't call her son to straighten it out but simply complies. Madness.I don't want to talk much about mafia being a bunch of idiots who supposedly have elaborate system of hiding identities but register their cars to the real addresses where they stay. Just facepalm. Severely drugged woman wakes up in an instant with clear consciousness and knocks the window out of the drowned car(scriptwriter didn't attend physics classes at school). Another facepalm.Then there is a useless feminist line. A guy whose mother the main heroine just robbed and locked in care home comes and calls her a bitch and she makes it a sexist thing, it's not, he's angry cause you just scammed his mother.This film has a pretence to be something like In Brugges or Seven Psychopaths but it's not.

The first half sets up the main character as an absolutely despicable villain, who robs vulnerable elderly people of their money, independence, and family. There are several heart breaking scenes, where you can feel her victims helplessness and it's genuinely painful to watch. I loathed the main character and everyone involved in helping her with her con. When the movie introduced Peter Dinklage as a badass mafia boss, I thought it was building towards a rescue and revenge, but no, the whole tone shifts in the second half. Instead of a cathartic takedown of a deeply unlikeable character, I got bumbling mafia goons making endless, unbelievable mistakes. Suddenly, I'm supposed to be rooting for this vile piece of human garbage as she mary sue style takes on the mafia and WINS. Then I was forced to watch a montage of the villain's wealth and success as she expands her empire of kidnapping and robbing old people. But oh wait, that's horrific.

Here's the thing though, when you're actually begging for the mob boss to kill the slimey main character and her equally disgusting associate, and then at one point worry about the mob boss, there's something very very wrong.I don't think I hated a main character of a movie this much before it almost ruins the whole movie for me. I don't know if its the smug actress or the fact that she's overly cut throat, but I was rooting for bad things to happen to her the whole movie and ending in a painful death, and there's just something wrong with that. Even with characters like that, there are usually some redeeming characteristics which make you somewhat like the character or empathize with them, not in this movie, the main character is an absolute vulture and you just want bad things

The acting was superb and I was quickly drawn in after I was able to get past the thought of the fraudulent behavior of the two main ladies. I found this movie had humor, surprising twist & turns and a daring story line, with a lot of attention grabber moments. Dianne Wiest & Peter Dinklage when it came to humor really made the movie. Rosamund Pike was very convincing and played her role so well that it almost made her character likeable, but her character was a very bad person that I would not want to know. Her character's actions were horrific. At the end, I almost felt bad for Rosamund's character & caught myself by saying, hmmmm...I am not sure how I feel about this. I did feel bad for the man with the beard at the end. However, people, it is a movie! I love movies that give you the real possibilities of life instead of sugar coating everything.

The whole movie felt just like if it was written to worship the protagonist. I mean at this point adding this character to the Avengers or Toretto's crew would be a good idea. The main problem with this film is that everyone except her is a complete idiot. How can a judge that studied law for years be manipulated like that. How is it that the head of the Russian mafia is beaten by a caretaker like it was nothing. What Marla was doing was deplorable and she deserved to be unmasked. Oh and did I forget to mention that she woke up poisoned in a drowning car and still managed to break the back window and swim ashore? All these to take her own tooth out and give us the most pathetic shout ever shown in a movie. The acting by Rosamund Pike and Peter Dinklage is top notch though.

It's sooo far away from reality. Survival of the protagonist's girlfriend is questionable, survival of the protagonist herself is impossible (almost like in James Bond movies). But kidnapping Russian mafia boss, well this is surreal.Secondly, let's put aside the whole superhero abilities of the main character. The final scene. What is that for?

By this time we were all ready to see some karmic justice on the worst villain ever. Except instead the movie took a wrong turn and became all ""I am woman hear me roar! bs"".

Even before the mafia showed up they never got guns or fled cause they were stupid Karens trying to be ""bad boss b*****"". The minute she stupidly turned down the 300k I was excited for the rest of the movie, inside I was like ""run b****!, he gon' kill you!"" but really I wanted someone, anyone to defeat her, and what better anti hero than the mother trucking Russian mafia, if anyone can put an end to this Karen they can get the job done.

The main character is a horrible person and they do a good job of setting your expectations up for her to get what she deserves. By the time you meet Peter Dinklage's character you don't even care that he's some mob boss. You just want him to get revenge for his poor mother.
That is what should have happened. Every single person watching up to that point wanted that to happen. It would have been a dark, spiteful comeuppance where the mob slowly dismantles everything she has done so that she rots in prison at the end. They set the stage for that to happen, and it would have been perfectly gratifying.
However, what actually ends up happening is so ridiculous and far-fetched that you feel betrayed. I spent the second half of the movie saying ""really?"" It was just that bad. Like, maybe this will become a cult classic bad.

Smooth sanctimonious professional guardianship agencies, complacent family judges, nursing homes with pet physicians willing to overmedicate headstrong noncompliant elderly victims. ""It's not what she wants, it's what she needs"" used to deny the elderly basic legal rights to due process and self-determination. My mother experienced every bit of it, her living will set aside (attesting to her will to live and rejection of any attempt to confine her, Mom was a 60s wild child fighting ""the man"" to the end) and her only child prevented from having meaningful contact by an all-powerful professional guardian agency in Wisconsin.

3376,gidister,"Story driven, not character driven, but with great acting",7,26 April 2021,"I enjoyed the movie. Addressing a few points:For someone who is not knowledgeable about the elder care system in the US, the premise was believable. I'm sure that if I read up more about it, I will learn about the checks and balances that are in place to keep this sort of thing from happening. Be that as it may, for me it was a novel idea that was an effective hook for me to keep watching.The main attraction of the movie in my opinion is the story, specifically how they attempt to sabotage each other as a way to get what they want, and how these attempts play out in the world. It is not supposed to draw you on an emotional level to the characters (that much). Think Ocean's 11 but with very good acting. Basically, it's a story driven movie, not a character driven one, but the good acting brings some credibility to the characters in terms of their motivations and actions. It should also not be mistaken for a movie preaching about the issues surrounding the elder care system in the US.I'm honestly surprised why so many people have a need to find a character to root for, as if they always expect a hero (or antihero) vs bad guy story. No, it does not have to be this way. In this case it was ""lawful but awful"" vs. ""unlawful"", and it worked just fine for me. The story isn't about trying to get you to identify with a character, but to showcase how people with different shades of lawfulness (note how Marla uses a taser whereas Roman has no qualms with sending people to their graves) go about fighting for what they want. Yes, a character to identify with on a personal level can be a strong motivator to watch a story, but the strong performances by the actors negate this need in my opinion. Although they act unethical, they still come across as people with understandable motivations.Regarding lesbians, we are under no obligation to represent them as angels, just as people with issues like the rest of us. See Charlize Theron's ""Monster"".",I Care a Lot

I dont feel its justified to call out the good ones and to criticise the ones I dislike.This movie had all the right ingredients in it to act as a catalyst to ensure i post a review. There were times when movies were used as a mechanism to promote ethics and human values. But this movie just did the exact opposite. The core idea sits around exploiting vulnerable people for money and the lead character goes on to become one of the most successful and influential person by just doing that bloody well. The movie sets a bad precedence to the world and specially younger generation making them think its OK to do ANYTHING to achieve their personal goals. I can go on to write a full blown report but i dont think this movie deserve that time and effort.

3409,localhorst,Shameless copy of key dramatic elements,3,19 February 2021,"Don't continue reading this if you don't want to read spoilers regarding the movie 'Layer Cake'.This movie is solid in terms of aesthetics and a certain theme set by colour grading, lighting, props and make-up. Furthermore, the cast is superb. Rosamunde Pike's character is convincingly evil, her assistant played by Eiza González is a respectable lover, which is not just a sidekick blinded by love, which is great. The judge, played by Isiah Whitlock Jr. is a surprising cast as everyone who remembers him from HBO's The Wire, immediately anticipates which kind of a judge he might represent throughout the movie.The film asks relevant questions about morale and ethics in making money, or as the protagonist claims: the 'american dream'. Unfortunately, this makes the way these societal problems, presented through a character that is unquestionably devoid of any sense of morale or responsibility, even more problematic and completely ridicules the urgency and relevance of exactly these central motives. The film more or less suggests that problems in health care, distribution of wealth, and obvious corruptness only occur when a completely exaggerated character like that of the shining criminal protagonist and her assistant are able to put their scheme into practice with the support of a blindsided judge. But, although not as entertaining as depicted here, these problems are very real, especially to families confronted with questions of providing domestic care by themselves or spending a fortune on elder care.Even more appalling than the lighthearted discourse of the societal questions which the film itself raises though is the fact that two very essential scenes of this movie are just copies of the movie Layer Cake (2004). Both movies begin with monologues by their protagonists, addressed directly at the viewer. In both movies, over-exposed shelves of modern day pharmaceutic products are shown, which the protagonists pass while explaining the capitalist machine of the modern world and how it works in a very pretentious and omniscient rhetoric. Notably, this introduction sets the stage for accepting that the criminal protagonist might still be a person to listen to, because they are very aware of the things they do (large scale drug deals, imprisoning elder people in order to take over take control of their assets as legal guardian). Yet for some reason these characters seem to have their reasons for doing these things. This is what makes them interesting and it is the very moment they gain the interest of the audience. Then, both movies carry on showing how a morally questionable protagonist struggles to maintain their criminal business model, up to the ironic ending. In their ending scenes, both movies present a protagonist that seems to have solved all of their business problems and personal affairs. Everything is just fine. Both movies show their protagonists with their loved ones. Both protagonists are wearing bright clothes and are on their way to or from some kind of leisure activity. Both protagonists get shot by a seemingly irrelevant character from earlier in the movie. In both movies, this seemingly irrelevant character was introduced as weak and inferior but now they get to take revenge by shooting the protagonists at point-blank range in a moment where the audience is still asking the question of whether they support the protagonist who was just starting to enjoy their life.Layer Cake managed to have this be a truly ironic ending, because beforehand it succeeded to make the viewer actually sympathise with the protagonist. In the case of I Care a Lot, the viewer is still asking themselves whether they can take sides with the protagonist, while watching her get shot and it sort of creates a feeling of gratefulness because now this question doesn't need a definitive answer from the audience anymore. In the end, the protagonist in I Care a Lot was simply a bad person taking advantage of others. In Layer Cake however, the viewer learned that the protagonist, although becoming rich, is just a small fish in the pond and that they didn't have much of an alternative. This is not the case in I Care a Lot, where the protagonist could have just stopped doing what they did at multiple occasions before facing real tragic consequences. Therefore, seeing her die in the end fails to create an ironic feeling. Being reminded of Layer Cake however, the intention of this being an ironic ending is evidently clear. It just isn't.To be clear, the blatant copy of the introduction and ending from Layer Cake already disqualifies this film, but it also fails to make an argument by improving on its inspirational source and thereby potentially making the copy a respectful nod towards its original source.",I Care a Lot

3427,jonjblock,"Smart dark comedy, great acting, twists & turns",10,20 April 2021,"Dark comedy may be the hardest genre to nail.Most people would prefer to see the very obvious Oceans 8 (another female-centered crime movie), but not me at all. I Care A Lot is an original, a nod to the dark comedies that came before it. If you liked A Simple Favor - which I loved - this will be up your alley.Rosamund Pike is AMAZING in this. Her character is definitely a cousin of her Oscar-nominated work in Gone Girl; she plays manipulative incredibly well. What adds dimension is her relationship with Eiza Gonzalez. These two love and respect each other, have each others' backs. Their relationship gets tested and the strength of their connection rises to each challenge. It's a rare movie depiction of a mature lesbian relationship. We need more of these.Which to the movie's credit, nobody ever comments on. Their relationship is accepted. Just like with Peter Dinklage; nobody comments about his dwarf stature. To do so would only cheapen the movie and the filmmakers are smart enough to see that.The music is great. The production values are strong. The story keeps you guessing right up until the final scene. It's VERY hard to find the right way to end any movie (except for maybe the standard 90s rom-com), yet it's especially hard for a dark comedy thriller. This movie does it right.And afterwards, if you're NOT left wondering more about how the elderly are getting taken advantage of in this country, and wanting some more answers for yourself, then it's probably time to REALLY step up your movie-watching game.",I Care a Lot

Of course it's not believable; it's deliberately over the top. In reality, no one would get away with what these people get away with on this scale for this long, but so what?

A wrong doing must have been done to her! She had to have been slighted in someway! Why is this the case?This main character is not meant to be likeable, the narration at the beginning of the film spells it out for viewers, ""good people don't exist"" you won't expect to see them here.

She truly seems like just an assistant. A very personal assistant.
Why is Marla this way? How did she get where she is now? Who cares?! What was that thing about her mother being a sociopath? Has that anything to do with the way she treats older people now? Who has time to answer these ridiculous questions?! The writers certainly don't.The concept wasn't bad. I truly was ready to see some great mind games and scheming between this ultimate scammer and a Russian mafia boss. But then it was just convenience after convenience in her favor. And... nothing.

You find yourself rooting for the bad guys to win because they're actually the good guys. The whole time Marla (Rosamund Pike) and Roman (Peter Dinklage) are playing cat-and-mouse, the old lady (Dianne Wiest)--who did nothing wrong to anyone that we've seen--has been locked up and subjected to subpar care out of spite. And there's no acknowledgement or amends for it. Marla started all of it! They don't show why she is doggedly determined to double down on abusing this old lady just because the old lady had the gall to defend herself and have a loved one try to show up and save her? There's an event at the very end that I guess is supposed to be Marla's comeuppance, but it doesn't work. The whole movie feels unjust and--I can't stress this enough--it is NOT funny.

3632,clauswebb,Exactly the film the world doesn't need right now,1,23 February 2021,"This film is not only immoral and unpleasant. A tale of indecency and despicable people and their aspirations. I thought it was going to be a dark comedy or something, but there's nothing funny about it or in it. And some critics might say the film is good because it is raw and uncompromising, but the story only works because it is unrealistic too. No, a big mafia boss will not 'try' to kill you, s/he will torture you, then cut you to pieces or whatever s/he thinks corresponds with the offence. They do not fail, certainly not that miserably, and much less twice in one night.",I Care a Lot
3633,szoti95,It could have been good... BUT Hollywood style happened,2,3 March 2021,"The movie started so well, it could have been a real success. The idea of the ""kidnapped"" elderly women turning out to be the mother of some mafioso is magnificent. There is no good revenge films nowadays, this could have been the one.BUT
This Hollywood style idiotism, that the ambitious absolutely evil protagonist has to win the day, is totally ridiculous. The film forced us to endure such a shame. Logically this woman with all of her family members would have been dead by the half of the film. But no, how would that look...And then the cherry on top: Peter Dinklage offers her partnership! No one in his right mind would do that. That crooked witch is playing on a total different level than these guys, way more below. ( It is easily proven, by her when she didn't kill any of her opponents ) They would kill her in a blink of an eye, and they would know that she could not do the same. This way she would lose advatage right after she get the money. She has something to lose, these guys would know that too.The proper ending in my opinion would be this: Our protagonist dies at the lake. The kidnapped woman walks out from the elderly care facility, and then they burn down the only remaining memory of our protagonist, her office, with the photo wall. The message could be like: Do no harass old people, they didn't live that long just because they were lucky.

A female villain? Female and completely lacking ethics? Wait... No one really is brave enough to do this nowadays. So I was hooked. However the movie somewhat starts like that and goes drastically down the gutter.
The actors do a good job somehow, but holy funk... Everything else is just badly portraied and put together. It's not even silly comedy,, like a Rob Schneider movie, which you would hate watching, but somehow you will say... ""Well I started a Rob Schneider movie, what did I expect?""I never watched a movie so much hoping death and misery for the ""hero"" thinking the author and director cannot be serious. There is no katharsis for the viewer. None at all. For some movies it makes sense (I. E. American psycho, which is a great film).If you would ask me to choose between another year of a pandemic or watching this movie again. The pandemic would be the easy choice.

Despite boasting an embarrassment of riches, not least an excellent cast, the movie manages within the span of its first act to ensure that just about every important character is an irredeemable caricature about whom I couldn't care less, even if I were promised a cut of their ill-gotten gains. The plot is thoroughly unconvincing. The writing (most especially Marla's cringe-inducing ""predator-or-prey"" monologues) is scandalously derivative. I gather we're supposed to be repulsed by a system that allows the elderly to be so cruelly abused and exploited in the beginning, then shift to cheering on this system's chief girl-boss exponent by the middle and end? I've also read this film is supposed to be a satire of sorts, but it lacks any semblance of self-awareness. Even it's supposed campiness, which some claim to observe, must be purely incidental.

After rescuing her lover (they left her alive why?), marla's first order of business is to get her tooth fixed.

When you finally meet the person that is supposed to be her match you're rooting for him to get his mother back. You're watching thinking the villain must be a criminal mastermind that was able to remain ""dead"" to the world and create a new identity for his mother but was NOT smart enough to make sure tags didn't trace back to his chauffeur??? This seem like basic rules of How to be a Criminal 101. There were other details thrown in that didn't make sense to me. They randomly have the villain shown new mules like this is supposed to make him seem like the character we should hate the most. The speech the main character gives about men and their empty threats was stupid. Was this supposed to make all the ladies shout ""YES! GIRL POWER!"" ??? I hope this wasn't supposed to be a women's empowerment movie because it was everything but. Nothing about this character would have made me sympathize with her. Even her taking on women trafficking mob. I was definitely waiting to see her get out smarted by some surprise character or something but that never happened.

The script has huge logical gaps and amateurish mistakes, that very much weaken the story and at times simply don't make sense in any universe.
And the biggest flaw of the film is its shying away from being a satire: the characters are one-dimensional, J.R. Ewing had a more complex personality than our villains.

I am convinced a lot of the 1 star reviews are from the cabal of attorneys and judges who are part of the guardianship system who are being exposed.

2) make us laugh at them / watch their downfall e.g. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia - funny because they get what they deserve for the most part.This movie does neither. We have to watch horrible people do horrible things to innocent victims. Marla even tries to justify it at the beginning by blaming capitalism and how we all have to fight and struggle to make money but instead of fighting the system, she basically is a personification of the system: she abuses her power and preys on the weak for financial gain.

One of the things I enjoyed most is something that many of the bad reviews are critiquing - the fact that none of the characters are really ""good"" . This way there is no chance of knowing how it will end. There were no cliché tropes or overused storyline.

It had a novel premise and did not follow the normal boring formula of Hollywood but kept me wondering where it was going to go until the very end.All the 1 / 2 star reviews I assume are from quite simple people who expect films to follow a formulated plot with goodies and baddies where the goodies always win. This is satire!! You are not supposed to like the main character in the slightest!! (Why does that need to be explained?) Does every film have to have a good person as the protagonist? What boring basic films have you been limiting yourself to?Pike is truly the star of the show delivering a deliciously evil character with subtlety and depth. Dinklage I wasn't so keen on, which may have partly been on the less well rounded role he was playing, but it was not so bad as to significantly mar the film.Watch the film and decide for yourself!

I had seen bad reviews but I decided to give it a chance since that often happens (undeservedly) to movies that revolve around women, and because Rosamund and Eiza looked good af. Well, it deserves the bad reviews!
The start was meh, but after the first 10 minutes no part of the plot made any sense! There are way too many stupid plotholes, so many lines that were supposed to be about #GirlPower but end up being plain cringey and ridiculous. The director tried so bad to create a movie in which women are strong and empowered yet failed MISERABLY; the women are just (boring) criminals with poorly written dialogue and that make horrible decisions, but hey, they don't let guys intimidate them because #girlboss am I right?
The acting is okay, the writing/directing is trash. The characters are unlikeable not because they are ""bad guys"", but because they are plain, boring and so unrealistic no amount of ""satire"" could save them. Oh and the implication that ending up on a wheelchair is a punishment and will get you abducted by the goverment? Add ableist to the list!

Are we supposed to be rooting for these two disgusting human beings? As others have mentioned, the story is set up well and things are promising, it seems as though the film is telling the story of these villains and their downfall. Eventually we realise these are our heroes, and we are supposed to find them redeemable in some way. The movie is so confused in how it's characters are portrayed that we find ourselves rooting for a murdering, drug peddling gangster. I attempted to see it from a different perspective, tried to humour that this may have been their intent all along. But it is not all that clever, it portrays them as just 'two women against the world', when in reality they're shallow, narcissistic, thieving psychopaths. The film is deluded enough to believe we are celebrating the moment she pulls herself out of the car from the lake. I'm not sure if there was a single redeemable character at all, the only satisfaction was seeing her bleed out in the last few seconds. Not worth anyone's time.",I Care a Lot

I was going to give it 1 star, but there were moments of promise and some good laughs. But in the end, this movie will never stream to my TV again and I will not recommend it to anyone.

BUT there's some strange reviews here. i've read a lot about the protagonist being depicted as a heroine and the movie being unrealistic and the subject at hand (i.e. the exploitation of the elderly) being disrespected. let's work down the list: (1) nowhere in this movie is Marla depicted as a heroine. she is a despicable character. she's deliberately a shameless opportunist and we're not meant to sympathize with her. if anything, we're meant to wonder how far is she going to go. is she actually going to make it out of this? like watching a ballon walk on a tightrope (kinda). (2) of course the movie is not technically accurate. that clearly wasn't the point of the film to accurately depict the mafia or the issues with exploiting old people. however what the films message was...?...that is indeed muddled. more on that later... (3) i honestly don't know. was the subject of the exploitation of old people handled respectfully.......i would think that it was because nowhere is the scam glamorized. while the movie has a certain ocean's eleven vibe, the ""clever thief"" doesn't win and let's be honest she isn't likable either. overall: the director could have emphasized the nuances and improved the dialogue to clear up the central message of movie. and please don't misunderstand: the central message of a movie is literally the whole point. without it you are left a bit empty and a tad confused to say the least. but is this movie literal doo-doo water?.....i think that's way over exaggerated. we've had worse films guys. especially this year. the worst thing this film did was half-@$$ a meaning. the plot was intriguing (not realistic). marla is money hungry sociopath that's fun to watch (not heroic). and obviously taking advantage of old people isn't bad (the movie never said that it wasn't). anyways..just a rant",I Care a Lot

Empowerment of the elderly!No. Apparently its about a lioness, self made woman, protecting her own. Predator or pray theme. Constant reference to winning. And self sacrifice at the expense of the elderly? How to get what you want and become what you want.Its just all off. The feminist anger and money aspirations dont tie together. She sees old people as a commodity to take advantage of. She uses her position to show that she cares about them. She has cooperation from her wider network. The script and the character development is sub par. It starts of interesting and then wanders off into the woods.The movie is still going. She is magically now a master of disguise? Its like someone threw a series of darts at a wall. Fearless. Lesbian. Crook. Lawyer. Female James Bond, diamonds, cash in care-homes, Russia. Person. Woman. Man. Camera.

If I would have read these reviews first, then I probably wouldn't have watched the movie or watched it with a negative mind set. The main character makes you want to see something bad happen to her because of how cut-throat & heartless she is. Some viewers are also criticizing the fact that the Russian mafia got written into the script, which I like because in reality, you never know who you're messing with. Now, I admit, there are some unbelievable parts in this movie, but what movie don't have that in it? Like I don't understand why the Russian boss wanted her death to look like she was ""drinking & driving?"" Why not just put a bullet in her head, like they did the doctor? The fact that she survived the ""attempted murder"" walked to safety, changed her clothes, got a cab & made it back home ""just in time"" to save her girlfriend as the house blew up is a little far fetched. She played a ruthless, fearless character, which made you want to see her REALLY get hers in the end. She won a Golden Globe award for this movie, which I have to say she deserves it. Anytime an actor/actress can play a part that makes their character so believable that you hate them, then that means they did a good job!! I kinda knew that in real life it wasn't that easy to take over a person's life, put them away & sell or keep all their stuff, but a lot of viewers were taking this ""movie"" & acting like it's real. It's a movie, come on people. All movies go up & beyond the real world, why? Because-it's-a- movie!! Besides all the unreal stuff that happen in this ""movie"" I liked it. The actors were all very believable & it had you rooting for the other bad guys. The older lady who played the Russian boss's mother, played an excellent part (then again, she did win an Oscar 30 years ago). I like how the movie ended. I think the only person you were rooting for received some type of satisfaction.",I Care a Lot

3890,kazuoblues,Wait till the end,8,20 February 2021,"I see a lot of people hated this movie and I can see why. I myself almost quit watching this movie especially when I saw the Russian mob boss played by Peter Dinklage single handedly kidnapped by a main character played by Rosamund Pike.Is this movie realistic? No. Not in that sense. There are lots of things that are not realistic at all about this movie like how a couple of Russian mobs can't kill a character played by Pike successfully (I mean isn't that what they do for living?), or how a doctor would give out confidential information about her patients over and over and not getting caught, etc., etc.And during the whole movie, I was waiting for something terrible to happen to Pike's character for she's so ruthless and relentless, and it made me extremely frustrated that she keeps on getting away with everything. I do admit that she does a great job playing that character and for that I do believe Rosamund Pike deserves her golden glove nomination.But at the end of the movie, it makes you realize that this movie is not about that at all - that is if you can sit through this movie until the end.This movie is not meant to depict realistic scenes of how a ruthless woman came to build a multi million dollar empire by scamming people and take advantage of loopholes in the legal system. Or, it's not meant to depict how bad things catch up to bad people - good versus evil and how good wins in the end, sort of things.A bad thing indeed does happen to Pike's character in the end. But that's only a sub context of this whole movie.Putting aside all the unrealistic depictions of Russian mob, a group of scammers, legal systems, etc., this movie depicts a hard reality of our present day society and irony of it all - that rich can get richer by taking advantage of the less advantaged people. And in the end, it shows that, after all, you do get what you deserve. The irony is how it's brought to Pike's character - who was not afraid of her death - and shows there's no winner or loser (lion versus lamb motif) and that you lose it all in the end after all - and this is why you have to watch it until the end.Sure. There are lots of things that could have been better about this movie. The storyline could have been little more realistic and streamlined. The script could have been little more clever. Some of the characters could have been developed little deeper - particularly Diane Wiest's character (I always liked her acting). In that sense, this movie can make you feel frustrated. And that might be why so many people hated it.If you want a clear cut ""justice will prevail"" kind of movie, don't waste your time. But if you want a glimpse of present day irony in a rather twisted way, you might at least want to sit through this movie until the end because the writer/director J Blakeson delivers it in a rather clever way.",I Care a Lot

Worst then that, its actualy very, very annoying. Maybe thats the only think you don't want your main character to be. It can be hatefull, but not annoying.In the first five minutes the viewer is feeling like this thing should be clarified and justice should be made. It seems quite simple, quite clear that the whole thing its a scheme. But it doesn't heppend, it keeps dragging the whole movie, and its very irritating. You hope the entire movie that the main character will fail and will be beaten, but it doesnt't heppend.And to amplify this annoying irritation, thing just go on her favor in a implausible way. The lawyer can't ask for a different doctor to testify, they can't make the judge understand the whole thing, the judge don't ask to see the elders, the mafia guys can't kill someone.

Interesting and real issues with guardianship and elder abuse are swept aside for the action and thriller components focused on our unlikeable set of main characters. Cool, potentially?Having a sociopath as the main character can be very interesting and I really thought this was going Nightcrawler kind of places where she pushes her limits, things backfire and she develops as a character - but no. Our omnipotent protagonist ends up learning nothing and gets everything she wants, overcomes the russian mafia and bends it to her will in a farcical way.I was waiting for the rug to be pulled from under her feet until the very end but it never came.

Except for Peter Dinklage, everything about this movie feels wrong. The actress can not blink her eyes. I watched her performances in ""pride and prejudice"" and in ""gone baby gone,"" and I ask myself how she even got to be an actress! Her facial expressions do not exist, or I rather say her facial expressions equal those of a psychopath: an emotionless human being; she doesn't blink her eyes. Basically, I'm just stating the obvious: she is not a good actress.
We all know that people on the top of the pyramid, these CEO's and billionaires have no scruples and are evil people who get past everything on their paths to reach their goals. In my opinion, the writer wanted to make the point that people in power are generally evil people with no compassion or empahy. Even if this is true - and I believe it is mostly like this - still, I don't want to see that in movies and have the main characters worshiped for their evil. This is sick, and I'm sick of it.

The film wrongly frames these characters as some sort of hero. Maybe they are trying to say ""be a lioness"" and grab life by the balls; but this is so misguided to even think that such horrible characters can be the model for this half-assed message.I wanted the Russians to maim her, shoot her in the knee caps, chop her fingers off with a bread knife, or just kill her.

Here I will not even discuss the morality of the film, where we are asked to empathize not even with a bank robber or drug dealer, but with a person who deceives helpless old people. The screenwriter of the film knows nothing about the court system, the laws and regulations of guardianship. On what planet has the screenwriter seen such laws? The guardian does not decide how the people she takes care of are treated. Doctors do it! Guardianship is not a general power of attorney. The guardian is prohibited from conducting transactions on behalf of the ward for the alienation of property. No one notary will conduct such transactions. Maybe, just maybe, if the heroine of the film committed such a fraud and immediately ran away, it would make at least some sense. But she does it over and over again and is not afraid of anyone. In fact, law enforcement immediately became interested in the activities of this scammer and criminal. Oh, I'm sorry, a strong and independent woman who apparently received special training as a saboteur, spy, hitman, master of hand-to-hand combat and participated in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.I am so tired of this ordinary garbage dump pouring from the cinema screens.",I Care a Lot

This is not a feel good movie. It is extremely well directed and the actors have done a wonderful job doing complete justice to their characters. You are not supposed to look at Marla as a hero, you just look at her as the protagonist who scams old people by using legal loopholes. Nobody is asking you to root for her.Agreed that there are a few plotholes - drugged woman breaking out of a car, mafia gang not being able to kill a small businesswoman, and the last part where Marla and Russian mafia get into a partnership to remove competition from the guardianship market (which wasn't very well thought through).But, I think the end gave me the cinematic experience I came for. The character from the beginning of the movie (whose mom's life Marla ruined) came full circle to end Marla. It was the life of middle income/upper midle income groups of people she was ruining, they were the most hurt.

This film is a satire of the health care system, a dark comedy denouncing immorality. This film is unpleasant because a certain reality is unpleasant.On June 21, 2020, NY Times headlined ""'They Just Dumped Him Like Trash': Nursing Homes Evict Vulnerable Residents"" and a passage in the article read ""[...] nursing home was telling staff members to try to clear out less-profitable residents to make room for a new class of customers who would generate more revenue: patients with Covid-19."".This story of a scamming legal guardian is just one illustration of the loopholes made possible by an unbridled capitalism where everything is good for making money, even at the expense of the vulnerable, unfortunately.Without apparently understanding the satire, many are shocked by the immorality of the characters. But how many have loved GOT, where people are massacred and women raped, Breaking Bad, which turned a ruthless drug dealer into one of the most beloved TV characters, The Wolf of Wall Street, which shows in a cool way the immorality and greed of an entire system? Or is it shocking because this time the bad guy is a woman, when a woman should be gentle and loving? (it's a woman who writes this).This movie is not perfect at all, and many passages are not realistic, but neither is Die Hard or Mission Impossible. That's not the point I guess.If you are shocked by this movie, I get it, but then go check some articles about healthcare system or how many billion dollars pharmaceutical companies will make with vaccines thanks to a global pandemic.",I Care a Lot

Yes even with Peter Dinklage, if I could have given this movie a lower rating than 1 it would be a negative 5. I am yet another person who purposely created an account just so I could write my first review and try to prevent others from making the mistake of supporting a movie that seems to support elderly abuse. I needed to vent because I'm so outraged that the main character is glorified for ripping off and abusing the elderly. As if its not bad enough in the beginning with her small elderly abuse business, then we have to watch the mafia & Marla create a multimillion dollar business to rip off and abuse even more elderly. I realize the movie totally unrealistic and I know would never happen in real life but its the bad after taste thats left behind that will not be washed away. Her dying in the end is just not enough satisfaction for this monster. While the acting is fine for the most part, characters have no depth. I felt the movie fell apart when they put the grocery bag over one of the stupid mafia guys head at the care home. I was so looking forward to some revenge for all those mistreated elderly victims. I should have read reviews before watching this piece of garbage as now my eyes can never unsee. Is it not bad enough that the elderly in real life are abused or taken advantage of? The only good guys in this movie are the poor elderly victims and this is one of those movies even it if it's cliche that the good guys needed to win. The good guys and the audience really needed revenge. I'm left to feel that everyone who had anything to do with this movie is basically blessing and condoning elderly abuse. Its a complete mockery, and supposedly a comedy.......What?? How could this ever be a comedy?? How is elderly abuse funny? I'm so confused. How does this have a 6.3 rating?",I Care a Lot
4141,staffordhsmith,Uneven and misguided,5,23 February 2021,This film really bothered me as it posed two repugnant grifters who prey on the elderly as righteous feminist icons. The portrayal of the Russian mob was like the Keystone Cops. They botched everything.,I Care a Lot

It misses a redemption, a twist, a salvation. The whole movie I was hating the protagonist and at the end I am far from satisfied.I am lying here with so much frustration build up and no release.

4151,DioBruna,Unconvincing and irritating,1,8 March 2021,"(SPOILER ALERT). If, with a large dose of generosity, one accepts the main subject of the film, then at first one encounters an interesting approach. Unfortunately, it is not exploited at all: a professional con artist chooses the wrong victim. But from maybe the 20th minute on, the plot goes down the toilet. Jennifer hid dark secrets, but her story is not developed at all: they forget about her in the middle of the movie. Peter Dinklage's character is probably the stupidest mobster in movie history and he is surrounded by the most useless employees ever seen. Even the judge is seriously flawed, incapable and just plain stupid. The con artist is at once sociopathic, narcissistic, immortal and all-powerful. Her business is full of loose ends, which the mobsters are incapable of exploiting: if they had extorted the doctor to confess the truth to the judge (or forced a confession in her suicide letter), the film would have ended decently within the first half an hour and I would have used my evening for something else more worthwhile, like watching the spiders on my neighbor's balcony or counting my fingers.

One minute Marla Grayson is a ruthless CEO, the next shes Jason Bourne. Characters were played wildly out of their scope and the story only resolved itself at the very end when she took a .45 to the chest.And lastly... why was she vaping in almost every scene?

However, maybe I miss the point the film tries to make. Or maybe I am not as smart as the writer/director.
But this movie made me really angry all along. Because we are supposed to care about our two protagonists, to be amazed by how cool and smart they are.
But how can we, when they are so dislikable ? They have no empathy, no good judgement, they are literally the worst people of the movie. THEY ROB ELDER PEOPLE AND LOCK THEM UP AGAINST THEIR WILL ! Even the russian mobsters are more likable. And the movie seems to glorify our heroins. To show how brave they are, defying conventions and fighting for their success. ""You are either a lamb or a lion"". REALLY ? Is that what we teach to people today ?
I know there are a lot of other movies like this one, with anti-heroes that we are supposed to like. And I think this one doesn't work because there is no character development. At the beginning, Marla is a bad person. At the end, she is a bad (worst ?) one.
In my opinion, it's a dangerous movie, that rejects empathy ; and I see a lot of young people beginning to idolize Rosamund Pike's character (yes she plays well and that's a waste of her talent) on the social networks. That scares me.
So in conclusion, very VERY disappointed.",I Care a Lot

4191,hopster-09691,Woke Bait & Switch,2,19 February 2021,"Story started out really well and promised good, shallow entertainment , but from there it's just woke garbage; two lesbians - criminals because Muricah Bad - fight Ze RuSsiAnZ ; story ends at about 1 hour in, the rest is just lazy script writing.",I Care a Lot
4192,robhowell-87416,Poor execution,4,20 February 2021,"The concept is original and could be good, however the lead played by Rosamund Pike lacks any conviction at all. Very underwhelming",I Care a Lot
4193,den-83493,Never been this angry with a film,1,3 March 2021,"I wish I read the reviews before watching this. The whole ""strong woman in a man's world"" plot is getting really old. I lost count how many times Pike said ""a woman"" and ""a man"" like the former levitates above the latter.Not to mention that the protagonist of the film couldn't be further from a hero. She is a conman who lies to the dumbest and most gullible judge imaginable to kidnap, imprison and torture an old lady, steal all her money and sell her property. Unlike any normal person, she is completely unphased by the fact that her victim has connections to a gangster who first kills her partner-in-crime and then tries to kill her. Somehow survives all of this and eventually outsmarts the gangsters and comes out a winner.This movie is so frustrating, it just made me angry. The so called ""protagonist"" is the most two dimensional ""ruthless independent woman"", and at no point would a normal human being take her side throughout this nonsense of a story. Do not watch this, if you don't want to be huffing and puffing in frustration for 2 hours.",I Care a Lot

4195,berkgese,Absolute Fiasco,1,16 March 2021,"Just with the aim of being different and original, poorly written scenario and unplanned progress of the story made me regret my decision of watching it. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they want to waste their hours and movie appetite.",I Care a Lot
4196,Eric_Vaughan,"It kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but in your brain. Very disappointing.",1,13 March 2021,"I actually watched this Movie because I saw an Instagram post by Joe Rogan (I don't know if he was paid to post it, or just has poor taste), and honestly the first half of the movie was quite good and afterward it just spiralled into absolute garbage! An utter waste of my time. Judging by the way the movie started out, it really had good potential on which they could've built on, but rather decided to just squander it.",I Care a Lot
4197,alondrahdz-02157,I don't care a lot,1,22 February 2021,"Watch it if you want to get mad. Main character should have suffered more. I was waiting to see the ""russian"" mafia do something better but watching the guy from the beginning get revenge will have to suffice.",I Care a Lot

From the very beginning, above all else, someone basically kidnaps the mother of a mob boss and nothing happens? The entire story went around and around in circles. The actors were great, but the writing was 👎",I Care a Lot
4204,davo21,"Slow, shallow, lame soundtrack, poor editing... bad!",5,22 February 2021,"The five stars goes to Peter and Diane, everything else sucks. The script is poor, you don't feel any love for the characters, many things are just odd. The music is so terrible it feels like a cheap low budget movie from the 90s.

I mean seriously???",I Care a Lot
4206,emileemarieolson,Had me engaged throughout,8,21 February 2021,"I love movies liked ""I Care a Lot."" The storyline was fresh and new, and also something I haven't seen before in ""thriller"" and "" thriller"" adjacent movies. The movie's topics are raw and real, and make us take pause and think about how we treat (or plan on treating) our elders.Rosamund Pike gave her all, as well as the supporting cast. There wasn't a minute in this film that I thought felt fabricated.I really appreciated and liked how everyone involved in the care process for the elderly had some screen time.Even if the plot was shallow, I still enjoyed this film's new perspective on life. Does it end at the care facilities when we younger generations deem it, or do we truly listen to our elders when they're ready? I like how this film challenges all of us. Do we pawn off our elderly into some stranger's care, or do we take a pro active role into their end of life care?",I Care a Lot
4207,berenger_brillante,I was more rooting for Thanos than the protagonists.,1,11 March 2021,"Seriously, this movie desperately tries to make us rooting for the main character for an hour but I was more rooting for Thanos halving the universe than Marla and Frankie.",I Care a Lot
4208,eimanshka,No thank you,2,20 February 2021,This is just a no no. I was excited to watch it as it looked great but was disappointed. The storyline is just unrealistic and annoying. This has potential to be a great movie but they ruined it,I Care a Lot

I was surprised that the ""first end"" was still kind of satisfying for me. The real end... it was surprising and I really hoped to see that guy again. And he showed up. And it felt good. Damn, writing this, doesn't feel right.
You see, my feelings are so struggling, this means, this movie was really good. It held it's promise. But still... there are no good guys. You have to live with it.",I Care a Lot

It's a movie with a good cast but a story line that will make you see red.... if you care a lot of course. In fact you'll want most of the characters to meet a painful end.That said, i enjoyed it so make your own mind up and understand that not all movies are feel good (which i'm sure most people get but not the ones that rated this film 1 star). If you like fairytales and princess' don't watch!",I Care a Lot

4220,beckicombs,What an awful movie!,1,23 February 2021,I had hopes that it was going to be better. The protagonist is a horrible person and totally unlikeable. I agree with the other reviews - Netflix has started to develop some hideous stuff.,I Care a Lot
4221,emohamad-09021,Incredibly bad script,3,21 March 2021,Each movie requires some suspension of disbelief. The story here requires the viewer to suspend more disbelief than all science fiction movies ever made blended together into a tasteless lukewarm soup. The main antiheroine is such a monstrously overinflated character that anyone who could believe her actions needs to be put into a care home and assigned a guardian. Terrible waste of time if not for the quality of the actors. Do not qaste your time.,I Care a Lot
