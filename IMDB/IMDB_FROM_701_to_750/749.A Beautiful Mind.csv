0,MartinHafer,Moving but overrated...,8,11 July 2011,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I'd say more, but I don't want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash's mental illness--something he's struggled with for many years.I enjoyed ""A Beautiful Mind"". It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it's SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man's life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn't particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe's accent. I don't know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia.",A Beautiful Mind
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Admirable and extremely well made, if just missing the mark of a ""great"" film",7,24 June 2017,"'A Beautiful Mind' had a lot going for it. An intriguing story based on an interesting man, a great cast full of talented actors, the involvement of James Horner and Roger Deakins (perhaps one of the best modern cinematographers in the business) and Ron Howard as director (a very competent director with some great films under his belt, directing always with a lot of quality and polish if not always distinction).Finally seeing it, always wanting to but never quite having the time, 'A Beautiful Mind' was to me a good, often very good, film, if not quite great. Of its four Oscar wins, Connelly and adapted screenplay (on the most part) were worthy wins, though there were better contenders in the Best Picture and Director categories, 'Fellowship of the Ring' for Best Picture and David Lynch for 'Mulholland Drive' for director. Again, from personal opinion, 'A Beautiful Mind's' Oscar nominations were worthier of wins generally, especially Russell Crowe for Best Picture, make-up and the film editing, cinematography also should have been under serious consideration.There are a few things that stop 'A Beautiful Mind' from being great. Pacing can be messy, feeling rushed in some spots and then dragging in others. Admittedly though there were other places where it was perfect.Do agree with the portrayal of schizophrenia being problematic, it is a sensitive and courageous subject to address but those with schizophrenia and mental illness in general will find problems with how it's portrayed. It is a complex and often frightening illness, that the film tries to take seriously and sensitively, but it just felt too clean and like it was being careful not to offend but ended up being too careful. Other aspects are heavy-handed.The espionage subplot was intriguing mostly and gave some powerful conflict, at the same time parts not quite gelling with the rest of the film and feeling a little confused.However, 'A Beautiful Mind' for want of a better word looks absolutely beautiful. The cinematography with the vibrant colours and seamless fluidity was one of the best of its year, and the period detail remarkably evocative and a joy to look at. James Horner's score has garnered mixed views, mostly leaning on the positive, personally though it added a lot to the emotional power of the film, swelled thrillingly and was beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, didn't think it was melodramatic at all.'A Beautiful Mind's' adapted screenplay really makes one think while also capturing a wide range of emotions, more than making up for the lack of accuracy. The story is compelling on the most part with a spot on portrayal of mathematics, something that was praised by the maths community at the time including John Nash. It is very moving and uplifting, many scenes dealt with powerfully.Ron Howard's direction is some of the best he's done. As ever from him it is rich in quality and polish but it also is some of his most distinguished and shows that he can direct with distinction (even if he doesn't always elsewhere.Can't praise the cast enough, along with the visuals it is the best aspect of the film. It is impossible to find fault with the powerhouse and perhaps career best performance of Russell Crowe, while Jennifer Connelly is touching in a loyal and sympathetically written role (even if not as challenging as a few of her other roles such as in 'Requiem for a Dream'.Ed Harris is chillingly malevolent, while the rarely less than game Paul Bettany and Adam Goldberg charm and Judd Hirsch and Christopher Plummer also not putting a foot wrong.In conclusion, admirable and extremely well made, directed and acted with a sizeable range of emotions, if missing the mark of being a ""great"" film instead of a good and often very good film and not doing enough justice to a great man and his life. The divisiveness is understandable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",A Beautiful Mind
2,Leofwine_draca,An interesting portrayal,6,1 December 2020,"An interesting real-life biopic of mathematic genius John Nash, a man who won the Nobel prize but whose genius cost him his sanity. This is handled in a mature and sensitive way by Ron Howard, although it does veer into sentimentality in the typical Hollywood way and it does have a maudlin feel to it at times. Nash's story is an engaging one and he's certainly an interesting figure, tragic in many respects; Russell Crowe's casting is miles away from the macho persona he's best known for but he's surprisingly sensitive in the part. My favourite element is the handling of Nash's mental health issues, which are portrayed in an exciting, thriller-like way.",A Beautiful Mind
3,SnoopyStyle,Russell Crowe proves his acting versatility,8,22 February 2014,"This movie starts in 1947 Princeton where John Nash (Russell Crowe) is trying to start his career. He is not impressed with anybody else there, and searches for an original idea. He is awkward and very peculiar. Then one night at a bar, a tall blonde and her friends walk in. It gives him an idea to overturn Adam Smith's theory. This allows him a placement in the Wheeler Labs in MIT. Years later working at MIT, he meets student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) who would eventually become his wife, and the mysterious William Parcher (Ed Harris) from the DOD.Russell Crowe has been a leading man for awhile but this one proves once and for all his versatility. He is amazing throughout giving a praise worthy performance. Jennifer Connelly makes a great entrance as she shows her brains as well as her beauty. Director Ron Howard is spot on with this movie. He allows Crowe the space to lead. It's a very human character. It's the best picture Oscar winner for a good reason.",A Beautiful Mind
4,Hitchcoc,A great character study.,9,10 March 2006,"Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation. You look for the evidence, not the word. The direction takes us on a journey that hasn't been done before.",A Beautiful Mind
5,Prismark10,Number crunching,4,24 May 2015,"I first watched this film when it had an advanced preview before its wide release. I liked the film but it did not feel it was a Best Picture Oscar winner and I believe screenwriter Akiva Goldsman is a hack of the worst kind. Well he did write Batman & Robin and here explains 'Game Theory' in terms of picking women up at bars which should had been enough to disqualify him for an Oscar win.Over the years the film's disparity with actual true events has been an issue with a lot of people. The trouble is nearly all films tend to be fictionalised for dramatic effect and A Beautiful Mind I guess is no better or worse but to me felt like a film loosely based on some true facts.I recently re-watched the film and planned to review it. The death of John and Alicia Nash in a traffic accident focused my mind on the review.What I took away from my reviewing of A Beautiful Mind was Nash as played by Russell Crowe being surprised by the varied use of the Game Theory principles in the world of commerce. It makes the hackneyed attempt to explain this theory by Goldsman make it look even more inept. I actually find myself thinking of how Game Theory applies in real life with things like sport rights television auctions.Once upon a time one channel would buy up exclusive rights to soccer. A winner take all attitude which presumably led to underhand tactics such as bribery.Now you have packages sold to various TV channels, which means several channels in one country will show live soccer at different times and days with another channel having highlights and the soccer authorities maximising their revenue. The poor punter gets even more poorer though having to pay more in subscription payments!On the weekend that Nash died I even thought if Game Theory could apply in things like peace talks. Were the South African Truth and Reconciliation hearings just another application of Game Theory put in practice?A Beautiful Mind kind of overlooks the most important part Nash work and really places it as a footnote.What we have is Russell Crowe playing the most muscular, dull/shy Ivy league mathematician you will ever get to meet in a film whose depiction of mental illness borrows heavily from the hit movie released several years earlier, The Sixth Sense.You kind of lulled into a false sense of security before you are hit in the gut with a sucker punch, but eh, this is a film of a man who suffered from mental illness. I saw the punch coming.You then see Nash regaining his self, his worth and his wife. He returns to academia and gains academic acceptance with a Noble prize.The film is watchable, there are some nice flourishes put in by Ron Howard the director but it feels less substantial than its critical acclaim suggests which includes an Oscar for best picture.A Beautiful Mind is a picture of a man where they give you the biography but miss out on his thinking.",A Beautiful Mind
6,classicsoncall,"""I can work it all out. All I need is time.""",8,11 November 2017,"You'll recall the scene in the movie when John Nash (Russell Crowe) is given an initial tour of Wheeler Labs, and he questions the presence of Big Brother watching from an elevated catwalk above the main floor. A hint to the viewer that what Nash is experiencing occurs later in the picture when William Parcher (Ed Harris) meets Nash for the first time, and refers to himself as 'Big Brother'. If in fact Parcher was a real person, it's doubtful that anyone at Wheeler would have revealed Nash's observation to him. That's what struck me the first time I saw this film and then again when I watched it once more this morning.Well, like a lot of movies based on a true story that I initially find compelling and worthy of the highest rating here on IMDb, I'm left frustratingly disappointed that the screenplay distorts the facts in order to give the most appealing impression possible to the viewer. The main one here was Nash's relationship with wife Alicia, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly. Their first marriage only survived for three years before his schizophrenia drove them apart, resentful over the fact that she had him involuntarily committed. Their romantic relationship then rekindled after he won the Nobel Prize, and well after his mental illness had subsided.What I liked about Crowe's portrayal of Nash was the way he came to grips with his delusions and later treated them with a dose of good humor - ""There's no point in being nuts if you can't have a little fun"" is what he stated to his friend Sol (Adam Goldberg) when he came to visit. Later on, reinstated as a teaching professor at Princeton, he self assuredly asked a student to verify the presence of a 'new person' he hadn't seen before. Those subtle instances helped reestablish Nash as someone who recognized that he was mentally ill, and that he needed to control his health with the proper medication.For anyone dealing with mental illness within their own family, I think this film can be an eye opener about the fear and hopelessness that the sick person experiences. I state that from a personal perspective having observed now adult children going through the pain and embarrassment of delusional fantasies that at times became downright scary. In that regard, the movie presents a reasonable perspective that illnesses like schizophrenia can be treated with the proper attention, a dedicated medical provider, and the correctly prescribed medication. I've seen it happen more than once.",A Beautiful Mind
7,gavin6942,Russell Crowe Can Act?,7,16 February 2015,"After a brilliant but asocial mathematician (Russell Crowe) accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish.I was sold when Nash began expounding on Adam Smith, and how everyone acting in their own self-interest works best for all. Effectively, he made a good argument for price fixing... only applied to dating. His thoughts on game theory are pretty incredible.The story gets more interesting as Nash gets more mentally ill. It is in many ways a precursor to ""The Imitation Game"" (2014), and both are excellent films about mathematicians. Maybe not a great double feature, but excellent for comparison.",A Beautiful Mind
8,lee_eisenberg,a beautiful movie,8,6 July 2005,"Prior to ""A Beautiful Mind"" coming out, I had never heard of John Nash. Then, this movie blew me away. While most critics panned it, the viewer gets completely absorbed by every performance. Russell Crowe does an excellent job as Nash, starting out with his days as a student at Princeton. As the movie progresses, we see his schizophrenia evolve. His wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) is virtually the only person who can understand him.""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those movies where you are surprised as you learn various things about the characters. Also, maybe the movie's timing might have helped it. After September 11, 2001, we needed something to show us that human nature is not inherently evil. This movie, released a few months later, did a great job reminding us of that. All in all, I consider it very appropriate that this movie finally got Ron Howard a Best Picture winner (plus a Best Director Oscar). Never preachy or sappy, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a beautiful movie, and Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly probably played their best roles ever.",A Beautiful Mind
9,jboothmillard,A Beautiful Mind,6,20 June 2006,"First time I saw the film I thought it was brilliant, seeing it a second time I can understand reasons the critics give it three stars, but it is still very enjoyable, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ron Howard (Splash, The Da Vinci Code). Basically, John Nash (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Russell Crowe, he lost to Denzel Washington in Training Day) is a maths genius at Prinecton University who can solve complicated equations, codes and theories. He can't find good use for his skills, so he becomes a teacher, and he falls for one of his students, Alicia Nash (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jennifer Connelly), who he also marries and has a child with. He is met by William Parcher (Ed Harris) who gets him working for the government breaking Soviet codes and getting involved in a big conspiracy plot. Alicia becomes concerned for John though and calls Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) to have a talk with him, and that is when we the audience, and soon John himself, realises he has paranoid schizophrenia. So John knows that Parcher, his university roommate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and his niece are all unreal people who only he can see, and he really struggles to get on with them in his life, causing terrible distress for Alicia. As the years go by he has learnt to ignore them, he returns to Princeton, and his academic success wins him the Nobel Prize for economics. Also starring Adam Goldberg as Sol, Judd Hirsch as Helinger, Josh Lucas as Hansen, Anthony Rapp as Bender and Austin Pendleton as Thomas King. Crowe does very well as the lead character, Connelly of course steals the show with her award-winning performance, and the support of Harris and Bettany are good, it is a film that desires people to take it seriously, but still very worthwhile. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music, Original Score for James Horner, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Russell Crowe was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Paul Bettany was number 40 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Good!",A Beautiful Mind
10,ccthemovieman-1,Crowe Does It Again!,9,1 February 2006,"The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show ""Monk"" has become.Crowe's character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as ""Monk,"" but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn't have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's ""Cinderella Man.""For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning.",A Beautiful Mind
11,rmax304823,Not bad,6,7 January 2003,"For generations people on the street have believed that ""genius is linked to insanity"" and for generations psychiatrists have denied that there was any connection. John Nash is one of the reasons the belief is popular. He suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Unlike major mood disorders (depression, mania) it tends not to come and go -- just to come and hang around. It's a devastating disease, affecting as it does the very organ that makes us what we are. And the side effects of treatment are not to be lightly dismissed.John Nash was a very lucky guy. His search for patterns is rather typical, but his finding REAL ones, that is patterns that exist outside his own mind, is unusual. The surprising thing about his case is not that he recovered but that over the years he managed to climb out of the abyss and find a position with which he felt comfortable. Insofar as this is a success story, it's pretty unusual.Ron Howard belongs to a group of relatively young directors -- Penny Marshall, James Brooks, Rob Reiner are some others -- that tend to take on stories that aren't excessively demanding or quirky. There may be troubles, but the endings are uplifting or heartwarming. This is that kind of story. It follows the trajectory we associate with sports biographies. Hero shows early promise, is struck down by demons during his career, overcomes demons and is apotheosized. That's pretty much the case here. Nash's winning the Nobel is kind of like Redford hitting that final game-saving home run in ""The Natural."" Like Einstein, Nash was awarded the prize for work he'd done earlier in his life. Math and physics are tricky fields. If you haven't made it by the time you're thirty, you're out of the game.But if the story isn't especially uncommon some other things about the movie are. The integration of Nash's hallucinations with his ""real"" experiences. This is always tough to do on screen. The fantasy figures in ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" are both frighteningly unreal and obvious. But here the viewer doesn't find out until the movie is half over that some of the characters he's gotten to know are productions of Nash's mind. And they're warm and comforting too, we can can understand their appeal. Once or twice they are a bit ""overlogical"" too. When his wife is trying to leave him, Nash hallucinates a little girl he'd first seen years ago, realizes that she hasn't grown any older, and that she therefore isn't real. Hallucinations don't work in such a reasonable manner. That's the kind of insight that a screenwriter might dream up. The movie also is a bit weak in conveying the kind of deterioration in personal care that accompanies schizophrenia. Most patients aren't pretty. They are suffering and it shows in their bad teeth, their mismatched clothes, and carelessly groomed hair.Still, within these limits, the movie is pretty good, the acting especially. It's easy to gain praise for playing the role of a deviant. You can win awards for it (cf., ""Charlie,"" ""Rain Man,"" et al.) But for the first time, Russell Crowe does a fine job of suggesting a genuine personality behind that dimly comprehending physical bulk. He actually comes up with a real performance as the young Nash. And it only improves as he gets older. One of the long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs is a set of twitchy movements called tardive dyskinesia. A good example of this is given after his return to Princeton, when he waddles along the campus and some kids mimic him from behind and laugh. (Ron Howard had the good taste not to turn incidents like this into moments of heartbreaking, tearjerking, hankywetting, blubbering, lachrymos pathos. Some directors would have done exactly that.)There is also the case of Jennifer Connoly. (Wow.) She's hardly recognizable as the innocent, open-lipped waif that she was in, say, ""Hot Spot."" She's a full-blown woman now, her face filled out and her jaw somewhat hardened, although she has the same girlish voice. Like Brooke Shields she has changed over the years from an adolescent of Kewpie-doll beauty whom any normal man would want to squeeze and bite into a more mature but still strikingly beautiful creature. It's hard to tell whether she is much of an actress. She hasn't had any truly challenging roles. Her movements are languid. They flow like silk. That could be a limitation.Well, see this movie. You may think you've had it bad, but Nash had it worse. For most of us, alas, there is not much of a Prize at the end.",A Beautiful Mind
12,moonspinner55,"Though designed to be prestigious, the beauty does manage to come through",7,20 July 2007,"Academy Award winner for Best Picture begins at Princeton, 1947, where mathematician John Nash (played by Russell Crowe) is flailing away at an economics theory while all his male classmates just want to get laid (the film equates the average Princeton male to the type of guys usually found on TV's ""Happy Days""). Five years later, Nash is working with the Pentagon on numerical formation patterns and appears to be pulled into a conspiracy plot to thwart the Russians from detonating their H-Bomb on American soil. It isn't surprising that ""A Beautiful Mind"" won the Oscar; it has been designed specifically for prestige (i.e., awards). However, it's a sentimental, dramatic package which gives its time-worn movie theme--mental illness--a few new twists courtesy screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, adapting Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Forbes Nash Jr. (the Academy normally frowns upon edgy concepts, yet this one has an old-fashioned set-up, which they welcome, plus a lead performance preconceived to be a triumph). After a rocky first hour, the picture does improve. Howard methodically sets up the plot mechanisms, but gives us a fascinating main character who is disconnected, a failure at social interaction, and a really bad first date. Nash's future-wife (Jennifer Connelly) isn't particularly intriguing or enchanting (she has dim thoughts, such as ""God must be a painter, why else would there be so many colors?""). Still, by the second act, Nash's personal crisis has become more clear to us, more involving and gripping, and Crowe isn't so much deliberately one-note as he is intensely focused (the actorly tics come later...and, when they do, they are almost endearing). The film has that slick look of ""grand entertainment"" that makes critics bow their heads, yet there are indeed miraculous moments: Nash neglecting to take his medicine and discovering an entire covert operation going down in his backyard shed; Nash, recuperating, riding his bicycle in an infinity pattern, scribbling numbers in the air with his finger. The mental institution stuff is the cinematic equivalent of treading water (and wastes Christopher Plummer as a doctor), but the last half of the film is quite good: a brilliant but disturbed professor working his damnedest to overcome his demons, helped along by a loving woman and receiving the kind of respect he never dreamed of. Howard isn't always graceful or sensitive (especially in the electric shock sequence), but he does resurrect a tired genre and ultimately makes it a moving experience. *** from ****",A Beautiful Mind
13,Quinoa1984,A Splendid job turned in by Crowe and Howard,8,25 December 2001,"Ron Howard brings forth one of his best and most serious films to date, A Beautiful Mind.  It examines a mathematical wizard named John Forbes Nash Jr. who created a discovery in game theory that is still used today for a number of things.  But the film isn't so much about math (what film is?) as it is about the man's struggles with a disease in his mind that drives him to madness yet somehow is able to try and fight it to the best of his abilities, which aren't always as high as they could be.  This man is played by Russell Crowe who gives another top shelve performance to add with The Insider, L.A. Confidential and Romper Stomper (Gladiator I don't really count as a top shelve performance), and he plays Mr. Nash so well it doesn't need to be thought that he's immitating him as much as being him. 
Crowe's Nash starts off in the film at Princeton university where he wants to distinguish himself with an original idea and soon comes up with one that defies 150 years of mathematical practice.  Things look good, especially since he starts dating a graduate student (Jennifer Connelly in an Oscar caliber performance to be sure) who is smitten with him.  But then things start to get troublesome- Nash is asked by a member of the defense depot to break codes that could be in newspapers, magazines, etc to help out the government.  Soon he feels paranoid the Russians are after him, and this leads him into a mental hospital (under Christopher Plummer's care) where he learns the entire consipracy is in his head (schitzophrenia).  Then the plot thickens as Nash battles with his disease, medication or not.Sometimes it's almost too much, but Howard delivers overall a great and compelling tale throughout nevertheless and Crowe shines (the rest of the cast, real or not, are also quite credible) with all the talent he has.

15,wes-connors,You Do the Math,8,23 December 2008,"By the time Russell Crowe (as John Nash) married Jennifer Connelly (as Alicia), I had serious concerns about ""A Beautiful Mind"". My first question revolved around Mr. Crowe's Princeton roommate, Paul Bettany (as Charles). I could not understand why Mr. Bettany did not pal around with the college bar crowd. Crowe was there, with a group of other students, but no mixing with Bettany. Why? Obviously, Bettany loved to imbibe; so, he should have been the life of the party, I thought. With that question nagging me, I continued to have questions. Like was up with the two men at the later party? I wondered Then, the final straw - Crowe uses his secret ""code"" to open a security gate; and, the gate swings open without closing behind him. This was not a very secure gate. Anyone wanting to gain admittance would only have to wait for Crowe to open it up, and walk in after him (if not climb in ahead of him). And, why wasn't Bettany at the Crowe's wedding? Just when I was wondering how to get in touch with director Ron Howard, the truth dawned on me. I was expecting a more traditional film. A couple of surreal moments should have tipped me off; for example, Crowe's barroom deduction concerning the students' chances of ""picking up"" a blonde women. Still, I didn't fully appreciate what was going on. Was the rollicking car chase with Ed Harris (as Parcher) supposed to be an illusion? Then, I wondered about the characters ""Charles"" and ""Marcee"". I understood ""Parcher"" as a manifestation of ""cold war"" paranoia. But, I do not understand what, precisely, ""Charles"" and ""Marcee"" reveal about the title character, other than a propensity for creating illusions. The three imaginary characters are the most important in Nash's life - maybe if I knew what they were around for, they'd go away. Eventually, the film confirms suspicions. I can almost see clearly now.******** A Beautiful Mind (2001) Ron Howard ~ Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany",A Beautiful Mind
16,sunwarrior13,Russell Crowe's Acting Is One Reason To See A Beautiful Mind,10,21 September 2012,"A Beautiful Mind is a biographical film based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics.The movie stars Russell Crowe as Nash together with Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer. It was inspired by a bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-nominated book of the same title by Sylvia Nasar.The film was directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman.John Forbes Nash Jr. is brilliant but an arrogant and conceited professor.He seems guaranteed a rosy future in the early '50s after he marries beautiful student Alicia and makes a remarkable advancement in the foundations of ""game theory"" which carries him to the brink of international acclaim. Soon after, John is visited by Agent William Parcher, from the CIA, who wants to recruit him for code-breaking activities. But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are cloudy at best as he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity. Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Battling decades of illness with the loyal Alicia by his side, Nash is ultimately able to gain some control over his mental state, and eventually goes on to triumphantly win the Nobel Prize.Director Ron Howard has created a moving masterpiece, elegantly guiding the audience through John Forbes Nash Jr.'s life as it shows the triumph and tragedy of life, as well as the beauty of the human spirit to overcome and survive.Also,it one significant movie since it is uplifting, thought-provoking, and emotionally devastating look on both a love story and mental illness.And most of all,it is beautifully acted particularly by Connelly and Crowe,who completely disappears into the character of Nash which is one reason alone why this is a for highly recommended viewing.",A Beautiful Mind

19,hitchcockthelegend,"John Nash, schizophrenic genius.",8,5 April 2009,"John Nash is something of a mathematical wizard. Constantly searching for something with which to make his name, he finds his calling by code breaking for the government. But with that comes a sense of paranoia and pretty soon John is sliding desperately into schizophrenia.There is a school of thought that says any decent film about the mentally ill or afflicted is a sure fire way to attract the awards givers. Personally it bothers me that it bothers me that people view these films in this demeaning manner. If a story is worth telling then lets get it out there for all to see. Would the cinema world and all those stuffy film lovers really be happy if film makers didn't tell these remarkable stories? A Beautiful Mind is one such picture that divides opinions, although exemplary made and well put together, it doesn't adhere quite to the facts of Nash's life-it's an interpretation that smooths out the drama by way of delivering a safe and watchable biography. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning four for Best Film, Best Director {Ron Howard}, Best Supporting Actress {Jennifer Connelly} and Best Adapted Screenplay {Akiva Goldsman adapting from the book by Sylvia Nash}. Yet as great as that roll call is, the big surprise is the omission of a win for Russell Crowe in the Best Actor category. For as tidy and engrossing as the film is, and it is folks, it's because of the big Kiwi that the film breaks free of your standard emotional heart tugger. It's a superlative performance from Crowe and him not winning is probably more to do with his much publicised dust up at the BAFTAS a few weeks before the Oscar ceremony: than his undoubted acting ability.The film as a whole should not be viewed as a representation of John Nash's life, many important things from Sylvia Nash's book have been omitted. But crucially it's important to note that in making this film, the makers have brought Nobel Prize winner Nash to the public's attention, whilst simultaneously giving awareness to the sadness of those suffering with schizophrenia. OK, so it's far from perfect in its portrayal of Nash the man, but ultimately the cinematic world is a far better place when the likes of A Beautiful Mind are being made and the film lovers are flocking to see it. And then some. 8/10",A Beautiful Mind
20,Theo Robertson,Well Made But Lacks Integrity,6,26 September 2005,"!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!Ron Howard's A BEAUTIFUL MIND shares something in common with SLEEPERS , PAPILLION and THE EXCORCISM OF EMILY ROSE in that it claims to be a true story but when you stop to examine the truth you realise that it's not really a true story at all . Perhaps I'm being unfair in comparing it to the aforementioned because in reality the story is similar to Oliver Stone's adaptation of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS in that the source material is based upon a real character but the film invents it's own version of reality Professor John Nash was a mathematical genius but he was also a bi-sexual and a rabid anti- Semite , you wouldn't know this from seeing Akiva Goldsman screenplay where he's deeply in love with Alicia . I guess centering a story around a romantic subplot adds to the film's commercial appeal , never let truth get in the way of good box office . Unfortunately the producers decide to introduce an espionage subplot where it's revealed later on is part of a schizophrenic delusion suffered by Nash . This subplot is very insulting to anyone with any knowledge or experience of schizophrenia because the victim wouldn't suffer the type of delusions seen here . He would suffer from things like abstract signals where the television would try to contact him etc , a schizophrenic wouldn't find himself meeting mysterious men in black or finding himself with a room mate who is part of his imagination etc There are somethings that make Howard's film worth seeing , things like Crowe's performance which might have won him an Oscar if it wasn't down to Academy politics . Connelly's award for best supporting actress was well deserved as was James Horner's nomination for score though perhaps Ed Harris might be upset about not being nominated for best supporting actor . I have to be honest and say that despite director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman making an interesting movie about mathematics neither of them deserved the Oscar that year . Best director and best adapted screenplay should have gone to FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING along with the Oscar for best picture And remember if you want to know about the real John Nash please read Sylvia Nasar's biography and ignore this Hollywood version",A Beautiful Mind
21,jotix100,A crazy genius,9,18 January 2002,"Ron Howard has given us a film that's so different from the formula-oriented fare we receive from Hollywood, that this film, although studio born and bred, plays very much as an independent film. The madness of John Nash is approached by the director, and the writer, Akiva Goldsman, with great honesty and restraint. The production has a look that tells us we are seeing the events in the life of this crazy mathematician as it really happened. Nothing seems to be out of place here with the right touch of atmospheric detail in showing the past, when Mr. Nash went from being an up and coming star in Princeton to his being selected for the Nobel prize in 1994, with enough time going into the schizophrenia that almost ruined his academic life, as well as his own marriage.Russell Crowe plays this tormented soul with utter understanding of the man he is portraying. At no time does he strike a false note or gets too carried away with his own acting. That shows a firm hand by Mr. Howard, whose command seems to be behind every shot of this film. Ed Harris is one of the best actors around and let no one tell you otherwise. He expresses so much with the simplest gestures any actor can make. His kind of acting is seamless from film to film. Here he gives a great and understated performance as the man in John Nash's nightmares and make-believe world.The biggest surprise though, is Jennifer Connelly. She demonstrates here as well as in previous work, mainly her previous work in Requiem of a Dream, that she is in a league of her own. She's that rare breed of actresses that go from film to film acting in roles that she disappears into without any fanfare or hype. Congratulations to Mr. Howard for this film.",A Beautiful Mind
22,preppy-3,Well-acted but dull,5,4 February 2002,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**  True story about John Forbes Nash Jr. (Russell Crowe), a brilliant mathematician, and his struggles with schizophrenia. Well-acted by Crowe, Jennifer Connelly (as his wife), Ed Harris (as a government agent) and Paul Bettany (as a college roommate) but dull dull dull!!!  It's needleslly long (over 2 hours), very slow and I had a hard time staying awake.  A few people walked out after about an hour--I wish I had joined them.  This movie purports to be a true story.  It isn't.  They make Nash into a saint-like character.  In real life he cheated on his wife (with women AND men), was addicted to drugs and divorced her.  All this is left out of the movie to make him more acceptable for mainstream audiences.  Basically though, they're lying.  They end up making his character boring.  Only Crowe's acting gives his character any depth.  The film just moves at a turtle's pace with characters talking and talking and talking endlessly about boring subjects (the schizophrenia doesn't kick in until after an hour).  Only the acting is good.  Anyways, this film was made for only one reason--to win Oscars.  It has a very cold, calculated feel about it.  Everybody looks perfect, everything looks beautiful, there's a big lush musical score, the schizophrenia is presented tastefully--nothing to offend anybody.  That is the type of film that wins Oscars--sadly this cleaned up at the Golden Globes so the Oscars might happen.  It's just annoying that this movie says it's all about schizophrenia and trying to make the public aware of it, when it's actually all about winning awards and nothing more.    Predictable, boring and calculating.  Avoid.",A Beautiful Mind

24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Extraordinary,8,15 October 2009,"I have not read the book, and I had not even heard of the people it revolves around. Therefore I cannot compare the events depicted with reality, though I understand that this takes liberties, and allows itself a lot of dramatic license. I have wanted to watch this for as long as I have known it existed. When I finally got a chance to, I was delighted to find that it was every bit as amazing as I had hoped. I will not reveal a lot of the plot... and I urge you, if you do not know much about Nash or what happens in this, *please* do what you can to keep it that way until you have seen this. What I will say is that the protagonist here is a mathematical genius. The acting is simply astonishing. I would list the superb performers, but I'd wind up including everyone. They are simply flawless. Two that must not go unmentioned are Russell and Connelly, both of whom deliver a powerful and unforgettable portrayal of their respective roles. The characters are well-written and credible. This is impeccably well-written and psychologically accurate. The plot is interesting and develops marvelously throughout. I could not take my eyes off this for a single moment at any point. The pacing is spot-on. This is brilliantly directed, though I cannot specify why without spoiling it, and I intend this, as all my reviews, to be open to anyone. If you are not certain what I am referring to after a viewing, feel free to contact me and I will tell you. The music is excellent and fitting. This has incredible production values, and deserves every award it won. There is some rather disturbing content, a little violence and occasional, moderately strong language. The 2-Disc Award Edition DVD comes with 2 interesting and funny commentary tracks(one with Howard, the other with Goldsman), 27 minutes of deleted(at times incomplete) scenes with optional thoughts by Ron, various informational featurettes(four of which have pages here on the site, and I will review them separately), footage of the receiving of prizes, a theatrical trailer and a commercial for the soundtrack. I recommend this to anyone who can handle what I've just described as being in this film, and who is mature enough to appreciate it. 8/10",A Beautiful Mind
25,view_and_review,Beautifully done,8,9 June 2007,"You know, I haven't seen ""Gladiator"" yet, and I honestly don't know why. I have seen this movie as well as ""Cinderella Man"", and Russell Crow has this acting thing down. I'm a sucker for biopics as it is, but honestly Ron Howard did a great job directing and Russell Crow did an equally great job acting. The story was touching. John Nash (Russell Crow), ironically enough, was incredibly brilliant, but he also suffered from hallucinations. He was stuck in a difficult quandary: he could take his medication which would suppress his illness and effectively erase his identity, which was his brilliant mind. Or, he could refuse his medication and keep his superiorly sharp mind, but also risk his sanity. Just being afflicted with the illness and having to succumb to it would have been a story in itself, but Nash actually living with the illness without taking inhibitors made his story that much more spectacular. He made a daring bold move to deal with his condition without the aide of his medication so that he wouldn't be without what made him -him. In fact, he proved what a powerful mind he had to deal with the hallucinations and still continue to operate normally. This was truly a wonderful story about a beautiful mind.",A Beautiful Mind
26,evanston_dad,Ron Howard Movies Are Sooooooo Uninteresting,4,23 July 2010,"Maudlin, paint-by-numbers biopic about math whiz John Nash that makes mental illness and marital strife look as pretty as a magazine cover.Russell Crowe does give a good performance, I'll give the film that, but I wonder how much better a performance he could have given if under the guidance of a more interesting director than Ron Howard. Every Howard movie I see makes me feel like -- no matter what the subject matter -- he's determined to create a movie that would be o.k. for eight-year-old kiddies to watch. Works fine when you're dealing with mermaids and firemen, but not so much when dealing with material like this.Jennifer Connelley proved that Joan Allen no longer necessarily cornered the market on mopey suffering wife roles, which turned out to be a good thing for us, because Allen was then free to play a hot CIA agent in the Bourne movies.Grade: C",A Beautiful Mind
27,AlsExGal,Crowe should have won the Best Actor Oscar for this film,9,18 October 2019,"Crowe does a great job of playing mathematical whiz John Nash who always had a hard time dealing with people, partially because he just didn't get them, partially because social niceties were just beside the point to him. But Nash had big dreams due to his mathematical genius until schizophrenia stole those dreams. What is great about this film is that the viewer does not know that Nash's imaginary friends are imaginary until the film reveals that fact. What is real to Nash is real to the audience, up to a point.His wife is not made out to be some kind of saint. She is frank after John is released from the hospital in that she mainly feels obligation. The anti psychotic drugs John is on make him unable to respond to her sexually, unable to carry on with his work in mathematics, unable to do much more than sit at home and stare. This is not what she signed up for, yet she stays.And after several months of this, John makes a decision to stop taking the anti-psychotic drugs, try to deal with the illusions with will and with work, and try to scratch and claw his way back into mathematics. In the 1950s he is actually allowed back on campus at Princeton where he once was faculty. Today, insurance and legal issues would take that out of the hands of Princeton itself.It's ultimately the story of how a man has to ""cut one's coat according to one's cloth"", as the old saying goes, of maybe not lowered expectations as much as slower expectations brought on by unforeseeable circumstances and obstacles.A couple of minor things I really noticed were some touches Ron Howard put into the film. One is how as the years rolled on from the 1950s into the late 1960s young people were just ruder in general. Some of the students start mimicking Nash and his odd gait for laughs. So I guess a growing lack of empathy was part of social progress? The second thing is the reality that in the mid 20th century doctors really believed in insulin shock therapy, even though it is now known to be meaningless torture. What you are actually doing is taking somebody who is not diabetic and giving them insulin which induces seizures. It has been known to lead to coma and death in actual insulin dependent diabetics who end up with an overdose due to their body just absorbing insulin and excreting their own insulin slightly differently than is normal for them day to day.Do realize this is not exactly the story of John Nash's life. He had a first marriage that he walked out on after his wife became pregnant. His second wife, Alicia, divorced him after six years of marriage in 1963. They did remarry in 2001. And Crowe definitely does not sound like he is from West Virginia, which was Nash's birthplace. But then all of these details would have been distracting and made the characters less sympathetic. After all, if I want to see the unvarnished truth about John Nash I should watch a PBS documentary, not a Hollywood movie!But back to Crowe. Although every part of this film is well crafted, his performance is the heart of the film. I believe him when he is being a jerk, when he is a socially clueless romantic clumsily courting his wife, when he is afraid for his life, afraid for his sanity, afraid for the nothingness his life could become post diagnosis, and I believe his immersion into mathematics as he battles bravely to come back to the field that he loves.I'd highly recommend this one as one of the more accessible 21st century Oscar winners. It is truly a classic.",A Beautiful Mind
28,ferguson-6,Ron Howard's best direction so far,8,30 December 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Masterful moviemaking can look so easy as a finished product.  Ron Howard seems to be peaking as a movie maker. Still though, he continues to get caught up in melodrama, but much less so in this fine film.  Mumbling Russell Crowe is outstanding (again) as the brilliant, but haunted Dr. John Nash.  Jennifer Connelly stands toe-to-toe with Crowe in every scene.  If you are unfamiliar with Connelly's work, check out ""The Hot Spot"".  It's a sleeper with Don Johnson and Virginia Madsen.  WOW!  As usual, Ron Howard has produced a few interesting notes. He has regular appearance of family members, including veteran actor dad, Rance.  Also, note the brief appearance of super-casting director (more than 100 films) of Jane Jenkins.  Regular film-goers will easily recognize her name.  This movie is not your typical bio pic.  This movie is about mental illness and both Nash's brave attempt to fight the disease with as little medication as possible.  This film makes a statement that disease is often too quickly treated with pills and not compassion, support and grit. Wonderful supporting roles by Christopher Plummer and the under-utilized Judd Hirsch make this a truly masterful picture.  Some of Ed Harris's scenes were overblown, but probably had to be to make the point they were making. Very few light moments in this one, but a must see.",A Beautiful Mind

30,zetes,Good but overrated biopic,7,27 March 2002,"SPOILERSIt's always inspiring to see someone overcome adversity like John Nash, the real-life hero of A Beautiful Mind. A brilliant mathematician, he suffered from sever paranoid schizophrenia for most of his adult life. But he learned to live with it, as normal a life as possible, and he ended up being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994. It's a great story. Too bad it's so generically told in Ron Howard's film. It's as by-the-numbers as a film like this can really get. The direction is bland, and the writing can be quite dull at times. Shine, for instance, is a much better film very similar in plot and structure. I must make an interjection in my own criticisms for this film, though. One reason why A Beautiful Mind may lack power is that it had some major points spoiled in the advertising. We don't actually know in the film, not until a long time in, that Nash is suffering delusions and fantasies. For instance, Ed Harris' character is imaginary, which can be deduced almost instantly. But would I have assumed that if I didn't know what the film was about? Can't be so sure.Anyhow, A Beautiful Mind is well worth seeing. The actors are pretty good. Russel Crowe may have given his best performance so far in the film. He won an Oscar last year for a rather lame role in Gladiator, but if he wins this year (I write this the night before the Oscars air, by the way) it will be very deserved. We've got an actor here who will continue to impress the hell out of us. Hopefully he can restrain himself from beating the crap out of people (I think that it might cost him the award, but we'll see in approximately 24 hours! An update: it did). Jennifer Connely is good, but she's been a lot better elsewhere, most notably in Dark City and Requiem for a Dream. It wouldn't be too out of line to award her, though. The rest of the awards it has been nominated for can vanish, for all I care. There's nothing special about Ron Howard's direction. It may be his best film, but that's a backhanded complement coming from me. The editing is plain. James Horner's score is particularly bad. It's far too overdramatic. The makeup is a possibility, though. Russel Crowe's old man makeup is quite good. I give the film a 7/10.",A Beautiful Mind
31,Sylviastel,A Princeton State of Mind!,10,19 February 2007,"The cost of brilliance might be madness. You don't need to look further than the brilliant math genius John Nash played here by Oscar Winner Russell Crowe. He should have won another Academy Award for Best Actor in this role. It's not easy at Princeton University. They probably didn't flinch an eyeball in their ivy digs over the Oscars. It's the kind of university where it takes a whole lot to impress those ivy geniuses. After all, they have Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, author Joyce Carol Oates, and Nobel prize winners on their faculty as well. Ron Howard said he loved filming in Princeton, New Jersey which doesn't seem to fit in the rest of stereotypical New Jersey. It's like another world of it's own where geniuses discuss politics, history, economics, math, and literature. It's hardly believable that some of them probably don't own television sets because they think it's waste of time and a distraction but they probably have computers instead. Princeton is a state of mind and a place where the mind is valued more than the body. With brilliance comes madness for John Nash. Ron Howard creates a beautiful film based on John Nash's story of suffering and demons that battles his mind for control. I like the casting of Judd Hirsch and Jennifer Connolly as the loving, devoted wife. John Nash will be remembered for this film more than his brilliance but that he was human just like the rest of us.",A Beautiful Mind

Ron Howard is a legendary storyteller, no two options on that! But his work of performance in 'A Beautiful Mind' takes him to a place only a Cinema-Fanatic can merely imagine!Based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a Nobel Laureate in Economics, 'A Beautiful Mind' unfolds wonderfully. Some lives are worth hearing about, talking about, and Mr.John Nash is one those very-few gifted people, who prove the evil within us wrong. A Legendary Man, his ups and downs, his strengths and weaknesses come alive in 'A Beautiful Mind'. In my opinion, There are some films that entertain, There are some films that enlighten & There are some films that simply motivate. 'A Beautiful Mind' is a rare combination of all the three genres mentioned above! Mr.Howard won each and every award possible for his work-here, and that isn't a surprise at all. As mentioned above, this film takes this Genius to a level only a few people make it to. Akiva Goldsman's adapted screenplay is marvelous. Roger Deakins Cinematography is awesome. Music by James Horner, is excellent.In the acting department, Russell Crowe is fantastic as Mr.John Nash. The star/actor sinks his teeth into the part and delivers a performance that can silence even his worst critics. To state this as his finest work, would truly be an understatement. Jennifer Connelly is superb as Nash's Spouse. She performs like never before, and is at par with Crowe in several scenes. Paul Bettany is effective. Ed Harris is, as always, note-worthy. Josh Lucas is good. Christopher Plummer is restrained.On the whole, 'A Beautiful Mind' is a Remarkable Film in all respects!

35,JamesHitchcock,Triumph of the Spirit,7,22 September 2005,"Director Ron Howard has the reputation of making intellectually undemanding films, often with a sentimental, uplifting theme, and ""A Beautiful Mind"" is no exception. It is a biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash, but makes no attempt to explain Nash's mathematical theories, probably wisely as pure mathematics is a notoriously difficult subject for the layman to grasp. The film points out that these theories have influenced a number of fields of activity, including economics and evolutionary biology, but does not go into any detail about the nature of that influence. The film is rather an example of the ""triumph of the human spirit over adversity"" type of biopic, the adversity over which Nash triumphs being the schizophrenia from which he suffered.When we first meet Nash he is an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1940s, intellectually brilliant but awkward and lacking in social skills. Despite his gaucheness, however, Nash makes a close friend in his more self-assured room-mate Charles Herman, and later meets and marries a beautiful student named Alicia. After graduating, he is recruited by the American intelligence services to help break Soviet codes during the Cold War. His CIA contact, Parcher, informs him that the Soviets are using American newspapers and magazines to convey information to their agents, and much of Nash's time is taken up with his attempts to crack the code they are using. It is at this point that Howard pulls off a coup de cinema. Sudden plot twists are more normally associated with the thriller genre, but Howard shows that they can be just as effective in the context of a biopic. We learn that Nash is not merely eccentric but actually mentally ill and that much of what we have hitherto seen- and accepted as fact- is not the truth, but an illusion existing only inside Nash's head. It turns out that there is no such person as Charles Herman; he is a figment of Nash's imagination. Although it appears that Nash did indeed do some work for the CIA, Parcher is also an imaginary figure and the supposed Soviet newspaper code which Nash has desperately been trying to crack has no existence in reality. There is a suggestion that Nash's fantasies are ways of compensating for his own perceived deficiencies; ""Charles"" is outgoing and confident whereas Nash himself is shy and reserved, and the melodramatic adventures in which he becomes embroiled with ""Parcher"" perhaps reflect an unfulfilled desire for physical excitement. The rest of the film details Nash's attempts, with the aid of his doctors and the loyal Alicia, to overcome his illness and to return to productive life as a mathematician. Like a number of Howard's films, this one has been criticised for its alleged sentimentality. This criticism, however, does not seem to have done it any harm in the eyes of the Academy; indeed, sentimentality often seems to be a positive advantage when it comes to winning Academy Awards. There is some truth in the criticism, but at least ""A Beautiful Mind"" sins less grievously in this respect than does another recent ""Best Picture"" winner, ""Million Dollar Baby"". Like that film, however, it is saved by some excellent acting performances. I knew from ""Gladiator"" and ""Master and Commander"" that Russell Crowe was a gifted actor; ""A Beautiful Mind"" showed me that he is also a versatile one, able to play a character very different from the action heroes he played in those two films and to convey the pathos of Nash's situation as the possessor of a brilliant but flawed mind. He received good support from Jennifer Connelly as Alicia and also from Ed Harris as Parcher and Paul Bettany as Charles, these latter two actors coping well with the difficult task of portraying characters who are, even in the context of the story itself, fictitious, having no reality outside the mind of another character. It has also been claimed that the film is not always accurate when it comes to the facts of Nash's life. It has, for example, been criticised for not mentioning allegations of affairs with both men and women, although I am not sure whether details of his supposed bisexuality were omitted at the behest of studio executives who felt that a main character who was anything other than a red-blooded heterosexual was bad for the box-office, or of gay activists who disliked any possible association between homosexuality and mental illness, or of Nash himself who has denied the allegations. It has also been pointed out that Nash's real-life relationship with Alicia was rather more rocky than the one shown here; they were actually divorced and remarried, something omitted from the film. No biography, however, can ever hope to tell the full story of its subject's life, and biographers always have to choose which elements they wish to emphasise. This choice is particularly acute for the scriptwriters and directors of filmed biographies, if only because a normal-length feature film can convey far less information than a book. Here Howard and Akiva Goldsman have clearly gone for the emotional rather than the factual approach to Nash's life; seen as entertainment rather than a biographical treatise this approach works well enough. 7/10",A Beautiful Mind
36,=G=,Hypekill.,7,27 June 2002,"There's little doubt that ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an excellent film. There's also little doubt that it was buoyed from buzz to Oscar acclaim by hype, strategic PR, and a gullible public. Taken in and of itself the film is rather ordinary among excellent films and not worthy of much of the critical acclaim it garnered. I personally found much of the film uninteresting, tedious, and downright boring. After all, how does one relate to someone whose accomplishments are so abstract as to be buried in esoteric symbolism and someone whose illness is so intangible as to be a state of mind? The beauty of mathematics and the war with the demons of delusions were not brought sufficiently into focus by the film which spent too much time trying to develop a rather uninteresting character, making his delusions our delusions, spicing it up with a car chase and shootout, fleshing out the mental ghosts, and showing the principal's eccentricism with endless scribbling on window glass. Compensate for the hype, keep expectations low, and enjoy.",A Beautiful Mind
37,MovieAddict2016,A disappointment,7,5 August 2002,"A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001)(3/5 stars)Starring RUSSELL CROWE JENNIFER CONNELLY And ED HARRIS With CHRISTOPHER PLUMMERDirected by RON HOWARD Written by AKIVA GOLDSMAN RATING: PG-13 - for sexual content, and a scene of violenceThe much talked about film A BEAUTIFUL MIND from director RON HOWARD is over rated. In no way should this film have snagged the BEST PICTURE OSCAR. In fact, the best picture SHOULD have gone to LORD OF THE RINGS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING instead.In the beginning of A BEAUTIFUL MIND, I found myself thinking, `Wow, this really IS going to be good!' Because I, myself, thought RUSSELL CROWE shouldn't have won best actor for GLADIATOR 2 years ago, and now I was thinking that this'll make up for that. Wrong! After Crowe's character starts becoming paranoid-an effect of schizophrenia, the movie just got weird. Something about it just was out of place, and though I know this film is based on the real JOHN NASH, I personally feel RON HOWARD messed up chances at possible good film. Among many other weird sequences with his `friends,'  at the end of the film, though it may be a true story, I actually felt depressed-the OPPOSITE of what Ron said he tried to create at the end. I felt that out of his whole lifetime, all he did, all the terror  All John Nash got was one Nobel Prize?. And the other weird thing is, that he STILL sees those people -- the man, the girl and the spy. While this may be true, I got more of a horror vibe at this thought, rather than a ` wow, what an accomplishment.' Ron could've presented this fact better than showing an 80 year old Nash, walking the college floors, and peering behind him, revealing the people, still standing there. I got a very, very weird feeling seeing this.The movie itself, wasn't that great either. Sure, it's good material, but not Oscar worthy! Jennifer Connelly didn't do that great at acting in this film, either. She did better in THE LABYRINTH! Don't take me wrong, this film's good, but not Oscar worthy. And like I said before, this film feels more like a horror picture than anything else, much less a drama! See it, like it, whatever. But don't tell me it deserved an Oscar. Why does everyone like Ron Howard films? All I've REALLY likes so far were APOLLO 13 and RANSOM. Other than that they're okay. NOT Oscar worthy though. This year's Academy Awards were given to the wrong people, and pictures. I'm sorry, but that's just my view of this film. Sue me, but I'll let you know, I'm giving A BEAUTIFUL MIND a good rating, just not a great one. 3/5 stars-If you've got some points to point out, r just to say something about a movie I reviewed, or even to agree with me, you can email me.",A Beautiful Mind
38,sddavis63,Excellent Performances In A Moving Story,8,11 August 2002,"This is an extremely well-done movie. I must admit that when I started to watch it I was lost after the first little while. It didn't seem to make a lot of sense, and it was certainly not what I was expecting from everything I had heard about ""A Beautiful Mind."" But without giving anything away, let me say that even if you have the same reaction, if you stick with this you will find out why the first 45 minutes or so seems so strange. In fact, that first part of the movie is so well done that when you first watch it you're tempted to just dismiss this as a disappointingly bad movie. But don't do that. Stick with it; it's worth it.Russell Crowe's performance as Dr. John Nash - the brilliant Princeton mathematician who struggles his entire life with mental illness - is magnificent, and demonstrates his versatility as an actor. He portrays both Nash's brilliance and his personal angst perfectly, and brings to the screen a man whom we can all feel for. Equally powerful was the performance of Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia, whose struggle with Nash's illness is just as valiant as John's is. Connelly brings out the pain of living in this nightmare, but her love - while tested - is also the source of hope for him and eventually helps him to persevere and even triumph.Moving, and at times funny (I loved Nash's line: ""what's the point of being crazy if you can't have any fun with it?"") once the story really gets going it has you questioning almost everything that happens - is it real or not? One of the few criticisms I could make would be that Christopher Plummer didn't really seem comfortable in the role of Nash's psychiatrist, Dr. Rosen. At least, that was my sense. That aside, this really is a great piece of work from Director Ron Howard.8/10",A Beautiful Mind
39,cherold,stop reading these reviews and watch the movie,9,8 December 2003,"I hadn't read any reviews of this movie, I just heard it was really good, and I'm glad, because I think it would be difficult to talk about without saying too much.  So I'm not going to say a thing about the story.  I'm just going to say that this is a fascinating story beautiful told and acted. It's funny, dramatic and touching but it never feels manipulative (well, maybe once near the end), letting the emotional effects come naturally from the actions (unlike other Ron Howard movies).  It is a movie that starts good and gets better and better as it progresses.  The story is told simply; the director doesn't let himself get in the way of the material.  So trust me, stop reading these little reviews and watch it.  I rate it 9/10.",A Beautiful Mind
40,FeastMode,my notes,7,25 July 2019,"Great movie with a great story, beastly acting, and an awesome musical score. russell crow killed it, so did connelly. i even enjoyed the love story aspect. and there were some powerful moments as well as emotional ones. i would normally avoid emotion-y bio pics, but this was an exceptional exception. i dunno if i'd rewatch it a bunch of times, but probably warrants another viewing. i watched it once when i visited Palestine when i was like 19, i remember liking it but was never considering rewatching it... until i went through a phase of rewatching a bunch of old movies to see if they were actually good.

41,ElMaruecan82,Nash Disequilibrium...,6,5 June 2017,"""A Beautiful Mind"" presents all the characteristics of a great film but since it deals with schizophrenia and visual and aural elements that aren't what they seem to be, I wondered sometimes if what I was seeing wasn't just elements of episodic greatness wrapped up in a story that actually had less substantial things to say than what the raving critics pretend it said. Ron Howard used to make movies that worked both on and beneath the surface, but this is a case where many elements of one man's life overlap and generate more confusion than fascination. That it won the Oscar for Best Picture has the same puzzling effect than of a math riddle.The film is a legitimate biopic about one of the most interesting minds of the twentieth century. I'm not sure I would call it 'beautiful', even Einstein didn't get that title, but 'fascinating', it sure was. It belongs to John Forbes Nash, the mathematician and economist who paved the way for a new conception of governing dynamics and competition, less through the theory of games than the notion of equilibrium, the fact that the lesser of two evils is a wiser option than 'everyone for himself'. I'm not being persnickety but I wish the film dedicated more time to his revolutionary work, I studied economics and the 'Nash equilibrium' was one of these lessons that instantly inspired me and I could see countless situations where the genius of Nash was applied.Maybe being a math buff influenced my expectations and I'm perfectly aware that this is only a cinematic adaptation, that Ron Howard or Akiva Goldman (the writer) are entitled to their narrative choices, but I was disappointed to see the 'sick' side of Nash' personality being shamelessly unleashed especially after the superficial treatment his game theory got, though I loved its application on the way to approach women. The second act of the film primarily deals with the diseases that struck that 'beautiful' mind but could have been a more subtle treatment of his mental condition, not just a translation into archetypal cinematic language but something in par with the subtle and realistic way Nash was played in the first act as a graduate student from Princeton whose sociability isn't exactly his strongest suit and his interactions with his co-workers or with women work as efficient comical moments.Indeed, to a fellow recipient of a prestigious Mathematics scholarship (Josh Lucas), Nash slyly declares that he found nothing seminal in any of the articles he wrote, and to a woman, well, let's just that a reference to sexual fluids earned him a nice slap in the face. Russell Crowe is quite convincing as Nash, a guy never looking his straight in the eyes, often down, looking for patterns in everything, and looking forward to having his scientific epiphany. There's a moment where he just lost a Go game and is puzzled because he played the part perfectly, this display of bad loser's spirit would have been more efficient had it not been immediately followed by another one where he throws his office desk from the window, encouraged by his roommate, an imaginary 'literature' student played by Paul Bettany and it seems like the writer was already preparing us for weirdness. This is a film that would have benefited from less spectacular stunts, no matter how supposedly true to Nash' life they were.So, once the article about governing dynamics is published and made a name out of Nash, the film makes a chronological leap where we find him as an MIT teacher. He there meets Alicia, a beautiful student, played by Jennifer Connelly, and if not original, the chemistry is believable. This is where something derails the narrative again, once you get the point that mathematics won't play a part to the story, you accept to get to the intimate life, but then for some reason, the writer decides it's time for us to get to the piece of resistance. Then the film focuses on subplots involving a mysterious agent from Ministry of Defense (Ed Harris) assigning Nash to thwart a Russian plot by finding patterns in newspapers. Then the film turns into some sort of copycat-political thriller with chase sequences and shootouts, that aren't even supposed to be real.The treatment of schizophrenia is so visible, logic and structured that the whole thing loses its credibility, it's on the same level as 'Inception' or the Matrix while I wish it was a bit more like 'Pi', or something that could really be perceived as mental internal, it is a biopic after all. Not that the film is always about Nash's hallucinations but even the rest is an uneven experience, it starts with elements of abstraction that makes you penetrate in the world of Nash, his fascination for patterns, in the sky, but then we're plunged in a succession of archetypal situations that occupy so much of the story every other character becomes just an observer of Nash' deterioration, even Alicia becomes the obligatory long suffering wife without any subtlety. How about having the insight of the one sane person who was the closest to Nash, his wife? Her performance was good enough to earn her an Oscar but it's not the same complexity as in her ""Requiem for a Dream"". As for Nash, we don't see the math genius but the victim of a severe mental condition, but it's handled in such a way it's difficult to care about it. The film is well acted, well directed, but I'm not sure it does justice to the legacy of a man reduced for almost half the film to things that didn't even happen. As spectacular as they were, I don't think they belonged to the film, and maybe, quoting Nash who commented on a bad tie, and after having 'enjoyed' other Goldman's screenplays, there might be a pattern explaining how bad his narrative choices are.",A Beautiful Mind
42,MOscarbradley,A load of bull,5,18 July 2007,"This hugely over-praised film was not only flavour of the month, it was flavour of the year and it went on to win the Academy Award as the year's best picture. The fact that it isn't really very good didn't seem to matter; it made mathematics sexy in the form of Russell Crowe as the real life mathematician and paranoid-schizophrenic John Nash and it conformed to Hollywood's idea of paranoid-schizophrenia, (fantasy characters that the audience sees just the way John sees them; a charismatic star who can overact all over the place but with whom the audience can empathize). Actually, Crowe isn't half bad, especially in the first half of the film before the madness really takes hold. Once it does it's all stops out and the script doesn't really help; there are no subtleties or shadings to it. When the pieces fall into place the film seems alarmingly conventional.Director Ron Howard can't resist sentimentalizing everything so the film isn't so much about John Nash, 'the beautiful mind' of the title. but how a sick man is cured by the love of a beautiful woman. If the film wasn't based on fact it would be utterly unbelievable. In reality, of course, Hollywood altered the facts leaving out key events in Nash's life, (his bisexuality, for example, is never touched on), in the name of 'entertainment'.Ironically the two best performances come from the actors Ed Harris and Paul Bettany who play the imaginary characters while Jennifer Connelly's much praised turn as the self-sacrificing wife never really escapes the confines of the role. This is self-sacrifice taken to the extreme and she was given the Oscar for her trouble.There are a lot of people who find this film highly entertaining though I would doubt if anyone would find it profound. When Nash wins the Nobel Prize his speech is pure Hollywood drivel: just like the Oscars, in fact.",A Beautiful Mind
43,bowmanblue,Much better than I expected,7,22 January 2018,"I never watched 'A Beautiful Mind' at its time of release as I wasn't a massive fan of Russell Crowe and I didn't know what the film was about. For me, this was the ultimate example of never judging a book by its cover. I still proclaim that the cover of the DVD looks pretty dull and gives no real hint as to what the film was about. Yes, I knew that Crowe won an Oscar for his performance and that it was a story about a guy who did stuff, but nothing about (the little) I heard about it really grabbed me. However, now nearly twenty years later, I finally got round to seeing what all the fuss was about. And I'm actually quite glad I did.I guess my overriding predictions of 'A Beautiful Mind' was that it was a love story and nothing else. However, the film is actually based on the real life story of John Nash (Crowe), an American code-breaker who helped the US Government decipher Russian messages during the Cold War, making the whole thing more akin to a spy thriller than a romantic drama. I'm not saying that just because it's about spies you're going to get a load of high-octane James Bond car chases and gadgets. What you have here is a far more realistic take on the profession. We see how Nash is 'recruited' by the Government and the way he uses his gifts with patterns and numbers in order to help them out. Of course there's always going to be a reasonable helping of romantic sub-plot and here it comes in the form of Jennifer Connolly who becomes his wife throughout the course of the story. But, in my opinion (now!), it's primarily a spy story.I won't go into too much detail regarding the rest of the plot as there are most likely some things that you won't see coming. Or, at least from my perspective as someone who knew nothing about the film before watching, I certainly didn't predict what would happen. But, I do recommend watching it, even if you're not a fan of spy-stuff. If nothing else then Crowe's performance is definitely worth a look. You can see why he got his Oscar as he does put everything he has into the portrayal of a man who, by his own admission, isn't that likeable and yet you want to see what happens to him. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer should also get mentions as they both provide integral parts of the story. I know Jennifer Connolly was good too, but I felt she had little to do other than be Nash's long-suffering partner throughout the story. It is a kind of long film and I think perhaps around fifteen to twenty minutes of the final act could probably have been trimmed to make it a tighter film. It may take me another twenty years to watch 'A Beautiful Mind' again, but I'm pretty sure one day I will.",A Beautiful Mind
44,dromasca,Superb Acting by Russell Crowe,8,10 June 2002,"This film is certainly memorable for one reason - but one BIG REASON - the superb acting of Russell Crowe. He deserves three Oscars, not only one for his great part. The movie overall is too long, and too conventional for my taste. At no point do we get really the genius at work, and though the schizophrenic non-reality may be well emulated we have a hard time relating the characters into the social reality of their time. However, Crowe is present in almost every shot, and I have not seen such a treat since Dustin Hoffman's Oscar performances. I am now convinced that he is the best actor of his generation.",A Beautiful Mind
45,ThomasDrufke,Something Extraordinary,8,16 April 2017,"Ron Howard is always great at adapting true stories into well- structured biopics. Whether it be Rush, Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, or A Beautiful Mind, he has a knack for representing real people well while also adding some movie magic in there as well.The first time I watched A Beautiful Mind I was blown away by it. Not only did I think all of the actors did a tremendous job sinking their teeth into each role, but I couldn't believe how fascinating John Nash's life was. This is a man was a student at Princeton and made significant contributions to the world of mathematics and economics (including proposing several theories and equations), all while being diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances as John Nash, in what also may be his most challenging. Crowe has to make it believable that he's both one of the brightest minds in the world but also someone who is seriously struggling with mental illness. He has great chemistry with his love interest, Alicia Nash, played by Jennifer Connelly. In fact, I think this film is a better romance than it is a biopic. Connelly, who won an Oscar for playing Alicia, is a revelation here. She had impressed in previous films, but there's something about her balancing the sweetness of Alicia's personality with her turmoil filled personal life.I think the main issue with A Beautiful Mind is its pace. At 138 minutes, it's right about at the length of your usual bio-drama, but it doesn't feel like it. The film moves at a really slow pace, especially before we realize what Nash is going through mentally. Part of the reason for this is that I found it hard to approach the complexities of his work. The story is interesting, but I can't say I knew exactly what was going on half the time. If the film would have found a way to make all the equations and theories dumbed down for the general audience, the film would have felt much smoother.Overall, the film is well done. I love James Horner's score, Roger Deakin's cinematography is beautiful, as is the romance between Connelly and Crowe, but I think it lacks in re-watchability and pacing.+Romance+Score+Strong performances+Extraordinary story-But difficult to follow at times8.5/10",A Beautiful Mind

The acting was incredible especially with Crowe, Bettany, Plummer, and Harris. The script was written well and that means the storyline worked well. I also liked the score by James Horner.

Not because it is a bad movie, but because the premise simply did not interest me.Let's face it; I hated mathematics at school. So, watching a movie about a brilliant mathematician is not exactly my idea of a good time with a movie. Throw in the spy element with mystery, action and adventure, and there's a twinkling in my eye. Sadly, this was merely our hero's mind playing tricks on him. Or quite bluntly, losing his mind.Based on fact, I suppose it would not have made an interesting movie if it wasn't for John Nash's imaginary world. Once I realized it was all just his schizophrenia talking, I lost interest and it was ultimately boring. The ending was probably supposed to give me goosebumps, but unfortunately it did nothing for me. I was only toot happy it (finally) ended. This is a very long movie, and also a very slow moving one.Make no mistake, this is a very well made film with good dialogue and acting.

Although historical films take some creative license for the sake of storytelling, this one is almost entirely fictional. Accuracy aside, Nash as played by Crowe is a subtle figure, wavering between narcissistic bravado and shy analysis. His turn for the worse is genuinely shocking, throwing the entire film upside down and making the audience question everything they've watched. The acting behind the other characters is also lifelike, as they are troubled by his issues but warm enough to support him. As far as the film's treatment of mathematics, genius and schizophrenia go, this is nothing too original or complex, but it is told in an understandable, sympathetic and tragic way.",A Beautiful Mind

56,zkonedog,Ron Howard's Masterpiece,9,4 March 2017,"Director Ron Howard has had his name attached to some pretty prestigious projects over the years, such as ""Apollo 13"", ""Cinderella Man"", and ""The Da Vinci Code"", to name but a few. ""A Beautiful Mind"", however, is (pound-for-pound) probably the best Howard-directed movie of the lot.For a basic plot summary, this film looks at the life of John Nash (Russell Crowe), a brilliant (but quite eccentric) mathematician who is approached by shadowy government figure Parcher (Ed Harris) to work as a code-breaker to help expose a Soviet Union bomb plot. As Nash becomes obsessed with his work, wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) begins to wonder whether or not John is truly ""working"" at all. To say any more would completely ruin the plot.I could write an essay on why this movie is so great, but to do so would give away key plot details that would ruin the experience for you. Suffice it to say, though, that there are plot twists that you won't see coming even if you know that some are coming! Plus, thanks to the direction of Ron Howard, this is the kind of movie that really isn't even about the ""twist"". It is more about the extraordinary life of Mr. Nash.The acting in ""A Beautiful Mind"" is also top-notch. As I've said in other reviews of movies starring Crowe, I cannot recall him EVER turning in a bad performance on screen. I mean, the same guy who can play a Gladiator in one movie and and boxer in another (""Cinderella Man"") can almost effortlessly (although I'm sure it isn't) transform himself into a much more cerebral role here. Co- stars Connelly and Harris play nice supporting roles as well, especially Connelly as Nash's wife who quite literally cannot believe what she is seeing from her husband on occasion.Thus, I consider ""A Beautiful Mind"" to rank among my personal favorites. It has an intriguing plot, yet focuses heavily on the characters to make you really feel for them. Not only does in continue the ""Russell Crowe streak of perfection"", but it also cements Howard as a top-notch director.",A Beautiful Mind
57,johnnyboyz,"Beautifully shot, made, acted and put across - a real gem of a film.",8,15 August 2007,"Yes, it's probably been said a million times by a million different people in a million different reviews but A Beautiful Mind really is a beautiful film. The film is smart, engaging and entertaining in its own way  even the fact it's based on a real person and loosely on a true story is even more fascinating. A Beautiful Mind is really just a life story but what a life. Dealing with mathematician John Nash (who I admit hadn't heard of before) and his life of genius and love as well as the more darker sides of his life or that of mental illness is a joy to behold and it's done in such a way that it engages the viewer, putting them there with Nash (Crowe) the whole way through.What I really liked about A Beautiful Mind is its intelligence. The film gets straight into business as Nash starts university in 1940s America; this is where we learn the most about him although half the information we're given we're not even aware of its importance. We see that Nash is, in truth, a genius but we also see a more unnatural side to his persona. His first friendship is with a roommate called Charles (Bettany) who I noticed is pretty much the exact opposite in terms of kind of person to that of Nash. He didn't entirely fit in with his other co-students outside and thus doesn't fit in yet this 'jock' mysteriously takes to him from the off. Clever and confusing film-making that pays off later on.Nash's and Charles' exchanges are often kept to settings where only the two of them are in immediate vicinity  the film further attempts to play with us when Charles' niece is introduced; furthering the character of Charles and further playing tricks on us for reasons that become revealed. Nash also develops throughout this segment as the 40s turn into the 50s. In all honesty, I became very suspicious of Charles the more of a friend he became and it's no coincidence that the more we see Nash doing what it is he does; the more we are tempted to label him a 'crazy' more so than 'genius'. This is due to the fact he's seen doing some pretty erratic things like multiple complex sums, tearing out magazine articles and basically trying to crack a code that isn't there. Once again, fantastic film-making  dragging you in and playing with you.Another interesting aspect of the film is it's espionage theme. This creates conflict in the film, giving Nash a reason to do the things he does  One small thing can trigger off several large things in Nash's mind. This is evident when he visits the pentagon to crack a code yet becomes so involved in it all that another character named Parcher (Harris) becomes involved in his life. Arguably, the scenes involving Parhcer and the results of Nash's actions because of Parcher often make for the film's best and most gripping bits not to mention that they enable the film to drop its most evident clues yet regarding the truth. A further example of a small, seemingly insignificant item causing chaos is when Nash spots the word 'Soviet' in a newspaper and his illness flairs up again. These espionage scenes create the conflict as the domestic issues intensify.A Beautiful Mind is a very powerful and well made film that just seems to feel like something Nash's life centres around: a mathematics puzzle. It's not one of those Mullholland Drive sort of visual jigsaw puzzle type films but it has the right balance of good character development, strong acting performances and intelligence that allows it to drop clues as to what might happen later.",A Beautiful Mind

I confess I did not know him until I saw the film, but I found it interesting how he tells his life, using his life's adventures to make the story more appealing to the public. Not everything the film shows is exactly true but if we except the writer's creative and narrative freedoms, the film is close enough to reality for a biopic. Russel Crowe plays the protagonist, and he does it in a generally good way.

59,leplatypus,A beautiful revisionism (dvd),1,3 November 2011,"My cinema hobby is an escapist one, searching values in movies that our actual world ignores. So there's nothing worst for me that a movie that tramples morality and beauty. In this genre, this one ranks among high.It begins with the extras: 30 minutes of deleted scenes with Howard saying that they are all beautiful, perfect but it had to cut them because of the time. Where's the rule that says that this biopic must run 130 minutes exactly? The length is never fixed, it depends of the story.Then, he proposes a scene with his real father: ""cut for show business"". What are his values? Money over Family? One of the finest French director (Richard Berry) always finds a part (big or small) for his daughter in all his movies! Next, the movie starts and it's the carnival of Horror: To depict that the story happened in the 50's, Howard uses very strong golden colorization! Then, we have to believe that Crowe is a 22 years student! And ice on the cake: his delusions are ""real"", which is total nonsense. In other words, the director found brilliant to embody his delusions like normal people. I didn't know that mental illness was a fairy tale! All the power of this drama is killed at birth and it's a shame. It reminds me of the french movie ""l'adversaire"" that stars also a psychotic. This one cheats all his family for years and it's his ultimate moment that reveals his madness. With that climax, our french ""Howard"" thought also brilliantly to start the movie by the end! Well, the great error of this biopic is to treat illness like a thriller, a spy movie. Others much talented directors (Lynch) can really depict what is madness and a dangerous reality.Sadly, Jennifer isn't acting so wonderful to earn her Oscar instead of Crowe, who is really convincing as a big man becoming very fragile. If you add that the story eludes his first child, his homosexuality and his divorce (!) and that you saw all the Oscars it won, I conclude that Hollywood has really gone psychotic now! NB: My real anguish with that itself but the fear of the psychosis. Now, i don't see or hear delusions but I'm afraid to face them in the future. So am i already psychotic and i don't know it actually ?",A Beautiful Mind

61,insomniac_rod,A fantastic journey through a special mind.,10,22 December 2006,"This is a wonderful dramatic movie filled with fantasy, drama, sadness, magic, and the occasional romance.""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those special movies that change your view or opinion on some specific events. This time, we get into the world of a schizophrenic man whose brilliance is just a part of his personality. We understand his disease but we also understand how he perceives happiness, sadness, and desperation.John Nash made important contributions to science and it's displayed in such a beautiful manner in this movie that you wonder if he was truly sick. His life changed when one of her students fell in love with him. She didn't fell in love with his looks but was charmed with his knowledge, common sense, and intelligence. She will be his support in the good and in the bad times. Together they will live in an alternate world of suffer and compassion; created of course by John's beautiful mind.I can't praise this movie enough. Since I watched it on theaters back in 2002 I knew this movie would change my life and it did. Sure, it has the typical Hollywood vibe but Ron Howard displayed a feeling of tenderness and passion like in no modern movie.From beginning to half of the movie you wonder about John's mental health but then after it's revealed of his disease, you can't help but care about him and try to understand what's really going on with his mind and thoughts.The acting is simply great, moving, tender, powerful. Russell Crowe demonstrates he's a solid dramatic actor and knows perfectly how to display many emotions. Jennifer Connelly shines with her powerful and passionate performance. This woman revolutionized acting in the new millennium. She can express MANY things and feelings with her beautiful green bright eyes... She also is simply beautiful, stunning. She's probably the most beautiful woman in the world.The direction is great, visually stunning and beautiful. The cinematography, art direction, editing, and score are the best money can buy. Quality all over this production.Please watch this movie; it's a lesson of life and a wonderful dramatic story. Objectively, it's more than just a blockbuster.",A Beautiful Mind
62,Anonymous_Maxine,Beautiful. A startlingly convincing portrayal of mental illness.,10,2 April 2002,"A Beautiful Mind is a difficult movie to review. I always think that the terrible movies are the most fun to review, because there's nothing better than slashing a movie like Scary Movie or Coyote Ugly that is obviously a belligerent mess, but it is the great films that allow for the presentation of some meaning in a review, and A Beautiful Mind presents a unique set of challenges in reviewing a great film. One way to begin to look at this film is to simply try to list the vast number of ways in which the film illuminates different elements of the human condition. There are the obvious ones, such as the problems associated with mental illness, as well as the fact that people who suffer from mental illness can be considered nothing other than victims, but are still all too often frightened and hurt by their treatment, but then there are less obvious ones, such as the fact that people truly are a product of their environment, and in the case of John Nash, that very environment lashes out at him when it is not processed correctly in his head. Whatever the extent to which these things are true, Nash's delusions are clearly a result of the stress involved in his education (as well as the fact that, as they say, genius is often associated with madness), the stress involved with the type of work that his specialty leads to, and perhaps most importantly, Nash's perception of the government as cryptic and potentially dangerous, as well as his perception of the Russians as dangerous people who are constantly involved in some sort of conspiracy. Nash becomes a victim of that a government in his own mind as well as in the real world, although in the real world they are seeking to help him rather than to force him to perform work that he doesn't believe in. (spoilers) The first 45 minutes to an hour of A Beautiful Mind, admittedly, are hardly Oscar material, either the acting or directing or anything else, but once you realize that Nash's entire occupation with the government as well as his roommate were all in his head, then you go back and analyze the beginning of the film more closely with that knowledge. This is very much the same kind of plot twist that we saw in The Sixth Sense a couple years ago, except that it is much more applicable to real life in this case. The Sixth Sense was the portrayal of a sort of afterlife, the existence of which is very much debatable, while A Beautiful Mind is the portrayal of a man with schizophrenia, which is a very real and very incurable disease. The film is, in fact, virtually a textbook of schizophrenic symptoms and the workings of schizophrenia.One of my favorite things about In Dreams, a film that I truly enjoyed and I will stand by my assertion that it is a quality film, was the way that it presented the mental illness of Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.), the rather unusual villain presented in that film. In fact, I think I said something in my review of In Dreams about how you should watch the movie if you want to know what it's like to be insane, but A Beautiful Mind is a much more mature, realistic, and convincing presentation of a more specific and more debilitating mental disease than whatever it was exactly that Vivian suffered from in In Dreams. This is not a psychological thriller, but an intensely humanitarian drama that powerfully delivers the extraordinary story of John Nash's life. There is just the right amount of humor in just the right places, Ron Howard's brilliant direction takes us through the unimaginable maze of schizophrenia, and you leave the film feeling that you have not only been entertained for two and a half hours, but that you have learned something important about one of the most devastating mental illnesses currently acknowledged and studied. There are thousands of things that you simply can't learn from reading a book, and the true nature of mental illnesses is obviously one of them. While I can't say whether or not A Beautiful Mind accurately depicted schizophrenia (because I don't suffer from it, nor does anyone I know), I can say that it is an exceptional portrayal of the thing that victims of schizophrenia experience. Through his vast contributions to humanity despite being plagued by terrifying schizophrenic delusions, John Nash has entered the realm of mentally ill people who have truly done great things in spite of their illnesses, such as Kay Redfield Jamison and Sylvia Plath, both of whom have written startlingly enlightening books that illuminate their respective disorders. I've always thought that it would just be great to be as recognized and respected as Nash has become, with the condition that I would not have to suffer through all of the hardships that he went through. John Nash has more than earned his fame, both because of his illness and because of his accomplishments (although potentially not because of either of them alone), and A Beautiful Mind is a fantastic film that brings it all to the screen for the public to see and to learn and benefit from.",A Beautiful Mind

The screenwriters have completely bastardized a better story.Just for the sake of correctness, Nash didn't invent game theory as this work attempts to claim. He came up with a notion of equilibrium, which is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel. But Crowe does NOT. This was supposed to be a historical film, but due to Crowe's lackluster performance, backed up by his aggressive contractual negotiations, his character has been given credit for things he did not do! In a learned person's opinion, this is an irresponsible, and disgraceful film mainly due to Crowe's contractual screen time, which necessitated giving his character credit for things he should not have been portrayed as having done, and his totally crappy, dialed in performance.This was a typical Hollywood whitewash of the truth, and a typical Hollywood performance by Crowe.

64,bsmith5552,A Beautiful Mind - A Beautiful Movie,9,9 August 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" took home four major Academy Awards for 2001. It deservedly won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay (Adaptation). It is the story of John Nash who is a brilliant mathematician whose life becomes a nightmare when he descends into the scary and uncertain world of a paranoid schizophrenic. Producer Brian Grazer, Director Ron Howard and Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman show us the world of a schizophrenic from the patient's point of view as Nash's world alternates between reality and and imagined reality. The audience shares his suffering and also does not know what situations and /or characters are real or imagined. Russell Crowe, in an outstanding performance, plays Nash with conviction and believability. Jennifer Connelly is his long-suffering wife Alicia who sticks with him and provides the support he so desperately needs. Christopher Plummer plays Dr. Rosen the psychiatrist who tries to help Nash. Ed Harris is excellent as Nash's contact in the Defence Department where Nash works de-coding hidden messages..or does he? Paul Bettany is Martin Hansen Nash's college roommate and Vivien Cardone his niece who Nash turns to for comfort. Adam Goldberg and Anthony Rapp are two of Nash's college classmates who he also meets from time to time over the years and who help Alicia in coping with Nash's behavior. Judd Hirsch plays Nash's college professor and watch for Roy Thinnes in a blink of an eye appearance as the Governor.

Connolly has always had a hard time emoting and Crowe really only plays Crowe aide from the rare movie like ""The Insider."" The director did a great job aside of the lead, but really we have Crowe playing Crowe thinking he is the greatest actor on earth and, really, he should be playing John Nash.John Nash doesn't really make an appearance in the film at all, it is all Crowe and that just doesn't work for a biopic.Any other actor and it would have been as great as the fans make it out to be.",A Beautiful Mind
66,freemantle_uk,"Mathematics, mental illness and the Cold War.",7,9 January 2011,"As a director Ron Howard likes making character pieces set to a period backgrounds. He did that with Apollo 13, Cinderella Man and Frost/Nixon, but it was A Beautiful Mind that won him the Oscar. Weirdly, I think A Beautiful Mind is a lesser film to his other films.A Beautiful Mind is a bio-pic about John Nash (Russell Crowe), a Mathematical genius who created the revolutionary idea of Game Theory. Starting with his life as a PHD student at Princeton University Nash where he starts to see the world in a certain light. After impressing his professors Nash get to work at MIT and advices the Pentagon on code breaking. He is recruited by William Parcher (Ed Harris), an intelligence agent for the CIA. Parcher tells Nash of a plot by the Soviet to blow up a nuclear bomb on US soil and communicate with their sleepers through codes in magazines. Nash forms a relationship with a beautiful woman, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), but as he becomes more paranoid, Nash view of reality is altered.A Beautiful Mind is a slow burning type of film, where the story and the character development is built over time. It is a serious drama that was designed as an actors film. And the actor was really good and that is what you would except from this cast. Crowe was really good and it was believed he lost the Oscar because of his outer acting activities. I really like Jennifer Connelly as an actress and she has shown talent in her roles: the highlight of her performance was when her relationship with Nash starts to break down and flex her acting muscles. Paul Bettany is another actor I really like and his role was to add a little comic relief to the film. And Ed Harris was able to give a more sinister performance, a little like his role in The Truman Show. He is also a little like the spies in The Good Shepherd, even dressing the same.A Beautiful Mind is a film about mental issues, a subject that is hard to be put onto screen because it is an internal issue and people experience it differently. But Howard does his best to visualise it, with Nash hallucinating events, seeing numbers and patterns and codes jump out from the pages. It was when the film truly comes to life when it is relieved that Nash is delusional and how his mind made up its own form of reality.But reading Nash's real story there was some even more strange behaviour. One example was because of his paranoid that he tried to flee America and renounce his American citizenship. Or when he was delusional he when on anti-Semitic rants blaming Jews for World Communism. It is interesting how his delusional were based on Cold War fears and the whole idea of the Red Scare that was common for the period. It was a great way for the right wing to try and keep people in control and force through their agenda: they still do it today. Plus the real Robert Nash had a number of affairs and had a child out of wedlock.Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a good film, but it is typical Oscar bait. 7.5/10.",A Beautiful Mind
67,strong-122-478885,Mathematics & The Higher Truth (or) You Can't Hold A Madman Down,6,20 January 2015,"If you can look well-beyond this bio-film's exaggerated sentimentality, its ""schizophrenia"" whitewashing, and the fact that its story was only very loosely based on the real-life genius/mathematician, John Nash, then, yes, you just might find it's worth sitting all the way through its 135-minute running time (which did, indeed, wear on this viewer's patience more than once).From my perspective - A Beautiful Mind seemed to be more interested in spotlighting Nash's mental illness (and his imaginary friends/alter egos) than it did about concentrating on his amazing ability to crunch all of those numbers.As well - The focus on Nash's relationship with Alicia Larde (unconvincingly played by Jennifer Connelly), who eventually became his wife, certainly had a tendency to become an irksome ""soap opera"" bore, which grated on my nerves, often enough.A Beautiful Mind covers approximately 40 years of Nash's life, from the 1950s to the 1990s, when he was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. Nash is still alive today.Anyways - Regardless of my beefs and believing that this film has really been so over-rated, I still give it a 6-star rating.*Note* - If you have the time - I suggest you Google images of John Nash just to see how his looks compare to those of Russell Crowe's, the actor who portrayed him in this film - And prepare yourself for something of a mild shock-eroo!",A Beautiful Mind
68,dfranzen70,"Powerful, quiet, effortless Crowe",9,23 January 2002,"A Beautiful Mind
Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says ""Russell Crowe"", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a ""hunk"" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",A Beautiful Mind
69,ackstasis,"""I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.""",8,18 February 2007,"John Forbes Nash was an American mathematician, a reclusive but brilliant man who harboured his own share of mysterious demons. 'A Beautiful Mind' first finds him during an informal welcome to Princeton University, alone against the back wall, staring at his own feet. His mind off elsewhere, Nash doesn't even listen to the inspirational introductory speech, but is instead  most likely  contemplating the original mathematical theory that he believes will make him great. Of course, he hasn't formulated this theory yet, but he is so supremely confident of his brilliance that, for him, it is inevitable.Refusing to attend his classes on the basis that they will ""dull your mind"" and ""destroy the potential for authentic creativity,"" Nash spends much of his time in his room, gazing out at the grass courtyard below, furiously chalking on the windows to try and discover an algebraic pattern to the movements of everyday life - a flock of pigeons around scraps of bread, a makeshift football game, the chase of a man who has stolen a purse. Nash is so assuredly confident in his mind's own abilities that he has long learned to ignore the aid of those around him. Upon losing a game of Go to a fellow student, Nash tries desperately to figure out what went wrong, recalling ""I had the first move, my play was perfect,"" before declaring that ""the game is flawed.""This complete dependence upon his own mind makes it even more difficult when Nash is told that he is suffering from schizophrenia. Afterall, if it is his mind itself that is the problem, how could he possibly use his own impeccable logic to solve it? Most likely, Nash decides, it is everybody else who must be wrong.Despite winning the 2000 Best Actor Oscar for ""Gladiator,"" it is in this film that Russell Crowe delivers his greatest performance, announcing unquestionably to the world that he is one of the most gifted talents of his generation. Contrasting starkly with his previous character, Maximus Decimus Meridius, John Nash is shy and softly-spoken, often exhibiting a complete disregard for social conventions.With his first spoken lines, Nash insults a man's choice of necktie, before informing another fellow student that ""there's not one seminal or innovative idea"" in either of his pre-prints. Unaware on how to communicate with women, Nash sometimes matter-of-factly declares to an interested female, ""I don't exactly know what I am required to say in order for you to have intercourse with me. But could we assume that I said all that,"" before requesting that they cut straight to the ""fluid exchange."" This statement is often met with a nasty slap to the face.Nash initially struggles through his time at Princeton University, simply unable to inspire that ""truly original idea"" that is ""the only way he will ever distinguish himself the only way he will ever matter."" He has few friends; his only true support comes from his chatty, laid-back roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany). After graduating from Princeton, Nash becomes a doctor of mathematics, but, to his disgruntlement, his duties include teaching a class. It is here that he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who is able to accept him for the man he is, but soon sets about giving him a ""beautiful heart"" in addition to his ""beautiful mind."" However, Nash's world is suddenly plunged into chaos when a federal agent named Parcher (Ed Harris) approaches him to perform top-secret code-breaking work for the Department of Defense.'A Beautiful Mind' is a haunting and inspirational biopic from Ron Howard (""Apollo 13""), who gives us perhaps his greatest film to date. Adapted by Akiva Goldsman from the biography by Sylvia Nasar, this film features terrific performances from a stellar cast, including a phenomenal Russell Crowe at the top of his game. You could argue that the screenplay sometimes embellishes on the truth for dramatic effect, but this can be easily forgiven in light of the often heart-wrenching drama we witness on screen. After all, like I've always said, ""don't let the truth get in the way of a good story!""",A Beautiful Mind
70,meeza,Simply Gorgeous!,10,2 January 2002,"It was sure a happy day when I decided to see Director Ron Howard's new film `A Beautiful Mind'. This film is one that sure looks good to be one of the best of the year. The film stars Russell Crowe, and it is based on the real life story of John Nash. Nash is an ingenious mathematician who has had to battle with schizophrenia. Crowe's performance should equal another Best Actor Oscar nomination. His work was so good that I would not be surprised if he adds another oscar to his acting awards collection.  If you multiply Crowe's work by the very effective supporting performances by Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer it will not be odd to say that this is the best ensemble acting in film this year; even though I am also divided by the fine ensemble acting of `Memento', `Mulholland Drive' and `Sidewalks of New York'.  Director Ron Howard should also receive a Best Director Oscar nomination, and any academy members who disagrees with his nomination should be subtracted from the board.

71,CubsandCulture,Too handsome for its own good...,8,12 February 2019,"While this film is very moving in its own right a more daring film that didn't ignore the thornier aspects of Nash's life would have been better. Nash's delusions were more outlandish than the film suggests; he thought he was in contact with aliens for example. Likewise, he had affairs (and was arrested for public indecency), was quite mean at times and was possibly anti-Semitic. Nash in the film is too pitiable and awkward to really capture the tenor of this stuff. The resulting film isn't bad but it lacks real weight as a result.I do rather like the trick the screenplay and direction pull off in regards to Nash's delusions vis-a-vis the viewer's expectations. It is an effective, through probably inaccurate, way to capture what paranoia feels like. Howard stages the action in that classic Hollywood way that makes the story involving.The film largely succeeds on Crowe's and Connelly's winning performance. For the type of role he is in Crowe is rather understated. Connelly is just sensuous and heartbreaking in this film.This film has grown on me over the years.",A Beautiful Mind

Russell Crowe ventures on a journey of fear, humiliation and vulnerability, giving a real and moving portrait of a troubled man whose gifts were his downfall... We see him impolite and rude, too smart to have to attend class, lacking social skills, insulting the great ideas of his colleagues, calling their work derivative, and declaring, ""To find a truly original idea is the only way to distinguish myself.""Nash is obsessed with patterns... He spends his days writing perplexing formulas on his dormitory window in search of a breakthrough idea... He gets it one night, while out with his fellow scholars at a local bar where a stunning blond grabs their attention... He recreates the design of a classmate's tie reflecting light through glass... He follows the movements of pigeons as they compete for food... He stares obsessively at too many numbers, and reveals his natural ability helping the Pentagon crack the mathematical codes the Soviets are using...He becomes friend with his roommate, Charles Herman, who is everything he is not  charming and charismatic... He somewhat refines his social manners enough to win the love of a beautiful physics student who would become his wife...Then he begins to look for secret messages in newspapers and magazines, interpreting vague, undecipherable connections between letters and numbers... His mental derangement grows to uncontrolled proportions and the lines between reality and delusion begin to occur as his hallucinations take control of his life in every instant... Nash soon begins to understand the nature of his mental illness and, while he is never cured of his hallucinations behavior, eventually keeps struggling to overcome it...Crowe imparts every facet of John Nash's personality with clarity and feeling... He wins our sympathy merely by showing us a man climbing to the top, falling to the very bottom, and through love and determination fully, recapturing his potential once again...Jennifer Connelly begins to establish herself as a young actress to watch for... She exudes class and sophistication... She makes a marvelous loving wife forced to face the realities of schizophrenia... She tries to do what's best for her husband, but in the face of adversity to take the decision she does, it is inspiring to think that love is the seed of all hope, and what makes the ride worthwhile... Paul Bettany gives another charming turn as Nash's only true friend... He is able to extend any sympathy or understanding, frequently pushing Nash to leave his inquiries for a pizza and beer break...Ed Harris looks nicely menacing in his black fedora... You never know if the man is real, a delusion or both as he constantly drives Nash to the verge of insanity and beyond... Adam Goldberg makes a quiet impression as a Princeton alumnus...Ron Howard evokes the beauty of Nash's mind, and brings us with tenderness, the story of a tortured-genius... His choice to shoot much of the film from Nash's point-of-view is both effective and intriguing...

OK , we get it; the guy is sick and suffers schizoid and paranoid delusions. So did my mother, but I tended to overlook her problems because of her wonderful outstanding qualities. They should have done the same in this film. The scenes depicting Nash's talents and accomplishments were far more inspirational than the cheesy attempts to include us in his delusions. We know he is delusional after the first few scenes with the bogeyman from the CIA or NSA.

The whole mental illness aspect of his life really took me by surprise, simply because I had not read any literature about the movie. While this film is excellent in most technical aspects (and Crowe's performance was certainly beautiful, even if he can't do a southern accent worth a lick), it just didn't feel like the worthiest film nominated for Best Picture. Memento, Lord of the Rings and Blackhawk Down were far superior movies to come out in 2001, it just shows what a little creative public relations work can do for a film.",A Beautiful Mind
80,Boyo-2,A Beautiful Movie,10,17 December 2001,"I think its a good idea to know as little as possible about this movie before seeing it. Now that I've seen it, the commercials on television seem to be giving away too much. With that in mind DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!Its a hard movie to pinpoint. Its not like any other movie I've ever seen, in that a character exists that is not real. John Nash's mind is the reality of the movie and its not until the movie is half over that you realize this and its jarring that you've been taken on a ride with this man's illness, and accepted it as the real world. Its also a very heartbreaking thing.From the middle point, John and you see the world differently because he starts to receive treatment.Russell Crowe does not overdo it for a minute and turns in his customary brilliant performance. Would not surprise me at all if he were to win his second Best Actor Oscar in March 2002. He really is that good.Just as good but with less screen time is the beautiful and beautifully talent Jennifer Connelly, who the world may finally get to see in a mainstream movie. Her chemistry with Crowe is vital to the movie and neither of them disappoint the audience at all in that respect.I enjoyed it immensely and felt like I had seen a movie when it was over.

83,davidmvining,Thin and Trite,5,16 December 2020,"I've never loved this movie. Upon it's original release I liked it fine, but I simply could not understand why it won Best Picture over The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. It was partially pique on my part at the time, but revisiting this film for the first time in over ten years, I was surprised at how muted my reaction to the film was far removed from that ""controversy"". From the beginning of Ron Howard's dramatization of John Nash's life, I felt that the treatment of Nash's mental illness was trite (much in the same way as was in Robert Zemeckis's Welcome to Marwen). As the film continued, I kept wondering why I wasn't getting caught up in this tale, and it took until after the movie was over for me to figure it out.So, John Nash is a brilliant mathematician welcomed to Princeton who has trouble with people. He barely knows how to interact with them, one of his teachers back in West Virginia described him as having two servings of brains and only half a serving of heart. He is so set on finding a new idea that he never goes to class and publishes nothing, spending more time monitoring the movement of birds, trying to determine an algorithm to describe their movements than anything else. It's in this section that we're introduced to John's first hallucination, Charles, his roommate, and the problem becomes rather clear in retrospect.Charles is unlike any other character in the movie. He's extravagantly boorish, having a position in the English department and complaining about DH Lawrence, and he sticks out like a sore thumb. Everyone else feels grounded, but Charles feels like he comes from another zanier movie. This problem gets shared by John's later major hallucination, Parcher, a US government official who brings John into an operation to find hidden messages and codes in periodicals. Everything about Parcher stands out against the reality we discover later. The sets are too big, the technology too outlandish, and the treatment too broad.Now, I think there's an argument to be made that Nash's hallucinations should stand out, but I wouldn't agree with it. Nash spends years with these hallucinations, and since the movie is told from his point of view the audience should feel like the hallucinations are simply a natural fit into the world around them. They do stick out rather horribly, though. This could be less of a problem if these hallucinations were taking on the mantles of different movie genres like a spy thriller with great skill, but the spy thriller stuff is pedestrian at best. It's perfectly serviceable and no more. So we get these scenes that feel like they belong to different movies that probably aren't that good anyway. This uneasy balance between how the movie presents Nash's hallucinations and his reality creates this real friction that keeps the movie from working all that well. Bringing down the outlandishness of Charles and the heightened genre tropes of Parcher, creating more subtle characterizations and scenarios (imagining Parcher's scenes playing out like the recent adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy which was all mood and atmosphere instead of sets and car chases seems like a good idea) could have made this first half work much better.So, the second half operates on the turn that Alicia, John's wife, discovers the depths of John's mental illness and has him committed to a psychiatric hospital. Under the careful watch of the understanding Dr. Rosen, John receives 1950s treatments for schizophrenia including insulin injections. When he's released, he's given medication that dulls him to the point that he can't work, can't really watch their child, and he can't respond to his wife's advances. This is where the movie works best, as the portrait of a genius intentionally cut off from what made him special, and the wife who supports him. As this section played out I envisioned a better movie that started with John getting taken to the hospital and told exclusively from Alicia's point of view. She cannot understand why the off-kilter but genius man she fell in love with has become a raving loon obsessed with hidden messages and a drooling vegetable in equal measures. She loves and gets nothing in return.I think back to Amadeus by Milos Foreman. Told from Salieri's perspective, it was a movie about genius told by a character who was less than that. It was an attempt to understand genius from the point of view of a man who was trying to understand it himself. In the same way I feel that A Beautiful Mind should have been about the balance of genius and mental illness told from the point of view of someone trying to understand it, his wife. As told now, the film genre jumps and ends up feeling trite.So, I say the second half is better, but that's only up to a point. After John refuses to take his medication anymore so he can work, Parcher returns and gets him to restart his work looking for hidden messages. Nash realizes the extent of his illness after a confrontation with Alicia, and he decides to try and seek help, but the movie descends into ""love conquers all"" territory where Alicia and John will sit together and figure out the illness together without the help of doctors and medicine. It's trite. I have no idea if this is how the real John and Alicia dealt with the illness, and I don't care. This feels like Hollywood simplifying mental illness, its problems, and its solutions. If the point of the movie was that the love of Alicia for John helped him out of his illness, then that's what the movie needs to be about from the beginning. Turning the movie in that direction in the final act ends up feeling cheap.Ron Howard is a perfectly competent director, filming what's on the page with skill. However, in my mind, he'll never be more than a passable technician of a director even with some great movies under his belt like Apollo 13 and Rush, and I think A Beautiful Mind highlights that reality. It's well made, but it brings the faults of the screenplay to the screen without a second thought. He feels like a director for hire where if given a great script, he'll make a great movie, but if he's given a subpar script he'll do nothing to make it better. There's a specific moment late in the film that highlights that, I think. Alicia is talking to John as they prepare for him to be taken to the hospital again. She's in the doorway and he's behind the bed. She's asking him if he still sees the people, and the camera points down to focus behind her as Charles' niece briefly runs behind her. The focus on where the girl runs instead of on Alicia with the girl's shape filling the corner of the frame allows for the audience to definitely see the girl, but it feels wrong. John's focus on that moment wasn't the open space next to his wife, it was his wife. Charles' niece should have popped in, not been the focus. Ron Howard is there to film that script to the best of his ability. With A Beautiful Mind, though, the script needed to be rethought completely from the beginning. That this movie rode a wave of praise to Best Picture is an indictment of the Academy and its thinking.I can see the appeal. It's the same kind of broad appeal that makes certain types of comedies huge hits, or giant action spectacles. It's simple storytelling to a low denominator that makes it easy to digest, but the movie's own schizophrenia in terms of how it tells Nash's story (along with a healthy helping of saccharine treatment of the characters, especially early) along with it's complete unwillingness to challenge the audience makes it a surprisingly dull affair for me.Now, having said all that, it seems like I hated the film. I didn't. It's okay, and that is really driven by performance. Russell Crowe is really quite good as Nash, embodying the character with tics that help him blend in. I do wish he had dropped a few more pounds because it's hard to hide the fact that Crowe is a big guy when he's playing someone who barely eats, but that's a minor thing. Jennifer Connelly as Alicia brings a woundedness to her character that works quite well. Ed Harris is appropriately menacing as Parcher. I don't really like Paul Bettany as Charles, though. A lot of my problems with Charles stem from Bettany's performance.This could have been something special. Instead it's thin Hollywood entertainment that, I don't think, has particularly stood the test of time all that well.",A Beautiful Mind
84,Spleen,Ron Howard finally makes it,8,20 August 2002,"Some spoilers follow.To judge from his previous films, Ron Howard doesn't like smart people much, doesn't trust intelligence as a trait and thinks little of thinking as an activity.  How did he come to present a sympathetic account of the career of a genius? However he did it, he did it; and for the first time in his career he's made a genuinely good film.On the surface this is ideal material for the old Ron Howard, the director of ""Parenthood"" and ""Apollo 13"" and ""EdTV"" who longs for opportunities to sink the boot into intellectuals and urge his audience to be at least moderately stupid. Nash is mentally brilliant, yes, but that (according to a superficial analysis of what happens) is his very undoing: he suffers from schizophrenia, and is prone to both paranoid fantasies and vivid hallucinations. That's what comes of having a beautiful mind. Far better to have a dull, unattractive one. ...Only that's not what the film is saying. Nash finds away around his difficulties not because he agrees to be stupid, but because he's able to remain clever; he works out (by thinking about it) that certain of the people he sees do not in fact exist, and thinks of effective ways of ignoring them. And anyway, ARE the hallucinations and the paranoia merely manifestations of the very same mental states that allow Nash to have his mathematical insights? Not at all. Some of the other mathematicians we see are, say, half as clever as Nash, but they're not half as schizophrenic; indeed, so far as we can tell, they're not schizophrenic at all. We're also told that Nash's main problem was that his condition wasn't diagnosed until too late and that this was because he grew up and lived in an environment that ENCOURAGED paranoid delusions. If Nash had a genuinely mental failing it wasn't that he was too clever, but that in certain respects he wasn't clever enough - wasn't able to see through the flimsy Cold War propaganda which many of his contemporaries DID see through; but of course, these people were stupid in THEIR own way, as we all are.But whatever the precise message, it's a good film.  (Let's pretend that the epilogue in which Nash wins the Nobel Prize wasn't included, as it shouldn't have been; it's a glaring irrelevance on the face of a movie that otherwise clearly knows what it's about.) I particularly like the rug-pulling halfway through. We know immediately that the cloak-and-dagger spycraft story isn't real; the details are just too ridiculous, and the situation is just too obviously a response to Nash's unfulfilled desire to fight communism. But the obviousness of this illusion simply helps mask the subtlety of the other one: Nash's imaginary roommate. We ought to have suspected him, for a variety of reasons. But we didn't. At least, I didn't.I wish the movie hadn't dumbed down its characters' ideas so much, but it gets away with doing so because it concentrates its real attention elsewhere, and it does what it REALLY wants to do very well indeed.",A Beautiful Mind
85,nycritic,A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Lose.,9,25 August 2005,"The story of John Forbes Nash doesn't seem like the subject matter anyone would want to make a film of, but Ron Howard brings forth his life-story in a way that makes one forget he was also the man behind 80s fluff such as SPLASH and WILLOW.A life destined to excel once he discovers and cracks his ""game theory,"" John Forbes Nash is, however, a man disconnected with his surroundings and reality. He can't even approach a girl without fumbling his way through an especially creepy introduction, and at the same time he can't stand losing a simple mind-game with his friend. At the same time, four other people make their appearances in Nash's life and all three are destined to change his life forever.The first of them is a college friend Charlie (Paul Bettany of GANGSTER NO. 1) who later introduces Nash to his young daughter Marcee, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), whom he marries, and a sinister figure: William Parcher (Ed Harris). Parcher has special designs for Nash: he wants him to use his keen code-cracking skills for special top-secret assignments involving the Russians and other obscure elements and on one night Nash gets to see just how dangerous the enemy is as he and Parcher are shot at after Nash delivers some information to a strange mansion posing as an intelligence office.It's not long before Nash becomes consumed with finding the perfect code and aided by the omni-present Parcher, who supplies Nash with a security code embedded into his own skin, he dives headlong into a nightmare of numbers and codes and soon enough collapses into full-fledged schizophrenia which will require shock treatment and an arduous recovery period. Alicia, instead of moving on, forcefully stays by his side even when he has a dangerous regression and almost kills their baby child.Stories like this require a tight script and thorough knowledge of the circumstance of mental illness as well as the person in question, in this case Nash. Howard directs Nash's progressive descent into his mental breakdown with ease and in a way where we're not sure if anyone who surrounded Nash is real -- the way he introduces Charlie, Marcee, and especially Parcher and the covert office is spectacular and shows just how strong schizophrenia can be in inducing its victims to completely believe what they are seeing and hearing.And then there are the performances. I don't think I need to say anything which hasn't been said of Russell Crowe. He is, right now, the only living actor who has the guts and balls to put his masculinity aside and dive head-first into the roles he plays. His screen presence oozes a magnetic, masculine power (and in one scene it's clear the man is built) but that doesn't overcome his characterization of Nash. If anything, he uses his physicality as an asset to clumsily walk around, and there is one scene later in the movie when he has returned to teach classes. He walks with the shuffle of someone who's lost in his own world. It would be hard-pressed for anyone to see the staccato waddle and the glazed eyes that he wouldn't be talking to himself in full-fledged conversations, and the hippie who mocks him, unnoticed, expresses Anyone's reaction. We know this is a genius, but one who has become damaged goods.Then there's Jennifer Connelly. An actress who as of yet has avoided selling out to blatant commercialism, her presence is as powerful as Crowe's. Quiet but intense, she is the foundation of which Crowe's feet rest on and without her he might as well be dead. Just one scene, when she is about to discover just how crazy her husband is and his colleagues are trying to stop her: just watch her reel around and casually but with authority slap one of them squarely in the face and continue on, undeterred. Marvelous acting. Her Oscar is justified.The entire supporting cast is uniformly brilliant. Ed Harris nails his creepy role as the imaginary Parcher. Paul Bettany gives off friendly dependency -- the friend who won't go away, even though he, too, isn't real. Judd Hirsch, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer provide solid support in small roles.A complex movie about mental illness as well as the power of love and the triumph of the soul (even if love -- the devotion between Alicia and John -- is excruciatingly strained at times), A BEAUTIFUL MIND is truly, a beautiful experience and justly won the Oscar for Best Movie and Director and should have also won Best Actor, but Russell Crowe will stick around for quite some time giving powerhouse performances. He is one strong actor to follow. I know I will.",A Beautiful Mind
86,eric262003,"Credit For Effort, But Far From Greatness",6,29 November 2010,"Granted, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is nowhere close to a classic and certainly not one of 2001's best film. But the hard work and effort put into this movie by Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman should not go ignored. Especially Goldsman who was responsible for that god-awful fallacy that is ""Batman and Robin"". This biopic follows the life of mathematical genius with a mental illness, John Nash the many obstacles he conquered over the years. I won't delve into the plot too much as there's a major plot twist in the midway point of the movie that turns the tables on the scenes before it.Heard from other people around me, ""A Beautiful Mind"" historical portrayal of John Nash is not 100% in terms of accuracy, but I was willing to forgive that knowing that a movie had many times before this one has utilized exaggerated dramatic effect to appeal to the mass. In fact, I'm giving praise of the structure it was to making this movie and what its intentions were which was to marvel at a mentally ill man's triumphs to win the prestigious Nobel Prize in 1994. So in way this movie can come across as a well-effort feel-good movie in its own merits.Although hands off for the efforts of Howard's direction and Goldsman's script, it is not the real reason why this film is just average. I don't even think they should earned the Oscars awards they unceremoniously received. Howard lacks in subtlety and just can't get his grip on a simple planned drama. Many of the scene's emotional stages are overdone and cliché laden, like breaking stuff in anger, crying and pouting, nothing really new here. But to be fair I will say that the pacing was reasonable, and it feels as the scenes progress it looks very immaculate.The last and final minutes is the weakest scene. Sure I was proud when Nash finally won the Nobel Prize, but it's the clichéd heartfelt speech that made me cringe and it clearly neglects what the movie was originally intended to accomplish. Sure Howard wasn't trying to spoonfeed us with how the film plods along, but to spoil us with the obvious message could have easily been handled earlier in the movie instead of dragging on for two hours. Okay now that I've pointed most of the bad points of this movie, I still thought it had plenty to offer to the audience. It comes from the scintillating performances by Russell Crowe as mentally unbalanced John Nash and Jennifer Connolly as his wife Alicia Larde Nash who just amazed me and had me begging her for more screen time. It's a crying shame that we know very little about her and what she did in her lifetime that she was providing for him in his later years. Crowe captures the essence of Nash's character, but his tics look more like acting rather than playing it natural. There was a very meager love story between John and Alicia, and there's no purpose as to why she's smitten for Nash.Schizophrenia is the main topic dealt with in the movie. And even though I have Aspberger's Syndrome, which is another mental illness, I have some knowledge of what it's like to carry a burden like what Mr. Nash carries. I guess I could say this movie fends off some of the misconceptions other movie's have dealt with on the topic of this illness this one might come the closest to being the most accurate in its portrayal.Sure it may have a Hollywood feel to the premise, the intentions of ""A Beautiful Mind"" are credited for taking the approach sensitively.",A Beautiful Mind
87,philip_vanderveken,"Maths can drive you crazy, I've always known it! :-)",9,25 November 2004,"At first I had my reservations about this movie. I never liked mathematics at school, so why should I watch a movie with a mathematician as the main character in it? Well, it may not have convinced me of the use of mathematics, but at least it convinced me that maths is able to drive you crazy (as if I didn't already know that for years).No, serious now. It sure may seem a very boring movie and I'm not the kind of person that wants to see all bio-pics that have ever been made, but this time I was really surprised by it. I found it really intriguing to see how the schizophrenia took over the man's life. It was fascinating, yet also uncomfortable to see. This may well be the strongest as well as the weakest point of this movie. The strongest point because it gives you something to think about, the weakest because it seems to me (after reading some comments on this website) not many people still feel the urge to think while watching a movie. If there aren't any big explosions, guns and special effects to be seen, they are no longer interested in it. Personally I liked the movie very much. Russel Crowe did a great job as Dr. Nash, but the other actors' performances weren't any less. All in all I would recommend this movie to anybody who isn't afraid to use his mind for a few moments during a movie and who doesn't need any special effects in a movie before believing it was a good one.

92,Takethispunch,Awesome acting.,10,18 December 2016,"In 1947, John Nash (Crowe) arrives at Princeton University. He is co- recipient, with Martin Hansen (Lucas), of the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship for mathematics. At a reception, he meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Richard Sol (Goldberg), Ainsley (Jason Gray-Stanford), and Bender (Rapp). He also meets his roommate Charles Herman (Bettany), a literature student.Nash is under extreme pressure to publish, but he wants to publish his own original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates ""every man for himself"", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. Nash develops a new concept of governing dynamics and publishes an article on this. On the strength of this, he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him.Some years later, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to crack encrypted enemy telecommunication. Nash can decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other decrypters. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by his mysterious supervisor, William Parcher (Harris) of the United States Department of Defense. He is to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns and believes he is followed when he delivers his results to a secret mailbox.",A Beautiful Mind
93,DeeNine-2,Excellent Hollywood-ized version of the man and his madness,9,7 May 2006,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, ""A Brilliant Madness"" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more ""real"" than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it ""pizza pie."" There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc.Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and to his accomplishments.",A Beautiful Mind

Also, I heard that Mr. Nash is a gay man kind of? Or at least he ""experimented""? That was LEFT OUT of the film. I liked the way Russell Crowe didn't play a TOUGH GUY in this. Instead, he played a quirky kind of nutcase. He jitters, he mutters and he rambles about stuff. The makeup to make him look OLD was very interesting. I was astonished at that!! All in all, I wish I had seen this earlier. I was in Tulsa all weekend and am kind of woozey as I write this.",A Beautiful Mind
95,sme_no_densetsu,A unique film and one of Ron Howard's best,8,17 May 2017,"Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-nominated biography of American mathematician John Nash. Beginning at Princeton University in the late 1940's, the movie focuses on his early contributions to economic theory and his subsequent, prolonged struggle with mental illness.As is often the case with biographical films, the script is fairly loosely based on the actual events. Some may take exception to this but I feel that the changes serve a valid dramatic purpose. Additionally, the means of portraying Nash's mental state required some artistic license. Again, I feel that this is handled effectively, though who really knows if it's particularly reflective of Nash's actual experiences?In any case, the story is an involving one that spans many years. The factual basis provided an intriguing foundation for screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to construct a script that puts the viewers in Nash's shoes. The paranoid atmosphere of 1950's America supplies an ideal backdrop for Nash's unravelling sanity while the aftermath is just as interesting. It should be noted that Goldsman was rewarded with an Oscar for his efforts.Of course, much of the credit for bringing Nash to life must go to Russell Crowe. Fresh off his Oscar win for ""Gladiator"", Crowe found himself nominated for an Oscar for the third year in a row, this time for perhaps the best performance of his career. He wasn't on his own, though. The lovely & talented Jennifer Connelly took home an Oscar for her portrayal of Nash's devoted wife. The supporting cast wasn't bad either, featuring Ed Harris & Paul Bettany in memorable roles along with the likes of Judd Hirsch, Christopher Plummer & Adam Goldberg.Ron Howard's direction is solid, as usual, though I'm not convinced that he deserved to win the Oscar that year over some very tough competition. Nevertheless, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a well directed film, both visually and performance-wise. The Oscar-nominated score by James Horner is also notable, as is the Oscar-nominated makeup that convincingly aged Crowe & others over the course of decades.All in all, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an effective film that ranks as one of Ron Howard's best in a career studded with several crowd-pleasers. Arguments could certainly be made for other films as being more deserving of 2001's Best Picture Oscar but the movie was by no means undeserving. Just don't go into it expecting stringent adherence to the facts.",A Beautiful Mind

While I am giving it a 9/10, that doesn't mean too much as far as whether you should see it or not.  It's a must watch.  I'm giving it a slightly lowered rating for some sketchy acting from our two main stars.  It's nothing really wrong with how they act per se. But...Spoilers???1.  I found Russells punch at the end of the movie lacking in any emotional depth.  Perhaps this was due to the screenplay. 2.  I also found (and I like Jennifer alot) Jenn's emotional scene's with Russell seem's a little forced.  Jennifer did really well in Requiem For A Dream.  I wish she'd carry a little of that into her other roles.  Or perhaps it's because Crowe's a better actor than Jennifer.  So much so that perhaps it shows.But really, all that doesn't matter much to me as I loved the movie.  I knew Ed Harris wasn't real, but Paul Bettany's character (he was great in A Knights Tale.  Bout the only thing that was great) was a total surprise.9/10Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10",A Beautiful Mind
98,mattymatt4ever,A Beautiful Film,9,26 March 2002,"Though this movie looked pretty good in the previews, I wasn't entirely anxious to see it until Oscar time was approaching.  Until then, I felt ""In the Bedroom"" deserved the Best Picture Oscar, Tom Wilkinson for Best Actor and Marisa Tomei for Best Supporting Actress.  I just had the impression that ""A Beautiful Mind"" would be one of those overblown melodramas that suck up to the Academy.  Well, after finally watching this film, my opinions were altered completely.  I'm sure if Russell Crowe didn't start any emotional outbursts, he would've certainly won for Best Actor.  I love Denzel Washington, and he was great in ""Training Day,"" but he played a ruthless villain and his role didn't have many dimensions.  As Richard Roeper said, Denzel had the opportunity to ham it up a little.  But I guess the Academy wanted to be PC this year and have two African-American actors--him and Halle Berry--step up to the podium.  But I'm still grateful that the movie won Best Picture and Ron Howard (finally!) won Best Director. 
Crowe not only had to fake an American accent, but also fake a West Virginian accent--one that I imagine even an American actor would have difficulty with.  He is incredible as the schizophrenic John Nash, who you feel a deeper sympathy for as the film moves along.  Lots of actors have played mentally challenged characters, but schitzophrenia is a disorder with many dimensions and Crowe was entirely believable.  I'm sure he did tons of research for the role, and it shows.  Jennifer Connelly is a charming, slightly underrated actress who many are unfamiliar with simply because she's starred in mainly independent works.  She is not only beautiful to watch, but gives the best performance of her career, and her Oscar is well-deserved.  The film is long, but never overlong.  I was so fully engaged, journeying through the brilliant but troubled mind of John Nash, that time ceased to exist.  And of course, anytime a brilliant film like this is released, there's always going to be a cult interested in reducing the hype by pointing out minor flaws in the story.  According to these people, the film failed to include certain elements of Nash's life, making it not entirely accurate.  This a movie!  Not a documentary!  Have you ever seen a biopic that was ENTIRELY accurate?  I don't know much about Nash's life.  All I know is his life inspired a wonderful motion picture.  Hell, I can point out certain flaws myself.  The speech Nash gives at the end was obviously doctored for dramatic purposes and I'm pretty sure the librarians at Nash's college would've kicked him out the library for marking up their windows. But this is such an amazing, touching film that I really don't care, and I'm sure most audiences will feel the same way.  My score:  9 (out of 10)",A Beautiful Mind
99,hall895,Beautiful indeed,8,26 October 2010,"Mathematical genius John Nash is a man whose life story seems tailor-made for a movie. Of course once Hollywood gets its hands on anyone's story true-life details are changed, things are jazzed up to make things seem more dramatic than they actually were. In A Beautiful Mind though the Hollywood treatment works and is actually quite understandable. In order for his film to succeed director Ron Howard had to somehow take us inside the mind of the schizophrenic John Nash. Howard pulls this off brilliantly and that more than anything else is what enables the film to succeed. It's not the entirely true story of John Nash's life but it's close enough. And the story that is presented here is undeniably compelling, dramatic and entertaining. It was a very challenging story to tell and Howard, helped no doubt by his stellar cast, pulls it off wonderfully. A Beautiful Mind is a rousing success.In order for this film to work the actor portraying the brilliant but troubled Nash would have to be rather brilliant himself. And Russell Crowe is definitely up to the task. He hits all the right notes, capturing the tremendous highs and terrifying lows of Nash's life. From the young man we first meet at Princeton to the old man who has accomplished and overcome so much it is an incredible journey for John Nash. And Crowe is dead-on perfect throughout. He makes you believe in John Nash and makes you understand what is going on inside his mind. What exactly is going on inside that mind? A very complicated question that but the film portrays Nash in a way that draws you in and makes you pull for him as he battles his own inner demons.Nash himself is obviously the film's most important character and thus Crowe's performance the most important and ultimately the most memorable. But this is a film in which the acting is uniformly terrific. After Crowe it is Jennifer Connelly who would be the next real standout with her portrayal of Nash's wife Alicia. Through all the ups and downs Alicia is right there with John and Connelly turns in a powerful, highly charged, emotional performance. The strength of both the actress and the character she portrays adds so much to the film. Also noteworthy is Ed Harris who gets to portray a mysterious, menacing character around whom much of the film's drama swirls. And the list of fine performances goes on and on. Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Josh Lucas...every performer plays their part so well. All the performances combine with a great, fascinating story to make this a film which captivates throughout. Not every great story makes for a great movie. This one does.",A Beautiful Mind
100,gftbiloxi,Adept Performances Redeem Uneven Film,5,24 April 2005,"Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and an strong supporting cast offer extraordinary performances in A BEAUTIFUL MIND--and fortunately so, for the subject of the film has undergone a Hollywood homogenization that renders the film both timid and tepid. Still worse, both script and direction are unfocused, and much of the film is taken up with a tricksy plot device calculated to manipulate viewers into an unexpected identification with Nash's mental illness.The plot device in question is one recently seen in a number of plot-driven films such as THE SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS; here, however, it proves extremely transparent and feels out of place, and since it requires the film to shift gears several times it contributes to the film's lack of flow. Moreover, it has the effect of presenting the nature of Nash's illness in very glossy terms that fail to really reflect the seriousness of his condition. It has ""santitized for your protection"" feel typical of director Ron Howard's work.But when the cast has opportunity to shine it shines with considerable brilliance, and in spite of the film's numerous flaws the actors hold the attention from start to finish. I have never been a fan of Russell Crowe, and I found his performance in the earliest scenes a bit artificial, but he quickly comes to grips with the role and delivers a powerhouse performance that remains in mind long after the film ends. Jennifer Connelly is equally powerful as wife Alicia, and the supporting cast (which includes Ed Harris, Judd Hirsch, and Christopher Plummer) is extremely fine. This is not a great film, but it does contain great performances, and I recommend it on that basis.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",A Beautiful Mind
101,jhclues,A Beautiful Film,10,8 January 2002,"As we go about our daily rituals and routines of living, in our own individual way, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are conforming to what we know to be the reality of our existence; a tangible, substantive reality we recognize, understand and trust.  And our senses provide the proof of that reality.  If we can see it, we can believe it-- which we do, and with good reason.  It's real.  But then again, what is `real' to one person isn't necessarily real to another, because there are instances in which an individual's `reality' exists only within the boundaries of his own mind, in a shadowland not unlike what many would think of as the Twilight Zone.  Only this place is not the creation of Rod Serling, but a very real place which exists-- with parameters set according to the individual-- within the mind of a schizophrenic.  And it is to that place that director Ron Howard takes us in `A Beautiful Mind,' starring Russell Crowe.	Crowe plays John Nash, a mathematical genius, who since the late forties has left his mark on such prestigious bastions of knowledge as MIT and Princeton, and whose `Equilibrium n-tuple' is perhaps the most important idea in noncooperative game theory ever conceived; equilibrium strategies being the things we predict about people.  It's not been an easy road for Nash, however.  As he himself puts it, he doesn't like people much; nor do they, in general, like him.  And it's made constructive social interaction something of a problem for him throughout his life.  Beginning as early as his student days at Princeton, he was noticeably `different,' not only in his relationships with others, but in the way he conducted his academic pursuits.  Even within his small group of friends-- fellow students-- he is a challenge.  He seems able to open up only to a select few:  His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), being the first and foremost, and later the somewhat mysterious Government agent, William Parcher (Ed Harris), whom Nash first encounters while involved in a project at the Pentagon, and eventually one of his students, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  Nevertheless, his future is filled with promise, but in the early 50s, while doing some covert work for Parcher, the mental illness which will devastate his life becomes apparent, and his life takes an unexpected turn into that shadowland that will test the loyalty of even those who love him the most.	One of the reasons for Ron Howard's success as a director is that he understands human nature and has the ability to convey his insights to his audience.  He knows how to express the inner-most feelings of his characters in a way in which the viewer will be able to identify and relate.  And this film is no exception.  In bringing John Nash's story to the screen, he concentrates on the man, rather than the illness, and it's that which makes this such riveting drama.  While we get a glimpse of the physical horrors of schizophrenia, it's in witnessing the devastating and debilitating effects of it on Nash and those close to him that makes the film so emotionally involving.  Howard seems to be saying, this is a man's `life' we're dealing with, not just an academic case study; it's the humanity of the story that's important-- and that's exactly what he delivers.  He tells the story in a way that allows the viewer to empathize with Nash, as well as those around him, and he makes Nash a sympathetic character without resorting to any mawkish sentimentality.  Howard gives you Nash as he is, an individual of extraordinary ability, with achievements and problems to match, and presented within a framework that is very real and entirely effective.	As Nash, Russell Crowe once again demonstrates that he is so much more than just a celebrity or a `movie star,' but an actor in the truest and purest sense of the word.  When you can watch an actor doing a part and completely forget that what you're watching is a performance, you know the work is exceptional, which is exactly what Crowe is here.  The story follows Nash through a span of close to fifty years, and the aging process is presented seamlessly by Crowe, who takes his character from youth to old age quite naturally and so subtly, that as you're watching you don't even give it a thought until, at the end, you suddenly realize that you've just experienced a man's entire life.  Howard and some outstanding makeup work must take some of the credit, of course, but beyond that it's Crowe who sells it, who makes it so real and brings Nash so credibly to life.  It's a performance that has Oscar written all over it, and deservedly so.  	After a string of outstanding performances in a number of films (like `Requiem For A Dream' and `Waking the Dead'), Jennifer Connelly should finally receive some of the acclaim she is due with her portrayal of Alicia. Early in the film she effectively plays to her natural, dark beauty, but this is decidedly not a glamorous role, and as the story progresses Connelly successfully manages a much deeper expression of who her character really is and what she is made of.  It's an emotionally challenging role, and she certainly rises to the occasion.  And, like Crowe, she develops her character quite naturally, not only physically, but through a maturity of manner and perspective, as well.  It's a good piece of work, and if justice prevails she will receive the notice she deserves for it, because it's definitely one of the many strengths of the film.	The supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (Dr. Rosen), Adam Goldberg (Sol), Vivien Cardone (Marcee), Judd Hirsch (Helinger) and Josh Lucas (Hansen) .  Thought provoking and emotionally stirring, `A Beautiful Mind' is, in the final analysis, a beautiful film, rich in it's humanity, and a journey that should not be missed.

To write review of this movie is to make sense of what I have understood about this mental illness in short.First of all I would like to talk about this movie. The movie is great, still to have clear idea regarding this illness I would suggest you to see a documentary. I did saw documentary named 'John Nash – A Brilliant madness'.It's every day struggle for the people suffering from this disease. They have to become strong and learn to distinguish between delusions, hallucinations and truth. The one who learns and adopt this practice overcomes and manages to become stable. This peculiar feature also highlights in john, and is shown nicely.After watching the movie and documentary, I concluded the movie to be little away from happened incidence in John Nash life. It seemed to me Russell Crowe was wrong choice. He was brilliant but when you see the documentary you see a totally different John.Having such illness, it becomes burden on one's family and colleagues, the social relations and family who takes care do worth much more are rare to find, as shown in movie.Everything in this world, living beings, non- living beings, beings which are conscious and beings which are not conscious have working relation between them that can be projected via rules of maths.

106,jon.h.ochiai,Something extraordinary,10,22 January 2002,"Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an extraordinary movie with a powerful performance from Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash. John Nash is the Princeton mathematician who wrote the founding paper on game theory, and has battled schizophrenia almost his entire adult life. In Crowe's acceptance speech at the Golden Globes, he said that ""...Hopefully, we made a movie that made you believe that something extraordinary is possible."" Director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, and a talented cast have done so. Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman created a story about humanity, and a touching love story. Goldsman streamlined some of the events of Silvia Nasar's book, and maintained coherence. Howard does not compromise on the perception of the young John Nash, who was a genius, and also an arrogant loner-- not good with people. At the same time we have compassion for Nash's plight given an enlightened view of schizophrenia. The scene in which we discover Nash's condition is purely masterful on Howard's part. Nash's journey is amazing.Russell Crowe is simply awesome. He can convey what is in Nash's mind with either a look or in dialog. Crowe has such a range of intensity, and is always believable. Crowe's Nash ages 50 years over the course of the movie. At the core of the movie is a great love story. Jennifer Connelly is a revelation as Alicia Nash, John's wife. Connelly as Alicia says that John ""transforms into the man that she loves."" Connelly's Alicia has such a capacity for courage and doing what is right. She loves John. She stands by him and raises their family. Her Alicia suffers and remains strong. There are also great supporting performances from Christopher Plummer as Nash's psychiatrist, and from Ed Harris and Paul Bettany. John Nash won the Nobel Prize in 1994 and continues to teach at Princeton. He still accepts and deals with schizophrenia. This is very touching and truly a triumph of the human spirit.

108,Holt344,"A Beautiful Mind is a masterpiece, beautifully told and acted",10,27 January 2021,"A Beautiful Mind was directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldman.
The film has Russell Crowe in the leading role with Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, and Christopher Plummer in supporting roles.The story begins in Nash's days as a graduate student at Princeton University. John Nash fields were Economics and Mathematics, a very smart and award winning mathematician, his life wasn't always like that. In his early days of a scientist, he began to develop paranoid schizophrenia.
It's a sad but fascinating story, Russell Crowe brought justice to John Nash who unfortunately died in a car accident in 2015.Ron Howard's direction is superb, and so was Akiva Goldman's screenplay. They deserved their Oscars, and the Best Picture was also won rightfully. The movie is incredible and I now wonder why I have never watched it before, but I'm grateful I did.I loved the way that they shot some of the scenes, many of them were great. Incredible cinematography throughout the film. The editing was superb.
The sound mixing and design were great, but James Horner's musical score was insanely powerful and incredible.At the end of the movie you will appreciate the performance Russell Crowe did to the fullest, he did a marvelous job, possibly the best of his career. Jennifer Connelly portrayed Alicia Nash and won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, well deserved as she gave so much life and heart to the character. It wasn't a mind blowing performance but I believe she got the mannerism and did the real person justice.A Beautiful Mind deserved its best picture, it's possibly one of the best movies I have seen in 2021, and yeah I can't believe it's turning 20 years old.

109,rzajac,I can see why some think this flick is overrated. But...,9,27 July 2014,"I can see why some think this flick is overrated. And, in some ways perhaps it is. But......buried in the arguably over-slick and buttons-pushing production is a profound metaphor, and as the storyline ramps up, the message is unmistakable. It has to do with the flimsiness of the dividing line between public and private psychoses. It's an important and ever-relevant idea, and its nice that it occurred to someone that a major motion picture might be a good venue for broaching it.I can think of two applications of this principle: Evangelical Christian environments, and--as directly addressed in this flick--""cold war"" (now ""terrorist"") paranoia.The Andrea Yates story, where a woman drowned her 5 kids rather than suffer the torture of ""knowing"" that she'd screw them up and condemn them to perdition, is NOT a story about how religion drove a woman crazy. But the truth is, in a way, worse: It's a story about the blurring of the line between public and private psychoses; about how her church milieu willingly *masked* her break with reality. Yates's insanity reflects back on a social phenomenon that doesn't have the wherewithal to deal with the very thing it for which it vaunts itself to be equipped: After all, Christianity has its origins in the story of a man who, among other things, dealt effectively with mentally ill people. But all that's just a dim ancient myth as large swaths of contemporary Christian church culture now plow along, blithely aiding and abetting mental illness.And the story of A Beautiful Mind deals roughly the same blow to the mass psychosis of paranoia about the ""other"", the nemesis, the enemy, somewhere out there, lurking, waiting to pounce, elsewhere in the world.The sad part of these systems is how a negative, aberrant minority uses these institutions, and exploits the permeability between the social/private minds, to produce societal effects that are as apparently tangible and eminently true as they are palpably life-disaffirming.I think the above interpretation summarizes the particular limb that Opie crawled out on, at great expense, to cinematically showcase.And, to reiterate my opening thought; yes, A Beautiful Mind is a kind of The Sound of Music with mathematics; with all the negative critique implications implied. But the work is crowned with the redeeming trait of its having shed light on perhaps the most important challenge facing decent society.",A Beautiful Mind

Russell Crowe mastered his role in this film, making you fall in love with his character and making your heart break for him. Jennifer Connelly also played her part with a graceful skill of perfection. This film was very well done.

In part, I think its popularity helped it to win an Oscar, and it's an over-rated film in my opinion. (I don't think this film deserved an Oscar because there were equally good or better films produced that year.) It's good, but I've seen better.

It's the true story about John Nash, a mathematician who is brilliant and also quite schizophrenic. He saw secret codes everywhere, including many that weren't there. I haven't read much about Nash, so am not certain how factual this is. This is Russell Crowe's best work yet. It's difficult to play an insane person, but he pulls off playing John Nash very nicely.

It was simply an extraordinary performance of Crowe. Take the film 'Gladiator' and compare to this one, and you will agree that nowadays Russell Crowe is among the best three outstanding actors of present days.

122,raymond-15,Excellent portrayal of a deranged mind.,8,8 November 2004,"A beautiful mind, a lonely mind, a tormented mind, a frightened mind, a rebellious mind....Russell Crowe portrays in vivid yet controlled detail the degeneration of a mind in turmoil....a sick mind overcome with schizophrenia. Fidgety mannerisms are not pleasant to watch and they grow in number as the malady takes hold. Imagined presence of colleagues at the University where he teaches mathematics and imagined conversations with them suggest that his brain is playing tricks with him. A top psychiatrist called in to examine him confirms his schizophrenia. After undergoing the bizarre shock treatment, the mathematician goes on a course of medication with little promise of cure.The intriguing part of this film is the confusion arising between real characters and imagined characters. This is intentional for we are seeing life through the eyes of a man suffering terribly from mental illness. It is disturbing to watch, yet fascinating. It makes you feel uncomfortable. Watch closely and you will see patterns on a window pane and patterns of shadows across a flight of steps and patterns taking shape in a jumble of letters of coded text. It is almost as if the mind is too active. And lurking in the shadowy background there is always a threatening figure watching him...or is he just imagined? Trying to reason with such an afflicted person is almost impossible. Much of the mental agony is suffered by persons close to him. Just imagine how difficult it must be to live with a person who can scarcely differentiate between what is real and what is imagined. Here is a man who does not believe in luck but who believes that everything can be explained by some mathematical equation. In life he says there are many equations to be solved, but adds the most mysterious of all is the equation of love. In the hands of the make-up artists Russell Crowe makes a wonderful and absolutely believable Mr. John Nash. Indeed his whole portrayal of Mr. Nash's life is most creditable and truly worthy of an Academy Award.",A Beautiful Mind

The films start is all about what is real and what is not. Is Nash really a part of secret government code breaking group or does he just imagine all it and so on and so forth. That really is the best part of the film. After the reality and fiction become separated we are shown so mush syrup, that only Ron Howard is capable of doing that.This film wouldn't work without Crowes performance as disillusioned Nash, but he has great supporting cast. Jennifer Connelly does great job as Nashes' wife, who tries to understand be supportive.

124,Christian_Dimartino,A chilling and extraordinary film.,10,20 July 2011,"Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances in the 2001 best picture winner, A Beautiful mind. Even though it wasn't my favorite film of the year, it was still one of that years best, and remains a masterpiece, even if people deny it so.Crowe plays Professor John Nash, a man with a brilliantly dangerous mind. He believes that some government agents(including Ed Harris) have been asking him to go on missions. But after people realize that he's crazy, its up to his wife(Jennifer Connelly) to try to cope with him.One of the best things about A Beautiful mind is the acting. Crowe's performance is haunting, Connelly's performance is also haunting, but in a different way, and Harris' performance is at times chilling. Actually, I found the film to be rather chilling.A Beautiful mind is a dark and thrilling drama that will have you until the last twenty minutes which sort of go out the window. But the other two hours of the film is enthralling, and with a twist that I doubt you'll ever see coming.Some critics didn't think it deserved the Oscar when it came out back in 2001, and it wouldn't have been my top choice. I would've chosen The Lord of the rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. But A Beautiful mind would've been my second choice. Its a work of art.A",A Beautiful Mind

126,FlickJunkie-2,"Brilliant filmmaking, superb acting",10,14 August 2002,"Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years.  With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves.  Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama.  He has a intuitive understanding of character motivation and is excellent at making his characters elicit strong emotions in the viewer.  This is particularly true in this film.The story is based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who suffered from schizophrenia.  The film gives us a unique first person perspective of the disease, drawing us into his world and allowing us to see what Nash sees.  Howard's presentation is brilliant.  At first Nash is presented as a bit eccentric, but lucid.  As we experience his world, reality and illusion are so perfectly intertwined that we are not sure where the world ends and the mind begins.  By fooling the audience Howard makes the subtle point that to the schizophrenic it all seems real. In attempting to evaluate Nash's world we get a distant understanding of the confusion that results when a rational person attempts to cope with a world that is part real and part hallucination.While this is a biopic, it is more fiction than fact.  A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease.  The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood.  Included in the DVD is footage of the actual Nobel ceremony and no speeches were given.  Yet, we can forgive the latitude taken because the story is so inspirational.From a production standpoint, special note must be given to the makeup department, which ages Russell Crowe so magnificently.  As the movie progresses through four decades, Nash is realistically depicted and aged appropriately.  Likewise, the art department does a fine job rendering four different periods, matching costumes, props and sets to the times.Yet, with all the fine production values, this film excels most in the acting.  Russell Crowe turns in a career performance in a career abundant in great performances.  This character is the antithesis of the Russell Crowe we've come to expect.  Instead of strong, tough and balanced, with a sharp worldly intelligence, he plays an eccentric and convoluted man with quirks, nervous habits and a psyche obviously out of balance.  Crowe completely immerses himself in the enormous volume of the role, effortlessly moving between its elements from audacity to paranoia to tenderness to genius. This is an accomplishment that is light years beyond his Academy Award performance in `Gladiator', good as it was.Jennifer Connelly puts herself on the map with an Oscar for best supporting actress.  It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.Ed Harris was my favorite to nose out Crowe for best actor in last year's Academy Awards.  Harris gave a brilliant performance playing Jackson Pollock in `Pollock' (also featuring Jennifer Connelly in a small role) that was trampled under by the `Gladiator' Oscar juggernaut.  As if to say, `If you can't beat him, join him', Harris goes toe to toe with Crowe in some of the most intense scenes in the film.  Harris lends significant energy and intrigue to the movie with an urgent performance as the operative who recruits Nash to break codes for the government.This film is nothing short of fantastic.  It is expertly directed, superbly acted and meticulously crafted.  It presents great drama while also bringing insight into a stigmatizing disease to a wide audience.  I rated it a 10/10. It rightfully ran away with the Best Picture Oscar.  If you see only one motion picture this year, make sure it is this one.",A Beautiful Mind

It is primarily set in the Cold War era. I have never been a Russell Crowe fan, so you should read elsewhere for impressions of his performance. Personally, I quickly tired of his mumbling.

129,movieguy1021,A Beautiful Mind: 8/10,8,1 January 2003,"At the 2001 Academy Awards, A Beautiful Mind got four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Screenplay from Another Medium. It well deserved all of them.Russell Crowe is John Forbes Nash. He's an acclaimed mathematician. He reluctantly teaches a class at Princeton, where he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). It doesn't take a genius to know that they get married. However, what Alicia, and John, don't know is that John is a schizophrenic. His life soon turns to shambles as he tries to piece together what's real in his life and what's not.It could only be Ron Howard who could make this believable. Of course, the story of John Nash is unbelievable, but it could be played with such unnatural pathos, making the story too silly to be likeable. Howard, however, could turn this into a compelling drama that you'll enjoy sitting through. The over-two-hour runtime seems to fly by. A Beautiful Mind has about everything a drama needs: palpable drama, romance, a few tense scenes, and even a little humor. Not much, but a little.The slow camera movements added to the general creepiness. Such as the clichéd use of little girls with big eyes to add tension, the creeping camera brought out the feel of the picture that is very tangible. If you just take an ordinary `drama', you can't connect to any of the characters. Howard, along with screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, made Nash a likeable character, even from his asocial and agoraphobic tendencies from the beginning of the film.James Horner created great music for this film. It's actually a soundtrack that I'm thinking of purchasing; he got robbed at the Oscars.Goldsman's script was so masterfully written. It seems like he could become an object to behold soon in the future. It seemed, however, like he wanted each line to be a memorable one that everyone in the future would remember. Although some of them may be, it was a turn off (but one of the few from the film). I think that Howard and Goldsman can become a worthy team soon on.Crowe did a better job here than in other movies, such as Gladiator. His genuine fear was very well displayed, though I don't think he got cheated at the Oscars. Connelly (who looked a lot like Andie McDowell to me) was also quite good, but, personally, didn't deserve her Oscar. Ed Harris, I think, did the best performance in the film as an FBI man, William Parcher. I could really feel for these characters, they did an excellent job as a whole.There's not much more to say, it was a great movie that everyone should see.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material, sexual content and a scene of violence.",A Beautiful Mind
130,RossRivero99,A triumph,10,7 July 2014,"Ron Howard's A Beautiful mind is a film done with skill and excellence, with Russell Crowe giving his best performance since Gladiator but this time playing a controversial person instead of a Roman general. The man who Crowe plays is Professor John Nash a mathematician whose cryptology problems have dealt with economics and other things, but there is one thing that makes us feel bad for Nash and that is that he suffers from a disorder called schizophrenia a disorder where you see things that aren't visible but seen in his imagination. Howard uses an excellent cast Besides Crowe (in a performance that should've won an Oscar) but the film also has Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Judd Hirsch, and Josh Lucas, but it is Harris and Bettany who play as his delusions. This was really one of the most powerful dramas I have ever seen with Russell Crowe giving a virtuoso performance. This is in some people's lists as one of the worst best picture winners of all time and that the first Lord of the Rings movie should have won, but from my perspective there was something behind it that I think that it should have won best picture and that is that how powerful it was. There was other things that were good about the film besides the direction by Ron Howard, and the excellent performances, but the other things were, the magnificent cinematography by the great Roger Deakins, the score by James Horner, and last but not least the makeup and costumes. But before I saw it I truly underestimated this movie claiming that Ridley Scott should have won best director for his film that came out around the same time Black Hawk Down but I really think that they should have tied but with this one taking home the award for best picture.",A Beautiful Mind
131,Horror-yo,Highly overrated,6,18 May 2016,"This film gets tremendous amounts of credit for being very real, and for Russel Crowe's supposed brilliant performance as the lead. I say these people are missing a few things. First of all, Crowe's role may not have been easy, but he certainly isn't masterful at it and is often either over-the-top or just not entirely credible and never seems completely ""in"" the film like some actors can make you forget they are paid actors with lives outside a film. Another thing is the film is very much a plain account, a mere biography, of some brilliant mathematician who had to struggle with severe schizophrenia. Nothing earth-shaking and not much to work with besides retelling the story, this film deals a lot with just events rather than a cinematographic interpretation of those events, and the parts that are indeed rendered movie magic are over-celebrated, emotionally void and subtlety-deprived moments that engage the audience forcefully with overdramatic music and classic thick cinematic methods rather than through a strength built through heart and genuine emotion. This film painfully lacks heart and an authentic atmosphere. It is just a mechanically carried out drama affair that collects gratuitous amounts of credit, it doesn't deserve. Hollywood in the works, industrially produced, executed and sold. No art or personal touch found here.",A Beautiful Mind
132,braddugg,A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.,8,19 September 2014,"A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.How could I put this, is it the best display of a schizophrenic patient or a biopic of a mathematician who went on to win a Nobel against many odds of his own hallucinations. This is both, and indeed this movie is of John Nash (Russell Crowe) and his story of becoming one of the finest mathematicians ever who has influenced a big deal in research of various subjects.Now, 5 minutes into a film we know there is mysterious, he fights with a friend whom others don't see now this very figment of imagination is blown out of proportion by his own mind and he goes through too many things. Now, that interesting, so there is a man who has hallucinations of seeing people, he is a real man and he has a story that is interesting nevertheless. So, Ron Howard picked it up and transformed into a better one using the screenplay which I must say is engaging in most parts as those hallucinations keep coming back. The other part is naturally mundane as those are the regular events which might happen to anyone.Here, I mean wining Nobel prize does not happen to anyone, yet winning a nobel having such delusions is what made Nash special and that's what made this whole film special. It's tough to be understanding what Nash actually is and why is Nash, the way he is. We are not shown of his birth nor his upbringing, we see him walk into a college as student and begin his journey there. So, there re still few questions unanswered but I would still say this a great watch and better leave those unanswered questions behind, coz the answers might have killed the interest. The cinematography is great and so is the sound and the art design, all are at their place and there is an impetus given by the screenplay itself which I must say is near to something of masterpiece. Yet, it may have its shortcomings as I felts some scenes are overdone just to create an impact. So editing could have been crisper. Above all, a memorable performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly take this movie into a different altitude altogether and that's the reason both have deservedly won many awards. Also, a word about the wonderful blu-ray that provided such remarkable details.It's a 4/5 for a movie that I must say is great and if not anything watch Russell Crowe alone perform John Nash and its worth all the time and money.",A Beautiful Mind

There's dashes of humor, bemusement a-plenty.",8,20 February 2002,"To tell a story about a schizophrenic person is a challenge in itself. Yet director Ron Howard delivered a literally entertaining suspenseful film with equal sensitivity, revolving around the backbone storyline of the love relationship between two persons - John and Alicia Nash, fascinatingly portrayed by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. It's a heart-warming film, ultimately uplifting. It affirms that with tenacity and persistence, loving and steadfast supportive companionship, hope - life's staple, will thrive and grow. Do not just give up and be overcome by other's opinions of you.
It is a beautiful mind. Such fascination with the world he sees, envisions. It captivates, enchants, delights and bewitches. Confuses, too. Is it for real? Is it only fictional in his mind? Nevertheless, it's a beautiful mind. Period. Infinity. It's a Möbius strip. Reminds me of the world of M.C. Escher - it's science and fiction, mathematical and sensational. The nurturing of such a beautiful mind, as director Howard points out, is the robust element of love, tender & care. To go to a movie with expectations of accuracy and truth in its delivery does set oneself up for disappointment. A movie is a movie is a movie. It is not a factual documentary, an A&E Biography, or E! channel's Scandal for that matter. Drama, in every sense of the word, is not real. It mimics a situation, its emotional characteristics, and actors give performances for our viewing pleasure. We are fortunate to have passionate filmmakers who produce films of substance. It's best to take the film for what its worth and enjoy the creative talents of the collaborative effort. Filmmakers may try to be as close to facts as possible, but they all have disclaimers at the end of credit roll for any fictitious injections in the film. So why stop yourself from appreciating the film with nagging doubts of accuracy and truth. Like the ever changing/generating molecules, truth is but for the moment it existed. The excellent performances by the two leads, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, truly deserve the Golden Globe Awards, along with Akiva Goldsman for his screenplay, and longtime producing partners of Imagine Entertainment, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is further graced by fine supporting performances: Ed Harris - never disappoints, be it light in ""Milk Money,"" heavy in ""Third Miracle,"" all-encompassing in ""Truman Show,"" passionate in ""Pollock,"" intense in ""Enemy At the Gates"" or vulnerable in ""China Moon."" Christopher Plummer - a stroke of genius casting him as we can't tell for sure if he's playing the nemesis again as he often does. Paul Bettany - the brilliant Geoffrey Chaucer of ""A Knight's Tale"" who can be tongue-whipping and subtle. Universal Pictures and Dreamworks certainly luck out in joining this endeavor by being distributors of the film, U.S. and worldwide. The eight Oscar nominations included film score by the inimitable James Horner, film editing, makeup (indeed!) besides best picture, director, actor, supporting actress, and screenplay. Cinematography was by master Roger Deakins, whose superior photography quietly complemented the varying moods as the story unfolds. Deakins was behind the two recent Coen Brothers films ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" 2000 - deftly subtle & dim lighted color, and ""Man Who Wasn't There, The"" 2001 - indisputably exquisite & artistic black and white. Give yourself a chance to see ""A Beautiful Mind."" Clear your mind and go see it without expectations. Simply enjoy. Yes, believe that ""something extraordinary can happen"" in your life.",A Beautiful Mind

You unfairly snubbed Howard of a Best Director Oscar nomination 6 years ago for his brilliant ""Apollo 13"", and if you decide to snub him of a Best Director nomination this year for ""A Beautiful Mind"", you will be sorry. Howard should be nominated for his directing job on this film because he did a great job. Let me say that again. A GREAT JOB! The film should also get a nod for Best Picture too. It's one of the very best movies of 2001. ""A Beautiful Mind"" tells the true story of John Forbes Nash Jr., a man who is one of the world's greatest mathematicians, and a victim of schizophrenia. From undergraduate days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize, we follow Nash on a journey that takes him into the far reaches of mathematical discovery, and into a bewildering labyrinth of hallucinations and madness. Russell Crowe brilliantly portrays Nash in what I think is the best performance of his career. He's sure to win another Oscar nomination this year (we'll see if he can duplicate what Tom Hanks did several years ago and that is win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars; Crowe has a very good chance of doing that). A great supporting performance is turned in by Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife Alicia; she'll get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. These two key performances by Crowe and Connelly make ""A Beautiful Mind"" the great film it is thanks primarily to Howard's direction and Akiva Goldsmith's wonderful screenplay (based on Sylvia Nasar's book).

Instead of that, we get a ridiculous and unrealistic depiction of his schizophrenia, Crowe babbling as an idiot, Conelly in the most unbelievable, sexist, dumb role they could ever write for Nash's wife and clichés of academic life, institutions, interpersonal relationships etc. Only Christopher Plummer, Ed Harris and the make-up department were actually worth their salaries. A film destined to please brain-dead people, I guess that's why the Academy liked it anyway.",A Beautiful Mind
144,Flagrant-Baronessa,"""A"" for Acting, ""B"" for Story, ""C"" for Accuracy  that adds up to a ""B"", right?",7,3 September 2006,"It feels pretty paltry and dry to grade a film on accuracy  especially since ""A Beautiful Mind (2001)"" is a dramatization and not a documentary. But when the director not only chooses to omit significant aspects of its biographical figure but richly glosses over almost everything in his life in a lush Hollywood coating up for Academy praise, then I as John Nash, would feel pretty stiffed at seeing the end result. But then I am not John Nash  I'm just a movie-goer looking to be entertained, touched and inspired in some way, and I was 2 out 3.These two points are difficult to pinpoint, but I would attribute one of them to the acting in the film, which is sensationally layered and realistic from all parties. Russell Crowe may be a jerk in real life, but he clearly knows his stuff on screen and he is very convincing as genius-mathematician-turned-schizophrenic John Nash. We follow his career and his life starting out at Princeton, getting married, and ending up in Stockholm, heartily accepting the Nobel Prize. He ages 47 years in the film but Russell Crowe is perfect at every stage.So the film makes it clear to us that John Nash is a genius man. Yet I was never mesmerized by his 'beautiful' mind  not in the same way I was with other cinematic geniuses in films like Good Will Hunting, Pi, Enigma and Amadeus. This is because you cannot trace his mathematical thoughts, we do not get to follow his genius pattern ideas and oh, when he draws an umbrella-shape in the stars for Alicia (Connelly) IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AN UMBRELLA. At all. It looks like a couple of dots, sorry. Very romantic, poignant moment though.While this sounds like a happy and acknowledged life, it is everything but for John Nash. He is the victim of schizophrenia, which makes him paranoid, delusional and insecure. He is never at 'the height of his career', but always a bruised man plagued by his own mind. It just takes him a while to realise it and shake him from his paranoid state. This part is handled superbly in the film -- the break-down is perfect and heartfelt and Jennifer Connelly is there as a supporting wife all along.That actually bothered me somewhat, and it is where the glossy Hollywood autopilot is switched on and Ron Howard leans back in his directing chair. While Russell Crowe is great and Jennifer Connelly is great, their marriage is TOO great. The real Alicia Nash wasn't the pretty little devoted wife to a troubled husband all these years; she divorced him in 1963. Another polished detail that irked me (moreso than the perfect marriage) was the Nobel Prize culmination. The real John Nash shared his prize with two others, but in the film Russell Crowe appears as a sole winner giving a poignant, sappy speech about ""the equations of love"", and the audience cheers, claps and stands up at the end of it.So in summary, if you do not mind the occasional lofty Hollywood approaches to drama, then this is a very good film. Russell Crowe carries it, Jennifer Connelly supports it and Ed Harris and Paul Bettany add further weight to an already respected cast. It is a well-sewn together product with nice cinematic harmony and my favourite aspect was the subtle nuances in John Nash's delusions that distinguished them from reality. You can spot this at the beginning if you pay attention.7.5/10",A Beautiful Mind
145,majikstl,"Real, reel and surreal",8,3 April 2004,"A BEAUTIFUL MIND is an extremely odd film.  On the surface it is the standard this-happened-that-happened biopic, the subject being a Nobel-winning mathematician named John Nash. But by the end of the film, instead of feeling you have learned about the man, the viewer is apt to understand him even less. The facts in the film are, at best shaky in the way all movie biographies play fast and loose with reality just to squeeze a man's life into two hours of screen time. Plus, questions arose after the film's release regarding embarrassing facts about the man that were left out, for one reason or another. But the biggest distraction is how the film blurs reality to somehow duplicate the man's own schizophrenia.  This is a film that tells a a story based on facts, takes dramatic license with facts, supposedly obscures the facts and makes up ""facts"" that aren't reality to anyone accept one character within the film. What is real life, reel life and surreal life may not ever be really clear. On the one hand, I admire how director Ron Howard does a ""Twilight Zone"" number on the audience, leading us to accept one thing only to slap us in the face with a new reality later. I don't necessarily think he goes far enough in exploring the plot possibilities. Nash's mental problems liberates Howard to try some daring stuff, but the reality that Nash is a living, breathing individual ropes him back in. The film might have been better (and oddly, more honest) had the whole story been fictional from page one of the screenplay.
Like Nash, the film finds a way of freeing itself of the boundaries that reality sets, unlike Nash, the film might have been better not totally regaining those boundaries. As is, the film is a solid enough piece of filmmaking: well acted and skillfully dishonest with the viewer. 
But the best thing about A BEAUTIFUL MIND is Russell Crowe's nuanced performance. Even without the delusional gimmickry, his performance following Nash's life from youth to old age is satisfying. The irony is that Crowe's performance is what lifts the film up above the ordinary, yet when Oscar time came around, he was overlooked and all the other major players were rewarded. Crowe was the real thing; all else was illusion. At the Oscars, the illusion won.",A Beautiful Mind

A mathematical genius, he made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery once he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After many years of struggle, he eventually triumphed over this tragedy, and finally, late in life, received the Nobel Prize. The film's strength is certainly the towering performance of Crowe as Nash; he inhabits the man from the internal organs out and Jennifer Connelly's performance as Alicia is also outstanding.",A Beautiful Mind
147,hokeybutt,Terrified... mortified... petrified... stupefied... by this movie!,6,14 August 2004,"A BEAUTIFUL MIND (3 outta 5 stars)I had put off seeing this movie for such a long time... people kept saying how good it was and how good an actor Russell Crowe is yadda yadda yadda... and I just didn't care.  I was sick of the hype surrounding his ridiculously over-praised ""Gladiator"" movie and not seeing this movie would be my revenge!  But, as luck would have it, it was on Canadian TV the other night... unedited (broadcast TV in Canada is soooooo cool)... and I figured maybe it was time.  Well, the movie started to lose me at first... it started out a little too predictable and then took a few implausible turns. Just as I was about to give up on it... some major plot developments had me looking at the movie with new eyes.  By the midway point, the movie had me hooked.  Not a perfect movie though... Crowe's performance does seem a little too ""act-y"" at times... and Jennifer Connelly is... well, she does the same thing she does in all her movies... some people seem to like it... me, not so much.  Once again, Ron Howard takes a movie subject that I find somewhat less than compelling (what? another eccentric genius who becomes a beloved teacher?) and turns it into a fine film.",A Beautiful Mind
148,alicecbr,"John Nash, Indeed a Beautiful Mind",9,30 December 2007,"How can a schizophrenic be of such genius and function at such a level that he commands the highest honor given to human beings, the Oslo awards given for work that progresses mankind, the Nobel Prize for Scientific Excellence. The judges there go to great levels to prevent the awards from being denigrated by going to some charlatan, as the knighthoods of England have become.Having now seen the documentary on this exceptional man's life, I understand more about the particular life a schizophrenic lives. Even the physical structure of his skull somehow creates the 'voices', which of course is Mr. Nash speaking to himself. Just as we are often beset by temptation, with cartoons showing the devil on one shoulder and an angel on another, such was the form these voices took for him. What is even more amazing when we see his 'recovery' in the movie, is from his own admission, a product of his fantastic intelligence. He uses the 'faulty' organ, his brain, to figure out how to 'be sane', foregoing the drugs of the early years that caused him much psychic pain. The description of the experiments performed on him and his treatment in the New Jersey asylum are disgusting,much as the shocking treatments (literally and figuratively) being given children today in Canton, Ma. The mothers of his sons were given proper credit for staying with him, despite his increasingly weird behavior, and his inability to be a nurturing father to his sons. However, that did not preclude the older son from accompanying his father on trips in his adulthood, to keep him from being lured off by his illness to wander Europe, as he did earlier. It is also an indication of how physiological his mental illness, how congenital, when we discover that his 2nd son is also a Math whiz and also schizophrenic. What is even more amazing to me, as a Math major, is the support he received from his fellow math students and teachers at MIT and Princeton, who..instead of viewing him as a rival and a weirdo....stood by him and gave him the support so many victims of mental illness fail to receive. For any of you who have friends or kin who suffer from some form of mental aberration, I strongly suggest this movie, both ""A Beautiful Mind"" and the documentary on the man himself, John Nash. What is left out of the Hollywood movie, but included in the documentary gives us much insight into what movie producers think the public wants. Quite frankly, I believe ""a Beautiful Mind"" would have been much more nuanced and yes, enjoyable, had we been shown the whole story.You will also find interesting the revelation you hear from him: ""I stopped taking the medicine, because it inhibited my work, and decided to refuse to listen to the voices, knowing how they were generated."" My son has ADHD and is now a computer professional with 3 beautiful children. He says, ""I wish you had not given me Ritalin, because I felt like I was 2 people in one body. If one of my children shows hyperactive tendencies, I will do ANYTHING before I try drugs."" Food for thought. Do we drug our children for THEIR sakes, or our own?",A Beautiful Mind
149,diac228,"A harsh and gloomy story told in a most beautiful way, Howard, Crowe, and Connelly help craft a fine film",9,14 May 2006,"Is a Beautiful Mind groundbreaking? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a cinematic achievement? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a drama that will change your outlook on life? Yes. Directed by Ron Howard and lead by an incredibly talented staff in writing, directing, acting, and musical score, A Beautiful Mind is leagues above the average drama and remains one of the few movies in recent years that actually did indeed deserve that Best Picture Oscar it had earned years ago. This film will make you laugh, will make you suspect, will make you cry, and will make you reflect on your life one way or another.A Beautiful Mind follows the life of mathematician John Nash. He is an extremely intelligent man but with his genius comes problems, issues, and situations that affect not only him but also the lives of the people he cares about the most. Throughout the film, there are many surprises and unexpected turns in plot that just reveals how his methods of thinking and attempting to find solutions ultimately eats away at his life. Russell Crowe plays Nash and pretty much nails it, one of the finest performances I've ever seen. You can even see him little by little break down emotionally as well as physically as he lived on with his problems. Jennifer Connelly is just as talented as she is beautiful, as she plays the loving yet frustrated wife of John Nash. Crowe and Connelly have excellent chemistry together, and their love for each other pretty much bleeds out of the film and into your heart, as you will have a lump in your throat during their best moments shared together. Another notable good job comes from Ed Harris, who plays a cold man hiring John Nash on a top-secret mission to help find out what the Russians are doing. The acting is basically what runs this film, but much credit should be given to the writing.Weaving a true-life story that needs to be told into a movie that can capture the interest of an audience is no easy task; especially involving the evil and cynical feature we all call mathematics. Fortunately for us, they kept the complicated, convoluted jargon that only true math experts can recognize to a minimum, even though there are times in which you are just better off zoning out as you see Nash engage into intricate arithmetic with other Princeton students. The story is paced well, as no section of his life is stretched way too long, nor does it ever become predictable. Ron Howard absolutely perfects his directing skills in this film, as he constantly leads the audience down one path, only to totally throw them off at the latest surprise. Kind of like Fight Club and Pulp Fiction, A Beautiful Mind may require more than one viewing in order to catch all the nifty details scattered about. Even the colors of the film are remarkably toned down as you dwell halfway into the movie.It is more than a biography; it is a love story, and a story about a man attempting to defeat a seemingly impossible task of daunting past his problems. While his dilemmas are far from normal, deep down, we all can sympathize and understand what he is going through, we all can see ourselves in him as he goes through his worst moments. But unlike most life-changing, eye-watering stories, this one didn't look like there was much hope, and as the viewer, you will almost deteriorate emotionally as badly as John Nash. Nonetheless, don't get the impression that this movie should be avoided if you are currently depressed or emotionally unstable, because underneath all the drama and chaos lies hope and anticipation, lies a chance that everything will be betterthis is what life is, an ever-changing quest for happiness that contains moments of darkness that seems to find no end. A Beautiful Mind is exactly an interpretation of life, that long, sometimes awful yet rewarding road that hopefully finds its way out of the bowels of rough terrain.Bottom Line: A Beautiful Mind should be viewed by everybody, as it gives a not-so-typical story about a man whose fears and issues threaten to get in the way of his first love, mathematics, and his main love, his wife. Acted out almost perfectly, and directed with few faults, this movie should change the way you view things or at least reflect a bit. While the dialogue does have its bits of slowdown, especially when the complicated math starts getting involved, this film is nothing short of spectacular. Highly, highly recommend.

The film does a great job of exploring every single aspect of John Nash's mind and when we finally see him for who he truly is, my heart breaks. A heartbreaking film that becomes almost unbearable to watch as Nash combats with his own mind between what he knows is right and what his mind tells him is real. The fact that he had such a beautiful gift for codebreaking but along with it came an unimaginable curse is terrifying. I believe it's impossible to understand what possibly could go through John Nash's head on a daily basis, and the experiences he had to endure throughout his life really are unimaginable but this film does a flawless job of bringing us as close to understanding him as possible. A big help in creating it's brilliance are the phenomenal performances from Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly which are two of the best of their career (probably is the best of Jennifer's), the decade and, I dare-say, of all time.

I'd give it a 9 out of 10.I had no idea that Crowe was this good of an actor. He had a ""Rain Man"" role in this film, in which an established actor can show his range by portraying a mentally ill person. Yet even his terrific performance here was maybe outshined by Harris'. I don't know what it is about Harris  but he grows on you. He's a great actor, even in a somewhat one-note role like the one he has here. He can be forceful and intimidating, and even genuinely frightening, but also sympathetic at the same time. (See his performances in ""The Stand"" miniseries (1994) or that Saturday-afternoon, guilty-pleasure standby, ""The Rock"" (1996).) Plus he's just got a damned cool voice.

Still, I couldn't help comparing him with other directors who have a genius for this kind of source material. This is a movie where the main character comes to doubt his perceptions of reality – when I think of films like ""12 Monkeys,"" ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""Jacob's Ladder,"" I couldn't help but wonder if their directors really would have given a tour de force with this story's fantastic elements.

Decades later, the once arrogant graduate student, now an accomplished PhD Professor, is honored by his peers for his enlightening findings in the field of Mathematics, which changed the world of Science forever.

And he finally got the help of his old friend and also won the Nobel Prize. Why would his old friend help him? At the beginning, the old friend was the main force of mocking him. It was not until he successfully challenged the game theory of his predecessors that old friends admired him and became good friends with him.

161,smakawhat,Beautifully done,8,11 January 2002,"Now this is the Russell Crowe I know and love.  The Insider, L.A. Confidential... and now chalk up another calculating masterful performance.A Beautiful Mind tells the autobiographical story of John Forbes Nash Jr. a distinguished professor from Princeton who went on to make some great theories and win the nobel prize.  The centerpiece of the story is the fact that John Nash suffers from schizophrenia a debilitating condition for most people which leaves them helpless.  Thus it is amazing that Nash has been able to achieve what he has.  For the most part of the story his hallucinations turn out to institutionalize him at one point, when he thinks the Russians are trying to secretly send him coded messages through news publications.First off the main performance by Crowe as Nash is amazing.  This is the performance that I know he is capable of, complicated, passionate and serious, none of this gutteral one line BS that he uttered in Gladiator. Here we have a marvelous performance that Crowe spins as we watch Nash fall into despair, every twitch, eyes darting, and Nash's helplessness this is not an easy task for any actor.  Nash is a recluse, almost an autistic savant, we see how he trys out his theories by writing on glass windows and stuffing himself in a corner of the library.  He is seriously gifted, but a social misfit.  Early on we hear how Nash describes how a grade school teacher mentioned that he was born with 2 heapings of brain but only 1/2 of heart.Ron Howard's direction is great in exposing Nash's life.  Probably the best scenes involve the use of how Nash comes up with his theories such as why the dynamics of a colleagues tie is so bad, or how a plan to get all of his college buddies laid leads to a theory that makes him famous.Also what else can I say about Jeniffer Connely who plays his wife in the film.  She is passionate and gives a full perfect 10 performance as well as the wife who is trying to survive with a husband she can't help.  But the greatest achievement of this film is how it portrays mental illness from the perspective of the person suffering it.Most films that deal with someone with a mental condition always place the focus on the people who are outside the person suffering, watching from a distance, trying to understand.  Here we have a film that literaly puts us in the mind of the sufferer, as to what it is to live with such a debilitating illness.  We get Nash's sense of accomplishment, but also his demons and paranoia.  And probably the most important thing is that we understand that mental illness isn't something that gets cured, the people have to live with it, and it never goes away.Also Crowe and Connely age in this film wonderfuly, so many films try to age actors/actresses in makeup and it doesn't work, but here it is done flawlessly..Minor faults in the film deal with that some of the supporting characters are reduced to props and people we don't know, and at one point the film bogs slightly when Nash is trying to return to Princeton to study.  But these points are minor since the performances of the main characters are so well done, and the stories focus is on them to begin with.Crowe will probably get the best actor for this.  Great film.Rating 8 out of 10.",A Beautiful Mind
162,Quicksand,Lesser Than the Sum of Its Parts,7,11 February 2002,"As a critic and student of film myself, my first look at the poster for this film brought mixed emotions: directed by Ron Howard (yes!), written by Akiva Goldsman (oh no!)A simple glance at Mr. Goldsman's filmography gives a very nice look at a list of movies that range from the non-threateningly mediocre ('A Time to Kill'), to the atrociously horrible ('Batman and Robin,' 'Lost in Space'). I looked forward to this film with the sort of morbid curiosity one usually reserves for a pet with a terminal illness.The film is not at all horrible.  On the contrary, about 70-75% of it is quite good.  Ron Howard remains one of the most talented directors of our time, and Russell Crowe gives an outstanding, nuanced performance.  Also, there are charismatic and enjoyable performances from supporting players Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Paul Bettany.Despite the best efforts of the supporting players, however, none of them really have much to work with.  Ed Harris almost does, but by the time Goldsman yanks the rug out from under Nash (and the viewer) halfway through the film, I developed an animosity toward 'A Beautiful Mind' that I never recovered from.Howard does wonderful visual work, as does cinematographer (and Coen Brothers staple) Roger Deakins.  Relating the unique, ulrta-logical way Nash's mind works is no easy task, and Howard rises to it.The mediocre writing, however, does nothing more than tell a good story badly, and I don't think Howard's visual flare ever makes up for it.  I'm all good and happy that Goldsman saw ""Fight Club,"" but he's not nearly as talented as anyone involved with that film will ever be.Note to the viewer-- when Christopher Plummer shows up, do yourself a favor: get up, leave, take a bathroom break, or fast forward about 20 minutes into the future.  This bungled plot device fails, but the rest of the film is really about an A-minus.Ultimately flawed, but a nice homage to the real John Nash.

Here are some clues:In the part where the film does talk about mathematics, it makes the viewer feel that he is more intelligent than he actually is, which is always a good idea when you're aiming for the lowest common denominator and you want your picture to sell tickets in the Ozarks as well as in Hollywood.In the part where the film talks about romance, the worst possible woman's picture clichés are dragged out to show Nash as ""different"" and desirable. In actuality, he was nerdish, odd and gay.In the part that talks about his schizophrenia, terrible care is taken to avoid mentioning the fact that the 1950's persecution of homosexuals had a lot to do with Nash's worsening condition. John Nash was forced to conceal his homosexuality and was persecuted for it by the same government that expected him to decrypt secrets for them and keep quiet about it. If that isn't enough to turn any brilliant mind into a paranoid-schizophrenic, I really don't know what is.In all the other parts, the bad script and the bad out-of-place acting by miscast actors are immensely aided by photographic special effects and by the music (or rather non-music) of James Horner, the inventor of today's omnipresent minimalist ""fear music"", where the cinema's sub-woofers are put to maximum use to make the viewer feel danger directly through his anal sphincter, the only part of one's anatomy that is actually needed to ""enjoy"" this film as written.",A Beautiful Mind
166,dy158,Good and inspirational.,8,22 June 2006,"I was never the one being cut out to be good in Mathematics. I admit, it was a little below average. But I ended up studying accountancy instead.But it never stopped me back then to watch the movie when it was shown on the television here back then like few years back or something. If I cannot be someone good in Mathematics, then watching the life of Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr. is good enough for me.Russell Crowe plays the Nobel Prize winner in the movie. Though he (as in Russell's character) has schizophrenia (the real John Nash Jr. did contracted it), he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics (this is as a result of my own mini research). I am not clearly aware of the Game Theory though, but then I guessed I realised why Nash is a mathematical genius in his own right after watching the movie.The reason I am only starting to remember about this movie once again as one of those I once watched, was because of, The Da Vinci Code (I did saw that movie and read the novel beforehand). I know this sounds funny, but back then when I read about who is going to direct The Da Vinci Code, director Ron Howard was credited in directing the Academy Award-winning movie A Beautiful Mind. It was then it hit me that I had actually once watched one of Howard's earlier works.Back to this movie I am reviewing on.

167,shanfloyd,A Beautiful Film,10,18 January 2003,"It's not that common people knew John Forbes Nash jr., a Princeton mathematician after he recieved Nobel Prize for his ""Game Theory"". It's not that people started to know him after Sylvia Nasar wrote his biography. What made John Nash a household name is Ron Howard's brilliant direction and Russell Crowe's excellent performance as the scizophrenic genious.Russell Crowe exceeds all of his past performances in this film. He did not act as Nash, he became Nash. His facial expression while solving a problem, his innocent and shy smile during romantic sequences and his vacant look during the time of scizophrenia are in a word magnificient, and shockingly original. Jennifer Connelly also put a beautiful performance as his devoted wife Alicia. The actings of these two are the core of success of this film. I am still in a dark why Crowe is denied his Oscar for the best actor.
Ron Howard changed the original story in some places a bit, but only to make it more enjoyable. His main goal was to feature Nash's point of view to his world and he has succeeded totally. The shot in the cafe` where Nash first understands the significance of the application of his theory is brilliantly taken and is the best example of Howard's genious as a filmmaker. The make-up throughout the film is drop-dead gorgeous as they showed Nash and Alicia aging in the course of the film. Thus the Russell Crowe in the beginning and the Russell Crowe in the end become two different entities due to the superb art of the make-up artists.A Beautiful Mind will be considered one of the best biopics ever. It is dramatic, descriptive, detailed, reflective, enthusiastic, heroic and in all, a beautiful film. 10/10.",A Beautiful Mind
168,macpherr,The chance to see the mind of a schizophrenic! WOW!,10,13 February 2002,"I could never have imagined how a person with schizophrenia views the world. I thought that they just heard voices, but I knew nothing about them seeing people.  I was actually very surprised when I realized that `John Nash' brilliantly played by Russell Crowe (Proof of Life, The Insider) has all those imaginary people inside his head.  I believed that the way he was cutting and pasting newspapers and magazines showed how confused his mind was.Last time Brian Grasier produced a movie about someone with a psychiatric disorder was ` As Good as it Gets', a movie that won two Oscars:  one for Jack Nicholson   `Melvin Udal',the obsessive compulsive writer.  The  second Oscar went to Helen Hunt 'Carol Conelly.' the woman that Melvin falls in love with. The movie got much praise from psychiatrists and it is  loved by many people. I love the movie. I have been watching it. It is a well done movie. As a parallel I am hoping that the movie at hand wins many Oscars. I am cheering for all who got nominated, specially Russell Crowe, because he is a very good artist and because I don't believe that the Academy has ever given two Oscars in a roll to a foreign born actor. I love the fact that `Alicia Nash's' played by Jennifer Connelly (Inventing the Abbotts) stayed by her husband's side until he was finally able to live with himself and society. My neighbors are getting the divorce!  This is a true story in every sense of the word.  `A Beautiful Mind' gave me more compassion than I already had for my neighbor who has the disorder. My neighbor used to send  letters to the entire homeowners association talking about how much Big Brother was giving him a hard time. It is amazing! He complained about the side effects of his medication. He has been hospitalized! It is very interesting that Ron Howard gave us the chance to see the mind of a schizophrenic. This movie has already done a tremendous service to society. I highly recommend this movie. It is incredibly well made!  A***** on my scale!",A Beautiful Mind
169,ssssgelojun,a beautiful mind,10,13 July 2020,"The three characters in Nash's fantasy were what Nash lacked in every period.The college roommate he fantasized about was the friendship he lacked, the agent the desire for recognition and honor. He was ignored by the professor and squeezed by other excellent classmates in real life. He is too eager for honor, even full of fear of failure, he can get authority recognition in the fantasy, can satisfy his heroism, he can be a mad genius in his own world, so deep in it.Little girls are a kind of kinship. The girl seemed to be a mirror image of him. He hoped to make up for the lack of love between him and the little girl in the early years, and he also enjoyed the important value that he was to others. He could take a little warmth from it, save and redeem himself.The good news is that love in the movies is a real thing, and if you don't think about the fact that he's divorced and his children are mentally ill, love in movies is beautiful.

170,nicolechan916,"Amazing portrayals, editing, cinematic style and chemistry",9,14 March 2015,"This movie is just brilliant. The acting is brilliant. The portrayals of that period in time is brilliant. The directing is brilliant. It's brilliant. The movie may not be as accurate as the reality, but it displays the effects of schizophrenia on the mind and of those around in a way that is accessible to everyone. I would really like to read the biography of John Nash now.Russell Crowe does a fantastic job getting into his character, that he pretty much becomes John Nash. He is like Eddie Redmayne in Theory of Everything, or rather Eddie Redmayne is like Russel Crowe and Theory of Everything is like A Beautiful Mind of 2015. Jennifer Connelly (who seriously looks like Demi Moore) is great in this too. I won't get into how her character is entirely centred on being a care taker, but perhaps that's how it was. Anyway, her acting was great and the emotions she portrayed could be felt. The rest of the cast too were brilliant and you could really feel how in character they were.Ron Howard did a great job directing this to be a masterpiece. I would expect that it would be hard to connect with this kind of character and to keep the audience involved in the film, but Howard does it perfectly. Also, Crowe portrays Nash in a semi-charismatic and witty way and as the audience, we are just drawn to him. Great job on both their parts.The editing and make-up are pretty phenomenal too. The editing of time passing and cuts of scenes make the film engrossing to the viewer. The scenes during and after the revelation of his mental state mimic his inner turmoil as the mood of the film tones down from there to one that is more sober. The make-up is especially noticeable as the characters age and there is a dramatic difference between their appearances – in a good way. It's incredible how make- up can do wonders.I don't really find this a problem in the movie, but it did add and or change events from reality. For one instance the ending scene with the pens is not a custom at all, and the relationship between John and Alicia was much more rocky than was portrayed. As a portrayal of real life situations and people, I feel like they should have respected what happened instead of 'Hollywood-izing' it. I still love the movie though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",A Beautiful Mind

174,The_Core,Uninspired & flat...,6,2 January 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those ""Oscar(tm)-aimed"" films like Gladiator that pretend to transcend Hollywood, and in the process appear eminently ""Hollywood"" (and mostly forgettable after the Oscars (tm)). 
Uninspired performances, unrealistic and oversimplified portrayal of schizophrenia and (unforgivably), a dull screenplay.  I kept looking at my watch through this one, and wasn't for one moment drawn into the story. There are no characters we can really empathize with in this film, and so it becomes an exercise in tedium.The film does a good job in creating the general paranoid atmosphere one would attribute to schizophrenia, but doesn't succeed in conveying the 'reality' of it.  Nash's ""delusions"" are obviously hallucinations(look up the difference if you don't know already), and the character is not sharply drawn or particularly interesting.  Jennifer Connelly's acting is rarely better than ""by the book,"" and nobody really seems very passionate about whatever characters they're playing.Sorry guys, try again.  Yes, I do like movies in this vein, as long as they're well-done... this one hardly qualifies as ""medium rare."" 6/10.",A Beautiful Mind
175,The_Core,A typical movie...,6,27 March 2004,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is typical Hollywoodized claptrap designed to jerk the heartstrings of the average viewer, with Russell Crowe overacting like a fool.  Hopefully this film will drop out of the IMDB top 250 soon, as it's one of the more overrated films in movie history.  To be honest, I cannot imagine most of the ""real life"" occurrences actually happening anything like the way they did in the film.  Crowe is one of the most egotistical and psychologically messed-up actors around, and it's clear here that he thinks he's another Marlon Brando.  Hollywood has done little to disabuse him of this notion.  Who knows what further silliness and excesses we can expect from Mr. Crowe in the future?The film isn't too bad if you ignore the blatantly manipulative elements. The story is engaging enough thanks to decent acting (particularly from Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer), and the film is watchable on a more ""mindless"" level -- it's fun to watch these top-list actors doing their stuff.  However, rest assured that this is not an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia, or of the real-life John Nash's life.Anyway, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is worth a watch if it comes on cable (currently playing on HBO), and you should make up your own mind.  From where I'm standing, it's pretty much one of those flicks designed to attract Academy voters at Oscar time and tug on the heart-strings of gullible viewers.  You may see things that are not really there, of course.  6/10.",A Beautiful Mind
176,jonathanruano,A Beautiful Mind,7,4 April 2010,"Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" has been popularly considered a masterpiece. Certainly the film is very well acted. Russel Crowe delivers a remarkable performance as the highly gifted mathematician John Nash verging on madness. Jennifer Connelly gives a capable performance as Nash's wife Alicia. Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and others also put in good performances. The movie is also technically impressive and the musical soundtrack is wonderful, except for that Charlotte Church song at the end. But ""A Beautiful Mind"" is only a superficial masterpiece because it never achieves greatness.I have not reached this conclusion lightly. I gave this film considerable thought because, although I instinctively thought that something big was missing, I was not sure what that something was. Then it struck me. The problem with ""A Beautiful Mind"" is really its tendency to oversimplify its subject matter. Great films force people to think and usually require more than one viewing to be understood. But Director Ron Howard's fault is in making films, like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" that explain everything to the audience in very simple terms. Howard does not seem to understand that the people who go to see films, like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" do not like an oversimplified story, because simplicity is boring. In making this criticism, I am referring to scenes like the one where John Nash's brilliant mathematical insight was explained in a very basic analogy of several men completing for one blonde woman in a bar. These men decide to change their strategy by working together toward a lesser goal - going after the brunettes - so that they all get laid. As I saw this scene, I realized that Ron Howard cares far more about towing the line of the Hollywood establishment than with the art of filmmaking. Hollywood's unspoken assumption has been for the last 30 years to oversimplify every story in order to make a film understandable even to unintelligent viewers and in the process get more people to buy theatre tickets. When set against this deplorable standard, ""A Beautiful Mind"" delivers.The only trick that ""A Beautiful Mind"" has up its sleeve is that the world that the John Nash character imagines is actually real. But once that trick is exposed, the plot is completely bereft of original ideas. Thereafter, the story line goes through all the motions of resolving the conflict and arriving at a happy ending -- and the experience of watching this film becomes boring and predictable. Even the ending, which is as artificial as the one in ""2012,"" can be anticipated by the middle of this film. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is not a bad film. It can be quite interesting at times. But there is something lacking and artificial about this movie because it is all based on a trick on the mind - that we are in the beginning not sure about whether John Nash's weltanschauung is real or not. After we discover the trick, the only thing that we have left to do is wait for the movie to end. Russell Crowe's performance is worthy of an Oscar and yet by the same token the John Nash character is let down by the screenplay and direction. There is no attempt made to explain the complexities of the John Nash character. We are simply told that he has gone mad and to accept that. Considering all the great films that have gone much further in adding depth and fascination to their characters, the John Nash of this picture (he is much more interesting in real life) is a bit of a let down. There is also little effort made in explaining the wonders of mathematics, even though John Nash appreciated the potential of his craft well enough to come up with some very unique ideas. Instead math and madness are reduced to mcguffins for a simple love story between John and Alicia that never was. The real Alicia Nash divorced her husband during his prolonged spell with madness.6.5/10",A Beautiful Mind

Denzel Washington's performance in 'Training Day' was flawlessly executed, but when you observe Russell in 'A Beautiful Mind' you will realise that such a performance should not get nominated for an Oscar, it should win it without question.Also deserving mentioning is Jennifer Connelly, who stands solidly beside Crowe and provides an exceptional performance, along with Ed Harris who as always is great to watch.A great film.9/10",A Beautiful Mind

Unfortunately, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is not that movie. Instead, it appears to be a standard case of Hollywood taking a potentially interesting story and dumbing it down to please a large audience. It's hard to describe where exactly this movie goes wrong. On the surface level, everything is OK. The acting is fine (Ed Harris once again steals the show), the atmosphere is authentic, and the movie is beautifully shot.This makes it a real shame that they didn't do anything more with the story. Instead of a complex story about real people, we get a simplified tale full of one-dimensional over-glorified characters (Jennifer Connelly is too nice to believe), a simplistic message (""love conquers all"") and corny dialog. And to make matters even worse, all of this is drowned under an incredible load of (false) sentiment and bombastic music. This movie doesn't just want to tell a story, it also tells you how you should feel about that story.This could have been an interesting movie, if it had just stuck to the facts and let people judge for themselves what they think about Mr Nash and his story.

Just as the brusque Antipodean's intensity and screen charisma blinded audiences to the flaws in ""Gladiator"", so he delivers another astonishing performance that more than compensates for this film's weaker facets.A (highly) fictionalised biopic of real-life maths whizz John Forbes Nash Jr, it follows the socially stunted prodigy from his professional beginnings as a nervous freshman at Princeton, through Cold War spy machinations, and his struggle to hold together his marriage to fellow mathematician Alicia (Connelly).Crowe is totally convincing - from 19-year-old student to OAP - giving a truth to Akiva Goldsman's occasionally twee dialogue and bringing fear and excitement to the most off-putting of subjects. Facing off with such a formidable, scene-stealing star would terrify a lesser actor than Jennifer Connelly, but she matches Crowe scene for scene. With a glamour and grace reminiscent of a 40s film star, and unafraid to suffer some unflattering close-ups of her angst- contorted face, the Golden Globe-winner delivers a performance that should see her secure a place on the A-list.Another supporting player who signals his Hollywood arrival is Brit Paul Bettany, as Nash's enigmatic best friend - fulfilling the promise he showed in both ""Gangster No.1"" and ""A Knight's Tale"".In truth it's the acting that makes the movie, for while Howard does a good job of actually making sums exciting - and pulls off a masterful narrative shift halfway through - he can't sidestep the pacing problems of biopics that try to cram in their subjects' entire life - perfunctorily whizzing through decades in the final half hour.Still, such problems are forgivable as the tear-stained finale crowns a moving love story.Who'd have thought algebra could be so exciting?",A Beautiful Mind
183,Shiva-11,A Beautiful Mind is a terrible thing to waste,8,3 January 2002,"A Beautiful MindFew people ever cross paths with true genius.  My encounter happened while I lived in a university dormitory.  `Tom' was a gangly 17-year-old whose most distinguishing features were his penchant for missing classes, a photographic memory, and a flawless mastery of several different musical instruments.  I remember vividly the day he asked me to read a History paper that dealt with Sino/Indian relations in the Cold War era.  Written as Swiftian satire, it had taken him three hours to write and was one of the most insightful and brilliant things I've ever read. Although it was three months late, his professor said it was outstanding and gave Tom a first class grade.  However, as the axiom states, there is a fine line between genius and insanity   I soon learned that Tom was prone to fits of manic self-destruction and substance abuse.  The last I heard he was doing freelance work for Rolling Stone, had been published in several well-known literary magazines, was dabbling in heroin and was in heavy therapy. 
While studying at Princeton, John Nash sets himself a simple task - find an original idea that will revolutionize mathematics.  While such an undertaking reeks of hubris, it is a natural progression for John, a genius who dwells in a different world where everything, regardless of its apparent randomness is linked by theorems and patterns.  He is eventually recruited to work for the Department of Defense, where he becomes enmeshed in a shadowy netherworld of spies and conspiracies and loses touch with those around him. Warning:  Potential spoilers ahead!The fact that John Nash's findings shook the foundations of economic theory and earned him a Nobel Prize should be enough to impress anyone.  What makes his story truly remarkable is that he achieved what he did while struggling with paranoid schizophrenia.  The film's success ultimately rests on the lead's ability to capture Nash's tortuous journey.  Whoever cast Crowe deserves a hefty bonus.Several days before I went to the sneak preview for  this film, reviewers were already gushing over Crowe's performance, and naming him as the frontrunner in the Oscar race.  Never one to swallow the word of critics (I know, ironic), I reserved judgment and can now state that Crowe is, for lack of a better word, riveting. The harder Nash struggles to crack the cosmological code, the weaker his grip on reality becomes and Crowe captures this masterfully.  He skillfully balances Nash's quirky brilliance and pathos as he dances between reality and insanity.  Crowe pulls the viewer into this crumbling world, and avoids becoming the stereotypical slobbering `madman'.  Jennifer Connelly is lyrically beautiful as John's wife Alicia (does she ever age?).  While the beginnings of their relationship seem dubious, does love ever really make sense? Connelly leaves the viewer with no doubt that Alicia was Nash's only link to the real world, tacit as it was  without her, he would probably still be languishing in a medicated stupor in some asylum.  Connelly gives Alicia a soul, wringing everything she can from her lines and I feel that it was a disservice to both Connelly and her character that she was not given more substantive dialogue.  Ed Harris and Paul Bettany also turn in excellent performances.  While the acting and direction in the film is exceptional, more attention should have been paid to the editing and pacing  several sections lag unnecessarily, notably the extended scenes that dwell on Nash's madness. They could have been cut down without lessening the impact.  In addition, Crowe's accent, which is hard to peg, slips a few times (okay, I'm being picky, but I really notice that).  The biggest `problem' is the marketing: the trailers are deceiving, leading you to believe that the film is a cloak and dagger thriller when it is so much more. A Beautiful Mind is one of those rare films that will appeal to both casual moviegoers and cinema fans alike.",A Beautiful Mind

Gone is Nash's racism, snobbery, arrest for indecent exposure, history of violent behavior, messy relationships with both sexes, the woman and son he abandoned, the voices that told him aliens were transmitting messages to him via the New York Times, the repeated stays at various loony bins, the nine months he spent wandering Europe trying to renounce his citizenship, the fact that Alicia divorced him in 1963, and that their son is schizophrenic. In short, gone is everything about Nash that made him such a enigmatic yet despicable human being to begin with.The whitewashing doesn't end there. Parcher calling Joe McCarthy ""an idiot"", and proclaiming how the atomic bombs ""evaporated 150,000 people"" has no business being in the movie, as such ""opinions"" were totally foreign to most Americans, and certainly to those who worked for the government (even those who were figments of one's imagination).Crowe as Rain Man and Connelly as the Long-Suffering Wife does not tell us what kept (and keeps) Nash and Alicia together. The cruel irony that a man who finessed a mathematical theory of rational behavior should succumb to insanity is totally lost on Opie and fellow hack Akiva Goldsman.

Russell Crowe does his bit to rescue this production as the star, and Connelly, Harris and Bettany are also excellent, but their scripts allow only so much scope for personal talent to shine. It is also worth noting that this movie is so late 90s/early 00s in its style that its slightly laughable at points. There is a soft light filter over the entire film, and the music is dramatic to say the least.

In many cases, the boundaries between them are not very clear, and schizophrenia like ""a beautiful eve"" is in most cases the patent of a person with a high IQ. Movies need dramatic contradictions and conflicts, and a contradictory personality is undoubtedly a good material.

But there is no doubt that geniuses are also people, and their human emotions also need to be satisfied. Therefore, most of this type of film will return to human nature after touting genius, and eventually realize the universal significance of the film on its redemption road.""A beautiful eve"" can also be regarded as a discussion of fame and fortune to a certain extent. The opening remark is a heated text in the style of ""Youth China"", so that the future of each motherland present feels that if it has not been opened before death It's shameful to pass. This kind of strong utilitarian suggestion has to say that it has deeply influenced Nash's life trajectory to a great extent, making him eager to become famous, and he is willing to do everything he can, as long as this society affirms him. William Parcher is such an existence. He appeared at a time when Nash was not willing to be kicked by the Pentagon. He made Nash feel valued and met Bole. From then on, he could go straight. This VIP-style treatment undoubtedly excites him and allows his vanity to be unprecedentedly satisfied, although this can also be attributed to the failure of his relationship. So whether he was in school or taking medicine, what he was most afraid of was his wise eyes ""blindness"". This taste is like interrupting the legs of a sportsman. The basics.When you are alive, walking on the road, you are an ordinary person, not an academic elite, not a genius. You live a life as ordinary as others, and you must learn to respect life.The true enemy of genius is genius, the opponent of idiot is idiot, and the person you never want to defeat is actually yourself. You never want to be perfunctory about life.",A Beautiful Mind

The rest of the cast was pretty good too.Minor SpoilerThe only flaws in this movie deal with John Nash when he doesnt realize he has schizphrenia and hes in that car. How can he be riding in a car when the person driving it isnt real. There was also one other occasion where something like this happened but I keep forgetting what it was.
Alot of people are p***ed off this won Best Picture. I have seen 3 out of the 5 best picture nominees and I can say this is the best so far. Moulin Rouge was Very Good but not quite as good as A Beautiful Mind. LOTR: FOTR was good, visually stunning and mostly entertaining, but its overrated.

He has proved one thing beyond doubt. He can do anything on film and it works. He indeed was robbed of his deserved Oscar and he indeed earned it in A Beautiful Mind. Superior direction from Howard combined with Russell's talent made it an Oscar favorite. The film does leave out several periods in his life story but I found that those additions only would have served to detract from the masterpiece instead of make it smoother or more ""factual"". This is a story about life, love, sickness, and genius. It is also a story of a triumph of the human spirit. The spirit urges us forward when the mind fails and the heart is not willing. It makes you feel things that most people can never hope to understand. Best film of 2001.",A Beautiful Mind
192,philthegreatone-786-63058,Great film about a great man,8,20 April 2011,This is an interesting film about John Nash played greatly by Russell a great mathematician. The film begins with him as a 19 year old at Princeton university. It jumps a few years later to when he is a teacher and his future wife Alicia played in an Oscar winning performance by Jennifer Connolley. One thing is though he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. His wife submits him to a mental hospital where he stays for a while. He experiences paranoid dillusions and sees people who aren't really there.

He starts as a college freshman and by film end is a Nobel Laureate and is supremely believable.In order to define himself he needs other people (as do we all).  Ed Harris and Jennifer Connelly fulfill these roles sublimely.The film fulfills its role too.  Just as John Nash does the audience questions what -- and more importantly, who -- is real.In order for this film to work the audience must question what is presented to them as reality.  John Nash must do the same.Magnificent photography, great editing and an incredible soundtrack all add to the sense of (un)reality.Schizophrenia is a hard subject to tackle -- let alone film -- but Ron Howard takes Akiva Goldsman's script and does it well and, more important, believably.However, the audience must ask: What is reality and who defines it?",A Beautiful Mind

198,The_Orenda,An important film...,7,16 October 2007,"Deep down, I feel that the topic of mental illness is a touchy and hard topic to cover for Hollywood. In regards to schizophrenia, A Beautiful Mind is currently, and by far, the best story in order to remotely comprehend what a family endures and overcomes when a member of their family is stricken with the illness. The story of John Nash is an intriguing one at the least.Taking an idea from Adam Smith one step further, Princeton mathematician John Nash revolutionizes economics and lands a job at M.I.T. The Pentagon also hires him to crack codes against the Communists.The movie takes its time picking up, as we get to know the anti-social Nash and his lifestyle. When the symptoms of an illness become apparent, we haven't seen the worst by far. There is no action or danger that would draw you into A Beautiful Mind. On the contrary, this movie is the dramatic story of an economic genius whom we get to know. Incredibly, his genius constantly struggles with madness everyday.",A Beautiful Mind
199,budmassey,"A towering achievement cinematic ally, biographically, and historically.",10,29 December 2001,"With this film Russell Crowe dispels any doubt that his Oscar for Gladiator was deserved. Had Crowe not alienated the entire Hollywood community with his sullen and belligerent manner in the months leading up to voting, he would have won the Best Actor statue for a second time. And while this is a tragedy of Crowe's own doing, it does not eclipse the satisfaction of Ron Howard finally getting his statue for Best Director. This is a true story that is sometimes a little taxing to watch, and the dizzying contrast between high and low is something that is only poorly attempted by the likes of contemporaries such as Vanilla Sky.Speaking of contrast, naysayers who panned Russell as wooden and two-dimensional in Gladiator will have to eat those words as he renders this complex turn that is filled with both vulnerability and hubris, elation and pathos, genius and madness. After all, that's why they call it acting, which Crowe has more than proved he can do.There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and the only danger is that Crowe has peaked too high too soon, a'la, say Richard Dreyfuss, or, *gasp* Anna Paquin (Hollywood's most underrated young beauty) and even *double gasp*, Tatum O'Neal, and although nobody can accuse Crowe of being an overnight success, performances like this one make us hope he isn't spent any time soon.The first half of the movie is lyrically beautiful, in which Crowe ascends the throne of the mathematics intelligentsia, meeting his exquisite wife, played beautifully and as a full peer to Crowe by Jennifer Connelly who won a well-deserved Oscar. The second half is, without spoiling it for you, the best suspense you will see since The Sixth Sense. In the end, it wraps up nicely with a bow, and to those whose reviews pretentiously claimed to find the story unbelievable, I can only add, this being a true story, that fact is always stranger than fiction.Much is left out of Nash's back story, like, among many other things, that he had pronounced homosexual tendencies, and we are never quite given any satisfactory explanation for his descent into madness. Nevertheless, A Beautiful Mind is a towering achievement cinematically, biographically, and historically.",A Beautiful Mind
200,jay4stein79-1,Happier Days Indeed,4,31 October 2004,"I really love Happy Days. There's something about Richie, Pottsie, Malph, the Fonze, and all the Cunninghams that just causes all of my aversions to sugar-coated Americana switch off. I cannot tolerate the Brady Bunch, Leave It to Beaver, Full House, etc, but a half-hour of Happy Days is pure television genius. I can't really explain why this is, but I surmise that I've always detected that, on some level, Happy Days didn't believe the myths it spun. It understood that the era it depicted was not all peaches and cream; there was something dark underneath all those episodes.Those other shows, those happy-family sit-coms, seem to believe their mythic landscapes and I cannot abide them for that. Or something.Well, as you all know, little Richie grew up and became a reasonably successful film director and produced, among others, A Beautiful Mind. And, man, does it make me yearn for Happy Days.I'm not entirely sure why this film has been un-necessarily given the title of genius. It's really just another Hollywood bio-pic and, if I'm not mistaken, there have been very few of those that were worthwhile (Ed Wood, for example, or Baadasssss! or Auto Focus). Nevertheless, come February and March, they take home all sorts of little gold statuettes.Russell Crowe offers another fine (though not Best Actor nomination worthy) performance as John Nash, schizophrenic genius extraordinaire, while Ed Harris proves again that he should receive more leading roles. He's one of the few character actors left in Hollywood who can waltz into any movie and instantly improve the film's quality. He was by far the finest point in the Hours and he's equally excellent here, yet again supplying the high-point in an otherwise mediocre movie (Truman Show and the aforementioned Hours anyone?). The remaining performances struck me as rather bland, as did the direction, and score.The only other bright spot for me were occasional flashes of cinematographic brilliance supplied by Mr. Roger Deakins, who, though not at the top of his game, provided us with something better, at least, than his nadir thus far - O Brother Where Art Thou.To be honest, though John Nash is certainly an important figure and has provided many important discoveries, I seriously question the need to give him his own film. Most great bio-pics serve a higher purpose than to worship the life they depict, offering the audience insight into something other than a so-called genius. A Beautiful Mind strives to do this, providing us with a glimpse into the world of mental illness, but ultimately the movie fails in this.The movie ultimately is not about schizophrenia; it's about John Nash. I like my bio-pics the other way around; I like them to be about something and not about an individual or group (take Ed Wood, for example - a film not about one of the most interesting Hollywood figures, but rather about the under-side of Hollywood - the B-picture and the effects of Hollywood upon the stars it made famous and threw away) All in all, this was a mediocre film, not worth the attention it received and certainly not worth the $9 I gave them to see it in the theaters.

201,Ozzy2000,Big deal and bad acting,1,7 July 2008,"Another highly over-rated Hollywood film for which half the budget was spent on Marketing and the purchase of Oscars for the ""Actors"".A fictional and very boring story about a a socially and mentally challenged mathematician who wins the Nobel prize for his Economic postulations which were of little consequence in History. The most over-rated so called Actor of contemporary History, Russell Crowe plays John Nash whilst the his doting Girlfriend and then wife is played by Jennifer Connelly.Russel Crowe has the usual two facial expressions of arrogant and conceited throughout the film along with his monotone mumbling voice.This film is poorly directed and drags on like a midday TV soapy about someone who is a misunderstood genius for some strange and confusing reason.

Poor Nash became afflicted with paranoia-schizophrenia, a condition he suffered from for about two decades until the symptoms abated.Cleverly, Ron Howard introduces us gradually to Nash's unreal world.The effects - such as an umbrella star constellation and magazine pages that light up etc, are wonderfully done.On the downside, the historical facts are played around with, when the facts would probably make a better story. (For example, the Equilibrium was not instantly accepted,unlike shown in the film.)Russell Crowe's performance is not particularly good. Jennifer Connelly's is much better as the just-too-good-to-be true girlfriend, then wife.At the pen-laying ceremony at the end, I was expecting Ed Harris to come and lay his pen, but I suppose that is just the way I look at the world.",A Beautiful Mind
203,dataconflossmoor,Unprecedented Genius Often Times Goes Unnoticed!!!,10,16 October 2007,"It is difficult to acknowledge anyone who is above and beyond the run of the mill!! People possessing ability or prodigal genius are often times, not even aware of it!!Russel Crowe is sensational in this movie, as he plays Nobel Peace Prize winner, John Nash!! A critical prerequisite to an actor or actress executing a role effectively, is that he or she can astutely grasp a thorough understanding of the role itself!! This film has a performance by Russel Crowe that can be compared with Tom Hanks performance in ""Forrest Gump"" and Matt Damon's performance in ""Good Will Hunting"". All three actors in these movies established a noteworthy precedent in the cinema industry by portraying characters who had an intense comprehension of the character's adamant convictions!! In all three cases, these characters had a self worth which exuded an unintentional greatness!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" deals with an individual named John Nash, a hermit with an unassuming cerebral charisma who is considered gifted (i.e. not normal). The denotative explanation of normal is ordinary... This individual is extraordinary!! Not normal is often times referred to in these precarious terms... strange, different, or unusual!!! A person who drives a Rolls Royce is strange!! A baseball team that wins the World Series is different!! A person who becomes a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company is unusual!! An exceptionally brilliant mind is not normal, this movie depicts the ramifications of such a blessing in disguise!!! Reality becomes a rude awakening for John Nash (Russel Crowe). His brilliance is not always easy to empathize with because his actions are so reckless!! He perpetually demonstrates a relentless affliction with formidable schizophrenic influences!! Many people who deal with John Nash encounter this illness with trepidation, and it throws them into a tailspin!! For John Nash, this is an obsessive preoccupation which requires a necessary detachment!! The producers of this movie want the audience to view John Nash's (Russel Crowe's) mental handicap like you are from the outside looking in!! It is for this reason that this movie manufactures a succinct obviation of emotional security for John Nash as a way of giving the movie audience a thorough conception of Professor Nash's dilemma!! Ultimately, he attains a noteworthy recognition from Princeton's prominent academia!! This is an accolade which most of us only dream about!! Ronny Howard and Brian Grazer do a remarkable job at directing this film, as their creativity homogenizes!! Their cooperation with the coordinating producers, as well as the actors and actresses in the movie, was not perfunctory, rather, they engaged in a rudimentary commiseration with virtually everyone who was involved in the creation of this film!! The acting in this movie is terrific!! Why the acting is so terrific in this movie, is mostly on account of the fact that all of the performers in this film were mutually challenged!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a marvelous film which left an indelible impact on the intellectually sensitive movie viewers!! Perhaps many of them painstakingly pondered the statement of ""I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible"". What is normal is ordinary, and, what is not normal has the potential to be extraordinary!! If you stop and think about it, it is truly enlightening when something extraordinary occurs!! If you can thoroughly conceptualize this, than the directors of this film have attained a zenith in artistic gratification which is absolutely spectacular!!",A Beautiful Mind
204,Doc_Who,"A wonderful biopic about John Forbes Nash,Jr and his life's problems to the Nobel Prize",10,30 December 2001,"I guess I'm one of the lucky people who have seen this movie before it gets a wide release. This movie is a biopic of math prodigy John Forbes Nash,Jr and many of his problems in life.When we first meet John(played by the awesome Russell Crowe) he is a student a Princeton. John makes a few friends at the school. But John's problems are about to increase in his life big time. John graduates from Princeton and moves on to bigger things.A few years later( the mid-1950's) John is working for the Dept. of Defense at MIT. John is recruited by a strange man in black to decode stuff for the government. John meets a beatuful woman who understands him.After John and Alicia(jennifer Connelly) get married, John's life seems pretty normal. But their married problems do not get any better.Eventually John ends up in a mental hospital for his schizophrenia. John gets the medicine he needs to get better. But John is still seeing people and talking to people who do not exist. Eventaully John Nash wins his Nobel Prize in 1994. There's lots more but I've already said enough.This movie has Oscar written all over it. The cast should gets Oscar nominations for thier work.Ron Howard finally made a movie far better than his last movie(How the Grinch Stole Christmas). I hope this movie gets awards as it a very well done film about a real life person,
If you are sick and tired of all the typical mainstream trash out there, check out this wonderful biopic. It's about 2 1/2 hours but it goes by quite fast. This movie was better than the movie trailers before it! If not check it out when it comes out on DVD!",A Beautiful Mind
205,llihilloh,"It's good, but not worthy of Best Picture.",6,21 February 2003,"'A Beautiful Mind' IS a good movie.  The acting is quite good, the story itself is ho-hum, but it just doesn't have what it takes to be a Best Picture.I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with Russell Crowe's performance.  I might just have to go all the way and say that I wouldn't have been upset if he would have won that Oscar.  He did a terrific job; he let his emotions flow, didn't seem to annoy me...no complaints here.  Okay, I have a complaint.  I did not agree with the casting of Jennifer Connelly. Am I truly the only one that thought that her role was extremely small?  I mean she just didn't have that big of a part.  She won her Oscar for some reason, not really sure why.  Ed Harris was alright.  He wasn't anything spectacular, but he certainly was better than Connelly.  I can't really remember any of the other actors just because they were all males, plus they looked somewhat similar to each other.  I'm not too thrilled with the story itself.  I had never even heard of John Nash before.  It seemed interesting, but then boring after a while, then it picked up, but became tiresome again.  It was a bit long, so I was somewhat relieved when it finally did come to an end. Okay, 'A Beautiful Mind' is good, but it did not deserve to be named Best Picture of the year.  I'm not sure that I would have even thought to put it in the nomination category.  The thing is is that Ron Howard did a wonderful job.  I'm a big fan of Howard; loved him for years.  He's an amazing director and his direction of the film is handled so well, but for some reason the movie just did not deserve that award.  He, however, did deserve his long awaited Oscar as it was rightfully awarded.  That didn't really make sense what I just said, but the main point that I'm trying to get across is that Howard did a great job.'A Beautiful Mind' is a good film to watch if you have the time and patience for a pretty slow paced movie.  Normally that would bug me to no end, but it's not as bad here.  It does lag though, at times.  It may have been nominated for a load of awards (winning half), but was still in need of that extra touch to really make it shine.",A Beautiful Mind
206,merrywood,A Celebration of Life,10,28 March 2002,"Empiricists are prone to simply place a label on something that cannot be quantified or qualified by sense perception and then to construct a mythology around it. This is the case in the science of human behavior. Abnormal behavior that is not understood, such as schizophrenia is labeled and categorized per its attending syndrome. Its symtomology is then attacked by various therapeutic methods and chemical concoctions, some which are more harmful to the patient than the so-called illness itself.In this exquisite film the protagonist suffers from schizophrenia as diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Yet, the film is not about the illness as much as it is about an extraordinary man who is quite different from most of us, a man who has far greater use of his brain than perhaps 99.9% of the rest of us. It is about his triumph despite the ""malady"".However, this malady, as seen by some metaphysicians takes on a more interesting casting. After Albert Einstein the entire world we thought we knew came up for grabs. In this new arena where temporal reality is invalidated and matter revealed as pure energy, where time and space are inextricably bonded and labeled illusory the astute metaphysician has no alternative but to see some abnormal behaviors as perhaps something far more profound than a dysfunction of the brain.As seen here, in this very best work thus far of Ron Howard after a director's career of excellence we are given the latitude to question the nature of the ""illness"" called schizophrenia. We are also shown interweaving realities as perceived by an extraordinary mind and what happens when that mind meets the rest of us.",A Beautiful Mind

Needless to say, that I got nearly bored in first half an hour, but what I resent this movie the most, is the fact, that this is just another Hollywood ""love-can-conquer-all"" type of movie, what reminds me of a poor Pearl Harbor.The movie should provide more, especially for the more demanding viewers, than just a simple love story. I had the feeling that the director just haven't enough courage, to show us the real John Nash. Like Oliver Stone did in magnificent J.F.K.
But, all in all, there are some bright things, which brings this movie above others (especially in this era, when H'wood is in crisis).

209,RIK-22,"Well acted, but poor story telling",4,18 July 2002,"I watched the DVD, of A Beautiful Mind, over a week ago, as I had really made my mind up about the picture, I didn't write anything until now.  One thing I can't dismiss was the performances of Jennifer and Russell, whom I thought were both excellent.I'm not sure about Ron Howard's direction, it's hard to criticise Ron, as he is such a likeable chap and on the DVD, you hear him talk about the film with great dedication and passion.  Having said all that I feel that this was a weak presentation of a story, rather like Apollo 13, simplistic, join the dots' film making.  No real use of the camera or changes of style. Nothing in this film draws me in or surprises me, by the end of the film, you have a feeling of being let down, with the director trying to get some kind of sentimentality out, even when there isn't any naturally there.There are, of course, two fundamental problems with this film, the story itself.  A mathematician, a shy difficult genius, who suffers from Schizophrenia.  Yet he has the dedication of his wife to help him through his experiences.  The story isn't that interesting or at least it isn't presented as interesting.  The other greater problem is the lack of truth, which is a real problem for me.  The reason I see a true story' is because I really want to see the reality of the situation and what really happened, not a fictitious account.  When I read, after viewing the film, that he had homosexual affairs, whilst at school and in fact he believed he was hearing from Aliens and not from people, it adds a completely different slant on things.  Also the key point of the movie, in my opinion, was his wife's ability to stay with him.  In reality it was her that hid his problems and it was her that had him committed to an institution and the biggest contradiction was that she divorced him.In summary, well acted, but yet another Hollywood true story' that is far from true (Hurricane, The Perfect Storm, Braveheart, etc)6/10",A Beautiful Mind

213,KFL,An unflinching depiction of the tortures of genius,9,18 August 2002,"As someone who has spent some time studying the history of science, and so presumes to know a little about the circumstances from which bold new discoveries have emerged, I found this film to ring true, for the most part at least.John Nash is a bold young man with the self-confidence to propose a theory that overturns 150 years of economic theory. He is ready and willing to throw out the old rules, and make up new ones. Problem is, this attitude can be dangerous: get into the habit of throwing out old views and looking at things in new ways, and you may find yourself cut loose and set adrift, bereft of a sound footing, unable to be sure of anything. After all, we can only remake our world a little at a time.Of course there is no simple relation between his achievements and his mental illness, and it would be mistaken to suppose otherwise. But the movie points, persuasively I thought, in the general direction of a connection. Nash is adept at discerning patterns--in the stars, in coded signals, whatnot. He takes this talent too far in the same direction, and it is transformed from an enviable talent into a monstrosity, a symptom of mental disease. The eccentric genius is after all one of our most well-entrenched clichés. And while Roger Ebert writes, in his review of this movie, that ""Nash has been compared to Newton, Mendel and Darwin, but was also for many years just a man muttering to himself in the corner,"" it happens that Newton, Mendel, Darwin themselves all did things equivalent to muttering to themselves in a corner. Obsession and its concomitant behavior seems to be a factor common to all four men.",A Beautiful Mind
214,joppanLive,A beautiful biopic,7,21 February 2018,"To be frank, I found this movie very boring in the beginning. But as time passes, I got immersed into it fully and it takes me along with it. John Nash's life is beautifully picturized with all the complexities in his life. I could relate this movie to people in my life and I found this movie very authentic and true. Jennfier Conolly was superb in her role as Nash's suffering wife. I would rate this film as a MUST WATCH among the biopics.",A Beautiful Mind
215,Kubris,Hollywood at its finest,9,4 October 2011,"I knew nothing about this movie before I saw it, only that it was a true story about a mathematician whose life took a turn for the worse after taking a new job. I thought this was a espionage-math movie. This made the plot progression much more shocking, and gave the film, in my eyes, a great twist.A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash, a man who is great at math, but not great with women. He takes on the job of breaking codes for the government, and begins to be followed and in one excellent scene, shot at. However, *SPOILERS* this is not the case, he is a schizophrenic, and it was all in his head. We see his slow recovery with fallbacks, as well as his wife's ordeals through this.Starring Russell Crowe, fresh from his Best Actor win, is a radically different person here: he is meek and intelligent, as opposed to the brave and strong Maximus. I believe his performance here is better than in Gladiator. He shows more range and is convincing as the confused and sick Nash.Opposite him is his wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly, fresh from her descent in a favourite of mine, Requiem for A Dream. She is excellent, but I think she slipped at the end in the aged finale. Her makeup/CGI is not convincing.From Nash's view, the film is planted in reality, but the amazing original soundtrack makes it more like a dream. Even the intense chase is accompanied by piano. The music is great, and you notice the scenes it isn't present.The direction is great, the pacing is quick, and the shooting is conventional, but that's all it needs to be.Why did I describe the film as 'Hollywood at its finest""? Because the true story is far less glamorous and sympathetic. The filmmakers cut out Nash's lesser moments, like his divorce, affairs and racist rants. Also the majority of the hallucinations didn't happen. There was no roommate, no government agents in his head: the reality wouldn't make a very good film. Certainly, changes can be made to enhance a story for the screen, but this story is barely John Nash. This post-viewing knowledge soured my remembrance of the film.A Beautiful Mind is a great film with great direction and acting, but strays too far from the truth. But don't let that dampen your mood on a great drama. 8.6/10",A Beautiful Mind

First pick up a book and make sure it's a biography. Nothing sounds more award worthy than the ""based on a true story"" line. Now start with the clichés: The perfect award winning role for best actor is a mentally challenged person with a remarkable ability (Forrest Gump, Rain Man, Shine, etc.) add a martyr wife who supports the main character's eccentric view of the world (Pollock), make it look like a period thing, have some decent cinematography a proven director, then, start preparing yourspeech for Oscar night. That's it.I'm not saying A Beautiful Mind is boring, or silly. It's in fact a competent film that delivers. Problem is, it's not the best film of the 2001. That privilege falls under Memento, and possibly Amelie or Lord of the Rings depending of your taste.

The haunting emotions, the fear, the anxiety, the terror... and the complex warmth from the people around John Nash. Fantastic! Can there be an understanding coming out from that ""genius and bright minds"" goes too far in an complex pattern inside the human so that it creates an imaginary world out of ""an fake habit""....?Russel Crowe shows his best sides in acting and should have been given a double Academy Award for his work in this motion picture. Absolutely phenomenal! Christopher Plummer..... Ed Harris.... Jennifer Connelly.... they all make this actors guild a perfect match.Can a soul be schizophrenic.... or is it ""only"" the brain? A stunning piece of art. Gives so much to the viewer, that lets it.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Great work speaking of the zeitgeist. - The actors : Oscar nominations. Question on that one? - The story : Wonderful! A man change so much with mathematics. Thank You, John Nash. - Entertainment : Spellbinding. - Age : Maybe from 7 years old, taking the consideration of the scenes of weapons and also the mental asylum.8,1 out of 10.

This is a wonderful movie, moving and entertaining. How accurate a representation of John Nash it is is totally irrelevant. Movies are an entertainment medium and in that sense, this film is a total triumph.And it is Russell Crowe's triumph. Crowe is on a role as of late garnering three consecutive Oscar nominations. He clearly won for the wrong film. This role is tour de force. He loses himself so deeply in the character so convincingly that I found myself in his mentally ill world believing everything I experienced.Ron Howard unfolds this moving brilliantly. I won't give away secrets, but the less you know about it going in the better. This movie does let you into the mind of its lead character and really makes you consider your own perceptions and realities. Are we really here? Am I really typing. Picking apart this film for minute factual content or leaving out alleged details of the main characters sexuality is totally churlish and unnecessary.See and love this movie. It works completely well as a piece of stand alone fiction inspired by a true story. Jennifer Connelly is stunning as usual (I question an Oscar for her, but she is effective) and there is a brilliant supporting role by the always enjoyable Ed Harris.A Beautiful Mind will stand in time as a worthy Best Picture.

223,Snowgo,The Cocky Dweeb,5,8 August 2014,"I really don't see how anyone can like this movie. What kind of person would that be? I am really trying to put this equation together. My only guess is a misanthropic, rude, conceited rich boy. I suppose this kind of person might find some vicarious validation or confirmation of his (or her) clinically anti-social behavior. Then again, many misanthropic, rude, conceited rich boys would find this movie as value-less as I did. The only poetry in the movie came when the lady at the bar gave him a righteous dope-slap. His colleagues should have done the same thing. This guy makes Rainman (Dustin Hoffmann), Starman (Jeff Bridges) and Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) seem relatively normal and affable. What I would love is for a sequel: (John Nash Meets Mr. Bean). Bean would eat him alive with his equally dysfunctional yet eminently- approachable eccentricism. I can only imagine the tears Nash would weep and the teeth he would gnash as his rigid worldview and egotism is shattered by the bumbling-but-caring and well-meaning Bean.I went along with the movie, continuing to watch, just to wait for the moment when this cretin is expelled from college. Alas, that moment never came. Sometimes, things just don't add up: Ask Nash.This arrogant, ill-mannered nebulus would never have made it through high school with his attitude. I abode with his cockiness, though, until it was revealed that the big theory he was working on was (cough) economics. I really thought the screenwriter was screwing with us at that point: Economics? Is there anyone in their right mind who finds economic theory to be entertaining or otherwise compelling?One major flaw in the script was when his roommate pushes Nash's desk and all his paperwork out the window: He should have shoved Nash out with it.His working on the sterile and uninspiring subject of economics was the icing on the cake. The cherry on top came when he began work for our beloved (choke) Pentagon. more formulaic demonization of Russia.If we find it difficult to find empathy or any relation to John Nash, the person, we find it impossible to find any connection to John Nash the D.O.D. employee. Not in today's political climate, knowing what we do about the Pentagon, C.I.A. etc.John Nash was looking for a novel idea to distinguish and validate him. Try a little humility and some compassion, John.P.S: Do NOT blame this horrid movie on Ron Howard. The short-comings of this film are the direct responsibility of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman.., and the seven other producers, besides Howard, that he had to satisfy. I'm not sure he could have made this film any better from a direction standpoint.",A Beautiful Mind
224,mweston,3.5 stars,8,18 April 2002,"I saw this on 2/19/2002. The title refers to the mind of John Nash, a brilliant but eccentric mathematician played by Russell Crowe. This film, which is based on the real life of John Nash, opens in 1947 when he arrives at Princeton, and continues through a period of 47 years. During this time his eccentricity is seen to deepen into mental illness, and we see his struggles against it in a way few others could attempt.Crowe's performance here is quite remarkable, both in terms of portraying the changing phases of his life, but also his ability to show us what he is feeling in his early encounters with his schoolmates and his future wife (played very well by Jennifer Connelly) and his later battles with mental illness. Ed Harris, on the other hand, is under used. The direction, by Ron Howard, is quite good in its ability to show us the inner workings of Nash's mind, both in its mathematical brilliance and in its struggles with sanity.The biggest aspect that holds this film back from greatness is its simplification and Hollywood-izing of Nash's life. For example, Nash's bisexuality is left out of the film. But even if the package is just a little too neatly wrapped, this is a film that is highly recommended.",A Beautiful Mind

A ""Beautiful Mind"" I believe now was the best film of the year it was released (think Space Odyssey score here).  I really liked this movie.  How often does one see a film about mathematician who is schizophrenic? Here are my reasons for liking ""A Beautiful Mind"": (1) Russell Crowe is a multi-dimensional actor and this is by far the best performance of his careeer.  He should have won the Oscar. (2) Jennifer Connelly showed some major chops as Crowe's wife.  Her Oscar was well-deserved.  (3) Ron Howard finally got his Oscar.  His direction of films has only gotten better over the years (last best example is Apollo 13). (4) You go into this film thinking you know what will happen but you aren't really prepared for it. (5) The writing and plotting were fantastic. (6) The action sequences weren't typical Hollywood cheese. (7) The make-up effects were entirely realistic.  Crowe and Connelly looked completely different and they didn't look overdone. (8) The two intellectual geeks from ""Dazed and Confused"" showed up as Crowe's friends and they weren't at all annoying. (9) The conclusion of the film nearly caused me to break down into tears. (10) THe middle third is unbelievable too.

I am losing count.I first watched it at the recommendation of my abnormal psychology professor, maybe in 2010? I did not watch any trailer nor read anything about the film - I just dived in blind and watched it. Having done this paid off, which I still do today.I was so glad I did not watch any trailer nor read anything about the film because by doing this was able to avoid the biggest two twists in the story, especially the ending. Learning about these twists live as you are watching the film for the first time is much more effective than if you already had them spoiled by reading about the movie. But even after having watched it once, after knowing the entire plot and re-watching it two more times, the movie is still amazing. Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly were perfect for their roles. Jennifer earned her Oscar and Russell should have won the Oscar instead of Denzel Washington. The supporting cast did fine too. Everything in this movie was good. The director Ron Howard earned his Oscar, Akiva Goldsman earned his Oscar for the screenplay, and Brian Hazer earned his Oscar for producing it. This is a must-watch film and a very rewatchable film.10/10P.S., may the real-life characters that Russell and Jennifer play in the movie rest in peace.

228,lingmeister,A good story about schizophrenia,7,28 December 2002,"A Beautiful Mind, is not a movie about the life of John Nash or about a mathematical genius. It is about a person whose schizophrenia gets worse and worse and how he overcomes it.To label it as a story of John Nash, portrayed here by Russell Crowe, is inaccurate.  Much of the unsavory parts of his life has been edited out and other parts has been changed.  This is all to make him a character whose only flaw is his sickness, which is also something the filmmaker wants the people to sympathize with.  Plus, many characters seem to be invented so that it will easily fill the story.  Watching the film at first, and then finding out his true life, you feel as if have been conned by the filmmakers.  I think if they dealt with all aspects of his life, likeable or not, his character would have been more real, and it would have made a fuller and more complex film.The mathematics aspects of the film seems to be glossed over much like window dressing, all to display his abstract genius mind without delving into anything deep and truly explaining the complexities of it.  When I was watching the film and saw the numbers being highlighted, I thought this was a pathetic joke, something like math for dummies, a picturisque coffee table version.  Eventually you realize the movie has nothing to do with mathematics.  In some aspect, I was disappointed by it.The film's true focus is on his sickness, including all the delusions he has, his treatments and all the effects it had on him, his temptation to go back to his old exciting self and eventually his will to fight the battle on his own.  It all makes for a emotional drama, although it is one that is heavily sugar coated by Hollywood.Russell Crowe performed remarkably in this film.  He was always a versatile actor, with a great performance in The Insider.  If it was not for the mysterious Oscar that he got for The Gladiator, he surely would have won one for this.  As for the Oscar that Ron Howard and the film got, it is questionable since the film was not groundbreaking.  I guess that is why films like this gets Ron the Oscars and Mulholland Drive gets David Lynch the award at Cannes.In all, recommended, given that one take it as a film about a man's fight with his sickness and nothing more.",A Beautiful Mind
229,Mr. Pulse,A fine film,8,4 March 2002,"A Beautiful Mind is, on its surface, a story of a brilliant mathematician who submits to schizophrenia, but underneath its a fascinating examination of the power of human perception, and the danger of suspicion when it clouds intellect.  It's a powerful film with exceptional lead performances and strong direction and script.For two hours and fifteen minutes, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly emerse us in the lives of their characters, John and Alicia Nash.  Nash is a brilliant but arrogant and antisocial mathematician, who slowly loses his grip on reality and becomes consumed by paranoia and schizophrenia, and Alicia is his pupil-turned-wife-turned-caretaker when he becomes dangerously unstable.  Crowe's performances is phenomenal, on par with the best of his work, and certainly superior to the role that won him an Oscar, and Connelly, brilliant last year in Requiem For A Dream, constantly finds ways to support and compliment him.The film's Oscar nominations and box office revenue speak to its success, but likely Crowe and Connelly will receive the lion's share of the credit. One shouldn't overlook the work by director Ron Howard.  He takes a potentially dreary story, filled with insanity and lots (and I mean lots) of mathematical equations, and constantly finds new ways to portray them visually.  A standout; Nash rides around in circles on his bicycle, muttering to himself, as the camera rises to bird's eye level, revealing his pattern as the shot fades to a window with the same pattern written on it; the symbol of infinity.The best movies present us with new ideas, questions to ask ourselves reflect on.  I wasn't just engrossed in the situations of A Beautiful Mind, I was constantly absorbed by the questions it posed about reality and obsession.  Nash tells his students at one point that a problem he has presented them with might take them months to solve.  Or, even worse, he adds with a wry smile, the rest of their human existence.  Don't expect the answers to the questions in this movie to come even that quickly.",A Beautiful Mind
230,Sinnerman,Mean(not so lean) acting machine. Russell Crowe for you.,5,17 March 2002,"Though much has been known about Russell Crowe - The Jerk, not enough is said about Russell Crowe - THE Actor.Reputation of his being a jerk is now part of modern day folklore, what with frequent episodes of his beastly tendencies, from breaking up marriages to beating up his castrators (of his poem, that is). However, upon watching an above average though not brilliant film like ""A Beautiful Mind"", one temporarily forgets the poem thumper ever existed and start appreciating his genuine talent as a mean(but not so lean) acting machine.In portraying the Nobel Prize winning math genius, John Nash, Russell Crowe has to assume not just the role of a clever bloke, but also a man lacking adequate social graces and political etiquette(much like the real life actor). On top of that, Mr Crowe has to flesh out the plight of a man plagued by insanity. You see, John Nash also suffered from schizophrenia, a condition which render its victim delusional, paranoid and slowly losing grip with reality.As this was a straight forward biography of John Nash, a full narrative arc, spanning decades, was presented to the audience. It detailed his genius, the onset of his condition, his spiralling into the depths of insanity, and his gradual path back on the road to recovery. Yet, nowhere in the film was I distracted with the timeline nor the gradual personality shift in the man. All credit goes to Russell Crowe, THE ACTOR. For he delivered a powerful yet restrained performance. He captured our sympathies not with his nuanced mannerisms, bringing out subtle moments of brilliance and anguish. A performance so committed, one is astonished by its utter lack of vanity and artifice.Dennis Quaid, ex-husband of Meg Ryan, has this to say of THE ACTOR: ""Hey, he's a really good actor. I won't tell you what I think of him as a person, though. That I'll leave out."" All said and done, Russell Crowe is a paradoxical A**hole Savant - A real life a**hole but a reel life savant. As long as he continue to churn out performances like that in ""A Beautiful Mind"", he will continue to earn the utmost respect from discerning viewers like yours truly. As long as he keep digging married women, underage infants or throw up ego-maniacal tantrums, I will wish that he gets full blown HIV plus testicular cancer. This pretty much sums up my ramblings on the guy the world love to hate. I rest my case.",A Beautiful Mind
231,Sinnerman,A Beautiful Intent to Grab some Oscar gold.,5,18 March 2002,"As an afterthought to my previous writing, that piece should be seen more as a tribute to a Hollywood anomaly named Russell Crowe and less as a review for ""A Beautiful Mind"", simply because I don't exactly love the film.Yes, I can see and admire its craft and its cast' performances are top rated all round. Also, me think its better than 80% of the crap you end up watching anyway. But something cynical in me can't help but suspect the film's true intention - to score some Oscar gold! Thats why it is made within a safe film-making boundary so as not to risk offending the middle-brow majority voters within the Oscar block.I certainly would have hoped a film on insanity be a little edgier, riskier and perhaps even harbour operatic ambitions(Much like my all time faves, ""Magnolia"" or ""Dancer in the Dark""). But it is just my wishful thinking and of course my views cannot and should not discount your decision in watching this well made film. Go see it and decide for yourself.An actress of intelligence and intuition, Jennifer Conelly gave an equally outstanding turn as the strong and loving wife to Russell's madman persona. Without her able supporting performance and anchoring presence, the intensity of Russell's portrayal would not have soared the way it did. After being neglected for her overly qualified performance, in last year's ""Requiem for a dream""(where she was butt-f**ked, seriously!), those Oscar folks should be summarily castrated if they don't give her due acknowledgement this year.In line with my being the source of all useless knowledge, just in case you are wondering, the infamous poem being cut out from Russell Crowe's BAFTA awards ceremony is titled ""Sanctity"" by Patrick Kavanagh. Below its full, surgically re-attached glory: ""To be a poet and not know the trade/To be a lover and repel all women/Twin ironies by which great saints are made/ The agonizing pincer jaws of heaven.""Have a Nice Day then.",A Beautiful Mind

It is about John Nash, a genial mathematician who suffers a mental illness and has to confront the disease.

It wasn't an easy movie to direct because of the nature of the story it tells, but Howard was able to enrich the writing with his work behind the camera, a very remarkable job.

238,CurtMan@LVCM.com,Beautiful EVERYTHING in this beautiful film,10,3 June 2004,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""A Beautiful Mind"" ranks as one of the best films I have ever had the privilege to understand, a monumental achievement on multiple levels in film. To begin with, the performance of Russell Crowe as the troubled, delusional mathematician John Nash borders on sheer perfection- astute, collaborative (of Nash's estrangement with the world), and potent; Crowe constructs a character so veritable and bewildering that you always marvel his genius and symphathize with his illness. The film chronicles a brilliant, yet socially flawed, mathematician. Nash dissociates with the world, dismissing the company of others for sketching and calculating curious situational equations----on his dormatory window. Struggling with ""books, classes"", Nash finally emerges as a gifted mathematician with a law for governing dynamics, and succeeds from Princton to Wheeler Labs at M.I.T. Assigned by ""Big Brother"" to investigate potential communist coding in various publications, Nash is soon propelled into a dizzying world of fright, turmoil, and delusion, as his accomplished genius is almost obliterated by mental illness. The film focuses intensely on Nash's battle with schizophrenia, with brilliant direction, beautiful music, and potent,engrossing dialogue. The second standout performance here is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly, who compassionately plays Nash's wife, Alicia, supporting the film whenever we lack to understand Nash and his trauma. The film succeeds in its story of a mathematician plagued by schizophrenia with realism and empathy. Every instrument of constructing this story is suitable, if not excellent. Simply put, ""A Beautiful Mind"" delivers the most beautiful potency in its success of engrossing us with John Nash, the most important genius of his time, and detailing his truly, bizarrely, remarkable life. **** out of ****",A Beautiful Mind

Probably one of the most interesting aspects of the movie is when we get a glimpse inside Nash's mind every so often to see the patterns he finds.But, unfortunately, A Beautiful Mind begins to lose its charm, and quickly. Sure, everything begins to rapidly accelerate for a moment as Nash is wrapped up in some sort of government conspiracy, but soon everything slows and the movie really trudges at a moderate pace.Spoilers are definitely coming.Nash's transformation into the paranoid, totally freaked-out husband is interesting, of course.  I was really getting involved with the movie, wondering what everything meant, what was going to happen to him, his wife, and his unborn child.Then the mental hospital doctor's came, and everything began to go downhill. Once they keep him under control and try to show him that what he sees isn't real, the movie really slows.  In truth, I was captivated, siding with Nash and saying to myself, ""No, it's real!""  That was probably the best part of the movie.  It was almost like a twist.  I could have never guessed those people weren't real.But that did not sustain the movie.  It didn't come together really well at the end, it was rather boring, and, although great if you're into movies that explore the depths of psychology, I found it quite tedious.A Beautiful Mind can really catch one's attention at the beginning, but it can't hold its pace.

However Ron Howard did a good job in the movie but I think he didn't really deserve his Oscar cause the movie really could have been a lot better with lots of tears and of course a lot of other meanings from that genius person's story and only depending on the warm music and performance of the leading actors wasn't close to what this story could have become with another more intelligent director. By this I don't mean to Underestimate his good job in the movie but I guess many other awards agree with me that he did a good job but didn't do his best only the Oscars that refused to give it to Peter Jackson. The story too didn't focus on his smart and the people around him more than it focused on his problem and tragedy that I felt he was a genius person his tragedy prevented him from using his mind and his family suffered to make him better.

It is all very professionally made and the story itself is truly touching and so I guess that any modestly competent director could wring out some strong scenes from it. Russell Crowe is impressive, but somehow he never convinces me that he is someone else than Russel Crowe. Jennifer Connelly is competent, but her academy award was undeserved. Her performance is mostly not a very memorable one, acting out almost all the different and sometimes difficult scenes professionally but with no personality. It like there is a switch on her back, set from OFF to CARE.The fault may not be with her acting abilities though because Ron Howard's direction is, as always, very slick and without an ounce of character. He knows what he is doing every second throughout the movie and where to push the right buttons for ""emotions"". All in all, a perfect date movie or something to watch if you have a couple of hours to spare. But I cannot shake the feeling that this touching and true human story could have been more memorable in some other directors hand. Because a week after watching, I really don't remember many moments that have lingered in the mind.",A Beautiful Mind
248,midas-jacobs,"""What truly is logic?""",9,25 October 2015,"There are going to be some spoilers in here, but the movie is based on a true story so you can consider this as non spoilers. ""A beautiful mind"" is about John Nash. A brilliant, but antisocial man. The movie starts of with him going to the university where he meets Charles, who becomes his best friend. At some point in the movie he gets offered a job, to work in cryptography. He accepts this job but it turns out to be a bad decision which changes his life...The movie is directed by Ron Howard, believe me or not, that is the same guy who did ""The Da Vinci Code"". I was very surprised too. It was very well directed in comparison to ""The Da Vinci Code"". I didn't like that movie at all, but I still gave it a 6/10 because I liked the book. The cinematography was also handled great. It was done by 'legend' Roger Deakins. This man is just amazing at his job every shot was really beautiful. The scene I personally thought was the best cinematographed was the scene where Charles and Nash were standing on the roof, how the camera flowed was just so pretty, the dialogue in this scene was also very good, this was my favorite scene. But not only in this scene is the movement of the camera good, this applies to almost all of the scenes. Which has a pretty outcome. What I didn't really like was how they used the orange collar scheme. it did make the movie look old, which I think they were aiming for, but I personally think it didn't look too good. The creativity put in to this movie was also very good. Like when Nash and Alicia are outside of a building and look up to the sky. Then Nash says that she must pick a shape and she tells him the shape of a umbrella, what I liked about this scene is how they lit up the stars that formed the umbrella. The also do this at times when Nash is cracking codes. It was overall cool to see how he unravels the codes. The make- up was very good, how they made Crowe look old was just so good.The acting of the movie was also amazing. Russel Crowe was by far the best. He played John Nash. He did an amazing job to portray him, and you could really believe that he was antisocial. You can see this in the beginning of the movie very well. Jennifer Connelly played Alicia. Alicia was the love interest of Nash. She was also good. She was a worried wife to him, and she nailed acting like one. Paul Bettany. His character I liked the most. He played Charles, a funny, caring, friend. And when he turned out to not be real I was shocked (a bit more about this twist further on in the review). Paul was also very good. Ed Harris played the 'Boss' off Nash when he started to work in cryptography. He was also good, but he was my least favorite character. There is also Adam Goldberg, he also played in the TV-show Fargo and in Saving Pravite Ryan. In this movie he did a good acting job, even though I think he was better in Fargo. You also have some smaller role characters, and they did the best they could. Overall the acting was good, but I was more blown away by Russel Crowes performanceThe script was good too. You can see this, by how easily you are convinced that Nash is antisocial. You can also feel the friendship that has bred between Nash and Charles, which makes it more heartbreaking to see him say goodbye to Charles. They also had some great chemistry. There were also some funny moments that broke the dramatic tone, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The twist in the middle of the movie was just mind blowing, I didn't see that coming, but I could have guessed. Because Charles was never at parties (in the beginning of the movie) but then he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. I definitely liked the twist, because it wasn't anything really predictable, like it is in most movies. But if you did some research you also could have known that it was all fake. Because of the writing and acting, you almost immediately cared about Nash, whereby it wad more sad to watch. Even though it is a drama it has some good romance in it to, what I didn't expect.Thank you for reading this review. I enjoyed watching this film, and would recommend this to other people. The ending is beautiful too. ""What truly is logic""",A Beautiful Mind
249,Phil_H,Superior and not at all what you think.,6,14 January 2002,"Insanity and utter genius are so closely related that it is sometimes difficult to see where one ends and the other begins. John Nash was clearly both.Nash thought he would be able to ""solve the problem,"" and find a form of cure for his disorder. But clearly if he was to medicate, he'd lose his gift. I agree with Nash: the gift is better to accept with the insanity then to accept the cure and lose the gift.I truly expected this movie to be a ""spy"" movie. And as one other reviewer has pointed out, this isn't, and yet in a way is a spy movie. Albeit the spooks are only in Nash's mind.I recommend this film to anyone, including those who don't like Russell Crowe. Make no mistake, I disliked Gladiator, but this is different and shows range and emotion. Now, I can say that I don't dislike Crowe, but rather had a distaste for Gladiator.If you liked this film, do yourself a favor and go rent ""Pi,"" these movies compliment each other and are worthy of being seen.Out of 10, I give ""A Beautiful Mind"" a 6, marking it as a superior product.",A Beautiful Mind

Even though the director changed John Nash's life a great deal to make it a more entertaining movie. John Nash, a genius who came up with a business model that was adopted by many businesses, is a social oddball that is so dedicated to his studies that he has absolutely no concept of social skills. He finds it a task to even make the slightest bit of conversation with a female. The only person he seems to get along with is his college roommate (later we find out that this roommate is not what he seems). His genius attracts a government agency that employs him briefly as a code breaker. There he meets Ed Harris, who is not what he seems either.

I had possibly avoided it because of the subject matter, in that, whilst not being scizophrenic, I have endured my own mental problems in my time. The Oscar ceremony persuaded me to see what all the fuss was about. I am so glad that I made that decision. I am very relieved it beat the likes of 'Moulin Rouge' and 'The Lord of the Rings' for, although I thought that both of those films were good, neither deserved to be considered as 'best film'. Personally, 'Amelie' was my favourite film of the year, but 'A Beautiful Mind' has to be the best film. I was quite shocked by the depth of Russell Crowe's talent. It's a shame he won the Oscar last year - I thought Tom Hanks should have won for 'Castaway'. Had he not done so, I'm sure he would have scooped the award this year. I've not seen 'Training Day' but this role demanded acting on many different levels. Crowe dominates the film with his performance; the perfect contrast of the brains versus the brawn of 'Gladiator'. Actually, if anything, I think his menacing thug-cop in 'LA Confidential' was a better performance than in 'Gladiator'. Anyway, apart from Crowe, I cannot fathom why Jennifer Connely did not win a Best Actress Oscar. Is there a screen time presence rule? If not, I feel she should have won in that category. I haven't previously particularly liked Ron Howard films, and I thought 'The Grinch' was pretty dire, but his direction is perfect here. It may not be totally factually accurate but it made for great film-making. For a while, whilst on a 'high' leaving the cinema, I couldn't think of a better movie. 9/10.",A Beautiful Mind

It follows the life of John Nash (acted by Russel Crowe), a mathematician who graduated from Princeton. If you don't have any background on the movie before watching it (like me), then there is a pretty nice plot twist towards the beginning that completely changes the direction of the film.The film is excellent at illustrating the troubles that Nash encounters throughout his career. Its one of those things that just thinking about could drive you insane. But there are plenty of supporting characters (and opposing characters, that are quite complex) to help him out. In the end, the film gives a feel-good conclusion.I didn't find the film to be spectacular in any one category, but everything came together to make a neat experience. Its one of those films where you are introduced to a completely different personality than yourself. This makes you think about all those things you haven't taken time to learn about (in this case, mathematics, schizophrenia, and a Nobel laureate's life).

It's an outstanding cinematic work which tells well the true story of the incomparably brilliant mathematician John Nash, a schizophrenic who leads a very traumatic life, due to the fact that overusing his beautiful mind leads to such a frightening life. I am impressed with the depiction of the story which goes all the way from 1947 through 1994 when Nash received the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics. The versatile Russell Crowe came across well in the character depiction of the overtaxed scientist who refused to take his medicine for his degenerative disease. Ed Harris convinced people that they should hate him for the harm he brought to Nash, even if he was a phantasm. Christopher Plummer was very good as the caring doctor, Dr. Rosen. Jennifer Connelley (my favorite) played her part well as the very concerned and very loving wife. Vivien Cardone, whose age was only in the single-digit column when the movie was produced, was outstanding as the little girl Marcee Herman who was taken with him; the character Marcee herself was a phantasm. Paul Bettany was excellent as the practically-vicious Charles, Nash's roommate; Charles himself was a phantasm. The only thing that family members should have been concerned about were the graphic and scary scenes, such as Nash's shock treatment and his cutting himself on the wrist. But overall, it was an excellent production. It was another great feat for producer Ron Howard, and, of course, for Universal, Dreamworks, and Imagine Productions.

256,GTeixeira,"A good film, but a terrible biopic",7,6 August 2014,"Simply put, a biopic about John Forbes Nash Jr., a mathematical genius who went on to win a Nobel Prize after years battling his many problems, including his schizophrenia.'A Beautiful Mind' is good, that much I'm not questioning. It is very engrossing, at times moving more like a thriller than a drama; likewise, the emotion actually feels natural and effective, without the usual sappiness of Hollywood dramas. The acting is superb: Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly shine here, and deserved the awards that year. Others who shone in a very good cast included Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Paul Bettany.My complaint comes in that this is supposed to be a biography of John Nash; however, it is anything but. This is Hollywood sugar-coating at its finest: it shows Nash as a troubled individual, having to fight against his illness and overcome his own shy nature to succeed; it completes ignores his more thornier history and changes it all to make him an impossibly sympathetic person. They flat out make things up as they go for the sake of turning this into your typical 'underdog fighting against all odds', formulaic and not unlike 'Rocky' or 'Good Will Hunting' (those other two, though, do not attempt to disguise themselves under the cover of a true story).This is partially fault of Nash himself, who refused to let a biopic of him unless they took out all the 'shadier' aspects of his life, and partially of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who extensively makes use of emotion over actual storytelling to win over his audiences in pretty much every film he does (I know what to expect when I see his name on a film, and it is never to expect a great one).In the end 'A Beautiful Mind' is a very good film, with a great cast, and a rare one which manages to make its emotional moments effective without melodrama or cheesiness; even the more cheesy moments, like Nash's 'Nobel Prize speech' (yet another non-truth), work better here than they usually. On the other hand, being labeled as a 'true story' or as a biopic is not only misleading, but distracting for those who know Nash's real (and far more interesting) story.I never understood Hollywood when it comes to their sugarcoated biopics. If they are going to change and make things up so his lifestory can support the theme they want to, why still insist with the 'true story' label? Just to fool the viewers/critics?",A Beautiful Mind

I went in with an open mind and came out with, shall we say, far less of an understanding of John Nash than I had hoped. Supporting actors are great, but Crowe's performance is too obvious and pales in comparison to his stellar nuanced work in The Insider. Connelly was actually a lead character and not supporting, but can one HONESTLY say that she added as much to this film as Maggie Smith added to Gosford Park? I truly believe that their acting would not have been NEARLY as acclaimed had they not aged on screen. There were several emotionally manipulative scenes that reminded me of the same shameless ""pull at the heartstrings"" tactics of On Golden Pond. Suffice to say, this is only TWO ASPECTS of Nash's life, and the articles I read about Nash around the time of this film indicate they left A LOT out. I'd rather watch Philadelphia or Terms of Endearment than this any day. For an UN-glossed-over biopic, I recommend ""Hilary and Jackie"" about troubled MS-stricken cellist Jacqueline DuPre.There are some effective plot devices and good acting, yes, but they don't make up for the drenching sentimentality that weighs this film down.

Nash is played by Russell Crowe, in one of the few roles I've seen him in where he has NOT annoyed the heck out of me. He just seems too arrogant and full of himself.Anyway, A Beautiful Mind begins with Nash's early years at Princeton University, and follows him to the time he was awarded the Nobel Prize. It charts his decline into schizophrenia very well, including a whopper of a twist that I did not see coming in a million years. Like John's friends and associates, I believed every word, no matter how far-fetched it all seemed after a while.I applaud any film that deals with mental illness in a serious way and doesn't poke fun at it. Aside from the fact that every Hollywood movie (and this one is NO exception) seems to feel the need to show at least one person gently rocking back and forth whenever we are shown a mental institution. I find it so bizarre that the ""gentle rocker"" seems to show up all the time...what condition is it that they think this guy has? Too much LSD while head banging to a Slayer concert? HERE COMIN'THE BIG SPOILS people: That aside, A Beautiful Mind is a very well made film. Guaranteed if you enjoy it you'll want to see it a second time to spot all the William Parcher moments (my two favourites are when he first appears to talk to John outside the University dorm, and he just ""appears"" at the top of the stairs, you never see him actually open the door and walk through, nor do you hear it close behind him, because of course, he's not really there. And my other favourite is passing the security gate, where the guard doesn't notice Archer at all. I kicked myself for not picking that up the first time around!) The Paul Bettany character of Charles, Nash's imaginary roommate, is so awesome and such a great character that I found myself wishing he WAS real, and I genuinely felt sorry for him when Nash finally tells him he's not going to acknowledge him any more. I was feeling sorry for a figment of someone's imagination! Bettany is a legend, a great actor in my opinion (he's also terrific in another Crowe film, Master and Commander, and is even very good in the crappy rom-com Wimbledon).Jennifer Connelly plays Nash's wife, Alicia, who stuck by him all through his worst years, when his delusions were basically controlling his entire existence. Connelly never gets too teary-eyed or melodramatic, and has a strength in her eyes that compliments her picturesque beauty.Crowe's shuffling John Nash is great, a far-cry from Hando in Romper Stomper, let me tell you!

And suddenly, the make-up ages her so strangely that she looks pretty darn close to Helena Bonham Carter from Planet of the Apes! Plot twists a la ""The Others""--to name something other than that movie with Bruce Willis and the kid, keep you watching, and moments of brilliance such as the theory with which John Nash proves John Adams wrong using a blonde and her friends, build up the expectations which are completely blown off by the less than satisfactory shallow talk on which the movie ends. When strings of movies came out as Pulp Fiction wannabes (the original itself from a John Woo wannabe), things were recognizably bad. Now that Night Shamalyan wannabes bring out their visual twists to their wannabe movies, things like this movie come out--you can't directly tell how bad it is, because the visual trickstery feels original, even though the device has been explored already with a better story--even though the gaffes in the movies give the movie very different unintended interpretations.

263,tml_pohlak_13,"The word I'm searching for is ""amazing""",10,13 June 2009,"A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash (Crowe), a brilliant mathematician. It begins by showing his days as a student at Princeton, where he searches for a completely original idea, something that will earn him widespread recognition. This goes on for about the first 25 minutes, and it is positively brilliant. But then, something happens. The next 20 or so minutes are extremely predictable and dull, as if it came straight out of a spy novel. This is my fault, though, because I find out as little as possible about a movie before seeing it. Had I tried finding out a little more about A Beautiful Mind, I would've surely seen the reason for this. Long story short, I wasn't expecting the major plot twist that came around the hour mark of the film, and that just blew me away. That dull 20 minutes is something I appreciated only when viewing the segment again, this time with the knowledge of why it seemed so dull. *** If you know positively nothing about ABM's plot, I strongly recommend skipping the following *** The praise for A Beautiful Mind is completely justified. Russell Crowe was positively robbed of an Oscar, as his performance is completely and wholly captivating from beginning to end. It is essentially due to his fantastic acting that Ron Howard brilliantly portrays schizophrenia. Researching the film a little more, I found that the movie takes enormous liberties with the real-life events it is based on, and has been heavily criticized for it. I disagree with such criticism. There is no way for a director to capture on film the mind of a schizophrenic. Nash's delusions are altered from auditory, but these liberties serve only to make them more powerful, shocking, and disturbing on screen. This is what makes the film so darn good— it captures the absolute pandemonium of the life of a schizophrenic. I really couldn't care less if the exact delusions experienced are not shown, so long as the atmosphere of such delusions is portrayed. The horror of Nash's tumultuous life is brilliantly captured when he ""attacks"" his wife, thinking he is defending her from a gunman. *** Safe to read from here on *** The Verdict: A Beautiful Mind might not be faithful to the source material it is based on, but it transfers the atmosphere of the source material perfectly on screen. Russell Crowe's brilliant acting proves to be the film's foundations, along with Ron Howard's brilliant direction. (By the way, a special mention goes out to Vivien Cardone for a straightforward, yet bone-chilling, performance.) Truly a great movie, A Beautiful Mind is quite an achievement— undoubtedly the Best Picture of 2001.Overall Rating: 10/10.",A Beautiful Mind
264,MadBadMovieman,A Beautiful Movie for a Beautiful mind.,9,5 January 2002,"Not so eloquent as other comments. All I can say is my wife went in with some expectations but both agree this is a Beautiful movie for a Beautiful mind.  Some are disappointed about the lack of emphasis on his Math and theories but the message of the movie cannot just be about what he has accomplished in his field.The fact that he is still functioning, contributing and survived this condition is incredible.  The Faith of his wife is inspiring. Many talented Actors went into this production.  The faith required and performances given are also inspiring.  We had never heard of their story before so we had no pre-judgements in the way.  We are so glad it reached the screen. 
Crowe received an Oscar last year when a few others, including Ed Harris probably deserved it.  This performance goes so far beyond Maximus there is no comparison. He must be in the top 5 contenders for Oscar.Connolly is so beautiful and yet has been in only a few good roles. With Ed Harris last year and now this one prove beyond a shadow of doubt she CAN really act.  We hope to see in more movies and not just as window dressing.  If not nominated - a real shame.Such a powerful ending. If only we could have seen a picture of them both at the end.  A true 10 of a movie and so worth seeing.",A Beautiful Mind
265,Blondie_,"A brilliant film, better than I would of thought",9,4 March 2002,"I knew this was a good movie, but I was expecting a typical Ron Howard film-cookie-cutter, ordinary, usual good movie, nothing special in terms of creative expression. Boy, was I wrong! Howard has impressively changed his usual style and become much more artistic and creative in portraying the mental illness of John Nash. Brilliantly done!! You can't tell what is real and what is not. And the acting accolades this film received are well-deserved. Jennifer Connelly has greatly improved as an actress with this film and while I don't think Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar last year, he surely deserves the statue this year for his remarkable portrayal of John Nash.",A Beautiful Mind
266,nmholland,Ron Howard's Best Film Since Apollo 13,9,20 February 2016,"A Beautiful Mind is directed by Ron Howard and star Russell Crowe as John Nash, a brilliant man that attended Princeton during the late 1940's and early 1950's. He is eventually recruited, in secret, by the government, to break codes involving an atomic bomb hidden somewhere in Europe. Soon after, things take a psychological twist, leaving John to wonder what's real, and what's not. Now, I can't talk about this movie too much in depth, because there's a plot twist about halfway through that I don't want to spoil, but I'll still review it.To start with some pros, this movie is amazingly directed, much like Ron Howard's other films. It also looks great, with an ever changing cinematography based on the decade the setting is currently in. The movie is mostly set in the 50's, but it also shows some time in the 40's, 70's, and 90's as well, and all these time periods are very distinguishable from one another, thanks to the cinematography and directing.Also, the acting is amazing. Russell Crowe as John Nash is a perfect casting choice. Crowe does great as a man in Nash's situation, and really fits in the role. Paul Bettany also does very good. Bettany plays Charles, John's college roommate that quickly becomes his lifelong friend. This character was a perfect comic relief for the dark tone of the film. Jennifer Connelly as Alicea, John's wife, is great too. All of the acting is really great, and holds this movie up.The last great thing I'll talk about is the score. James Horner makes yet another amazing score that pulls you inside of John's head every time it plays. It really helps the audience see through his eyes, and understand the way he feels about certain subjects.Now, the only negative I had with film is the plot progression. Some people can see this film as very boring for the first act, yet also unpredictable. I thought the movie was going to go one way, until it took a 360 about halfway through and really threw me off. I actually had to sit and process it a little before continuing on with the film. This a good thing, once the credits role, but for the first portion of the movie, and when the twist occurs, it makes you wondering whether or not the film should've played out this way.Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a great film, and a must see for most people. Ron Howard does amazing again, especially with Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, and James Horner working with him to create his best film since Apollo 13. A Beautiful Mind gets an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",A Beautiful Mind

Yet they have been lived together in the same house. And remarried after the movie released. Personally, I believe there is only a little romance appeared in reality. According to Dr. Nash's interview, it seems like he healed himself without medication but by his strong will.

Probably she sometimes wanted to leave him but she had been supporting him so hard. Her true love made me so impressive. She believed him earnestly.

The rest are simple entertainment. This movie proved to be a truly emotional experience. I walked out of the theater wondering if the people around me were actually there, doubting my own sanity. For a short while after having watched this film I developed a fascination for John Nash. Latter I heard him interviewed on NPR and was thrilled by both his brilliance and humor. That interview only made the movie even more dear to me, bringing home once again the reality of it all. The only movies I can think of to compare with ""A Beautiful Mind"" are Cassasblanca and The Wizard of Oz. Oh, I understand that the three have nothing in common as per plot, setting, etc. But they have THIS in common ... They are cinematic art at its finest. Thats what ""A Beautiful Mind"" is. Art, great art. The cast, Russel Crowe in particular, are perfect in their roles. All other aspects, script, lighting, sound track, photography, ALL of it, Perfect. It just doesn't get any better than this.",A Beautiful Mind
272,RolloTomasi,Genius,10,20 January 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those projects that would look like a hard sell to a producer upon close examination. Think about its premise: the story of the co-recipient of the Nobel prize for economics in 1994, a mathematical genius who was nearly overlooked because he was a paranoid schizophrenic. There is no doubt that Ron Howard and Russell Crowe's involvement was crucial to the film's coming to pass, but before one frame was shot, someone had to say ""yes."" Sylvia Nasar, upon whose novel the screenplay is based, must have been as surprised as anyone when producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard came calling. This is the kind of story that wouldn't seem to lend itself to film narrative-it may not have had it not been for Akiva Goldsman and Howard's approach to the material. They leave out details of John Nash's life, glamorize people and events, all in the name of creating the best film possible. The difficulty in adapting Nasar's novel was that so much of the story goes on in Nash's head. Goldsman's script is one of the best I've ever seen put to film. It's part human drama, part perception-tampering psychological thriller. Another challenge is Nash himself. By now it's well known that the man had an awful personality. Goldsman doesn't shy away from this, but turns it to the movie's advantage. Crowe's remarkable performance as Nash is heartbreaking. The man is obviously a very dedicated mathematician, with all these ideas, but doesn't have the disposition to get them across. He's his own worst enemy. The actual love story between Nash and his wife is altered, again, for the purposes of making the Nash character at all likeable. Nash had a son with Eleanor Stier before he ever met Alicia Larde. He never married Eleanor, who reportedly wished he would, but married Alicia. She divorced him in 1963 but did keep him from returning to a mental institution and stood by him while he fought his mental illness. The two were re-married recently.Any inaccuracies or liberties taken have been excused by phrases attached to ""Beautiful Mind"" such as inspired by' or based on.' This film has critics scoffing over the way it oversimplifies Nash's ordeal, and yet those same critics turn around and unanimously bestow it with Best Picture nominations and awards, Top Ten list entries, praise for Goldsman, Howard, Crowe, and Jennifer Connelly. They need to remember that if Howard and company were for some reason forced to depict the events of Nash's life more truthfully, ""Mind"" never would have been made or worse, it would have been an inferior film. The industry needs more pictures like this one. Not that anyone in Hollywood cares what critics think anyhow.Look for ""A Beautiful Mind"" to earn Crowe his second straight Oscar. Wins for Connelly and Goldsman are also likely. A shame, though, that Roger Deakins has been getting such well-deserved attention for his cinematography on ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" his work on this film may be overlooked.Grade: A",A Beautiful Mind
273,teejayniles2345,"Why ""MIND"" will win the TOP OSCAR March 24",10,14 March 2002,"The 2001 Ron Howard film, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, is more than a front runner in the race for a Best Picture Academy Award.  It's the most traditional, logical, and emotional Best Picture among the major feature-length films vying in the category for that Hollywood ""gold medal"" triumph.  This significant ""team product"" (Universal Studios, DreamWorks, and Imagine Entertainment) deserves the endorsement that only the top Oscar can convey! As a ""traditional"" pick, consider how this 2 1/2 hour film advances an invigorating ""happy ending"" format.  The episodic chronicle of a mentally challenged individual, John Nash, and his long-suffering, supportive wife, Sylvia, neither ends with gloom nor doom.  Some might object that such recent winners as AMADEUS and THE ENGLISH PATIENT ended with death by overwork, plane crashes, and euthanasia; however, their popular source material from novel or stage play dictated the outcome of their main characters, respectively.  The typical American outlook is one of victory despite obstacles of all sorts.  This winning depiction of a delusional schizophreniac even includes his Acceptance Speech at the Nobel Prize ceremonies in 1994.  Like memorable and typical Hollywood biographies, this film offers basically glimpses of an overall success story.  The Nash family remains held together despite extreme medical and psychiatric crises. Opponents of this film's sweep onto the 3/24 Victory Stand/Stage in Hollywood point out that the depicted couple actually divorced and separated, only later reconciling.  Tradition favors memories of an uncomplicated nature and this film has an ""uneasy"" connection to what's real and what's not real at all.  If it wins because of its comforting attitude, voters may sweep along to Best Actor and Best Director awards Russell Crowe and Ron Howard as they did when RAIN MAN, Dustin Hoffman, and Barry Levinson took home Oscars. Secondly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND is the most logical pick out of the primary competition (GOSFORD PARK, MOULIN ROUGE, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING).  The Academy will likely be supportive of American-focused material for this first ceremony after the national tragedy of September 11, 2001; they'd perhaps promote the New Jersey-set film over those set in England and Paris (GOSFORD & MOULIN ROUGE).  Other films with minor nominations have settings in the U.S.: MEMENTO, ALI, MONSTER'S BALL, and TRAINING DAY;  I predict that some of these will spoil the races in several of the categories with their strongest performances or technical accomplishments.  Voters of the Academy logically might be holding off any recognition of the first-of-three installments of THE LORD OF THE RINGS saga.  Two more films will debut at Christmas 2002 and 2003.  Like STAR WARS, STAR TREK, and INDIANA JONES, they might win at the box office while never taking home the Best Picture statuette. Thirdly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND packs an emotional wallop but yet doesn't fully flatten its audience.  When I recently viewed certain of its most gripping sequences (in Nash's padded room or insulin therapy lab and in the small family bathroom), I was amazed at the overwhelmingly effective nature of the film's depiction of the ravages of mental illness.  There was so much raw power on the screen; still, we cared about all the individuals involved without losing our connection to the story and its graphically depicted extremes.  To contrast, the independently produced nominee, IN THE BEDROOM, took its audience on a roller-coaster ride that did ""hit the solar plexus."" Its pure realism about modern-day violence, from a short story by Andre Dubus deserved full recognition in this mega-category.  Its chance to play ""David"" among the other ""Goliaths"" is hard to predict, at least right now. Older voters, a majority of Academy members, would favor some emotion without feeling immobilized and stunned senseless by it, in my opinion. In conclusion, A BEAUTIFUL MIND deserves the highest award on March 24 because of its conventional approach to an American success story, its logical preference to a ""Middle-Earth"" fantasy epic, and its emotional punch that moves us to terrain where we can catch our breath without wheezing in dire pain.  When all is said and done, this Ron Howard-Brian Grazer production may not win all of its nominations but it stands the greatest chance of taking home the ""gold"" -- the Oscar for Best Picture 2001.",A Beautiful Mind

275,cleary-joshua,This is proof of just how good Ron Howard is as a director...,10,27 August 2013,"What criteria should we judge a biopic on? How true to life it is, or how well it works as a standalone movie? I ask because if ""A Beautiful Mind"" is judged by the first criterion, it fails pretty badly on many counts. We are provided with a watered down, glammed-up version of the life of John Nash, cutting out many of the 'gory details'. If we take the second criterion, it's a masterpiece, proof (as if we needed it) of how good Ron Howard is as a director, and how well Russell Crowe can act.The movie tells the life story of economist John Nash, whom we first meet when he starts at Princeton. He is socially awkward, bullied in part by his fellow students, and spends all of his time trying to come up with some original work. The only person he seems to get on with is his roommate, played by Paul Bettany, and the two characters spend a lot of great scenes with each other. After Princeton, he works for the US government as a codebreaker and at MIT. He meets Alicia, who goes on to become his wife, but is becoming too infatuated with his 'government work', with Ed Harris' character constantly on his case.I only summarise the plot in this much detail because there is a point, around the hour mark, where we discover that a large portion of it isn't real. John is really a paranoid schizophrenic, and a few of the characters are mere figments of his imagination. I went into the film knowing this in part, and guessed fairly early on that one of the characters wasn't real using 'Sixth Sense' logic (doesn't actually interact with anyone except the delusional character). The other main one completely astounded me. This is even more of a credit to Howard, since he makes the aftermath of the reveal even more interesting and shocking than the reveal itself. One of the great parts of having a fairly early twist is that the rest of the film is very unexpected, and keeps taking you to surprising places. I won't say much more, because going into this film without many spoilers makes it even better.Watching the film, I wondered why Russell Crowe hasn't performed this well in any film recently. He is at the top of his game playing Nash, with fantastic awkwardness, an extremely believable accent, and character traits which seem very well studied. At first glance, he seems to be playing an intelligent Rain Man/Forrest Gump, but there's so much more depth to his performance. The film is a treat to watch, with an astounding cast all round and proof that one day Ron Howard will go down as one of the greatest directors of the 21st century.",A Beautiful Mind

It already has 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and Best Supporting Actress for Jennifer Connelly.   Russell Crowe is an intelligent actor and knows how to act in great films. This is his 4th Oscar Nomination; others include nominations from ""L.A. Confidental"",""The Insider"" and ""Gladiator"" which is the only Oscar he won for. I apparently thought his performance was extradionary and that he will possibly get the Oscar. He played John Nash in the film, a Math Genius who is diagnosed as paranoid-schizophrenic. He goes on to win a Nobel Prize for his game theory.  Jennifer Connelly plays Alicia Nash, Nash's wife (isn't it obvious). She tries so much to get through to Nash in the film so many times. She really had to go through a lot in her life as his wife, but she pulled through and that i really find great. Connelly did a good job and all but she sometimes bothers me because she is very gaunt;however, she is extremely pretty and you can't push that away.Ed Harris plays Parcher in the film.

284,segacs,What is reality?,8,5 February 2005,"This is a superb movie that is both a pleasure to watch and a lot of fun to contemplate afterwards.A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who also happens to be schizophrenic. Those of you who have taken introductory microeconomics might remember vaguely something about Nash Equilibrium (it took me two thirds of the movie to make the connection) but that's hardly important. The movie stays away from the math for the most part, preferring to focus on how Nash saw the world as opposed to what he did. Although at two and a half hours, the movie is relatively long, I honestly didn't notice until I left the theatre and checked my watch. I was astonished to see that so much time had passed because the movie kept me captivated.Russell Crowe's performance was nothing short of extraordinary. Jennifer Connelly was fine in her role, as were many of the supporting actors, but none particularly stood out compared to Crowe.Where this movie truly stood out, however, was where it forced audiences to question how we define reality. What exactly is real? What isn't? Is seeing believing? Does reality exist only in the mind? A Beautiful Mind has been criticized for turning fact into fiction and taking broad liberties from the true life of John Nash. This may very well be true. As an autobiography, it likely falls far short of factual. However, it has considerable artistic merit in its own right, fact or no fact. After all, what is truth? The movie also glosses over some things that could have been further developed, such as Nash's struggle to overcome his illness. Plus, his relationship with wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) comes off as fairly implausible. She is too supportive; he never gives anything to the relationship, even at first. And the ending comes off a wee bit too sentimental for my taste.Bottom line, though? Go see this movie. It is brilliant and definitely worth the watch.",A Beautiful Mind

Russell Crowe gives the standout performance of the year as well as his career in the part of John Nash. He simply goes from one great role to another and yet he makes the job look so effortless. Ron Howard has made yet another enjoyable film... I've yet to see him make a bad one. Jennifer Connelly is Nash's steadfast wife who defies all the conventional rules and stands by her husband as he fights a nightmarish battle against schizophrenia. She gives a good performance but I don't think it's Oscar material. It's basically like Gwenyth Paltrow's popularity campaign a few years ago for ""Shakespeare in Love"".

286,byrann_gowan,A beautiful movie for a beautiful mind,9,21 January 2012,"This movie is very loosely based on the life of one John Forbes Nash, Jr. There are definitely some additions to his life in this movie, but, from what I read about his life, there's still quite a bit from his real life in the movie, which is one of the reasons why I give this movie a perfect score.First, let me tell you a little about Nash: He was a genius who worked in game theory, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. However, his life was plagued by the unfortunate disease known as Schizophrenia. He spoke of characters, such as Charles Herman and William Parcher, characters who did not exist. His life became one nightmare after the other during this time, as these visions would threaten everything in his world, including that of his then-wife.Ron Howard definitely deserved the best director award here, but if anything, it was the acting that got me hooked. Russell Crowe does a very good job as Nash, who, all his life, wanted to look for an idea. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as Alicia Nash, who starts off as a student of Nash's, and ends up becoming the wife who fears for Nash. Connelly definitely deserved her award for this; If any other work of hers parallels ""Blood Diamond,"" it is this one. Ed Harris, of course, is always great in every movie he's in, and this one is no different. He plays the Parcher delusion, who is an agent for the Department of Defence, and is trying to get Nash to help them fight the Soviets. Paul Bettany is great as the Charles Herman delusion, who becomes Nash's best friend throughout his university years. Josh Lucas is great, and those who remember watching ""The Sound of Music"" when they were younger will be delighted to see Christopher Plummer on the screen here.All in all, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a well-acted movie that is both a touching love story and an educational look at any type of psychiatric disorder. 10/10 for me.",A Beautiful Mind

It has an easy plot, good performances, with movie goers directing style. Besides that, the cinematography is a little bit above average. But i'm sorry to say this but, this movie is just an average. 70-75 rating no more.The one thing we must appreciate is Ron Howard himself. He was really versatile as a director. He can direct such many kind of genres. Early 21th he made such a good entertaining drama-biography movie ""A Beautiful Mind"". Later, he made a mystery ""Angel and Demon"" and ""Da Vinci Code"". Another time he made a sport ""Rush"". Far before them, he made sci-fi ""Apollo 13"". Wow that was bunch wide genres.This movie has been weaken by the director himself in some way. Hollywood has a culture to change the way the plot goes on. And that happened in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Maybe Hollywood want to change this movie into something more enjoyable and light. It's alright, we definitely can't judge a movie from the inaccuracy of it's plot. But they change it into something uninspiring, a little bit melodramatic, and untemperament. That was really not good for this kind of genre (drama biography based on true story). It's not match at all, it's blunt.Although Ed Harris and Crowe's performances were good (not superb).

I marvelled at how I could have been so caught up in LOTR hype that I had forgotten what a truly brilliant film this was.There is never any doubting the awesome power of this film. It's a movie like two weights attached to your tear ducts that keep getting heavier and heavier until you finally give in to temptation and weep into your hands.However, there are a few questions raised by this film. For one thing, it has been much publicised recently that it presents a fake, Hollywood depiction of schizophrenia, and the real disorder is completely dissimilar to what is portrayed here. The film tries to compensate for this by suggesting that this is highly advanced and it has gone on untreated for many years in John Nash's mind.For one who has not read the Sylvia Nasar's book, I cannot be sure how accurate a depiction this is, I would suggest that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard took a lot of artistic license to this film to create a more moving, and dare I say, perhaps more interesting story. Not that the results isn't good, I just think it's important that when you watch this for the first time, you are made more aware that you are watching the story of a man called John Nash, rather than necessarily a biography of the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash.The other question that is raised, at least for me, is what is the magnitude of Nash's hallucinations? On the surface we are led to believe that his hallucinations stretch the extent of an imaginary room-mate, an imaginary niece and an imaginary job for the department of the defence led by an imaginary man in a hat and coat. But obviously it's more degenerative than this. He imagines an entire workforce with a large amount of tracking and locating devices, a radium implant in his arm. Later, he completely imagines all of this machinery moved to a small shed not a hundred metres from his back fence. When you stop to think about it, it begins to seem a little far-fetched. Another question as well, how much else did he hallucinate? The first time he drops a letter in the private mailbox, a car drives past and someone stares at him, who he immediately suspects is a Russian. Did the car really drive past or did he just imagine it? It's possible that it did, I mean if one drives past an old ramshackle, abandoned house and there's a man dropping off a parcel, one would most likely stare. But obviously at this stage of the game, the audience is living out Nash's dreamscape. But once we find out that none of this is real, these earlier raised questions beg some scrutinising, in my opinion.However, if you don't think about it, it's brilliant. Russell Crowe is superb in an incredibly hard role, Jennifer Connelly also brilliant, and Ed Harris dazzles as usual. It's superbly intricate in its direction and it manages to mix tension and suspense with human emotion to a masterful degree.The artistic license may take a lot of the realism out of the story but it definitely doesn't detract from the effect. 4 1/2 stars out of 5.",A Beautiful Mind

292,SeptumSin,A little rant on a great movie,9,9 November 2008,What can I say I like movies about Mental Health. This movie is about Professor John Nash who currently teaches mathematics @ Princton University. This man is one of the greatest minds in the world even winning the Nobel prize for his efforts.So what separates this story from any other boring biography piece? Well that would be the fact that Dr. Nash has a Mental Health Disability. Now I'm not going to ruin things for you if you want to see the movie but I will say this...it is really well done. Ron Howard engineered the film in such a way to keep you guessing even when you feel you have a handle on things. Russell Crowe definitely gave the best performance of his life here. I still have a hard time believing that he gave the performance in the film. Jennifer Connelly also gives a good performance winning her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. In the end I have to say there is little wrong with this movie....From a Mental Health Therapist point of view I still have some hesitance in showing it to the population I treat as the tendency to glamorize things and even seems to point of even saying that the man managed to beat things by taking care of himself and not accepting treatment where the book shows the opposite effect. I do try and point out that the man still takes medications to this day. Either way there is no better illustration of mental illness in my eye so if you haven't seen this film then you really should.,A Beautiful Mind
293,Charles-31,Fabulous film with an extra stroke of brilliance,10,7 August 2002,"I was very much impressed with the acting and presentation of this movie. But, what I really want to point out is what I consider one of the most brilliant examples of slight of hand in a movie that I have ever seen.  **** minor spoiler alert ****  It is sad that we have become conditioned to stupidity in film making.  Nuclear weapons can accidentally detonate, guns never seem to run out of ammunition, the CIA can do anything, etc.  When Ron Howard presented me with a cold-war code breaking scenario involving a German nuclear bomb, I knew it was nonsense and fully accepted that something so dumb could be put into a movie by an otherwise savvy director. Of course, it turns out to not exist.  This trick very much impressed me. It showed that Ron Howard is aware that we are conditioned to stupidity and was willing to use that against us, thereby exploiting a weakness in the viewer that expands the range of illusion.  Later, he tricks us again when we realize that the illusions are not always so well telegraphed.  If was this element of A Beautiful Mind that most impressed me.  Yes, this film works on many other levels, but it took this extra stroke of brilliance to earn a 10/10 from me.",A Beautiful Mind

297,Altaira,Wow.,10,4 January 2002,"Let me tell you just how good ""A Beautiful Mind"" really is. I have a kidney disorder that makes it necessary for me to visit the restroom every hour. I was on the verge of exploding halfway through this movie and yet I didn't move for fear of missing even three minutes of this fascinating event. (As soon as the closing credits rolled, I ran.) ""Mind's"" greatest achievement, in my humble opinion, is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to sane people. The general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves, repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. But why? It's nearly impossible for a sane individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly, what that feels like. Without this essential empathy, many people become frustrated with the mentally ill, asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. We express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. It is incomprehensible. ""Mind"" does all it can to change that, and it succeeds. Unless you are familiar with John Nash's story, you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until partway into the movie. He's eccentric, abrupt, and highly intelligent, but doesn't seem crazy. The reason: His delusions are as real as reality to Nash, and likewise, they are real to the audience. *(SPOILER)* I suspected the decoding fantasies weren't real, especially when Nash began postering the walls with newspaper clippings. But his fictictious roommate threw me---and there is the point. The audience is just as fooled by the delusion as Nash is, who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion. Incidentally, I came across a professional review that blasted ""Mind"" for including ""all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with Nash's work that was thrown in for Hollywood thrill."" I feel badly for that chap, since he missed the entire point of the film. But that just proves Ron Howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality. There are some truly shocking moments in ""Mind."" When Alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house, I was eerily reminded of Jack Nicholson's wife in ""The Shining"" discovering his endless, typewritten pages of the same phrase. The scene that follows, culminating with Nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. In a moment, remembering ""Marcie,"" Nash has a flash of insight, and he finally accepts his illness--ironically, through his intellect.When Nash imagines that someone is going to kill Alicia, he lunges at her--and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless actof violence is a gesture of love, filtered through the smog of delusion. Now my take on the acting: Superb in every sense of the word.  Russell Crowe sure knows his trade. There's never any question about the authenticity of his character, although the accent wasn't consistant. Crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age Nash---his walk, words, and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. Crowe will probably get at least another Oscar nomination out of this one. Heck, he might even win it again. Ed Harris is, as always, perfect. Harris continues to be one of my favorite actors, simply because he's flawless. With delusions like these, no wonder Nash was torn between treatment and ""spying."" I hope people see this film. Not just because Russell Crowe is cute or because it's a Ron Howard piece, but because you will learn something important. You will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. You won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themself. And when someone you love is dealing with a disorder, be it schizophrenia or depression, you won't ask them to ""pull themself together."" You will understand why they need your love--because they are just as confused as you are.",A Beautiful Mind
298,csrothwec,"A beautiful, inspiring film",9,28 August 2011,"A beautiful,insightful and very moving film which is a joy to watch. The script and direction are superb and the film zips along at a 'page-turning' rate which will continually have you asking 'what happens next' as it is a rolled up thriller, love story and biography in one. For me, it was also a revelation in terms of Russell Crowe as an actor. I had admired his playing in 'Gladiator' and thought he was good fun to watch in 'Master and Commander' (while, on the other hand, I had thought his 'Robein Hood' was a disaster and a waste of talent all round - not least for including the usually marvellous Cate Blanchett in its proceedings as well!) In this film, though, Crowe is a revelation and shows some of the best movie screen acting I have ever witnessed. His portrayal of the lead character is achingly beautiful, with many high points (culminating in his 'Nobel Acceptance Speech' which had me on the verge of tears!)

300,ayric,Fantastic Journey Into the Troubled Mind,9,21 December 2001,"I am fascinated by the fact that so many brilliant minds are tormented with psychological disorders. It adds to the complexity and the mystery of the mind. The true story of John Nash is one of the best and most interesting examples of the troubled genius.The trailer for this movie is a hoax. From seeing the trailer I thought this movie was to be a bad romance mixed with a bad thriller. The trailer almost fooled me into not seeing the film, which proves to be the worst piece of marketing I have ever seen. This is neither a romance nor a thriller, and it is far from bad. A Beautiful Mind is a terrific drama about schizophrenia. It deals with psychology in a beautiful and original way.
Russell Crowe did not deserve his Oscar for Gladiator last year. He does deserve it for A Beautiful Mind. I believe his achievement matches that of Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest. He is quite frankly stunning, and plays on a tremendous variety in this film. Jennifer Connelly may very well win an Oscar too. The stunning beauty should have been an A-list actress at least ten years ago. Let's hope she is finally recognized.If The Lord of Ring hype fails, I believe Moulin Rouge or A Beautiful Mind will take the Best Picture award in March.

301,engelst,Interesting biography turned into a chaotic display of cinematic mediocrity,5,5 March 2002,"This film provides inspiring flashes of the life of John Nash, winner of the 1994 economics Nobel Prize.Unfortunately, it does so in a rather daunting way. The film lacks momentum and at times someone seems to have decided to simply kick the script in the butt to at least keep the film moving. As a spectator it is hard to know what was actually intended: a thriller, a biography, a feel-good movie or simply an attempt to make some profit in the wake of the ""Sixth Sense"".Russell Crowe was over-acting grossly. Many a time a wry smile forces itself unto you seeing him clown his way through the darker parts of this drama. As usual, Jennifer Connelly gives a charming but rather bleak appearance. Under the circumstances the acting is more than adequate though, and provides one of the few memorable points of this movie.The scenes depicting life at a university are so simplistic that you don't know if you should laugh at so much stupidity or be angry at the director for treating you like a dimwit. The more so as this is a story about a man with an exceptionally high I.Q..I read somewhere that throughout the film one can see the microphones. I didn't actually notice this (understandably, as the movie does its best to mix romantic intermezzos with a contrived thriller plot). But this doesn't come as a surprise seeing that the most important parts of the movie have been unlovingly expedited.Sadly, the most novel aspect of this story, i.e. the workings of a man's mind, and more specifically the victory of a man over his own mental illness, almost disappeared under the mass of cliche story elements and the artificial (and ultimately superfluous) plot twists à la Sixth Sense.",A Beautiful Mind

I never really felt, while watching the movie, that John Nash was a genius, nor did I like his character (which I think was important while watching him struggle through his schizophrenia).

310,EThompsonUMD,An unusually complex and adventurous Hollywood biopic.,7,10 February 2002,"An unusually complex and adventurous Hollywood biopic, A Beautiful Mind, starring Russell Crowe as Nobel Laureate John Nash, is a likely 2001 Best Picture nominee  and given its Academy-pleasing inspirational-triumph-over-disability main story line, I wouldn't be surprised if it took the whole enchilada.The film's early scenes are richly scripted (and daringly slow paced) to establish Nash's mathematical genius. We listen to him talk math with his fellow 1940s graduate students at Princeton University. We try to follow his obsessive problem solving on windows and any other handy surface. More mysteriously, we observe him observing group dynamics from pigeons to barflies, moving, we ultimately learn, ever more profoundly toward his Adam Smith-revising epiphany. All this is done with enough surface realism to convince us that the character is actually doing what he is supposed to be so good at  a much more difficult task when the character's accomplishments are mainly ratiocinative (writers, philosophers, and scientists) than when the character leaves a physical mark on society (artists, soldiers, politicians). If nothing else, A Beautiful Mind will provoke many viewers into looking up the mathematical/economic theories of the real John Nash. Complicating this tale of genius (and, of course, attracting Hollywood to it), is Nash's decades-long descent into, and recovery from, serious mental illness. While the film's depiction of schizophrenia continues to receive praise from the mental health community for its accuracy and sympathy, the stylistic approach walks a line  not always soberly  between effective drama and preternatural hokum lifted from The Sixth Sense. Since the director (Ron Howard) carefully restricts the film's first two acts to Nash's point of view, the audience has little or no means of perceiving the increasing paranoid madness that envelopes the character, especially given the generally paranoia-producing milieu of post- World War II American society. For much of the movie, in fact, the plot seems to be following the 'just because I'm-paranoid doesn't mean that they are NOT out to get me' formula of many a Hollywood political thriller, most elaborately illustrated/parodied in Conspiracy Theory.But in an inspired moment of Hitchcockian reversal, the last act shifts the point of view to Nash's wife as she discovers (and thereby we also discover) that her husband is truly insane. Ironically, Nash manages to break himself out of his subjective prison by marshaling his logical powers to the examination of a crucial piece of 'data' that leads ineluctably to the proof of his own madness. Upon this Cartesian foundation and with the help of his heroically loyal wife (Jennifer Connelly), Nash spends the years leading up to and beyond his Nobel Prize in Economics warding off the demons of delusion through the concentrated application of reason. Despite a little overblown sentimentality in its final scenes, A Beautiful Mind delivers some interesting existential observations about the powers as well as limits of love and reason as momentary stays against the confusions of mind and society. And if it turns out to be this year's Best Picture Award recipient, well, it certainly won't be the least worthy one in recent years.",A Beautiful Mind

I have to admit- before this movie, I was never really a Russell Crowe fan, due in part to his reputation for being arrogant and obnoxious. I really went to see the movie because Jennifer Connelly and I are the same age and I grew up seeing her face in Sears' catalogs, never having seen any of her acting performances. But when I saw Russell and the enormity of acting talent he put forth in this movie, I was completely blown away. How wrong I was for opinionating myself and using my opinion to decide whether or not I would see any of his movies. This movie impressed me so much that I went out and rented all the Russell Crowe movies available to me, and all I can say is: Boy have I missed out through the years. His true personality radiates in every character he plays, and he was surely the right choice for the lead in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Jennifer Connelly was outstanding as Alicia Nash, and together, her and Russell were a ""Beautiful Pair"". Paul Bettany was also great. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone in any age group, due in large part to the message it conveys- a beautiful mind, a mind that can appreciate the deeper things that most of us can't, can be a troubled one, and those closest to that""beautiful mind"" should never give up hope and keep close in mind the important things in life- compassion, long-suffering, and most of all: L-O-V-E. 9/102001 136 minutes Rated: PG-13 CC.",A Beautiful Mind

Certainly one would have enjoyed a more adventurous and transcendent approach to a movie about mathematicians, but at least ""A Beautiful Mind"" succeeds in its modest way at drawing us into a difficult and not-inherently-dramatic story.  The movie is leagues better than the edgier Pi (1998), which tried to illuminate math with an artsier touch.I'll leave it to others to describe in detail the astonishing make-up and acting work that turns Russell Crowe, successfully, into a 70-year old man.

Can't we have a good movie whose running time doesn't go beyond two hours?Being a little sensitive when it comes to the same old political references, I got the willies when the ""Russians-are-out-to-drop-a-bomb-on-us"" quote came first. I thought we'd had enough of that bullshit in the past, but apparently not. To be honest, I didn't know the film's action was set in such a large period of time, starting in the early stages of cold war and ending in the nineties, but anyway that remark made me lose interest real quick. Plus the movie drags on too long. Any good film can be flawed by an excessive running time, like happens to be the case and, despite Crowe's great performance, his character is boring at times. I could not care less for John Nash if he is that dull.To sum up, the film is not bad but, as for deserving so much hype, I sincerely doubt it. Not that this year there is a lot of Oscar-deserving movies as far as I know, aside from Lord of the Rings, of course. Maybe Bridget Jones' Diary should have been nominated, but I guess it's too ""incorrect"" for those Hollywood morons to take.6/10.",A Beautiful Mind
320,t-81966-84968,a brief evaluation,9,30 June 2020,"There may be a fine line between genius and insanity, but the line between them is often not very clear, and schizophrenia, like that in a Beautiful Mind, is mostly the preserve of the super-intelligent. Movies need dramatic conflicts, and a contradictory personality is undoubtedly a good material. For a long time, both movies and TV series have been fond of creating a series of similar images to satisfy the audience's desire to peep at intelligent people.",A Beautiful Mind
321,Bevan - #4,Just no fizz to it.,4,18 August 2003,"Alright, it was a well done movie for what it was, and interestingly executed, but it had the feel of a dry non-fiction work. It almost seemed like the hype and the Academy Award voting were tactical; you couldn't give Jennifer Connelly an Oscar for her brilliant performance in Requiem For A Dream, for instance, because after all Academy Awards can't go to naked women performing explicit kinky sex on camera in druggie films, but Beautiful Mind was just that sort of painfully earnest movie for which Academy members can impress one another at parties by claiming to have given it their votes. Now Crowe did a workmanlike job, Connelly was the spectacular eyecandy she's been capable of being her entire career, and the alternative to voting for this flick would have been to give Moulin Rouge a Best Picture nod, which would have been a crime against nature.But that aside, while I saw this at Dollar Night at the Wollaston Theater, it's still two hours of my life I won't get back.Rating: 4/10 and that's generous.",A Beautiful Mind
322,rastaban3,Excellent,9,18 July 2003,"Very good film.  It did have a sad story line, so you can call this a ""tear jerker"".  This film also drills home the point that some of the best minds of our time are sometimes a little crazy.  Also, that behind every great man, there is a great woman (or vice versa).  This film shows that.  The ending would never have happened, it is not likely that Nash would have made it without his wife.  The only thing I did not like about is the way it was presented.  It did make the film a little confusing for a while.  The confusion was cleared away later.  Over all very good, 9 out of 10.",A Beautiful Mind
323,n_r_koch,Hollywood-ized version of the John Nash story,7,17 October 2006,"As has been pointed out, this film leaves out crucial details from Nash's life in order to give him wider appeal. Taken on its own terms it's just another medical tearjerker, like ""Awakenings"". Even Nash's delusions, the best scenes in the film, are made conventional. It's still worth seeing because of the acting, above all from Harris, Bettany, and Crowe. Harris and Bettany both have great presence and are memorable without overdoing things. And Crowe not only gets Nash's strange manner and West Virginia accent down but does a believable elderly version (in make-up). The screenwriter has sugared up Alicia (who was also ambitious) into a benevolent earth mother, but Connelly does a decent job given that she has to spend most of her role whimpering things like ""Talk to me!"" or ""You're sick, baby"", or gazing worriedly at Nash, or just screaming. (We never find out who this Alicia was before she became Mrs. Nash, so her crisis doesn't amount to anything.) I also like Josh Lucas as Nash's hotshot competitor, Adam Goldberg as his college chum, and especially Judd Hirsch as his adviser (Hirsch demonstrates perfectly the old maxim: ""Don't act; think."")",A Beautiful Mind
324,blaircam,A beautiful mind and a brilliant film,8,29 July 2002,"Well, Russell Crowe was far better than I expected - he deserved the Oscar.

Wonderful story wonderfully done. A very strong 8/10",A Beautiful Mind
325,Preston-10,"Crowe rises above genre, the movie doesn't. Spoilers.",10,27 December 2001,"A BEAUTIFUL MIND is the story of how a talented man, bound by a desire to put his craft to work, attempted to defeat disability, and went on to receive praise from his contemporaries. You might think that I have successfully described the trials of the Russell Crowe character (John Nash) in the film, and how, with the help of his wife, handled schizophrenia while going on the win the Nobel Prize. The problem is, I didn't. This really isn't the plot of the movie. In fact, the plot of this film involves what went on behind the scenes of the movie.We live in a time where Hollywood cannot even make a decent character study without placing it in some predefined genre with the intent of increasing box office revenue. I couldn't help but consider this while watching A BEAUTIFUL MIND. That's not to say I didn't feel satisfied with Russell Crowe's performance. To put it bluntly, this is some of the best acting you will ever see. Unfortunately, A BEAUTIFUL MIND becomes a psychological thriller that leads to a pithy resolution that ""love conquers all"".
I can only suspect that this was not the film that Ron Howard wanted to make. Don't get me wrong, I've never identified Howard as being some kind of independent spirit or unconventional filmmaker. After all, Howard did direct THE GRINCH. But here is why what went behind the scenes overshadows the story: Howard does put a lot of emphasis on character development, and I could sense his desire to give John Nash's story full emphasis with a studio pressuring him to make a thriller. As a result, the film is kind of half-baked. We become more concerned with whether John Nash is delusional or not. At least, I was.I still recommend A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Crowe's performance is the reason to see it, along with praiseworthy performances by Ed Harris, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer. This was also one of the few times I've went to see a film where the audience applauded at the end. I can't help but praise an action star like Russell Crowe for transcending the Hollywood genre. I wish I could say the same for the movie itself.",A Beautiful Mind
326,m0rg16,Very good movie,10,6 January 2003,"I just rented this movie not to long ago, and at first I didn't really think it'd be that good. But the first few minutes really gripped me enough to sit through the rest of the movie, which was fantastic. It is about a math-genious (excellently played by Russel Crowe) who starts going to some school, can't remember which, where he faces many diffrent kind of persons. Some like him, some don't. His life goes on and soon he is a teacher and falls in love with one of his students and they get married. But soon after that the problems start to occur. John Nash (the math-genius, the main character) has been working for the goverment for some time and has been performing top secret operations. But soon after his marriage he starts to realize that everything has just been something he made up. His schizofrenia has caused him to see images. Or were they really images?From there John Nash goes on with his life after some time spent in a psychatric hospital and the story takes one twist after another. Very, very interesting movie. I have also learned that it is based on a true story (well, not entirely), which is very interesting.The look, the sound and just about everything else in this movie are just superb, and the story is brilliant. Ed Harris and Paul Bettany also contribu te with some of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in a film. A must see for everyone, I'm giving this movie a 10.

I will say Russell Crowe does a fine job as lead Character and will surely be nominated for another academy award. The acting is solid all the way around and the film progresses at a perfect pace, it really does a great job of surprising you.

Nash is a genius West Virginian mathematician who flowers at Princeton in the late 1940s and then goes to work at M.I.T. where he accepts some secret work in cryptography for the U.S. government, but his marriage and his sanity are at stake because unbeknownst to him he suffers from serious schizophrenia. The beautiful Jennifer Connelly delivers a superlative Oscar and Golden Globe winning performance as Nash's devoted wife Alicia, and the chemistry between Crowe and her is genuine and rings true. Masterful Oscar winning direction by Ron Howard, and the film also benefits greatly from the exception supporting performances by Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, Judd Hirsch, Austin Pendleton, and Vivien Cardone, but it's Crowe's awe inspiring performance that completely dominates this sensational motion picture.

I will never forget the scene in which John Nash stands on the symbolic abyss, and his wife decides to assist her husband. ""I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.""

331,dantown,Nash was in fact a Rambler and a Gremlin,7,21 September 2006,"This is an unfaithful edit of my review of this pretty fine movie. by the staff at IMDb:Jennifer Connelly is a shocking and beautiful actress. When my atheist friends tell me "" There is no God"", I say: How do you explain the existence of Jennifer Connelly then? That usually shuts them right up. Jennifer plays "" the wife of"" gifted mathematician John Nash. That's it. That's her role here. Second Banana to Nash, so to speak. John Nash and his wife were both students at Princeton(MIT?) although his future wife wasn't as splashy as he. She wasn't a potted plant-is all I'm saying....Nash was a mathematician of excellence. He pushed the limit of his mind and lost. This movie is a tender-hearted and artful representation of his complex and doofy and gut-wrenching and important life. This game-theorist Nash didn't realize he played a game on himself. How ironic. The game of Insanity is just another game for people who don't know when to quit. Sanity is where you quit your (failed/lost)game of life and move on. End of Story.Insanity is -sometimes-where you ask yourself to be an Intellectual Giant- without mercy or reprieve- when you might be a pretty fine Intellectual Mighty Whale instead. Nash was a fine, flawed person who wished to be Einstein. He must have hated himself unmercifully for having not achieved that. Genetics may have pointed him towards shizophrenia- I'm not an expert on this. Losing a game of Chess can be very hard to take. Nash played ""Go"" instead.I never learned how to lose at Chess. It makes you angry at the universe- if you take it too seriously. It feels like you are being humiliated by The Whole World. In reality, it's okay to fail at a game. John Nash forgot to throw the Monoply board over and start a new game. He killed his own life, by not allowing himself to quit the game:The life-game called Insanity. What a waste. In sum, this movie is good enough for Hollywood. It has a heart. I am glad I saw it. Please read the fine Sylvia Nasar book of the same title. It will thrill you and give you the background for this fairly good movie.",A Beautiful Mind

I'm going to start off by talking about the characters in this movie. Russell crowe: He was brilliant in this film. he was perfect for john nash, and his acting was so real-life. Jeniffer connelly: She was a good actress in this movie. Ed Harris: ed harris was breathtaking and suspenseful and made the movie more better. The Plot was very good. At first, the movie was a little slow but it got better and breathtaking.

333,sheepmonk2000,A Beautiful Film,8,19 May 2011,"This film is really good. It seemed to start of a bit slow and some of the early scenes, involving Mr Nash at Princeton were a bit boring for me. There are a couple of good scenes at this stage however, such as when they visit a bar and Mr Nash deduces him and his comrades potential success rates with a group of young co-eds. Moving on...the film really picks up pace by the time you hit the half way mark and there are some quite brilliant scenes involving Mr Nash, Mrs Nash and the schizophrenic illness that is a having a profound and wearing effect on them both. Mr Nash is in denial, whilst Mrs Nash is at her wits end. When Mr Nash does finally come to his senses it is the result of what is is quite a harrowing scene, and the revelation is filmed beautifully. From this point on the film becomes more and more interesting as we follow the different strategies Mr Nash develops in order to cope with his illness, some of which are successful, others are not.Anyhow, to conclude, the film is a really great portrayal of somebody with a schizophrenic disorder (and I'm schizophrenic so I do have a clue - though I do doubt it is a degenerative disease as is suggested in the film) and everything from the acting to the scripting is really good and like I said, once you get past the first 45minutes of the film, the up to this point, merely passable film becomes a 4*(8/10) take on mental illness and of course John Nash's brilliant work.",A Beautiful Mind

I just can't believe it.I saw the real John Nash on Larry King the other day and let me tell you his accent is nothing like the thing Russelle Crowe tried to do.  What kind of accent was Crowe using anyways?  Sure Jennifer Connelly did great but she wasn't supporting, she was lead actress!  That just shows the members of the academy didn't really see this movie they just gave into the hype and voted on it.I love movies of all genres.  I loved Forest Gump.  I should love a movie like this, but I don't.  As far as I saw it was just hype.  There is nothing special bout this movie.  It's just a film with  big name actor backed up by hype galore.

I heard reviews saying it would 'change the way you look at the world.'  That is insane!  I saw this movie and forgot about it until it started to sweep the Academy Awards.Russell Crowe gives a terrible unbelievable performance!  I have always thought Crowe was a good actor but the fact he was a shoe-in for best actor...  It's obvious the Academy cares more about the production than the performances.  Jennifer Connelly won best supporting actress.  It's a shame because she wasn't a SUPPORTING actress, she was lead.  And as for her performance, it was so-so.  Nothing special to it.Besides not deserving best picture and best supporting actress it also did NOT deserve best director.  Ron Howard should have given his nomination to Baz Luhrman.  Ridley Scott did a fantastic job recreating a war.  Baz Luhrman imagined Moulin Rouge.  Peter Finch took us on an trip I can't explain to you.  I think every director nominated for 2001 desereved more than Ron Howard, who simply gave us a boring movie with a big name star.In the end A Beautiful Mind will go down as a weak pick for best picture (A beautiful mind over Memento... please).*2/10*",A Beautiful Mind

341,taikman,"Some moments of Hollywood sentimentality make this a very good, but not great film.",7,7 April 2002,"'A Beautiful Mind' is one of those inspirational films about a troubled man struggling against the odds and winning. The kind that do well at the Oscars, like 'Gandhi' or 'Forrest Gump'. Russell Crowe plays John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who developes schizophrenia and loses touch with reality. He deals with his illness with the help of his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). Fashionable cynicism aside, it is a wonderful story, because it's true. Of course some of the nastier things Nash did when he was nuts - like slag Jews - are ignored for the sake of a tighter script and a more appealing hero. This is an example of why the movie is good but not great - director Ron Howard ('Apollo 13', Richie in 'Happy Days') can't quite trust the story. He has to overplay his hand, showing Alicia's nobility and Nash's courage a little heavy-handedly, letting the music soar a bit too much, in short making a Hollywood movie. It's not that 'A Beautiful Mind' is sickening or earnest - there's a surprising amount of laugh-out-loud moments relating to Nash's delusions and some gripping scenes - but there is enough schlock to keep it from being really outstanding.  The performance that sums up how overrated the movie is belongs to Jennifer Connelly. She was widely praised by critics and picked up Best Supporting Actress at the Baftas and Oscars, but frankly she's too beautiful for her role. There are no lines of care on her face, not enough weariness or pain. It's pretty hard to see why she falls for a self-centered, socially inept nerd like Nash. Connelly tries hard, but gives us an angel when we need a real woman.  It is Crowe on whom the movie stands. As a man he may be little more than another Aussie yobbo, but on screen he's a class act. Look around a campus, particularly the Science blocks, and you'll see his young Nash: twitchy, not quite meeting the eye, a little hunched, very smart, the social skills of a hermit crab. Later, in Nash's prime, he becomes more aloof, arrogant, contemptuous of 'lesser mortals'. then the schizophrenia sets in, the nervousness returns and his eyes become sunken and desperate. I can't imagine a more different role than Maximus in 'Gladiator', which shows that Crowe has one hell of a range as an actor. Some may find his performance mannered, but as he spends most of the movie portraying a man on the edge of sanity it works, and works terrifically well.  In the end we are left with a fine film: 'A Beautiful Mind' is well directed with a good script, a solid supporting cast and a great lead actor. But best film? Give me the grandeur of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', the cleverness of 'Memento' or the charm of 'Amelie' any day.  7 1/2 /10",A Beautiful Mind

345,mar9,"Astonishing story, well acted",8,22 April 2002,"No-one would dare write a novel as far-fetched as John Nash jnr's life. A prodigy, a mathematical genius, a paranoid schizophrenic, a Nobel laureate. With raw material like this, ""A Beautiful Mind"" was always a short-priced favourite to be a good film. Well, it is, but I don't think the Academy was right to call it the best film of 2001.Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deliver exceptional performances. I'm again frankly mystified why the Academy firstly nominated Connelly as a supporting actress when she gets enough screen time to be rightly regarded as a co-star. And as for Crowe not winning Best Actor, well... People who view this film superficially could write Crowe's performance off, dismissing it as thespian sleight-of-hand, a bit of hunching, stillness, some drool and hey, presto, paranoid schizophrenia. They would be wrong. There is so much depth to Crowe's portrayal. He plays Nash in the early years superbly as a self-acknowledged genius, arrogant but just a bit detached from normality, the accent just right. Then the years of Nash's illness, the terrifying delusions, the pain in his eyes during his insightful moments. This is incredible stuff, and Connelly is not overshadowed, she plays the role of Alicia masterfully.It is interesting how Nash's delusional episodes are portrayed as real in this film, which is reasonable, given that they were real enough to Nash at the time. To tidy the film up, a couple of elements of Nash's life are neatly excised - the mistress, the early divorce from Alicia and their subsequent remarriage. Nash's 30 long years imprisoned in his illness are skimmed over in the final reel, which to my mind unbalanced the film a bit. It seems rushed in the last few minutes, as if Ron Howard has noticed that the film is already quite long and he's cramming the last bits in.Finally, could it be that Ron Howard has constructed this film to draw parallels between Nash's life and that of post-war USA? Initial brilliance, unlimited potential and boundless optimism. Then a catastrophic fall into paranoid fantasy, stagnation, impotence and paralysis (for the USA, the Cold War years, culminating in Vietnam). Then a rebirth and recovery, slipping into comfortable autumn years with an acceptance of self, but at the same time an acknowledgment of the troubled past.

I also like the fact that Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany have met here for the first time, during the filming of this movie. Quite cool.Anyway, let's talk about the film a little bit. It's based on the true story (well, based on a biographic book about the true story) of John Nash, a socially-challenged Mathematician who's struggling with schizophrenia. We're shown how it affects his love life, his job, and generally how it made him such an interesting figure.First, I'll get this out of the way: this film doesn't have any big problem, actually. Maybe it feels just a *little* bit too long, but I don't think that it impacts the watching experience that much.So now, I'll tell you why this movie is so decent, people. I think that the actingof every actor is at least good ,and Russelle's acting is pretty much fantastic here. He captures Nash in such a unique, emotional way. I also like Connelly and Bettany here, they're both great. The film, mostly in its first half, has this charm about it, and I really think that it does a great job in getting the viewer emotionally invested. The cinematography is quite creative at times, especially when it's related to the schizophrenia, but nothing that blew me away. It was enjoyable, tho, and I liked it a lot. The relationships between the characters, the actors and the characters themselves are what makes this film truly good and special.So, to sum it up, it's a good, well done film with great acting and unique, lovable characters.

It had received lukewarm reviews and I, at the time, was not really in the mood for another feel good triumph of the human spirit movie.  But I came out most pleasantly suprised. For the past little while, I've had a love-hate relationship with this movie.  I liked it, and thought it a very mature film by Ron Howard, yet I feel it was a sycophantic attemtpt to draw attention at the academy awards, attention that I feel should have rightly gone to The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring.

I don't particularly care for him, but I can certainly respect his brilliant portrayal of the schizophrenic mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr.  While Howard glosses over the more displeasing character traits of Nash a la The Hurricane, traits which include alleged Anti-Semitism, it's not his movie.  Crowe owns the screen, and, being in virtually every scene, he elevates what could have been a tale of a man's struggle with a severe mental illness he can't deal with, and the people that stuck with him, into something that, while not approaching art, is heart-wrenching, with a predictable, but nonetheless welcomed happy ending.  I find it difficult to understand how this film earned Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, yet failed to garner one for the man who made the effort worthwhile.  Yet, Hollywood loves mental illness.  From Forrest Gump, to Rain Man, to Charly, films about heart over mind seem to never get old with the judges at the Oscars. I feel that this is as good a film as could have been made about this character, almost entirely due to Crowe, without becoming distant to the viewer.  Do we really want to know about Nash's Anti-Semitism?  Not really, no.  A Beautiful Mind will always appear to me a film that made a campaign at the academy awards, and robbed a far superior film of it's honor.  But it's definitely worth seeing.",A Beautiful Mind
348,jaesboxer,"A beautiful ""fiction"" *** (out of ****)",8,27 December 2002,"A Beautiful Mind is marketed as a story ""Based on events in the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr."".  Nowadays, however, based on is a fairly loose term.  The sheer number of factual errors and liberties taken with the life of the schizophrenic mathematician are too many to count, so perhaps it is best to think of this film as a fiction.  That said, this otherwise mediocre movie is elevated to an extreme degree by Russell Crowe's brilliant performance. As John Nash, Crowe is nothing short of astounding.  He single handedly redeems the film, and raises it past the level of mediocrity.  In truth, this film won four academy awards it should not have (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress), and lost the one award for which it should have been a shoo-in (Best Actor).  Is there no justice?",A Beautiful Mind
349,thechosen1,Superb.,10,13 July 2002,"Well, there was never any doubt that Ron Howard's directorial skills could go to great limits.  Once again, he and the rest of his crew have made another extraordinary film.  It was excellent.  One of the best pieces of film making of modern times.  A Beautiful Mind was definitely the best film of 2001. Russell Crowe was just brilliant. Even though I was rooting for Denzel Washington at the Oscars, I would not have been surprised at all if Russell Crowe ended up with the Best Actor.  His performance was exceptional.  Most of us would not have seen the real John Nash before this, but if Crowe's acting was anything to go by, I think that's exactly how he must have been. His dialogue delivery and expressions were wonderful.  I believe that the entire movie rested on his shoulders and he did a splendid job. As for Jennifer Connelly, I truly think that she deserved her Oscar as well. You could almost feel all those emotions in her eyes. This movie is definitely a masterpiece.  Superb in all departments.

Now, months later, with all the rumor about it, i feel like sharing some impression. I heard a lot of polemics about it skipping a lot of the real life of John Nash, and i am a heavy sustainer of true biographies. But i will make an exception this time: it was a good choice. Because putting all sorts of kinky details would have over-noised (did i invent the word now?) what was the real aim of the movie, which is to show what ""a beautiful mind"" can do, including helping itself. Moreover, i am a math teacher myself, so i could appreciate even some math humor which someone could have lost.

353,erikgloor,Ever try and intellectualize your fears away? See this film,9,11 January 2002,"Ron Howard seems to be at his best when proving the old adage 'truth is stranger than fiction.' Thumbing through all films he directed (thanks to IMDb!), I see his best films involve true stories or true subject-matter. Ask me if I've seen ""Grynch.""With ""A Beautiful Mind,"" Howard proves himself to be, truly, at the top of his game. This was one of the best films I saw all year and, to my mind, rivals ""Apollo 13"" for Howard's all-time best.In keeping with other mindbenders of 2001 like ""Memento,"" and ""Mulholland Drive,"" ""Mind"" plays with perception in order to dunk you in more than one reality so as to give you a real appreciation for the separate plights of its characters. And you never know where the seam is until later. The plot starts you off in the heart of the artichoke and pulls you out ever so slowly, so, much like the main character, you can't fully appreciate the life lived in this story until much, much later.Crowe is masterful as the lonely would-be genius *** light spoiler alert *** fighting to intellectualize his delusions and rationally counteract them by sheer force of will.

Probably if the movie had been a documentary it would have been to boring, but great liberties are taken around his personal life etc to cast doubts over its overall integrity.That said, it is a movie that forces the viewer to engage, and even might demand that critical viewers reflect on their own mental issues. As a recovered (hopefully) alcoholic I never underestimate the power and nature of the deranged mind.It was an interesting choice for Russell Crowe to play the part of Nash, and certainly the support crew is superb. Crowe does a good job but coming so close after Gladiator I do wonder if there might have been another choice.At a personal level I find this challenging and while I watch it about once a year sometimes I need to turn it off.

Paul Bettany is always good.

It has intellectual stimulation, suspense, love, surprises, humor, and great acting.  It never drags, and is always convincing.One thing I appreciated about it was that I did not feel over-stimulated. Sometimes I think Hollywood just tries too hard to make you go ""wow!"" Instead, this movie chose to take on the pace and character of reality. It was like floating along on the river of this man's life.Russel Crowe was the height of the movie -- not the least of the performance was an Australian doing a West Virginia accent, which I thought he pulled off most credibly, at least most of the time.  The woman playing the wife was not as good, though exceptionally beautiful, which is not a bad thing in a movie.  Also the man playing the roommate was very good.
I didn't realize that Ron Howard, whom I can never stop thinking of as Opie, was the director until the closing credits.  Well little Opie grew up and done good!  It's funny how I almost feel like he was a childhood friend, albeit from a different state.I have read that in some ""primitive"" societies, schizophrenics are treated quite differently from here.  They can be regarded as religious mystics and are encouraged to talk about their visions.  Some people think that this treatment actually works better than what we do.  This movie certainly makes one wonder whether that might not be true.",A Beautiful Mind
358,joaocruzferreira,A Beautiful Motion Picture,9,16 September 2007,"I was shocked not to see this film in the IMDb Top 250. This is arguably Ron Howard's finest work to date. Based on the true story of John Nash, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an entertaining, enlightening and passionate drama which tackles the tribulations of a mathematical genius suffering from schizophrenia.Nash is played by Academy Award winner Russell Crowe (for his portrait of Maximus in ""Gladiator""). In my opinion, this is Crowe's finest performance up to date, in which he was nominated for the ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" Oscar but only being beaten by Denzel Washington's flawless work in ""Training Day"". (Actually, Sean Penn was even better in ""I Am Sam""). Jennifer Connelly also gives us an honest portrayal of the confused but devoted Alicia Nash, which earned her the Oscar for ""Best Actress in a Supporting Role"".

359,votarus4,The Hollywood Stamp of Excellence?,4,8 July 2002,"(SPOILERS) To Russell Crowe's credit, he resists the temptation to wallow in Akiva Goldman's overwrought, pseudo-Greek tragedy of a script to deliver a fairly compelling performance.  Nash's story IS compelling; however, Ron Howard (director) misses every opportunity to tell it or interpret it. Again and again, he resorts to safe, traditional, manipulative, Hollywood direction and refuses to enter Nash's mind and relay his experience in a visual or metaphorical way (refer to Aronofsky's brilliant ""Pi"").  We are instead given car chases, conspiracy theories, imaginary friends, sentimental scenes with fountain pens, but alas, no interesting camera work. That's a pity.  Roger Deakins' cinematography (with the Coen Brothers, for instance) is usually astonishing. Here, it's merely serviceable.  Howard reigned Deakins in for all the wrong reasons.  Lastly, the Academy of Blah, Blah, Blah is just as predictable, misty-eyed and conservative as it has always been.  A Beautiful Mind was certainly not the best picture of last year.",A Beautiful Mind

Joining him on this emotional and paranoid journey is his wife Alicia (Oscar Winner Jennifer Connelly), a concerned doctor (Christopher Plummer), and several invisible people including his college ""roomate"" (Paul Bettany), and a secret service agent (Ed Harris).Ron Howard does a remarkable job at bringing the true story of John Nash to the screen. He shows the film through the eyes of a troubled genius, which is at times magical, and at other times menacing. All the performances are excellent, and very powerful. This is undoubtedly Crowe's best performance. My favorite scene is after Alicia found out that John wasn't taking his medication, and as she starts to drive away, and he stops her and says, ""She never gets old. How can she be real if she never gets old?"". In my opinion, this is the most powerful scene in the movie. The music also helps make the story telling process exceptional.All in all, this is truely a masterpiece.

I like the way it was taken, I really do. It almost moved me to tears when I watched it last. Especially when John Nash gets approached for winning the Nobel Prize and some scholarly gentlemen give him their pens. It was emotionally stimulating, especially since we saw him in awe watching another Nobel laureate receive these gifts.As for dealing with the sickness is concerned, I find it substantially real. Russell Crowe does a phenomenal job in bringing his character through various stages of paranoia and confusion when experiencing these delusions, and Jennifer Connelly brings sincerity to her role as his concerned and caring wife.

I don't know much about the actual Professor Nash, but if he dealt with even half of what they show in the movie, he must be an incredible man.The thing that took me by surprise in this movie is that there is only one scene in this movie that was before his hallucinations. They do such a great job of blending the early hallucinations into the move that you never question them until you realize what they are.

He is helped by the love of a good woman though...God awful ruination of a potentially revelatory story is woefully pithy; insensitively directed and features the worst Crowe performance since he hit Hollywood!  The dialogue is a collection of wannabe profound soundbites which convince neither as the musings of the characters saying them or as the deep aphorisms the writer mistakenly perceived he was educating us all with.  Howard's direction seems (almost purposefully) to miss the entire point that this should be a SUBTLE study of descent into and battling with madness.  Instead we see the Hollywood lexicon for what thick viewers will recognise as madness: Nash gets angry for no reason; Nash writhes and foams; Nash chases his own tail; etc...  And as pedestrian as Howard's non-functioning direction is - it isn't remotely helped by Crowe's interpretation of a tortured genius as: Spacker Camp!  Crowe's grossly offensive (clearly un-thought out) attempt to portray insanity as a man walking around with the initial symptoms of cerebral palsy and talking with an affected, pseudo-effeminate register is the stuff of notoriety.

The IMDb user comments section is brimming with praise; people are calling this the best movie of the year.  Heck, it even won the Golden Globe for Outstanding Dramatic Motion Picture.Have these people seen ""Memento""?  Or ""Moulin Rouge""?  Or ""The Royal Tenenbaums""?  Why is ""A Beautiful Mind"", a fairly standard film, receiving all these accolades?Unfortunately, I have the feeling that my thoughts on ""A Beautiful Mind"" are probably skewed from all the wonderful press and praise it received before I viewed it (sadly, the same thing happened with ""Gladiator"").  I was expecting some elegant masterpiece, but instead got a movie that, while it features good acting, is still a slave to Hollywood convention.(insert spoilers warning here)Okay, so we start off with John Nash at Princeton, and we have all the classic high school/ college elements -- the socially outcast main character, the bully with the chip on his shoulder who's got it in for the main character, the wisecracking-yet-all-knowing roommate, the stern authority figure, the problem that can't be solved but suddenly is given a solution thanks to an unrelated real world situation, etc.  And it just went on from there.  More convention on top of convention.A lot of critics are praising this movie for being a good big budget film that came from a major studio.

375,Jenny Ho,Yet another triumph over adversity tale,7,3 March 2002,"'A Beautiful Mind' tells the real-life story of mathematics professor and genius John Nash who also suffers from schizophrenia.  Included in this account is John's time spent at Princeton University where he chooses to skip classes entirely in pursuit of an original idea with which to make his name.  Thus, we see John spending much of his time scribbling complex mathematical formulae on the windows of his room and the university library.Despite his illness, John's work eventually results in him being awarded the Nobel Prize.  After leaving Princeton, he accepts a couple of assignments which involve code breaking for the government, one of these being provided by the mysterious Parcher (Ed Harris).  As he undertakes this assignment, John is filled with paranoia as his condition of schizophrenia becomes more apparent to his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and the audience.Although 'A Beautiful Mind' doesn't make for light entertainment, there is some humour to be found.  John's lack of social skills is evident in the way he handles women and his frankness in confessing to them that he would like to undertake intercourse as soon as possible as part of his chat up is quite endearing.  John's room mate Charles also provides welcome comic relief in the film's few lighter moments.One downside of the story telling in the film is the skipping of several years at a time which may leave you wondering what's been missed out in the account of this man's life (the upside is that the passing of time is accompanied by very convincing make-up!).  The end of the film seems a little rushed in the way John seems to make remarkable progress in his recovery and the fact that his wife sticks by him during his prolonged mental illness is a little unconvincing.A film dealing with mental illness is never going to be comfortable viewing but the fact that the film is based on a true life story does make it fascinating to watch.  What impressed me the most is the first class acting on display: the two leads Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly produce engaging and Oscar-worthy performances which are at times heartbreaking.

377,BuddyBoy1961,"If this TRIPE wins Best Picture, I'll give up movies forever!",5,3 March 2002,"May I first say what a fine addition this movie will make to Lifetime's library of theatrical motion pictures. Ah, how I look forward to seeing this garbage every three months for the rest of my life on 'television for women'. P-yooo, what a stinker! I knew I was in trouble when James Horner's score started a whole minute before the credits--I had to endure endless logo reels from Universal, Dreamworks (a real bladder-buster) and Imagine before the credits even began. And what's the first credit card on screen? Universal Dreamworks Imagine present! Talk about ego!To paraphrase a character in the movie, both Ron Howard's treacly direction and Akiva Goldsman's simplistic script are both WITLESS and OBVIOUS. This is nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before on a Sunday night on CBS. Whatever quality this movie may possess rests solely on the shoulders of Russell Crowe. His dedicated performance is the glue that holds this gooey mish-mash together from start to finish. (Though, I must confess, I won't lose any sleep if Denzel Washington wins the Oscar this year.) Crowe rises above the mostly temporarily-tepid talents of everyone around him to make every scene he's in at least appear to be trenchant. I can only guess that it is Crowe's unflinching energy throughout that is giving life to the ridiculous critical attention this movie as a whole has attained in recent months. Yet when Crowe is off the screen, we remember just how stuck we are in yet another TV disease-movie-of-the-week. Regarding Jennifer Connelly's performance, oft-lauded of late, let me say this: I'll be the first to admit that both she and her role fit like a hand-in-glove; which is to say, how fortunate it was of Ron Howard to find a two-dimensional actress to portray a two-dimensional character.Anachronisms abound in this movie, particularly in the dialogue. And where did that huge budget go? A couple of Packards and an old Olivetti? And for some reason, the makeup has been nominated for an Oscar. What braniac on the makeup staff forget to fill in Adam Goldberg's huge earring holes? (I guess his character likes to play pirates on the weekend.) But the most egregious faults of this film lay in Goldsman's cheesy love-conquers-all approach and outrageous alteration of the facts. A disclaimer at the end of the movie states that ""...a number of incidents have been fictionalized..."". A number?! Not ""some"". Not ""a few"". But ""a number""? Okay, how about...uh...82? That's a number. That the producers would purport for a moment that this movie bears anything close to the truth is a crime in itself. And the attitude that hand-holding, bear-hugs and doe-eyes is a valid treatment for a severe mental illness is an insult to one's intelligence. They would have you believe that WUV cures EVERYTHING: schizophrenia, typhoid, lupus, psoriasis, herpes, dandruff, you name it.That this movie would even for a moment be considered a potential member of a pantheon of pictures which includes ""On The Waterfront"", ""The Godfather"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is terrifying to imagine.

Moulin Rouge was fantastical and original.  Gosford Park was exceptionally witty.  In the Bedroom tore at your emotions with stellar acting.  A Beautiful Mind had good acting, not even great acting.

380,stevenleadbetter,"Well, I liked it, regardless.",9,6 February 2002,"OK, the problem with a recreation of either a story that has been filmed before, written down in ink or happened in actuality, is that the retelling is never accurate. OK, so John Nash may well have been portayed as more of a saint than is actual. But I take umbrage at those that comment that this is a lesser film for it's license to bend the facts. As a biography of a nobel prize winners life, it doesn't stand up to much close scrutiny, but as a piece of cinematic entertainment it is as fine a piece of cinema as I have seen all year. I am continually surprised by Russell Crowe's acting abilities. I was reminded of 'The Insider' almost straight away, in that 'little man, fighting against the odds' kind of way.Ed Harris is, as usual, brilliant, if a little underused.The most surprising performance of all was that of Jennifer Connelly. I have previously seen her in her many varied roles but never have I been so impressed with her. This is far and away the best performance of an eclectic career so far. If the detractors of this film think of this as cinema, and not biography, these people may just gain more from it than they have so far.

I almost didn't watch the whole film, I'll admit. The beginning seemed a bit too slow to me and the story was almost on the brink of boring. So I just rewound it and put another flick in. I had no intention of watching it again because I didn't see what the big fuss was, except for Jennifer Connely. But after a while I decided to watch the whole movie all the way through. This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Jennifer Connely and Russell Crowe turn in some truly outstanding performances. This movie was the first time that I saw Crowe in a movie and he did a brilliant job. Connely is always great(she was the real reason I decided to watch the film in the first place. Without giving too much away, John Nash suffers from some truly disturbing schizophrenic hallucinations.He does some decoding work for the government and then afterwards thinks he's being followed by a guy in a suit and tie(played by Ed Harris in another of the film's outstanding performances), a roommate who moves in with him, and the roommate's niece. All of which are figments of his imagination. The hallucinations never leave him throughout his life, but he learns to deal with them, due in part to the patience and love that his wife(played by Connely) for him.

383,bliss66,Complete Rubbish!,1,21 April 2002,"This film is despicable garbage.  It has the bare-faced cheek to use a mental illness as an excuse to switch up cinematic genres and it's deeply offensive.  The first hour is completely incomprehensible filmmaking--why does no one, except the viewer, realise there's something wrong with Crowe, I mean, aside from all his bad acting?  Howard straight-jackets all the other actors to prolong his device of dual realities that once revealed, makes no sense whatsoever.  Why don't we as an audience view the sets as any normal person would and focus on Crowe's bizarre behavior?  Just so Howard can make us think we're watching a bad espionage thriller?  Why does every other actor in the film just stand around dumbfounded, forced to give maximus (erm, I mean, maximum) room to Crowe's showboating performance? And what were the details in Jennifer Connelly's pact with the devil to make this wretched film?  Her's is a great beauty that can be used to tremendous effect when a director knows what to do with (like Aronofsky in Requiem). Howard just heaps on the mascara and probably made her wear curlers to bed every night. I can only thank God there was a fire alarm in the cinema so I missed the wretched ""old age make-up"" scenes that looked likely to rival those in ""For The Boys.""  This is dire filmmaking and further proof--as if it were needed after the success of The Sixth Sense--that America has no culture.  Or taste.",A Beautiful Mind
384,deproduction,Unbalanced,6,11 September 2002,"This film had the potential to be one of the all-time greats.  The way the story drags the viewer along into the confused perspective of the main character is engaging and effective.  However, with such poor dialogue, such forced acting, and such unbelievable characters, the end result is a film that is incapable of drawing-in much of its audience. The dialogue was trite, unnatural, and forced, and the characters were developed in such a way that as a viewer, I felt I had seen each of them before in countless school-boy films.  From the first second you were introduced to these characters, you knew what they represented.  It is incomprehensible how a writer could develop such a multi-dimensional plot, but fill the story with such simple, stagnant characters. Crowe's Nash came across much like all of Crowe's characters: aloof, unfeeling, and detached.  Once again, I found it difficult to empathize with him.",A Beautiful Mind
385,jack_94706,"A fine movie; a ""detailed"" book",8,9 February 2002,"Enjoyed reading many other reviewer's comments, especially those who'd experienced schizophrenia themselves or who'd worked as psychiatrists and the like. I've had some acquaintance on a personal level with friends and family who've experienced mental illness -- both bi-polar illness (usually called mania or manic-depressive illness) and schizophrenia. After first seeing the movie and then reading Sylvia Nasar's book, I have very mixed emotions about both. The main ""true"" thing which comes through in either version -- is that schizophrenics do sometimes recover, or experience long periods of ""remission"" as the book describes it. Central to this, many times, is the support of family and recognition of professional colleagues. In Nash's case, many many colleagues were exceptionally tolerant and caring -- something more underscored in the book. The movie makes Nash's wife the main hero, plain and simple, in his recovery. The books paints a much more varied and full-bodied story of life with his wife, his mistress, his sons (one by his wife, one by his mistress) -- and of his homosexual liaisons which were also key to his life-long journey towards becoming nicer or more human and humane. The book contains a wealth of detail -- much of it about Nash's contemporaries rather than about his own life; I'd say you get about one-third Nash, two-thirds Nash's acquaintances and company. It's impossible to write a biography, of course, without giving background details. But Nasar had great difficulty making both Nash's personality and his so-called ""Beautiful Mind"" comprehensible or appealing. A lot of what he did and thought was more ugly than beautiful. A different title would have helped greatly, I think. Anyway, Nasar's way of coping with writing about Nash himself was to take refuge in describing those around him who were less successful but easier to describe, or who were more extreme in personality or who achieved greater acclaim before he did. She wants to show that he, to some extent, ranks with the greatest thinkers of any time -- people like Nicola Tesla, Einstein, Pascal. This may be true, and when she showed how Nash sought to approach the really knotty problems, especially those considered important by many people -- it works. But Nasar is terrible at explaining math in its particulars or in general. She does little better with the relationship between math and applied-math fields which so often involved Nash directly or ended up being important to the application of what he'd originated as so-called pure mathematics. I was ready to forgive the movie for this -- and while it gives only a suggestion of the math involved, at least it does this well, even exceptionally -- but not the book. There are close to one-hundred pages of notes at the end of Nasar's books -- and seeking those sources is the only hope for those intrigued by Nash's accomplishments or areas of research. The best ""story"" of the book, the only part well-narrated, comes near the end, and involves the Noble Prize and the fight between the Noble committee members over choosing Nash. It's a great story. In the book, after it becomes clear Nash has shown signs of recovering from schizophrenia, a slow and steady progression over ten or twenty years -- Nasar raises the question of whether Nash might have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenic. No one recovers from schizophrenia, especially without drugs -- that's what people used to think, many still do -- and both book and movie mention this belief. Manic-depression, however, is known to often be well-controlled with medications. I've had direct contact with manic-depressives and relatives of them, much more so than with schizophrenics -- to me there's no question that Nash was not a manic-depressive. On the other hand, from all indications, Nash was someone who suffered, at times severely, from schizophrenia, with paranoid delusions. The paranoid element of his illness may be to some degree realistically and imaginatively treated in the movie. Where the movie strays very far from the truth, in a sort of Disney way, is in the creation of his imaginary college roommate and then later with the roommate's cute little daughter who never ages. Nash never had any hallucinations or delusions of that sort; he imagined aliens were communicating with him, and felt he'd gained knowledge which would help world leaders, presidents and premiers, and even sought to communicate with the Pope. He did clip headlines from newspapers and magazines, as the movie depicts -- in connection with this paranoid-delusional obsession. The character of the roommate is well-acted, however; I personally felt it was an excellent performance. But, be that as it may, especially with the addition of the roommate's daughter, it makes for the movie's major failing. What results is a cuddly and almost kindergarten-level metaphor or simplification as part of the portrait of both the disease and of Nash's experience of it. When I watched the film, despite never having personally known or witnessed someone with schizophrenia -- I had a feeling schizophrenics and their families would find those sequences of the film offensive or simply ridiculously untrue to life. Reading other reviewers' comments, that hunch seems well justified. Nonetheless, granting that the movie departs in some large ways from the real events of Nash's life, and blunders badly with the phantom roommate element -- it's still a great film. Great movies and great books often do have blunders, sometimes serious ones, or weak sections. In this case, I think the movie especially can be forgiven its faults and distortions because of the challenge of portraying such difficult subjects. By that I mean not only Nash himself, as a personality, but more broadly the topics of advanced mathematics and schizophrenia. Secondly, it does have its heart in the right place -- the patient and loving care of family and friends can play a major role in helping mentally-ill people (not to exclude the role of doctors and medical treatments). Finally, I think it's an extraordinary performance by Russell Crowe. He's better in ""The Insider"" -- but from the all-too-little of what Nash was really like in speech and in personal mannerisms which does at times come through in Nasar's book -- Crowe's portrayal has elements of genius. Certainly the scriptwriter deserves recognition, here, too -- since the book provides mainly the film's title and little in the way of dialog or coherent narrative thrust. Some reviewers have complained that Crowe is too much of a muscle-man to portray such an intellectual. But Nash was strong; he lifted weights -- he was physically imposing, especially since he was quite tall as well. So, if you want to complain on behalf of tall-people that it was unfair to select Crowe to play Nash -- OK. But give the idea that smarts and brawn never go together a rest. Nash was not only tall and strong, but as photos and text in Nasar's biography demonstrate -- quite handsome. He had movie-star good looks when he was young and before his illness led to a decline in his dress and appearance.",A Beautiful Mind

I had never really been fond of Russell Crowe, math, Ron Howard, or paranoid schizophrenia.  And just didn't find the subject matter intriguing.  I was mistaken! ****POSSIBLE SPOILERS****This movie grabbed me from the beginning and held my interest until the ending credits.  Crowe took the viewers with him as he plumetted further and further into false reality, and then he took us back out as he was , with the help of his wife and friends, able to control his delusions.  I am pleased that this film won best screenplay, but disappointed that Best Actor did not go to Crowe. He was brilliant, and he has changed my mind about his abilities as an actor.  This movie has gotten some criticism for not staying true to the book and for being too ""Hollywood"" and/or ""sentimental"".  To those people, first of all, IT IS A MOVIE, you cannot change that.  Movies and books are different.  Things have to be changed, added, or taken out here and there to make films work, it's that simple.  If you haven't seen this yet, rent it.

387,yaseminturkish,Follows the tradition of the mental illness genre but Russell Crowe elevates the film to a new level,9,16 April 2002,"An ordinary mental illness genre film would have dissolved into the typical paint by numbers rule in which the lead actor adequately performs his role and his problems are understood only by the audience.  A Beautiful Mind follows the rule that only the audience and his wife can sympathize with the mental patient but it develops into something more because of the difficulty and depth of Russell Crowe's performance.  Do you remember the small but poignant scene where John Nash attempted to hold his newborn son in the rocking chair?  It was a simple scene that wouldn't be difficult for an actor but the facial expressions and look of pain in Crowe's eyes elevated it to a new level.  Say what you want about Crowe and his real-life shenanigans but be open to the idea that liking him as an actor should be more about how he performs in his roles and less about condemnation of his bad-boy persona.  It is a shame that Crowe performed better this year than the always dependable and Oscar-deserving Denzel Washington (He should have won for Malcolm X in 1992) and became virtually the only nominee from A Beautiful Mind who lost the chance to grace the podium.  After all, Jennifer Connelly simply played the conventional role of the young wife who understands but has difficulty dealing with her husband's condition.  Connelly fared better in the little-seen but unforgettable film Requiem for a Dream.  Ron Howard's directorial award was somewhat overblown when you realize that Robert Altman had to skillfully handle 20+ speaking parts in Gosford Park and he did it wonderfully without breaking a sweat.  And perhaps it's just me but can anyone else not forget that Ron Howard once direct Elijah Wood in that pathetic movie North?    A Beautiful Mind is the kind of film that you'll remember 20 years down the road but less for the conventional plot and more for what Russell Crowe brought to the role.  The comparison to Rain Man is justified here because that was a movie where your likely to forget the road trip shared by Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) and his brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and more likely to remember how Dustin Hoffman had to have maple syrup with his pancakes and only wore K-Mart underwear.  Rain Man also lacked a viable plot but movies within the mental patient genre are not meant to focus on plots but on patients.  In that sense the so-called boring storyline of A Beautiful Mind is forgivable because much more beautiful than the Nash speech at the end is the way that Russell Crowe's eyes express the feelings that his mouth cannot speak.9/10 (The best performance by an actor since Denzel Washington in Malcolm X)",A Beautiful Mind

You had to sort out for yourself what was reality, just as Nash must have had to. And you soon develop a connection to the main character, seeing the world through his eyes.But then the director gets in touch with his inner ""Opie"" and takes you back to Mayberry.

Yes.The problem is that the depiction is pure formula. Everything reeks phony. Phony, phony, phony! It makes shameless use of much too obvious Hollywood standard tricks to stir up emotions. The bicycling routine, the desk out the window, the stereotype mannerism, the ubiquitous self referencing (the board game, the pen gifts e.g.). And the international Hollywood symbol of ""crazy"" is walls plastered with papers and photos. Yawn!The acting is downright hammy. It suffers from the Hollywood illness: heavy handed hammering the sentiments down our throats, no elegance at all. And the dumbest Hollywood standard of them all: let the actor speak out what has just been acted out! When even the dimmest of the viewers has seen ""they did it"" the actors MUST say ""WE DID IT"". Right, yes, why take the trouble of showing it on the screen when you tell us anyway? Does American directors think the viewers are too dumb to believe what they see? Are they planning the soundtrack for broadcast as a radio play on the side?An English project would have created a much more subtle, intelligent movie which would have explored the story and impacted so much harder. I can't help compare with Shine. It's a totally different movie but the same story. It's done with elegance. I am quite unsentimental by nature but the tears forced their way out when I saw that.

So maybe a movie like this seems better than it is but the acting was great especially Russell Crowe. The dialogue was above average containing some subtle lines and didn't seemed dumbed down for the audience. Perhaps there were moments of over sentimentality, but I admit I got caught up in it and felt some emotion for the characters particularly toward the end.Some critics are annoyed that some aspects of Nash's life were left out, mostly the unsavory ones which probably made him appear a more sympathetic character than he actually was in real life. Such as that he had some bisexual experiences. I understand that criticism but look, I don't want to see John Nash take a crap on screen nor do I want to see him fooling around with another man, so those critics should shut up.

399,Sally_Kirkland,"Kitsch! (or alt. title: ""The Man Who Was Afraid Of Hats"")",4,27 September 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is an honoured film. Lots of awards has been coming it's way and I understand it as this film is an archeotype of the kitschy image a lot of directors have on making film.In fact, the film is kitsch. The result is always going to be so when the introductory view from the directors point is that ""we are going to make art/history etc."". Indeed Ron Howard has always wanted to make THAT film that could keep everybody talking. Looking at his records show that he so far has not artistically been very succesful. With all these awards, notably beating Robert Altman in Best Directing at the Oscars and DGA, has he then achieved it? Has he made art with ""A Beautiful Mind""?No. Far from. He has elaborated on his very oldfashioned look at making movies, and he has shown his disrespect for the viewers.
Take a look at the dialogue in this one. Do people really talk like this? Did they do that in the '50s? No. Between Nash and his wife there isn't a single real-life conversation. Ron Howard does not have time for such common things. Common things in his mind cannot be art. So the couple are left with a cribbling dialogue that never explain their affection for each other but simply displays them as puppets. They are not real people. (A bizarre thing to say when the plot centers around an authentic story!)Ron Howard's best effort so far IMO has been ""EdTV"". That was a charming film that did not try to be more than it was: Entertaining. The characters in it were (so to speak) normal - and so was the dialogue. Strange that even the real people in ""A Beautiful Mind"" have to be so shallow.Also, Howard believes that the audience is more or less stupid. This leeds him to giving up on all subtleness and explaining everything very clearly. I don't like being spoken to as if I was stupid - do you? It destroys the overall issues of this film - and I cannot help thinking that it is so odd Howard never even tries to elaborate on Nash's theories and his importance. He has given up on us from the very start.Russel Crowe is a always a rock, but here his performance tend to be unintentionally amusing - remember Anthony Hopkins in ""Legends Of The Fall""? You want to laugh as his character deteriorates - but no no, this is serious stuff. Does Ron Howard really thing life is that serious? Where is the authenticity in this real life story?Jennifer Connelly is given very little to work with. She whispers and has got a different hair-do from time to time - and then there is the obliged breakdown that gave her the Oscar. Only Winslet and Smith were AMPAS nominees in the supporting category this year without displaying ""breakdowns"". Food for thought, eh? Anyway; even Connelly's breakdown seems odd. Howard so bad wanted the Oscar for her.Kitsch is what this film is about. Indeed the weakest of the five Best Picture nominees. Artistically flawed and tame, Howard got what he wanted.

401,zhongzl-kelley2014,Feel like I was incomplete before seeing this movie,10,21 August 2015,"The movie create an atmosphere like dreaming with smoothly revolving camera angles. I came in knowing that Nash had schizophrenia because I unfortunately encountered a spoiler while going over reviews here, but I wasn't able to tell which part was delusional because of the hypnotizing tone of the movie. Genius Ron Howard somehow managed to filter all the flaws of filming itself to present a story that is whispering love and persistence in every shot, every line, every insignificant details in the picture. I just finished the movie 3 minutes ago, and all my goals and plans for today are washed away, I can't think about anything but my love for this film.No need to add to many comments you probably have read here, but Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly rock.In social life, nerds and inconsiderate people like John Nash are the first combatants that are cleared out of the colosseum, but the stunning acting of Russell and Jennifer convinces the audience that the love between John Nash and Alicia Nash can't be explain by our shallow knowledge about falling in love. They are above the level of attractive girls falling for attractive boys, their nature, or something deeper, is drawing them closer and closer to form a romance that touch the world with its purity and depth. Alicia didn't marry John for money, safety or his appearance, because John here looks like a wrinkled bear. Alicia loved him because he was where she belonged, and the first appearance of Alicia punched the concept in me that she knew it as soon as she saw him, because she was staring at him with sparkling beauty. It was love at first sight.The settings were also cool, the scene where Alicia cracked open the door of John's office and the cottage near their house is mind-blowing. The scene of numbers glowing and floating out of screens in the Pentagon and from the magazines lying on the floor was also a genius representation of intelligence, exceeding the BBC drama Sherlock Holmes. It actually makes no sense because they are just random clippings of random magazines, but it also force the audience into believing there are some secret messages embodied in these random paragraphs because we are seeing this from a genius' perspective, it's adjusted to a level of intelligence beyond ours. But after seeing the abandoned building from Alicia's eyes, who was a sign of sanity, in which the windows that shadows were escaping and dogs are barking, were sealed with cement. The pile of envelops tell both Nash and us, that the whole conspiracy thing isn't real, it's as ridiculous as the 911 being plotted by the US government or the world tricking you into believing that you have a nose.The music is most effective tool the movie uses to mark out the climaxes and the turning points. James Horner was a gift from the god, I cried when he was taken away 2 months earlier. All the music in here is exciting, but it was exciting mixed with sadness, sense of shock, sense of hope or sense of pride. It always grabbed the audience's attention like a mighty hand, and squeezed their heart until they choke with pain. I think Ron Howard should've buy Horner a drink after the Oscar ceremony.All the Oscar-winning movies perfectly explain something about humanity, and form a explanation in the audience's heart that can't be explained by the simple word ""love"" or ""friendship"" or ""support"", but we find ourselves somehow different when we walk out of the movie theaters half dreaming half awake while mumbling something like ""It's hell of a movie.""I will think of John Nash when I'm walking my dogs in my 80s, I'll think of him when I am unemployed and wandering on the street, I will think of him when I'm kissing my boyfriend.Image of John writing on the windows in his dorm is still flashing through my mind.Image of Alicia holding the baby to her chest with terror is still flashing though my mind.Image of the little girl opening up her arms is still flashing though my mind.Image of the Charles pushing the table down the window is still flashing through my mind.Image of the paper about Game Theory is still flashing through my mind.Image of old Alicia smiling with tear in Noble Prize ceremony stabbed my heart.""You are the only reason I am, you are all my reasons.""""Thank you.""",A Beautiful Mind
402,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Like all awardscoopers overrated.,6,17 March 2002,"It's got the Golden Globes and it's got the Oscar nominations so it can't be that good, right? The tendency I have is, frankly, to be very sceptical about this kind of award-winning film because the Oscars tend to be little more than a popularity contest. And if you look at a list of the big Oscar winners of the last decade(s) you'll see it hardly ever is the year's best movie getting the Best Film award (see for example American Beauty beating the likes of Magnolia and The Insider while Fight Club wasn't even nominated). Usually the awards are given to some babyboom-appealing toothless film about triumph over adversity with massive studio backing. Well, when you read A Beautiful Mind's tagline, you pretty much get the idea it's purely aimed at forking in the Golden Baldies. So, is it as good as the award ceremonies would have you believe or it as bad as I thought it would be?The answer is: it's neither. There's a lot wrong with this, A LOT. I haven't read the book either (although the film's, uhm, 'cinematic' portrayal of Nash has brought reading it to my interest - when I get around to it, I'll read it) so there might be more wrong with it. What I do know, is that a lot of Nash's unpleasant sides have been left out of the film. We get the paranoid schizophrenia but his personal relationships (apparantly, Nash divorced his wife, only to remarry her forty years later) are sometimes skipped, as well as his bisexuality (this could have been about a bisexual genuis schizophrenic? - I would have been SO there). The point is, although the filmmakers, for some (cowardly?) reason leave out his bisexuality but do decide to insert a car chase (of all things). A Beautiful Mind is a crossover movie somewhere halfway a thriller and halfway a drama. Had they made it a mere drama by enriching the relationships in the film (the one between Nash and his wife is far too one-dimensional) I might have bought it. Had they made it a full-blown conspiracy/ schizophrenia thriller, I might have bought it. I don't buy the mixture perse. The thriller elements seem thrown in for audience entertainment alone and the human drama, under the decidly lightweight direction of Ron Howard, doesn't hit home hard enough. Plus, anyone (especially anyone who's seen one particular movie mentioned in this comment) will see the big twist coming and the movie drags toward the end. And one question continues to bug me today: did Nash, a brilliant man, really give that schmaltzy speech at the Nobel prize ceremony (if you know, please email me)?Russell Crowe's performance is one that's there to please the Oscar audience. He's a genuis schizophrenic and Crowe does almost everything a role like Nash's requires. Every little gesture is there, the accent is near-flawless and he even acts well while in heavy layers of make-up. It is a fairly self-conscious performance, on the other hand, aimed directly at nabbing the awards. Give Denzel the Oscar. No, the real deal is delivered by Jennifer Connely, possibly Hollywood's most underrated actress. Anyone having a role as cliched as hers and anyone having to deliver those horrible lines and inject some real human emotion into it, really does deserve an Oscar. Ed Harris is good, but has an even more thankless role. Paul Bettany is great fun and injects some much-needed spirit into a film about, frankly, a bloody rude man.The strange thing is, even though it's a straight and simple story about a brilliant man coming to terms with his environment and, far more importantly, himself, I didn't dislike it at all. I can break it down like any other Oscar-friendly far-too-feelgooder, but in the end I did care for the film's version of John Nash and his wife. I thought the scientific concepts were adequately handled (it's not trying to be a history lesson, and not a maths course either) and you can't go wrong with a cinematographer like Roger Deakins.All in all, the movie may be a mess of historical trivia on Nash's life and some narrative trickery more suited to a more surreal film, but it is entertaining. So, please, give the awards to some really good films and accept this film for what it is: average.Rating: 6/10",A Beautiful Mind

What do we know of the real man behind the film, at the end?  Do we get any sense of the complexity of his achievements, or of his problems?  If I were to believe this movie, I would believe that Nash had only one single idea in his life, and a simple (if pervasive) problem to face.Unfortunately, at the end, I'm left with the images of Crowe acting out nervous tics, and Jennifer Connelly playing the impossibly loyal wife.The IMDB info for this film says that ""A number of facts in John Nash's life were intentionally altered for dramatic and commercial reasons"" - unfortunately, so many of them that in the end A Beautiful Mind felt like a lie to me.

Russel Crowe is amazing as John Nash, he never fails to impress, im my opinion this is his best performance to date, not over doing the role at all, but actually being John Nash, defintly should win the Oscar. Jennifer Connely is also incredible as Alicia, I've never seen her in a movie before and man, she gives a great, she-better-win-the-Oscar performance in this. Ed Harris is also just great in this, and Ron Howard's just a great film maker. Great acting all around.

410,gerry159,"A Beautiful Mind. A brilliantly made film, but a fraud",6,12 November 2007,"I wonder why it's O.K. to laud some pictures that are suppose to be made from fact and condemn others. A Beautiful Mind is a movie based on a real person but the film changed him and his wife and no one seemed to mind. Denzel Washington played Hurricane Carter in his film, The Hurricane, and the film was blasted by critics because the screen writer had to take some ""creative liberties"" in telling the story. Murder in the First, the story based on Henri Young's prison time at Alcatraz was also lamblasted because of ""creative libertes."" Murder in the First did poorly at the box office because of certain film critics let it be known that it took such liberities. Yet these same critics shouted Hosannas over A Beautiful Mind deliberately over looking the ""facts"" that the main character was homosexual and that his wife was a Spanish woman. And to add insult to injury, the actress playing his wife won an Academy Award. Several Spanish actresses commented that how little roles came their way and that this role would have been just what was needed. Sure, some readers will probably say ""so, what.""! it was the story that counted. And that would be true except that it was not the real story about the genius. What with Ron Howard one would expect nothing less than him changing the wife to a white woman. All in all, A Beautiful Mind might have been an Academy Award picture but it's pure fraud. But that's Hollywood and American critics for you. I hope some viewers will see this in it's true light.",A Beautiful Mind

415,Bunty-at-IMDB,A Beautiful Mind is indeed beautiful,8,18 September 2011,"Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind is complex yet touching wonderful story about a Mathematics genius John Nash who suffered paranoid schizophrenia. The film covers a lifetime of a man, his ambitions, his pain, his struggles and his discoveries. And the person who took the center stage is brilliant Russell Crowe. However, it is not safe to say that the film is flawless – particularly the direction - Howard's direction is focuses and tight in first two acts. But in third act, when the Nash gets old, the film goes like a conventional tear-jerker Hollywood schmaltz. Based on the book, the screenplay is very well written by Akiva Goldsman. The film does not entirely follows Dr. Nash's life and times, and did took some creative liberties showcasing his life. Also, I wanted to see a bit more of Nash's work – the film barely touches that. Cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer James Horner contributed amazingly to the film. Editing in between the middle is slightly slow in pace, but I am nit-picking here. The man of the show is Russell Crowe. He brings great sense of humanity and emotions to his portrayal of John Nash. His body language, his dialog delivery is so effortless that you really think that he is John Nash. Jennifer Connelly also did a great job portraying Nash's loving wife. She was pitch perfect in many scenes, and perhaps her role itself defines the word 'Supporting'.A Beautiful Mind is a well made film with wonderful performances. Although flawed, it is a film that will be remembered for Russell Crowe's beautiful performance. The film is a must watch, but it is certainly not a masterpiece.8/10",A Beautiful Mind
416,sapblatt,"Good, albeit overrated film",7,28 December 2003,"Ron Howard admirably put together 2001's Bet Picture `A Beautiful Mind,' the story of Professor John Nash's battle against his schizophrenia. As anyone who has read my reviews knows I tend not too watch too many of these modern, major Hollywood productions and I usually find them to be too slick and with no edge. This fact, along with my general dislike of Russell Crowe had me avoiding this Oscar winner for a while.With all of my personal baggage now set aside, I must admit I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, and even more surprisingly, I found the best part of the film to be Crowe's convincing portrayal of Nash. The depth and talent that must be utilized in order to convincingly portray mental illness must be staggering. Jennifer Connelly (`Pollock') deservedly earned her Oscar for her heart-felt depiction of Nash's wife, Alicia. The other actor that warrants mentioning is the always brilliant Ed Harris (`Pollock,' `Apollo 13,' `Nixon.') Is it just me or do others feel that if Ed Harris starred in a remake of `Plan 9 from Outer Space' it would warrant Oscar consideration? The man is an amazing talent.The area of this project that seems the most beautiful to me is the combination of Howard's direction, Roger Deakin's (`O' Brother Where Art Thou' `Fargo' `Kundun')cinematography and the editing of Dan Hanley and Michael Hill (editing team on `Apollo 13' and `Backdraft'). The way that this film depicts the inner workings of Nash's mathematical and schizophrenia is wonderfully done.",A Beautiful Mind

I heard that this is based on a true story and I feel bad for the guy who actually had to go through this. I feel really bad for his wife and kid. Poor kid. The hero sort of annoyed me too.

Russell Crowe was the olny actor of our generation that could have nailed this role as well as he did. Yes, its a switch from Gladiator, which people scream was an 'all braun, no brains' movie. Thats not the case. But I wont go on with that.
A Beautiful Mind has conquered the media, the movie going public, and the critics. This movie both lived up to, and has surpassed all the hype that surrounded it. Ron Howard did an amazing job in his directing. He is a great director, but this is his masterpiece. Jennifer Connelly has been one of my favorite actresses since Labyrinth. She was exceptional in this movie. Paul Bettany, the prodigal roommate, is a fantastic up and coming actor. I hope hes around for years to come. Ed Harris was perfect for Parcher.

419,a-65018,"Powerful,quiet",8,10 May 2020,"A Beautiful MindDirector Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says ""Russell Crowe"", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a ""hunk"" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",A Beautiful Mind
420,mikestollov,"Delusional mathematician=interesting, Sane=Boring",7,30 June 2002,"Spoilers Alert Ron Howard's best work yet is not without it's flaws. The story of John Nash is no doubt a difficult story to tackle, after all he developed the ""Game Theory"" of economics which I read about & which gave me headaches for weeks after. Representing that in the film in any sort of depth would be very hard to do without alienating a vast population of cinema goers, although complex mathematical problems have been represented in an understandable & entertaining way before (most notably with the efforts of British code breakers & cracking the Nazi Enigma cyphers).Here's the dilemma then, as Russell Crowe's mumbling Nash descends into delusions the story is interesting. Ed Harris is spooky as the ""Big Brother"" character called Parcher, who works in a world of spies & espionage. The slide from reality to unreality is very well done, you really can't tell that Nash has slipped his leash & wandered off into increasingly paranoid delusions unless you know the story already. From then on it's an occasionaly fast paced plot about breaking Russian codes, tracking suitcased sized atomic bombs that are being routed across the US by a radical faction of the Soviet military. All very James Bond & there's plenty to keep you glued to the screen.The reality takes a back seat, to the extent that you wonder just what on earth the world was doing to allow Nash to keep working in his lofty position while all this hallucination was going on. Now I can understand that you only have so much time, so much story line to devote & that avenues are explored at the expense of others, but if you don't know what John Nash's accomplishments were (his ""Game Theory"" revolutionised economics) then you spend the rest of the film confused. Although his new theory is mentioned, a result of his university search for a completely original area of maths, only at the end is a passing reference made to the importance of his breakthrough. In fact I know some people who think that his unequaled contribution to the world & the reason why he was in such a good job, was the breaking of the above mentioned Soviet codes! This is an indication of how confusing the story can be & I know that it needs to be shown that Nash was delusional, but not at the risk of having the audience lose the plot!All this is due to the overstating of his delusional world, which is cleverly done, but there's far too much smoke & mirrors for the real story to emerge. For instance it is well into the second half of the film that you find out that his college room mate Charles (Paul Bettanay) is actually an illusion. This is skillfully done, it has to be said (the scene in Dr Rosen's (Christopher Plummer) office), but by then you have to sit & think far too much about dominant plot lines that have happened before. I'm all for films making you think, rather than the force fed cotton candy rubbish of Spielberg or Brockheimer, but I found the phase change too confusing. There really should have been a few more clues to build suspicion in the viewing public's mind.There are some hints. For instance there are several characters that never interact with the real world. They also never age, a vital point to Nash's eventual recognition of his illness & the way in which he managed to live with it. But it's far too subtle, to the point where the hints fade into obscurity & the importance is lost.Of course you go, ""Ooohhh' & ""Aaahhhh"" when the truth is revealed, but then we have the second problem, we're back to dry reality & nothing interesting happens. It becomes a life struggle, a unique story non the less, as I don't know how many people have overcome their paranoid delusions simply by applying their on intelect. But rapidly it settles into well worn tracks that are dusted off yet again. Triumph over adversity, love conquers all, the value of friendship, blah blah blah. Iwas left thinking that having Parcher around was better!A final criticism revolves around the sound. Many years ago when Al Pacino & Robert Deniro came along we had a terrible series of ""mumbling"" films, where you couldn't hear what on earth people were saying. This film is bordering on the same, with one minute explosions of sound, followed by long periods of ""what did he say????"". With modern sound production techniques there really is no excuse.Visually it is absolutely flawless, the cinematography flows without effort & the eye is constantly at ease with what is being shown. I like that, it's the way it should be. The music is well sorted out too, setting the mood very well without being obtrusive. This isn't a high octane thriller, so we're treated to a background sound track that stays there, adding to the flavour perfectly.The actors are also wonderful, although Russel Crowe mumbles far too much, as I said. Ed Harris is teriffic as the government spook, Parcher, fitting the 1950s suit & hat with a combination of attention holding aura & chilling malice. Jennifer Connelly is the long suffering wife, a part that doesn't give her much room for development, but she gets to flesh the part out as much as she can (like I said, some aspects of Nash's life get trimmed as the delusional world takes up so much time). Christopher Plummer as the psychiatrist Dr Rosen is a little disturbing, the line where he forciably takes Nash into hospital is somethign like ""I just want to talk with you"", which you know means he's going to actually lock him up. None the less it's good to see Plummer still getting work & doing it very well indeed.One final point surrounds Nash's sexual preferences. I've heard from several gay that Nash went both ways, with a preference for men & that this wasn't shown. I've no idea how true this is, but if it is the case I don't think it's very fair to leave this out. After all if it's OK to have the subject of severe mental illness raised, why not his sexual orientation? Others, those who are more informed ont he subject, will have to explore that avenue.",A Beautiful Mind
421,TigerlilyBramble_of_WillowBottom,Proves that something extraordinary is possible.,7,1 July 2002,"Okay, okay, I admit it. When I first saw the trailer for this film, I rolled my eyes, not hearing the part about it being a true story or that Ron Howard, one of the best directors of this or any generation, had directed and produced it. It was especially the title that made me think it wouldn't be very successful. I mean, ""A Beautiful Mind""? Come ON.
Well, I first started realizing I was wrong when I heard it was big at the box office, and then when I heard it had won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. But by the night of the Oscars, I was my skeptical self again. I wanted Ron Howard to win Best Director, and I didn't care if it won Best Picture, but no matter what, I did NOT want Russell Crowe to win Best Actor. I'm not sure why, but it's probably because I'm not crazy about him, since I heard what he did to the person who cut his speech short. And he didn't win.Finally, a few nights ago, I decided to see this Best-Pic winner that critics were calling ""moving"" and ""powerful,"" so I rented it--and was taken aback. I was shocked. I couldn't believe I had ever doubted this movie before I saw it. First, I'll get over with saying what's NOT good about it: It does feel full of itself, if you know what I mean. Now for what IS good: The makeup--they had to make the actors look older, and did a nice job. The musical score--at times it could be annoying, but most of the time I liked the mysterious music that set the tone of a somewhat mysterious film. The acting--need I say more? I admit Russell Crowe gave one of the best performances of his career, and although his accent slipped more than once, I believed him. And Ed Harris was a good addition to the cast--(MAJOR SPOILER)he seemed like a good guy, but got freakier as you realize he's not real. But the true standout performance, according to the Academy and me, was not Russell, not Ed, not even Christopher Plummer as the doctor who diagnoses John Nash with schizophrenia, but Jennifer Connelly. She's a beautiful and very powerful actress, and really made a name for herself with ""A Beautiful Mind""--not just by winning the Oscar, but simply by playing Alicia Nash. I believed every second of her performance (except maybe the whole bathroom mirror scene; that looked a little phony), and although most probably didn't buy the ""this is real"" line, I did, and I'm not sensitive when it comes to movies. The only type of person who WOULDN'T enjoy ""A Beautiful Mind"" would probably be the type that doesn't appreciate a touching, believable drama with excellent directing and wonderful acting...and there are a few goofs to look for, so nit-pickers like me might enjoy hunting for them.

If we are meant to feel compassion towards Russell Crowe's character because 'oh look he is a genius with a mental illness' then unfortunately I did not feel any empathy at all. The script is totally embellished which takes away its credibility. Also, most of what comes out of his mouth hardly warrants a title of 'A Beautiful Mind'.

424,guy_lazarus,Did John Nash make that speech at the Nobel Prize award ceremony?,3,19 March 2002,"To answer to the question John Nash did not give the speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony that is in the film A BEAUTIFUL MIND; the only Nobel Prize winner that gives a speech is the Peace Prize winner (or the Literature winner -- there's only one that is allowed to speak, and I can't remember which -- I'm not losing my mind, just my memory). Nash gave no speech at all; he held a press conference. The speech is a fabrication of the screenwriter.Nash won the Nobel MEMORIAL Prize in Economics, which is not a true Nobel Prize, by the way. It is not funded by the Nobel will (which is the reason the guy vetting Nash for the prize explains that money has to be raised for it). I read the book when it first came out and barely remember it (though I remember it being a good read -- that darn memory again), but I believe it had covered the extensive politicking behind the prize which was fascinating in itself.I thought the film was horrible. One leaves the theater not knowing anything about John Nash (the real John Nash), mental illness, or life itself. Love did not cure John Nash -- the best explanation for the spontaneous remission of his schizophrenia is hormonal changes that began when he reached his 50s. Love does not cure schizophrenia, folks, outside of a Hollywood suds fest.What is so egregious about leaving out Nash's bisexuality is that the ""Red Scare"" and purges in the U.S. in the late 1940s/1950s targeted homosexuals as security risks. (This explains why Nash in real life was fired from the Rand Corp. -- the ""think tank"" so intertwined with the Vietnam War -- after allegedly making a pass at another man.) Homosexuals were considered ""mentally ill"" officially by the American Psychiatric Assn. until the early 1970s. They were, and continue to be considered, security risks by the military-industrial establishment.The film is nearly a constant lie from beginning to end.  One mourns for the great film that could have resulted from such material put in the hands of a great director with a taste for the duality/perversity of life as truly lived, say Atom Egoyan. Ron ""Opie"" Howard's direction is abysmal. This is a child actor morphed into big budget Hollywood director that has no point-of-view/take on life other than the box office. Schmaltz equals box office, so that's what we get. ""That's entertainment!"" I don't believe Opie knows anything about what it's like to attend a university such as Princeton, let alone what it is like to be afflicted by genius-cum-schizophrenia or to live life in the real world. It is a movie with a profound deficit in wisdom.I found the performances to be incredibly over-hyped; Jennifer Connelly is fine, but she does not give a performance of award-winning caliber unless the award is such hype-driven ""Let's honor the latest B-movie bimbo morphed serious actress"" awards as as the Oscar. I was also not disappointed to see her breasts, or her in revealing outfits. (It's the 1950s -- why isn't she in a girdle or some other foundation garments? There is not attention to detail in this film; it's all softened to evoke the year 2001 through a nostalgic filter. ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" in contrast, masterfully evokes the feel of the '50s. I could remember the feel starched shirts, tiny sports jackets, clasp-on ties and faux-fedoras my brother and I wore to church in the early 1960s while watching ""Man."" ""Beautiful Mind,"" in contrast, evokes the 1990s, what with portable nukes, the word ""meds,"" the digital readout implant, etc. Soft focus filmmaking, geared towards not challenging the audience even minutely.) I mention Connelly's assets as after watching her over many years, including her wonderful turn in ""Waking the Dead,"" one comes to expect seeing her breasts, or oogling her in something sexy. You're disappointed when it doesn't come off.The one-note performance of Russell Crowe makes me doubt my earlier assessment of him as a very talented actor. There is no development at all in his characterization of John Nash, and while I would like to blame the director, I think back on his performances in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER (the latter of which I liked enormously) and see his Nash is just a variation of his ""wounded"" shtick. It was monotonous, to watch Nash as a loon from beginning to end. None of Crowe's characterizations, on second thought, show any development at all.While I will concede with Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" that I was watching an actor of some talent (though not greatly gifted), but I was watching an actor ""acting"" rather than an actor as the character (as Tom Wilkinson, who gave the most outstanding performance in English-language film this year, does in ""In The Bedroom"" -- you forget you're watching an actor acting and are watching the character himself). There is no fluidity at all in Crowe's characterization, nothing of the seamlessness of when a great actor becomes the character her plays. we're watching a cobbled-together performance, something more akin to elocution, ""gestures"" that will convey to the ordinary mass ""My -- aren't I watching 'great acting.'"" Crowe could have used semaphores (as opposed to the lazy or bored actor ""phoning in"" his performance; I supposed the audience gives extra credit for extra effort in really getting out there and ""acting"").  Crowe gives us a herky-jerky nut-case who becomes almost laughable two-thirds into the film. While watching the film, I began to think that Tom Hanks would have done a much better job with the character.I have had a long-standing argument with my girlfriend over the merits of Tom Hanks as an actor -- I'm not a fan of his, she is -- but watching Crowe's ""good"" bad acting made me appreciate that Hanks is indeed a truly good actor. A hallmark of an outstanding performance is when you cannot imagine another actor in the role -- I can not only imagine other actors in the role of John Nash, but other actors giving a far better, far more believable performance than the over-hyped Russell Crowe. Apart from Hanks, Gary Oldman would have been terrific in this role. There's such a scent of ham in Crowe's characterization, all's I can think is -- if you're going to go that route, why not with the greatest slice of ham in the world -- Mr. Oldman? Gary never made it to star status and then began weighing roles by the size of his pay-cheque, but he is at heart a terrific actor, albeit a really full-bore, over-the-top one, but if that's the way the director wanted it played -- as an out and out looney tune -- why not go with a great actor that can give you a fluid performance that is not a bunch of cobbled together tics (and whose ""West Virginia"" accent wanes more than Nash's schizophrenia as portrayed in the film).This film is terrible -- it makes a caricature of a genius, a caricature of someone who is mentally ill. Fifty years from now, if there still is a good ol' planet Earth, people will look back and see Crowe's unenlightened performance (as orchestrated by Opie) to be the equivalent of Step-in-Fetchit.",A Beautiful Mind

I knew the film's premise going in so I was basically trying to figure out what was real for John Nash, & what was illusion.

426,apfortony,beautiful but 2001's best?,8,2 May 2002,"Although I was not very familiar with the history of John Nash, the man whose life this picture is based on, I did find the story compelling and the acting very good indeed. However if this was the best film of 2001 then it certainly was a mediocre year for movies. Yes the ending was moving but in a melodramatic movie-of-week sort of way. Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance and she adds depth to her role as the stoic supportive wife. We can see her fear grow as the evidence mounts against her husband. Through her frustration the audience gets a sense of how hard it would be to stand by someone with that kind of illness. This makes the payoff at the end all the more sweet. But the fact that Nash's life story was cleaned up for the big screen does unfortunately detract from the movie. One can almost feel the focus groups and marketing surveys determining how the film will finally play out. This is a shame because of the remarkable and convincing way the audience is set-up to discover that Nash suffers from schizophrenia. If the film had gone on past the point where it ended I think it would have scored a bullseye. Because even without knowing that certain parts of Nash's life were left out, I still wondered if he really said the things he said when he gave his speech. The fact that the film ends where it does already seemed to make it just a little too much Hollywood. That parts of his life were left out to make the picture more ""commercial"" makes me wonder if other parts were over emphasized for dramatic effect. This takes a good film down a notch.",A Beautiful Mind

Well it's not the case here, because A beautiful mind is a very provocative, intelligent drama which may not be receptive to mass public, a possible reason for it's poor rating.I loved the thin line between reality and fantasy, between health and mental illness, line which becomes clearer and clearer as we approach the end, i might say a tragic, but not so tragic one - depending on every ones judgment.Last but not least, what i find of particular importance is the message this drama delivers: when you can't defeat schizophrenia or any other illness, acceptance can be just as comforting as the hope for a miraculous cure.All being said I hope I made my point, A beautiful mind is without a doubt in my mind, the most intense and provocative film of the 00's so far, and i rate it 9/10.",A Beautiful Mind

She does a good job, but her character degenerates into awfulness.

434,garyprosser1,What's In A Mind?,9,8 June 2019,"Didn't think I'd watched A Beautiful Mind. At first, I thought that maybe it seemed familiar because of its similar feel to the later films The Theory Of Everything and The Imitation Game. Misunderstood, awkward geniuses in elite institutions, struggling to find their place in society whilst engaged in a battle with their own brilliant (or, indeed, beautiful) minds; it's no wonder that I was drawn to this film because I've already seen and loved it.Sadly and also fortuitously, I don't have a mind like John Mash's so I was able to watch this film with new eyes despite having seen it and it really is remarkable. Whether or not it is as true to life as the other two films I mentioned (both of which, while brilliant, deviate heavily from reality), I don't know. What I do know is that I'm clearly drawn to and fascinated by those whose brains are wired differently from those of mere mortals. Nash, Hawking, Turing, Curie, Lovelace, Weeks, Da Vinci; these people see the world so utterly differently and beautifully that I'm compelled to want to see what they see, even though I never, ever could.Ron Howard won 4 Oscars for this film and it's easy to see why. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are exemplary in their roles as the Nash's and the film itself doesn't waste a scene as it tortures us and John with what is real and what is not. This is part biopic, part thriller, part mystery; all wrapped up in the mind of one remarkable brain. It is a blessing that John lived at a time where his conditions, to use a basic term, were at least attempted to be understood, albeit primitively, rather than him being locked away in a padded cell for the rest of his days.Such minds change the world if they're allowed to. The person in question might never be able to understand themselves or the world they live in but if and when the light shines through and they unlock whatever is lurking in the recesses of their capabilities, beauty and magic are released and the way we all view things is altered.Hawking's body let him down, the medical profession let Nash down and everybody let Turing down (look it up; it is a source of eternal national shame what happened to him after the war). Great geniuses are so often misunderstood and let down by those around them but we can only be grateful that these people's minds were allowed to shine so brilliantly and with such intensity for however long they did.A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful film about a beautiful man. We mere mortals are so lucky that such insight comes along once in a blue moon, even if they themselves must suffer so much. I just wonder if it has to be that way.

438,lhseaglerunner,`A Beautiful Mind' is a Moving Picture of Mental Illness,8,10 January 2002,"`I don't like people much.they don't seem to like me either'-John Nash, `A Beautiful Mind'
This single quote, which could sum up scores of main characters throughout the history of Hollywood, is perhaps the perfect way to sum up the attitude of `A Beautiful Mind's' protagonist, John Nash. Afflicted with a disease, schizophrenia, he manages to confront it and eventually conquer it on his journey through the highs and lows of life.
We first meet John Nash (Russell Crowe) he comes across as an egotistical, yet brilliant mathematician, and because of his ego, he focuses his energies not on reviewing other ideas of his mathematical predecessors, but instead on finding `an original idea.' This quest poses problems for Nash as he struggles to find his idea, but throughout, he is supported be Charles (Paul Bettany), his partying prodigal roommate. When Nash finds his idea (of course he will-it's Hollywood), it is an economics that completely-and accurately, flies in the face of 150 years of economic theory.
With this idea, Nash receives a cushy job as a member of an MIT think-tank that is funded by the government. It is he who gets the call to go in and break a nearly impossible Soviet cipher regarding agent movements. After rendering these services, he is called upon by Agent Parcher (Ed Harris) of the CIA to search for Soviet codes in magazines during the tense periods of the early 1950s. With all of this defense work, it becomes natural that he becomes a little paranoid and stressed, which only bring out schizophrenic delusions.
To add to his already complicated life, the prickly and brusque Nash falls in love with a student of his, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who, despite his manner and direct approaches, loves him as well. To make a long story fit into the space of this little column; they fall in love and get married. But Alicia begins to get worried about her husband's paranoia. In the fall of 1956, Nash is taken, quite forcefully to a psychiatric hospital, where he learns that the world that he thought he knew was mostly in his imagination. Now Nash is forced to find some way to conquer his delusions in the tortured battleground of his mind.
What can I say about this movie? Well, for the most obvious choice, it was nearly flawless. Russell Crowe is excellent in this turn from some of the more, shall we say, physical movie roles. With `Gladiator' on my list of favorite movies, I personally could not picture Crowe as an academic. I'll admit it, I was wrong. Director Ron Howard has made me say that I AM WRONG. That sounds humble enough, right? The supporting actors were also superb in their roles. Ed Harris was the perfect guy to place, with no offense intended, a jerk. He played out his character strongly and made certain that the audience would not love his character. Jennifer Connelly was stunning as she portrayed the loving, faithful, yet anguished wife of a man haunted by invisible demon. Awe-inspiring performances all around.
The issues that `A Beautiful Mind' dealt with were also strong and daring. Thinking about all of the films that I know of, I can only think of a few that portray mental illness as part of a primal theme, with most of it showing the physical aspects such as autism in `Rainman' or the treatment of it, ala `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' This film delved into the invisible demons of schizophrenia, which were portrayed on the screen to give the movie some sense. But this is so much deeper than just the story of tragedy and triumph-it is really an allegory, a parable for living. Nash was forced to deal with his demons, to face them head on, which could also apply to anyone's and everyone's lives because as humans, we have fears and problems that should not be shirked from, but instead, be faced head-on so that the demons will be conquered. (Note to readers-If I have just gone off on a tangent, I apologize, too much studying of themes for Lit class I guess.)
It is my prediction right here, right now, that `A Beautiful Mind' will garner a handful of nominations for the Oscars, and without knowing the rest of the field, I think that it should do very well. Go see this movie, it will touch you, it will move you, but most importantly, it will teach you about life and living. One hundred percent.",A Beautiful Mind

He has finally proved to the world that he is an amazing director and no list of the best contemporary directors is complete unless it bears his name. The brightest gem in this film is Jennifer Connelly. Her performance is so real that you can't help but feel her pain in coping with her schizophrenic husband. Her performance as Alicia is worth every supporting actress accolade in the books. Ed Harris gives his best performance ever in a supporting role as Nash's antagonist. He appearance is so subtle it is absolutely terrifying. James Horner's musical score is grade A even compared to his previous work on Titanic and Glory.

For those who've heard but think its no big deal, I disagree with you. For those who know and care, please help stand up with me.It is fact, not speculation, that John Nash was at very least bisexual, and the tendency to suppress this fact only adds to the stigma of shame thrust upon those of us who are not happily heterosexual. The people who write the scripts insist on changing facts to make the movie more mainstream and profitable, to make it more palatable for those whom share distaste for people who don't fit into how their egos require. It is a shame, because this movie could have been groundbreaking beyond its intriguing portrayal of a brilliant man's inner turmoil, done so well otherwise. You cannot use an excuse that revealing a complex man's complex natures would only give the story too much distraction.I would have enjoyed the movie otherwise but found the omission disgusting. Much like 'The Martian Child' by David Gerrald that was successfully translated to bigscreen, but because it would be 'unacceptable' to have characters 'marred' by so-called character-defects that would reduce their likability, well we certainly can't allow children to have such role models, can we?I am fortunate to be well-educated and well-read, to have known that gay or bisexual men can be awesome and powerful, not just amusing.

449,Don Stephens,Press Return...,7,16 January 2002,"Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is just the kind of movie Hollywood makes. An eccentric genius falls in love while battling his personal demons.  It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but I've seen it before, and in a better version.Avid watchers of film will equate ""A Beautiful Mind"" with a little indie flick that came out in 1998 called ""Pi.""  (The actual title is the mathematical symbol.)  That film also depicts a mathematical genius, number theory stretching beyond his control, and the game Go.  But ""Pi"" itself was possessed of a spiraling madness.  A reclusive mathematician whose computer spits out a 237 digit number which could be translated through Hebrew into the name of God, and thus finding patterns in all the chaotic events of daily life.  It was directed by Darren Aronofsky, (who also directed ""Requiem For A Dream"" and is in talks to helm the ""Batman: Year One"" film) and was shot on grainy, 16mm black and white.  ""Pi"" had edge and daring and a lot of other stuff ""A Beautiful Mind"" doesn't have.That being said, ""A Beautiful Mind."" is a lovely little film. A man's battle with himself, and a love story to boost ticket sales. It's one of those slivers of a true story that is mostly fiction but we all wish happened anyway.  Russell Crowe, in a brilliant performance, plays John Nash, a West Virginia math prodigy who can afford to be arrogant because he's always right.  The rest of the movie for the most part is nothing new, but the character of John Nash is something I don't remember seeing.  Mumbling in his near indecipherable accent, hobbling along as he ages, looking positively ill at ease in a tuxedo.  This is a new level of fearlessness for Crowe.  After a guy plays a disgraced-yet-studly Roman soldier in one of the most overrated films ever made, there is a level of coolness that one might feel the need to live up to.  Not Crowe.  He takes off his leather skirt and jumps right back into the deep characters where he left off with ""The Insider.""As a director, Ron Howard is shamelessly commercial.  That's not always a bad thing, but it ain't always good either.  From his worst movies (""Dr. Suess' How The Grinch Stole Christmas"") to his best, (""Apollo 13"") Howard shows no artist's touch whatsoever.  My feeling is that he just falls ass-backwards into the scripts that'll probably be the highest grossers. Well, more power to him.  If he makes more movies like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" he may find himself with one more fan.  But pay Aronofsky some royalties, will ya?*** out of 4",A Beautiful Mind
450,amanfigo,Some wonderful Crowe and Howard,8,6 February 2003,"A wonderful movie that counts us the great history of the prize Nobel John Nash and their fight against the schizophrenia and one of the best movies of Ron Howard!!!. A history that Howard directs and he counts us the history in a simple but at the same time sublime way, a brilliant one  "" biography "" that makes us understand the character (with the help of the touching intervention of Russell Crowe) and like he goes being able to make in front of their fight against their mental illness.  	 	I am surprised as Howard plays with the inability of distinguishing the real of the unreal of Nash and it is able to make us believe that the main character hallucinations are real and then he gives us the surprise that it is totally the opposite. A movie that is so majestic that I don't have words to define it. I love the way in that the whole plot is developed; as Nash, thanks to their willpower and the support and their wife's love, it is able to overcome the great problem that it comes him torturing in the whole history. A splendid sound band that accompanies and it supplements perfectly with a real history and with a good atmosphere and screenplay.  	The part of the interpretations neither should spend for high in this history they are already of the best that I have seen, as that of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer.... and mainly the special interpretation of Russell Crowe (For my it is the best interpretation in his career like actor) that it gives a tremendous air of realism to the character as if the one was the own John Nash.

451,patrickl-1,a beautiful film...,7,30 October 2002,"When I heard about the premise to a movie with Russell Crowe being released in December, 2001 (one of the best actors of modern cinema) playing a schizophrenic mathematician, I thought, ""B.F.D."" With acting from Crowe, powerful performances from Jennifer Connelly (whom was always easy for me to look at, but I didn't think she was THAT good), Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and others, I found myself so engulfed with it, I was wondering, ""when's Russell going to go schizo?"" Only after the first hour, I was amazed how Akiva Goldsman (and it IS the screenwriter who deserves credit as much as Ron Howard)told this story with such clever execution! (And he's no mathematician, either!) NOW THAT IS STORYTELLING!
But it was also the resilience of Jennifer Connelly's character that also gave me a sense of hope that there are still compassionate people in this world who still love others despite their flaws. Most people in society today would completely divorce themselves from a situation like that.

No. Look at the sort of films that do well on the big night! This film is like Chocolat - sugary sweet. Let's just hope for the sake of cinema that the Academy sees sense like it did with that. The film is historically completely inaccurate. But the serious crime is that schizophrenia is badly misrepresented. Rather than audi-intrusiveness in some schizophrenics, the film producers decided to opt for sixth-sense style sensationalism. How original. Nash's violent temper and bi-sexuality were almost completely disregarded, or sanitised, and the ending was puke-makingly sugary. The film has one, and only one, redeeming feature: Crowe has done it again. For all his odiousness as a person, he has managed a fine performance. But this film is otherwise hardly worth the entrance fee. Oh, and by the way, a biopic whilst a person is still alive? I don't think so.

453,bigspeegs,An Uncompromising Snapshot of a Schizophrenic's Life,8,23 February 2002,"RATING:  ***1/2 out of ****
On the surface, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a biopic of John Nash, one of America's great mathematicians. But that statement is misleading. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is not a film that paints a big, sweeping portrayal of the events of one man' life. Instead, in the way that Ed Harris did last year with ""Pollock"", Ron Howard gives the viewer a more personal look at the subject of the film. Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman don't take the easy route and merely dramatize everything that Nash accomplished, for that would really only be a two-hour way of saying ""Won Nobel Prize for..."" They let us get to know Nash as only those who were closest to him knew him, and most remarkably show us how his mind processed and who he was.
John Nash (Russell Crowe) is a math student studying at Princeton College. His friends are studying and building on the works of what he considers to be ""lesser mortals"", while what he really wants to do is come up with a truly original idea. He spends his time alone, trying to find definitive patterns to everyday movements, games, etc. He gets encouragement from his roommate Charles (Paul Bettany), but I'll jump the gun a little and tell you this is where the trouble starts. Suddenly, he does find his original idea, and it is so revolutionary that he is given a grant to study/teach at MIT. There, he meets Alicia, a student of his that he has begun to court. The two get married a while later, but during this time, Alicia doesn't see that Nash is being plagued by delusions, one a CIA operative (Parcher, played by Ed Harris) who enlists him on a ""top secret mission"" to try and discover secret encoded messages in periodicals supposedly being sent out by Russian spies. His empty quest starts to devour him, as he dreams of the Russians coming after him and other secret forces closing in. Alicia begins to notice that something is definitely wrong, and starts to help her husband try and realize what is real and what isn't. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a solid, powerful drama. I'll re-iterate that it doesn't tell us everything about John Nash, and sometimes that irked me. I admit I did not know much about John Nash's accomplishments, and going out, I wasn't in the least bit enlightened on that front. His supposedly breakthrough work on game theory goes relatively unexplained here, and that was one thing in the film that could have used a little tweaking. However, this is about the man, not the work. Many people have complained about the film's ignorance towards Nash's bisexuality, and I would have to disagree with them to an extent. There are moments in where bisexuality is most definitely hinted at. This would be more of a problem if the film was not so obviously trying to focus on Nash's paranoid schizophrenia, something that is portrayed magnificently. Akiva Goldsman has fashioned his screenplay in such a way that we are put in Nash's shoes, and then brought to see a more objective view. At first, we have little idea as to what Nash's delusions are, they all blend into reality seamlessly. Then, they start to get more outrageous, and when Nash's fears of these images start to be brought out into the public, we start to look at him from another viewpoint. However, we feel for him, because we have seen what he is going through, and we feel for those affected by him (especially Alicia) because he has become so out of touch with the world.
This film is a prime example of what Russell Crowe can do when he's not out toga partying with Ridley Scott. He gives one of his best performances, portraying the schizophrenia without over-doing it or milking moments for their dramatic value. Another actor might immediately approach the subject grimly and teary-eyed, but Nash at first cannot realize what he is seeing does not exist, so why should he be afraid? Jennifer Connelly gives the other extraordinary performance in the film. Connelly has been one of the most under-appreciated and hardest working actresses in the business, and it is wonderful that she will now get the recognition she deserves for her powerful, passionate portrayal of Alicia Nash. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is compelling film that never stoops to endorse melodrama or over-acting. It doesn't get all the details of John Nash's life in, that much is true, but it doesn't need to. It has a purpose, and it executes it in magnificent form. It is a fine, intricately constructed vision of paranoid schizophrenia and a man who had the will to defeat it. And although skeptics will attack it until the cows come home, the truth is that ""Mind"" is beautiful.",A Beautiful Mind

With the outstanding screenplay, it just fit in. The beautiful shots with the sharp and accurate camera angles deserve some acclaim and now he's gonna get it.The performances are exceptional. Russel Crowe demonstrates to us what the meaning and purpose of acting really is. He is brilliant as the suffering John Nash. Connelly is also great, she gives a thoughtful, yet sophisticated performance as his wife. Rest of the cast are always too great; (Bettany and Harris).Overall, A Beautiful Mind is one of the most Oscar deserving Pictures of the century!

459,johnprestonevans,A Beautiful Performance,7,3 February 2002,"Based on the real life of genius mathmatician John Nash, this film takes liberties with its events, but ultimately serves up a great movie about a man in madness.  Russell Crowe is fantastic as Nash.  This is a signature performance that will captivate moviegoers with a magnetic energy.  Nash's slow but steady decent into paranoid pscyzophrenia is troubling, puzzling and heartbreaking.  The character ages 50 years through the course of the film, weaving him in and out of delusions that are not made clear until the midpoint of the movie.  The first half is remenicent of the clever trickery and manipulation that the 6th Sense had, and until you realize he has this delusional disorder, you dont understand that half of what is one the screen is not real.  The 2nd half of the picture depicts Nash's struggle to overcome the illness on his own terms - using his ""beautiful mind"" to beat his degeneration.  He is a complex character, at times insecure, and others extremely arrogant and blunt, obsessed with his mathematic breakthroughs and fantasy life as a Pentagon agent.  Jennifer Connolley is good as his wife, who stands by John through decades of uncertainty and maddness.  The ending feels a bit too sweet and nice to feel very real.  It will leave you questioning how much liberty director Ron Howard exercised with the script. A good film nonetheless.  Final Rating = 7.4/10",A Beautiful Mind
460,lisarull,Stunning performances that avoid the worst kind of schmaltz,9,14 February 2002,"Yes this is high Oscar-fodder: it's the kind of material that makes the awards judges go weak (and look, nominations galore and wins for all concerned... except of course, in the final analysis one fears, for Ron Howard - like Michael Mann, the system rarely forgives popular TV origins).And let me say first off that it would be foolish to deny that a goodly portion of the audience for this are going because they long to see something to erase the critical disaster that was ""Proof of Life"" from their memories (because, facing facts, this would make a great movie anyway, but Russell Crowe is what will have drawn most of its audience).  And, thank god, it succeeds in that.  In POL we had that body in a black vest struggling to act in an incredibly formulaic action drama.  Here, RC is back to what he does best - ACTING - and we get a white t-shirt... well, I'll definitely settle for that.I dreaded that this would be a real schmaltz-fest: don't get me wrong, I liked ""Apollo 13"" and I'll cry at almost anything, but I was rather wary of how much ABM would be wringing my tear-ducts.  In the end it's an incredibly tempered depiction of mental illness and what directoral/camera trickery is done is subtle and nuanced - in keeping with the performances.  Knowing as much as I do about mental health issues and the experiences attached to them, I felt moved - but not in an obvious way - by the way this was dealt with.  Jennifer Connelly (as Alicia) does a magnificent job in portraying the quiet, and then raging, frustration and love felt by a partner in such circumstances.It seems unfair to pick out individuals from the cast for comment - above and beyond Crowe's touching performance which truly inhabits the character of John Nash - since each makes such a great contribution to the overall storyline.  However, Harris and Bettany especially could have found themselves caught in the worst kind of roles, yet they lend the film immense solidity and depth. Given the storyline there is not much that is radical or previously unseen, but what is done is done very well and avoids the worst excesses associated with this kind of film.  And it is not exactly about 'overcoming' schizophrenia (which implies 'cure') but rather 'dealing with' it.Ultimately though it was a pleasure to see such a return to form for an actor who deserved better than dross like ""Mystery, Alaska"" and ""Proof of Life"" (note these both followed great critical/popular acclaim pieces like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Gladiator"") as ludicrously entertaining as these may have been in their own right if Crowe had not demonstrated such immense talent elsewhere.",A Beautiful Mind

467,dgoody,Lives up to the hype,8,9 May 2002,"Life is a long, subtle and complex entity riddled with ambiguity and questions, without neat little dividers or convenient scenes. In short it is often a frustrating and confusing experience, which is one of the reasons why motion pictures have become as successful and as ubiquitous as they have, because they offer an escape from the problematic nature of our circumstances and allow us to dream for a few hours.If you wish to see a balanced and intelligent portrayal of either the life of nobel prize winner John Nash or the effects of Schizophrenia then A Beautiful Mind should be well down your list, if even on it at all. However if you want 2 hours of well produced and well acted drama, and have it in you to forgive a few oversights then Ron Howard's multi Oscar winner succeeds.The film follows the life of John Nash from his obsessive and turbulent time at Princeton university where he writes a groundbreaking paper on an economics related subject, through to his study at Wheeler labs where he becomes embroiled in top secret government work as delusions start to take over his life.The strength of A Beautiful Mind is in how powerfully it evokes Nash's delusions, to the extent that you not only starting questioning exactly who around him is real, but wishing that some of his fantasies really were real, and as such, if you let it, the film draws you into the characters tortured world, where he is torn between impossible decisions because of his confused judgements.The performances are all excellent and aided by the scripts wise decision to restrict tearful emotive speeches to a minimum instead of soliloquising the audience into submission. The supporting roles from Ed Harris and Paul Bethany are crucial and well delivered. Even Russell Crowe's Forrest Gump accent is forgivable due to the general restraint shown in a part that most people would have showboated throughout in. Whilst it still pales next to his remarkable performance in The Insider, this confirms that Russell Crowe's ability remains undiminished by the corrupting effects of Hollywood stardom.Where the superficially similar Iris struggled to impress with an intricate flashback structure and dreamy abstract visuals Ron Howard keeps things relative basic, with only some fairy dust special effects trying to add a little too much saccharine to the tale (whenever Nash cracks a code it seems as if Tinkerbell is pointing the way for him with the amount of sparkles on the screen). The result of this is that whilst A Beautiful Mind may function only on a simple and restricted level, with little for the intellect or artistic eye to feast upon, it succeeds as potent storytelling where the performances and direction do their best not to obstruct or inhibit the fingers of the film plucking at heartstrings, which is what has made American cinema the most popular in the world.",A Beautiful Mind

This drama has a complex story line, but it's a complex topic, so expect nothing less than a complex movie. Mind boggling to say the least. This movie is a love story, a story of a triumph over one of the least talked about diseases around; mental illness. Ron Howard takes us into the mind of a schizophrenic and he does it so beautifully, so tenderly. Aside from the story of one man's life, Mr. Howard brings the sadness and misfortune of a terrible disease into our minds as we are shown the mind of one of it's victims, John Nash. It's an extraordinary story of an extraordinary man, with an extraordinary life. It begins with John Nash entering into Princeton's graduate program and we are given a peek into his ""brilliant"" mind...and slowly into his illness. Of course, with dramatic license we are told of a great love story, but I wonder of the truthfulness of that part (Mr. and Mrs. Nash were divorced for some years and remarried a few years before the movie was made, not as the movie portrayed) but, for the purpose of the movie we are not angry for the minor alterations of reality.Ed Harris is so good in this we almost believe he is real as Parcher, a character that only exists in John's mind. As is Paul Bettany, Nash's ""roommate"" and ""friend""..while we are watching we are unsure and fooled into thinking their roles are that of actual men, when they are not. Thank Ron Howard for that. I later read that there are clues to show us before the viewer is made aware of it...for instance...when Charles' niece is playing in the field with the birds, running around, the birds don't fly away, hence she is not real...also, Charles is not seen at Nash's wedding and while we may wonder why, we aren't sure at that point why. Also, there is some truth to the fact of John Nash working for the government, we just don't know to what extent. In the movie, there is a fine line between what the viewer is shown to be real and imagined. That's what makes it so good, so artistically crafted. A creative scene in which we see Russell Crowe called to a top secret room to decipher ""messages"" with the montage of computerized numbers is perfect. It's as if he's spinning out of control. Or perhaps a glimpse into his brilliant yet affected mind. There are many poignant moments in the film. To name a couple; when Nash's rival allows him to take office at Princeton while fully aware of his illness. He shows compassion we should all have for the mentally ill. Also, when he receives the pens in the tea room, we see that he is recognized for his work and not shunned because of his condition. A beautiful Mind is a beautiful story with few flaws (one I feel I should mention is Crowe's accent, it could have been better..not that I could do better but it sounded off) This is another movie that will not be forgotten and will go down in film history books. Not only for the talent of those involved in making it, but for it's contribution to awareness of an ugly, ignored disease that affects so many...this is one you've got to see, even own (the DVD, of course for the special features) I give it 9/10*",A Beautiful Mind

473,DR.Z,Mathematics can be a beautiful thing,10,28 December 2001,"Boy, if Russell Crowe doesn't win his second consecutive Oscarfor best picture for this movie, I don't know what will.  He is trulymesmerizing here as John Nash, the brilliant mathematician whoslowly descended into the pit of schizophrenia in the prime of hiscareer.  Every mannerism, facial tic, shuffling walk, andstammering comment rings true.  **mild spoiler coming** And thatscene in his backyard garage with his wife (without giving toomuch away) really freaked me out, somewhat akin to when theyfind that body in Se7en. **end spoiler**.  Jennifer Connelly, thebabe of all babes, is merely beautiful here as the wife who standsby him through all the tough times.  Of course, there are theobligatory Hollywood minutes which will have the sentimentalreaching for their hankies.

474,dmnkeen,Enough is enough.,6,25 March 2002,"I don't really dislike this movie, but giving it Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay!!! Come on, Academy, snap out of it: let's try giving the award to something that really deserves it and not something that is merely worthy.Although A Beautiful Mind is well made (Roger Deakins' cinematography in particular being a standout), it is not in the same class as fellow nominees In The Bedroom, Lord of the Rings, Gosford Park and Moulin Rouge. All of these other movies take enormous risks, inflame passions and debate, and look like labours of love. Ron Howard's movie, regardless of the makers' intentions, comes over as a well intentioned but flatly earnest big budget made for TV issues movie. At it's worst, the movie is more about emotional manipulation than it is about producer Brian Grazer's aim of opening a window on understanding mental illness.Russell Crowe has done much better work than on show here (and, deservedly, lost out to Denzel Washington for Best Actor); and Ron Howard himself has produced better movies like Ransom and Apollo 13; even his underrated The Paper is much better than this. That Howard at his least effective has beaten directors like Altman, Jackson, and Scott at their peak does not reflect well on the Academy's judgement.When all is said and done, however, what does it actually mean? The history of the Oscars is littered with movies which lost out but are more memorable than the winners: Raging Bull, Jaws, It's A Wonderful Life, Psycho (hell, Hitchcock never ever won an Oscar - what does that tell us?), The Searchers, etc, etc, so it will not surprise me when, in a few years, this movie has been largely forgotten or reevaluated for it's true worth (a la English Patient) while Rings, Rouge, Bedroom and Park will stand unblemished as the true master classes in making stimulating cinema that they really are.6/10",A Beautiful Mind

The excessive time devoted to the unfolding of the relatively simple story makes a mockery of the otherwise fine efforts of the actors, and make them look overdramatised and pretentious.

482,KoreanPenguin,A Beautiful Mind (2001),8,12 June 2013,"Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind,"" contains a visual treat that I won't soon forget. I'm talking about a scene a little over halfway into the film, where our protagonist John–played by Russell Crowe (of ""Gladiator"" fame)–sits in the kitchen with his wife Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly (""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Blood Diamond""). He's beginning to fall back into his disorder, and sits at a table, playing with a strange suction cup unicorn toy. Alicia is starting to grow increasingly more frustrated with John, and steps over to the refrigerator.There is a clear divide in their marriage, and even though it is portrayed so clearly on-screen, we are provided with a powerful, yet subtle reminder here. A wall literally separates the two of them, their backs are turned to one another, and although they are having a conversation, they are both concentrating on different things.This is the kind of provoking imagery that Ron Howard has put together for his audience, along with ASC Roger Deakins (""No Country for Old Men"", ""Skyfall"", ""Shawshank Redemption"").""A Beautiful Mind"" follows the true, yet flawed, story of a brilliant mathematician, named John Nash, who struggles to live with schizophrenia. We begin our excavation into his life starting first at his entry into Princeton, and our journey ends with Nash in old age. As grumpy and–for the most part, socially inept–an old fart as he was in his younger years. Regardless of his laughable social ability, he makes lifelong friends (and gets hitched) despite his strange behavior; even though he's kind of a jerk. He is quite lovable. Whether this is the beauty of Crowe's fantastic work as an actor, or the tediousness of a well-designed script, I will leave that decision up to you.Even though we focus mostly on Nash, we do spend a good portion of time with Alicia. I must say that I truly appreciated her character's devotion to John. Unfortunately, many times in film, a love interest is thrown in as an afterthought to spice up the sex appeal, but here is not the case (although, Connelly looks somewhat stunning as an older woman). What I admired most about her screen time is her unrelenting sense of hope. Granted, she does grab their child and begins driving away at one point (but you would too if your husband nearly drowned the little tot.) Alicia inspires a true feeling of redemption for Nash's character, and she sees it through until the end. A marvelous picture of the difficulties of marriage and endless perseverance through it, I assure you.Of course, Howard would never let his audience go without extra fun, and this comes in the form of actors: Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, and Ed Harris, who play respectively: Nash's psychiatrist, Charles (one of Nash's friendly hallucinations), and Parcher (a government agent hallucination, hell-bent on pushing Nash to decipher non-existent Russian codes from various publications and magazines.)Something that Howard does excruciatingly well here is not spoon-feeding the story to his audience. The plot isn't simple, even though the ""Fight Club-esque"" reveal of ""multiple personalities"" is somewhat predictable; if you know much about the film. It definitely isn't a tidy film presented in a gift-wrapped box. There are a few short scenes that make you just a bit queasy to help you understand more fully just how emotionally and physiologically painful Nash's condition was on himself and those around him. It is necessary in my opinion.There is a bit of cheese, in the form of a special pen gifting scene directed towards Nash, representing the level of respect that he had gained over the years, again, despite his medical condition. To explain the symbolism of these ""pens,"" one should simply watch the film to understand. Very shortly afterwards, Nash gives his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. As he gazes out into the audience, he says, ""I have made the most important discovery of my career – the most important discovery of my life. It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reasons can be found. I am only here tonight because of you"" His eyes fixate on Alicia, as he toys with a pocket square in his coat; a nod to an earlier moment in the film.These moments are excusably cheesy, and serve to fully send home the idea that if it was not for the persistence of Nash to push through his disease in his fashion, and if it was not for Alicia's complete devotion to him as a wife, he likely would have driven himself mad and lived in an asylum for the remainder of his life. Fortunately, this is not the case, and in light of his random outbursts at home and on-campus at Princeton, he is able to live out a strange, yet somewhat regular life.We feel only the utmost sympathy for John and Alicia, and by pushing against all odds, they find victory. We love these stories, don't we? The academy loved it enough to present it with four Oscars, including Best Picture. Isn't that nifty?The only blotch I found on this wonderful tale is the true story of John Nash. In real life, he didn't actually begin experiencing hallucinations until after his marriage with Alicia. He also had a child with a previous girlfriend, and Alicia eventually divorced him and married someone else. They remained very close friends however, and she provided him a place to stay, and helped him through his disorder. A few Hollywood modifications, to be sure, but its always a little sad when the movies are prettier than real life, isn't it?A humbling response is knowing that Nash was, and still is an astonishingly brilliant man. He still keeps office hours at Princeton, and he still walks to school everyday. An impossibly smart and beautiful mind.",A Beautiful Mind
483,redshoesfall,Typical Hollywood. (1st paragraph is spoiler free),3,25 July 2017,"This film was something I legitimately tried to like. Really. Going into it, I had average expectations, hearing the hyper over it over the years, and I've always had a tangible interest in conditions such as schizophrenia. Though the movie does do some things that I like, the things that I find wrong are all the more troubling, to the point where I never want to watch it ever again.So, here are the things I liked, at least at first:Russel Crowe's performance: believable. He did his job and did it well. I also enjoyed Ed Harris and Paul Bettany's performances.(SPOILER) - Subtlety. At least, when it comes to the schizophrenia aspect... in the middle of the movie. I think the subject was handled okay, up until the end when it began to feel a little forced (although I would honestly need to comb through that again, of which I am not interested in doing). There's one part in which a desk ends up being thrown out the window. In the next shot(s), something happens in the background that hints to the instability of the protagonist's perspective, that you later understand as the viewer.These are the things that bugged the hell out of me:This is a sappy and contrived Hollywood picture, that instead of bringing issues that catalyzes honesty emotion, the events set in motion feel false, redundant, and overdramatic. I perfectly understand the weight of some of the situations (or the plot as a whole), but at the same time it felt like the movie didn't take the subject itself seriously and was following a paradigm to try and be ""one of those good movies.""The mother effing romance. It was the most lackluster, flaky, force-fed, quickie-style romance I've seen in a movie this hyped. It felt artificial, it had no foundation or groundedness to it, nor chemistry, and worst of all, it was based on a real relationship that turned out much differently than what was shown in the film, and I feel is incredibly misleading and even PROPAGANDIC towards the whole relationship, which I feel is a disservice to the audience. It probably pisses me off more than most, but the romance in the film is so annoyingly recycled from every single film made in Hollywood. It was eye-rolling, and I simply can't stand it. In actuality, John Nash had an illegitimate son and had actually divorced from his wife and got back with her many years later. Why not include that? It simply didn't feel like it came from nonfiction source material. It felt like the oily, perverted hands of Hollywood.The material it was based on. This felt like fiction - ""based on true events"" is correct, but I feel like these aren't real people, life doesn't go exactly this way. This is based on a certain reality - not the reality in which it's ADMITTEDLY AND PURPOSEFULLY based upon, which makes it worse when a film like this turns out to be so run of the mill. If the tone and details are going to be changed, why not make it a completely DIFFERENT story altogether? What if this film wasn't based on a REAL MAN and his LIFE? The sins of this film would be much more forgivable, I think. But it's not. It's about ""John Nash"" and his ""life.""Ultamitely, I would advise not to take the events of the film incredibly seriously, and judge by your own discretion if you have any interest in it.",A Beautiful Mind

None of these. What I keep wondering about is how Alicia, a young math student at Princeton in the1950s, had the savvy to wear a strapless black evening dress on her very first date, which turns out to be a black-tie Princeton do.  If there were an Oscar for most valiant performance under hostile conditions, then Jennifer Connelly, who plays Alicia -- and who, incidentally, looks great in the strapless black -- would surely win.  Ms. Connelly bares up under awkward editing and awful dialog, as when she, now Mrs. Nash, tells him and us that love and faith will cure him of his schizophrenia.  In the New Testament, perhaps; in Hollywood, by all means. All that's missing is a new-age crystal. Dodging a story about ordinary humans, director Ron Howard has chosen to chronicle genius, but the product is the same old inflated confection: a romantic night sky in New Jersey that holds  more stars than any Arizona desert; a ghastly Nobel prize award ceremony; and worst of all, the progress to that prize based on one academic paper, scribbling math formulas on window panes, and a lot of frenzied magazine clipping.

I've known a lot of schizophrenics in my years as a physician, and none of them had visual hallucinations- such visions are very rare. Almost all of them had paranoid delusions of conspiracies against them, and almost all heard voices, which is what Nash experienced. Usually the voices are condemnatory and frightening. It's hard to show that visually, so the screenwriters make up completely bogus ""symptoms"" that are a false depiction of what schizophrenics actually suffer.

491,david_bixby,Best Picture?,6,27 June 2002,"When was the last time that you saw a Best Picture award winner that you really thought deserved the title?My guess is that you will not be impressed with this latest recipient.Before watching a Beautiful Mind, I read all the press about how the movie was not an accurate portrayal of the life of John Nash; that it left out several important but ""inconvenient"" or ""unattractive"" facts.  I told myself that I would put all that aside, however, and try to see the movie as simply a good story.So much for that approach.I found this movie to be pretty boring and unfulfilling.  They spend very little time on character development and even if you haven't read about the parts of Nash's story that were left out of the movie, it still feels like something is missing.Nash is supposed to be some kind of unrivaled genius, but aside from watching Russell Crowe stare at many terribly complicated equations (no doubt written onto library windows and chalk boards by graduate students who happened by the set during filming) we get very little sense of what it was that this guy did that was so earth shattering.If they had bothered to go more into Nash's game theory work, the movie could have been a lot more impressive and interesting.  As it is, we are left to take on faith that Nash's theories about maximizing his and his friends chances of getting laid must have been Nobel caliber stuff.Furthermore, there is no explanation at all about what on earth it is about Nash (a confirmed misanthrope) that could possibly make his wife fall in love with him, much less spend her entire life as the care-taker of the nuthouse that is Nash's life.  Note: had they felt inclined to include the fact that Nash and his wife were separated for a while, it might make the picture a little more believable.Maybe she knew that she would win Best Supporting Actress if she stuck around long enough.Once again, I am disappointed in the Academy's Best Picture selection.",A Beautiful Mind

Seeing what is really not there and cannot tell between the real and fake, can be a frightening experience. Living in a world were all your work is a lie, can scare you. Living in a world were no one beleives you, can scare you. A Beautiful Mind was indeed Beautiful, it showed a man's love and desire to lead a life with his wife and to do what he is great at. Seeing numbers in everything, is amazing. But ignorning things that taunt you, is miraculos. It is hard and makes me understand, what the disease really is. A genius, cursed with a heavy load.

495,slinky-8,Typical Hollywood fare glamourizing life -- 6.5/10,3,6 July 2002,"Once again, Hollywood comes out with a film that strains the limits of credibility in order to make the viewer the happy man who walks out of the theatre feeling that love conquers all. This film is highly overrated although not altogether unsatisfying.Unfortunately, right from the very beginning, I didn't believe much of the script that later had the rug pulled out of it in ""Shylamanian"" style. Some of the surprises were telecast right from the beginning and made for somewhat awkward scenes. Crowe's Virginia accent changes considerably over the film and the image of his buff physique should not have been shown, which in my mind made him the furthest thing from resembling a mathematician. But I'm whining here... let's get to why this film is truly overrated although not unwatchable.The script was incredibly poor. A love story develops with almost no perceptible verbal chemistry on screen. Usually characters have to interact and the character and audience needs to be won over, not just by sensuality and a clever line or two. There is little explanation as to WHY Nash's wife saw something in him more than most who supposedly didn't like him at all (although everyone seemed to enjoy his company at Princeton too, except for one or two tough scenes -- odd.) Neither did I feel the viewer get the sense that the math genius could do the impossible in the manner he does -- look at a roomful of numbers, no pencil, no calculations, nothing -- and simply breaks codes with the aid of some cheesy Hollywood special effects ""mesmerizing"" your mind. Please, this more resembled Superman than it did a genius mathematician. It asks you, the viewer, to connect the dots you know you have to make since the script doesn't do it for you at all.Unfortunately, the movie continues to strain credibility, especially the family troubles. The lack of other characters assisting in that difficult situation was odd, unexplained (where are their parents), and made me wonder just how much fantasy this movie was based. Apparently, the words ""based on a true story"" is an understatement as Nash's true story doesn't quite resemble this glorified, Hollywood heart candy. I didn't get much sense of struggle -- the problems encountered were simply passed over quickly. Everyone sticks around to help Dr. Nash, to ends that just were simply not the manner in which people act.Is the movie altogether bad? No. In fact, there is quite a bit that is very good with the movie, such as excellent performance by Russell Crowe and an equally good and sultry performance by Jennifer Connelly, who does the best she can with a mediocre script. This is a good rental but don't go in expecting to be blown away with it's overhyped rating. It's your typical Hollywood fare that glamorizes and airbrushes the lives of people who should have faced serious adversity for fear that you might not want to go to the movies if you don't come out feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. In an era of incredibly weak film-making efforts, this film rises to the top of a mediocre heap.",A Beautiful Mind

The twists and turns of doing so make a very eerie pattern of madness where one can't distinguish between what's real and what's not. Yet, there is real feeling for the character who, despite mental illness, went on to win international recognization. It was very hopeful in the end.

""The Sixth Sense"", ""Fight Club"", ""The Others"" and ""Vanilla Sky"". All have been made in recent years, all use the same devices, and all used them much better than ""A Beautiful Mind"".  I'm getting tired of it as it nears creating it's own genre of ""Suprise"" filmmaking.Ron Howard does an excellent job directing as usual and the acting was good, as expected... not wonderful or perfect.  I suggest you see ""Rain Man"", ""Sling Blade"" or ""Regarding Henry"" if you fancy a brilliant actor playing the role of a handicap.The thing I didn't enjoy was that this movie never really decided what kind of film it wanted to be.  You begin to attach yourself to Nash and then suddenly his wife takes over as the object of the movie.. and she shouldn't be.  It's like Nash wants it to be an ""October Sky"" about discovery and merit and then this wife wants it to be a bad romance novel about love.  I adore a good love story, don't get me wrong, but this movie wasn't a love story, nor was it about overcoming one's odds.. it was a horrible incomplete attempt at homogenizing these things.  Especially with the ending scene at the Nobel Prize ceremony where he turned his acceptance speech into an I LUV U, when I got that awful ""Mr Holland's Opus"" feeling in the pit of my stomach.  Blech.Worth seeing once. **",A Beautiful Mind
501,hermanoszenit,What even,6,28 December 2020,"This movie is so predictable, which makes it very boring. It drags on for way too long after it's finally revealed that he had schizophrenia (emphasis on finally) it still goes on... for some reason? I didn't know this was based on real life for a sec which made it even more confusing, but that's 50% the movies fault 50% mine. If I hadn't realized, i would've only found out at the very end. The coloring was so bad it hurt it went from yellow to green to pink, which hurt my eyes. But I did like some of the movie like the dialogue and the overall performance, the boring factor of it blocked the fact that it's a very beautifully shot movie which makes me mad.",A Beautiful Mind

504,sherineyousery,Very confusing movie ..,7,25 March 2014,"Confused between having to give it a very low rating or a very high one and with hundreds of reviews written before mine, I still want to make a few points. Maybe it would help out someone:1- Biographically: I've read that the real John Nash had an entirely different story. Please tell me would you take the history and life of a man and change it entirely, deceiving a lot of people and mutilating history to make a movie ?! Couldn't you change the names and say that it was ""inspired"" bu a true story ?! Was it that hard or was it not at appealing and interesting ?! So I agree with everyone out here bashing out this movie for being that inaccurate and deceiving.2- Regarding the fictional love story: it was a little real. When you love someone with all your heart and senses, Hollywood -in a lot of other movies- would be selling you lies. The reality is that even the most romantic couples with the most beautiful love stories ever suffer a lot, fight but stick around. So, it was to some degree realistic. 3- Regarding the mental illness:Some people here say it was very unrealistic and a fairy tale. Those people didn't pay enough attention to a lot of details in the movie like the baby who would drown or the people making fun of the professor. So I disagree, it showed much truth, although not in every aspect. There's a very important aspect that was very disrespected in the movie: the Psychiatrist's image and the medications, which I overlooked because that might be the case with some of the patients who weren't taught how medications would help or have had experiences with bad psychiatrists.A point I found ridiculous and offensive to a great extent, however, was how mental illnesses were portrayed as if a patient with some strong will would overcome them without hospitalization, psychiatric help or medication, just his ""heart"" as pointed by the wife in the movie. This was utterly stupid, this is a disease who sick people should be taught how to cope with, or in other words, a state of mind that you have to learn to live with. However, there's a very important aspect clarified here: disorders are not things you have to get rid of or cure, rather than states of mind or in other words, chronic cases, medication should help in some cases, therapy would help greatly too in a lot of cases, and you have to cope with it. Pain makes the most beautiful and the wisest people as I have seen in my life, especially mental and psychological pain, and if the patient/individual knew how to learn from it. 4- Technical Details: The acting was marvelous and the soundtrack stood out. The direction overall could have been a little better and of course, the writing is really criticized for all the deception.Overall, a movie recommended and shows a lot of reality for some people, but is a sorrow to see it transform true people's stories into fabrications.",A Beautiful Mind
505,carmenneverxx,Hollywood Fantasy,5,7 June 2021,"Mediocre movie at best. It was so simplistic and full of clichés I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. Lacked the nuance. Maybe it's just targeted towards younger audience, I'm not sure, but I was obliged to watch it for psychology class and I don't even think it's an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia. Maybe it's because I knew what it's supposed to be about and therefore the movie was badly predictable. The romance came out of nowhere and Alicia was just a painfully stereotypical female love interest with no real substance. All of the science stuff was comical in it's simplicity. The ending dragged for a very long time and it was very sweet which I like but it didn't feel earned.",A Beautiful Mind
506,Tom-91,Brilliance on Brilliance,10,11 July 2004,"<Potential spoilers>While this film has all of the elements of a great film (Russell Crowe's best work...far superior to his role in ""Gladiator, which was also a great role), and some hauntingly beautiful music, I think what impressed me most was how Ron Howard chose to portray the genius of John Nash.Most of what I have read about geniuses, whether they be in art, music, math, or science, is that they possess the ability to see patterns where others cannot see them. Throughout the film, John can be seen looking at a glass or strings of numbers, and then we see some of them highlighted to show that John sees these patterns, where no one else sees them. I found it a simple yet unique way to show how this complex thought process works. In a sense, we get to see through the eyes of a genius.If you are intrigued as to how the mind operates, and you are looking for a film that does not have two-dimensional characters, this has to be a film on your short list of ""instant classics"". It is a beautifully crafted piece of art.",A Beautiful Mind
507,brodie6,"Beautiful mind, not beautiful movie",4,13 March 2002,"I must admit that this review is somewhat unfair in that I only lasted for an hour before I had to leave. It was that bad. It was a very disappointing film. It was corny, overacted, and predictable. The premise of the movie intrigued me, as did seeing Crowe in such a divergent role from that of the character he played in Gladiator. In the movie he has this ability with numbers and uses mostly facial contortions to portray to us the fact that he is using his ability. Well as I watched this I thought `how could they possibly be talking Oscar for this guy' His acting was so painfully bad.In one shot be bangs his head on the window (he acts like he just took a bullet to the groin) and it produces a spider crack in the glass. Well, he bled like a stuck pig, with a gash on his head O.J. would have been proud of. His roommate rushes over and gushes over him like Crowe was his love interest. Sickening. Then, in the very next scene not so much as a scratch on Crows head. Oscar? Smoshker. This movie was well received by many others who reviewed it on this web site. I can only imagine that most of them are women who are infatuated with him, and would give two thumbs up if he played in say `The return of Pee Wee'. The acting from not only him but also most of his costars is so contrite and overacted it leaves one actually in shock as to how bad the movie is. The one bright spot as far as I could tell was Judd Hirsch. Who played a professor. Do your self a favor and wait till this stinker comes out on video and borrow it from the library.",A Beautiful Mind

509,Mr. Bennett,A Beautiful Man,10,12 May 2003,"OK,let me start by saying that I hate Russell Crowe. Always have. I didn't like his attitude, that whole 'macho' thing..not to mention his acting in 'gladiator'. Overestimated, but that is not the issue here. I had seen the trailer and thought that it could actually be a nice movie.To be honest, mrs. Connelly was the one that attracted me because I think she is a fine actress. Anyway, I rent it the other day and couldn't wait to watch it.So I did. And I liked it. OK, I liked it a lot. First of all I was drawn by the photography and the costumes.. There was nothing that could reveal that what you are watching was made in the 21st century! I liked the fact that for one second it had you! You believed that Nash was telling the truth, that he was indeed the victim. And finally, even though it hurts to admit, I liked Crowe, there, I said it. His acting was absolutely shocking! You could read intelligence and madness all over him. His face, his body, his speech, his movement, the way he smiled while he was scratching his forehead.. I was watching speechless. I couldnt not believe how talented he can be.
Overall this is a great movie. What I got from it is that if you're talented, the world will know. Nothing can hide the brilliance of your mind. Not even your mind itself...",A Beautiful Mind
510,Nuno_Reis,Nothing beautiful to see,6,12 April 2002,"Honestly I can't understand what the Academy saw of so special in this movie and in it's director, personally I think that it shouldn't even be on the nominees for the statuette.The only detail I really liked in the script was when he realizes that he really has a problem because of the LITTLE girl, but anyway that isn't enough to make a good movie, there are bad (but really bad) films with better stories and the only part that could save it from mediocrity is the totally predictable scene of pen offering to the great minds.Well, I hope the next movie from Ron Howard to be better than this because worse it's very hard!",A Beautiful Mind
511,Dario_Gino,Excellent Hollywood-ized version of the man and his madness,6,27 September 2008,"This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well. Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia. In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, ""A Brilliant Madness"" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more ""real"" than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that. Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe. I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination). The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes. Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it ""pizza pie."" There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today. New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc. Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married. Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments.",A Beautiful Mind

I saw on the trivia section attached to this film that tom cruise was set to play nash.Im truly glad he didn't. Russell Crowe inhibits nash with every fibre  of his being, for a while there you forget its him. Tom cruise had never done that for me. But the biggest suprise was Jennifer Connely's performance as Alicia nash that stood out from the crowd, Im happy that after toiling away in bad movies for so long she is finally getting matirial that showcases her natural talent.I loved this film and recommend it to anyone, young, old... its just a great experience.***** (5 stars)",A Beautiful Mind

Then it altered and without spoiling anything, I will have to say that the turn in the film turned my interest and made me more aware of the situation.The acting of Russell Crowe is flawless and for me it made the film what it is.

521,uckpshh,The best works of both Howard and Crowe.,10,29 July 2006,"If there ever was a Ron Howard movie to justify the director's critical acclaim, it is this movie. ""A Beautiful Mind"" works on every level. The movie combines strong acting, screen writing, and direction to make not only an entertaining experience, but a very involving one.Russel Crowe is amazing in a roll which, in my opinion, eclipses his Oscar winning roll in ""Gladiator"". John Nash is given so much depth, and the character is developed so well that by the time all is revealed, even you want to believe what he believes. The beautiful Jennifer Connelly is also worth a mention in this Oscar winning performance.Also worth noting is the strong supporting cast, which includes the terribly underused and underrated Ed Harris, as well as the rising Paul Bettany.Although this movie has a lot to offer, it does suffer from a few inconsistencies in that it's not always sure what it wants to be. This movie could at first be perceived as a character study, but at times it wants to be a thriller, and at other times a suspense drama. If you can look past these drawbacks (if you can really go as far as to call them that), there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this movie.Overall, this is a movie absolutely worth seeing, and it would rank highly on a list of my favourite movies.",A Beautiful Mind
522,Ross16,Beautiful Movie,9,24 September 2008,"The movie is not a very accurate biography of Nash's life. Nash's life was very painful according to the book. The movie only touches the outskirts of the pain his schizophrenia caused. The biggest problem of the movie is that Crowe portrays Nash probably far more likable than Nash actually was durng his illness. Crowe has a charisma that the real Nash probably does not have. The movie is a Hollywood movie. It is glitzy and stylish. However, I think Howard has done an admirable job in storytelling. Crowe portrayed Nash well. Nash was althletic looking and handsome when he was younger. Howard had synthesize the whole story in a couple hours and I think he told the story in a very powerful way. Schizophrenics are delusional partly because their view of the universe makes them the center of the universe. Their role in their universe is very important to them. The movie also reveals the torment of the treatment and the drugs they used back then to treat schizophrenia. Connelly was beautiful and very convincing as the wife. I enjoyed the movie immensely.

526,msteedle,"Very good, but not great",6,31 January 2002,"I have to admit that this movie was very good, although I don't think it is as great as the rest of the world, apparently.  Nash's sickness was exploited for dramatic purposes (in actuality, he might think he is seeing someone, but would not actually think he is rubbing a little girl's hair or kissing her forehead in thin air).  The directing was adequate, but utilitarian.  I wonder if most people know what a director actually does, or if they just lump the categories of best movie and best director together. Ron, I think we have seen enough of the shot with the camera revolving around Cameron Crowe's head by the third time you used it.  The acting was great all around.  The script was also good, but included only selected parts of Nash's life - only those that make him seem like a wonderful man. The writers chose to leave the parts of his real life out like when he got divorced, had illegitimate children, etc.  I guess that would have negated the ending (spoiler?)  This movie was pretty good - a 7 or 8 out of 10 - but I just don't like watching somebody's tragic life embellished for entertainment purposes.",A Beautiful Mind

As John Nash mumbles through complex math theories, the entire audience is just spellbound. I am quite sure most of us don't have a clue as to what he was saying, it didn't matter. Being said by Russell Crowe is enough for us to know it matters. Very few actors have ever been able to do that, Brando comes to mind. The pleasant surprise from the movie was the script itself. I have heard the buzz for Crowe, and for Connelly...both deservedly so. But, I have not heard much about the power and humor of the script. Akiva Goldsman did a great job, as adapting books is hopefully becoming a specialty (Sum of All Fears is next). The Oscar buzz is not just hype, this is a serious contender for Crowe, Connelly, picture, adapted screenplay, and possibly director, although our buddy Ron is up against some tough customers this year.",A Beautiful Mind
528,cericsso,Simply put: Beautiful,10,3 March 2002,"I wasn't actually planning on going to see ""A Beautiful Mind"" in the first place, but as it was, I was convinced by the friend that accompanied me that it was truly something to see. And now, after seeing it, I thank her for that. Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland, I found myself pulled into another kind of story, a powerful, emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.""A Beautiful Mind"", based on the novel by Sylvia Nasar, is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr., the genius mathematician, whose life suddenly takes a turn for the worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After fierce battles with his inner self, he overcomes this and returns to win the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his brakethrough game theory in economics that he had been working on during his years in Princeton University in the 1950s.John Nash, portrayed very well by the versatile and brilliant Russell Crowe, is a partly shy, yet ironic and sometimes even arrogant, gifted young student studying in Princeton University in the late 1940s. He dedicates his time to numbers and equations, set on to solving every problem at hand, rather than mingling with co-students on the football field or in the pub.Nash is later on introduced to Sylvia (played by the lovely Jennifer Connely), a physics student attending his classes. She helps Nash to open up and eventually discover love.Enter William Parcher (played by Ed Harris), a shadowy and mysterious agent working for the Department of Defense. Parcher, after realizing Nash's ability to see mathematical and geometrical patterns everywhere, approaches Nash with a mission that involves national security.Now, amidst his work and relationship, Nash is suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of emotions and disbeliefs as he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. And this is the part where ""A Beautiful Mind"" truly shines: in portraying the disorder from Nash's own point of view. In a powerful and emotional way, it shows the viewer how difficult an illness like this can be to not only face, but overcome, something that people today may not always realize.Before seeing this movie, I must admit that I was a bit afraid that casting such a well-known actor as Russell Crowe as the main character would ruin the image of John Nash, forcing the viewer to see Crowe, rather than Nash. This is a common problem when dealing with famous actors, but to my surprise, it didn't much bother me much. And the same goes for Ed Harris.As a movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is absolutely great (It is so much more, but I cannot find the words to praise it enough, so I will simply go with ""great"" =). Not only does it have a strong point and an importaint message to the viewer, but it delivers it in a touching and sensitive, partly even humourous kind of way, with the help of powerful actors, a great screenplay and even a few special effects to boost it up. So for anyone whose grown tired of the consant pointless action-movies out there, and instead want to immerse themselves into a character-driven story that might actually bring a tear to your eyes, I sincerily recommend ""A Beautiful Mind"".",A Beautiful Mind

To his credit, Crowe does pull off avery complicated character -- but just barely. John Nash is U.S.born and bred and never really strayed far from his W. Virginiaroots. So why did the filmmakers find it necessary to cast anAustralian lead? Yer guess is as g'das mine, mate. Granted,Russell Crowe was awesome as the soft-spoken detective in L.A.Confidential (keyword 'soft-spoken') and as the outspoken Romanwarrior in Gladiator, but as a complex leading man from a veryprovincial area of the U.S., Crowe misses the mark at times. Atone point, I thought I was hearing Crocodile Dundee speaking at aPrinceton checker match. Where was Kevin Spacey when theproducers were casting Beautiful Mind? Kevin Kline? Or even GuyPearce -- who also is Australian but can affect a flawless U.S.accent (ala Memento)?

Crowe is phenomenal - once again proving the playboy from Australia can be the coveted chameleon of the camera.  In this picture, Crowe is an awkward jerk who blossoms into a multi-faceted man of courage and inward strength.  How Ron Howard develops this plot is at once a mock of convention and an invention of beauty.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  The world needs more films like this one.

533,psoftinfo,My Second Favourite Movie of All Time,10,25 May 2004,"First off, let me get past commenting on those who derided the fact that the movie played fast and loose with the facts -- that it wasn't a documentary. Pfui!  It wasn't presented as such.  Okay, that's that.*** SPOILERS ALERT *** (Stop reading now if you haven't seen the film)I had a rough idea of the plot:  a brilliant mathematician is brought down by schizophrenia.  This had a special meaning to me, because I once heard a presentation by a man (let's call him Fred) who conquered his schizophrenia using the power of logic.  Doctors told him it was impossible, and this is precisely what Doctor Rosen tells Nash.  They may be right in most cases ... but not always.  Nash did it, and so did Fred.Yet I didn't truly understand Fred's accomplishment until I was slapped in the face by this movie.  When Doctor Rosen reflects on what it's like to find out that people you know never even existed, I was struck hard by the brutality of the notion.  From that point onwards in the film, I kept wondering, ""What if you had to doubt absolutely everything?""I was intrigued by the way that we're given hints that certain elements are delusion.  My first big clue was the digital readout embedded in Nash's arm. It was an huge anachronism on the heels of some other less stark anachronisms.  From that point onwards, I started wondering if Parcher was real, but I couldn't see how that was possible.  And because  I couldn't resolve the matter in a tidy way, I obtained a faint inkling of what Nash's affliction was like.One scene that hit me hard was when Nash passes Charles' little girl on the steps after telling her he couldn't talk to her again.  She holds open her arms for a hug, and he has to keep going.  In that moment, I saw how tempting it could be to slide into the delusion.  He also has to turn his back on the ideal buddy, and his Duty To Save The World!I could go on and on, but I've only got 1000 characters.  I expect you're wondering if I'll mention what my FIRST favourite movie is.  It is ""Talk Radio"".",A Beautiful Mind

535,mathewshires,Inspirational,9,8 March 2002,"This really is a great film, a supremely intelligent and well-made picture that deserves to make a mint and possibly scoop the top Oscars.I didn't think that Ron Howard was capable of a mature and clever film like this one as much of his work to date has been pretty light-eg The Grinch, Parenthood, EdTV etc. He had a go at 'serious' cinema with Apollo 13 in 1995, but I felt that the popularity of Tom Hanks and the naturally dramatic nature of the Apollo story carried it to its box office and critical heights.That said, A Beautiful Mind is full-on clever and mannered film-making. Howard is totally on top of his game. His craftmanship and care subtly drives every scene. The film is not cluttered or over-complex, nor is it preachy or patronising while tackling its quite difficult subjects-schizophrenia, the nature of misunderstood genius, the Cold War etc. Russell Crowe is a God in this film, its his best work to date. He doesn't overdo John Nash's mannerisms or accent, he BECOMES Nash, dominating the movie with an endearing mix of honesty, comic understatement and heartwarming naievety. Jennifer Connelly is sexy and smart as Nash's wife, too. Ed Harris is wonderful as usual. All in all, a brilliant film. 9/10.",A Beautiful Mind

The film does not set out to explain modern theories ofeconomics and quantum physics ( again, find an Idiot's Guide! ). Ihave personal experience of mental illness, and the great worth ofthe film is its focus on the nightmarish experience ofschizophrenia, and the general lack of understanding about it,even in the 21st century; it has more impact as well by showinghow such an illness can possibly destroy the mind of a genius.  Ofcourse in addition how it could wreck one's family, relationshipsand career. The film is generally empathetic about how his wifeand close friends stick by him, which is so important, no matterhow scary things can get, and also shows the importance of usingavailable drug therapy. It also demonstrates the ability of thesufferer of this illness to overcome it to the degree of being able tolive a successful life, by acknowledging the illness ( a physicalillness which attacks the brain...I do not like the term mentalillness ), and striving to fight those thoughts and images that youknow are irrational, even though they can be so real. In the film theimaginary characters are more real to the viewers of the film thanthey are to those not close to Nash; thus trying to demonstrate tous the absolute reality of these figures in the mind of the afflictedperson. Throughout his life these ""imaginary"" characters werealways real, he just chose not to acknowledge them or speak tothem; he had the advantage of being supremely intelligent andunderstanding his disease; and in his final speech he acknowledges mathematics, quantum theory, and his own imagination as part of his make up; he embraces them; they arepart of who is John Nash, thus raising the ever stimulatingquestion of what reality actually is.",A Beautiful Mind

The ""beautiful mind"" part was never really explored because this man is/was a mathematician and his formulas nobody in the audience would ever understand! So Ron Howard decides to put the focus of the story squarely on our protagonist and his mental demise and subsequent rise again. But it's just not that interesting. Sorry. I was bored by the time the credits came up. Russell Crowe is a fine actor but the story was limp and I was bored. Some movie fans are such suckers when it comes to displays of intense emotion.

However, the story of John Nash itself simply isn't all that interesting and one gets the impression that Hollywood is trying too hard to make a story out of nothing.  I mean Nash's mental conditions was heavily emphasized throughout the film that it came across more on a movie about mental disorders.  I wished the film devoted more time emphasizing Nash's contributions to mathematics and why his contributions were important.  At the very end you do hear a bit about that but that was much too late after 2 hrs worth of riding through Nash's mental problems.  This movie had chances to become really good, but instead of going deeper into explaining in layman's terms the contributions of Nash, so we can appreciate his ""beautiful mind"", we get carried away into Nash's nightmares and drowned for 2 hrs in Nash's mental state that could've been explained in 15 minutes.

So I felt like this one played a dirty trick on me.  I wonder ifanyone figured out that Charles wasn't real before Rosen said hewasn't.  In the beginning, everything about Charles is perfectlyplausible and consistent.  The second time I watched, I lookedcarefully for any hints that he wasn't real.  The first thing I could findwas that he overheard Nash's remark about fluid exchange, eventhough Nash spoke too quietly for anyone to overhear.  By that timeCharles' reality was too well established.  I can understand Nash seeing and hearing Charles even thoughCharles isn't there.  I find it hard to understand that Nash couldsee Charles turn off the record player, failing to notice that he hadreally turned it off himself.  I see this as deliberate deception of theaudience.  (Notice that after Nash's hospitalization, there are nomore examples of the imaginary characters manipulating realobjects.)Perhaps Nash's brilliance is reflected by the fact that in the earlystages, he could create a completely consistent and plausibledelusion.  In contrast, after his hospitalization he claimed thatCharles had a cloaking device.

Jennifer Connelly was shockingly good. Before seeing this film, I did not think she could display such a wide range. And in all the stages of her character, I think its impossible not to empathize with her.
It's hard to comment on the subject matter without revealing the entire plot, but Hollywood needs a name for this genre. There are many recent films that feature main characters with this ""problem."" I do think the handling of the mathematics is well-done, but not shown enough.

557,ikalafatis,How to waste the potential of a powerful storyline,5,8 March 2002,"The strongest trump card of the Beautiful Mind is its storyline. So much more could have been achieved by so much less, if only the story had been allowed to unfold without the need to mislead or dazzle the audience with special effects and directorial coups. An enjoyable, if schizophrenic film (excuse the pun).This is the classic nevertheless compelling sociopathic-genius-turned-schizophrenic story. The magnitude of the Nobel prize and thus the deduced importance of the genius's work serves to augment and hold the audience. We all secretly admire and even envy the truly dedicated and gifted people, so our attention is guaranteed from the start.This attention is wasted firstly by a script that at times focuses on non-story-serving scenes (several Princeton-based ones spring to mind, as well as the GO circular scene, what a pretense..) that dilutes the pace of the film and needlessly prolongs its length, presumably to adhere to the latest ""more is better"" Hollywood fad.Mr Howard overstates. There is a distinct desire to dress up the story with effects, to tease or mislead the audience with a view to thrill, to fit in every trick of the trade. Understandably, since having an Academy Award story potential, one goes for the big ""8 Oscar"" prize.The net result is, unfortunately, a dilution of the story, and the attention of the audience on things that don't really matter.Mr Crowe is acceptable but not consistent. He is struggling, perhaps by directorial misinformation, to balance the character between idiocy and sociopathy, brilliance and simplicity. Even considering the evolution of the character, the inconsistency is apparent, especially when frantic head or hand gestures are used to denote stress and reality shocks. Definitely not an Oscar performance.Mr Harris is poignant and ghostly and in general positive, although a bit too cowboyish at times.Ms Connelly brings grace and beauty, but her character is not well defined to the point that it almost becomes a support role.Good if sparse humour, tasteful cinematography and a soundtrack that serves but does not dominate are some of the positive points of the film.A Beautiful Mind is a thriller, a biography, a venture into the unknown depths of the mind, a sociological study, everything and nothing at all.

562,Shade-9,Surprise by Jennifer Connelly,8,13 January 2002,"A fantastic film with fine performances by all its actors, A Beautiful Mind keeps you both entertained and amazed by both the intricacies of the plot and the stellar performances of its actors.Russell Crowe turns in a magnificent performance as John Nash, a mathematician with an amazing set of problems ( both in real life and mathematics ) that he is forced by circumstances to solve. 
While I am used to seeing stellar performances by Mr. Crowe, what I was amazed by was the absolutely stunning portrayal of Nash's wife by Jennifer Connelly.  While many have often stated that Ms. Connelly was talented beyond her previous screenwork, she proves that without doubt in this film. So often in the past Connelly has been used as a pair of breasts to be seen struggling against fabric or more often bared to titilate male viewers. Here, however, she shows for all time that her talents transcend the physical beauty she embodies.Jennifer Connelly is the anchor for this film and I truly hope we see more of this kind of work from her in the future.",A Beautiful Mind
563,Scritzy,"Whose life is it, anyway?",9,3 April 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is a beautiful movie. It is the story of the brilliant and tortured John Nash, mathematician and Nobel laureate, a man who wrestled with the demons of mental illness and came out on top.Or is it?If you read the book on which the movie was based - and be forewarned, it is NOT an easy read - you will find that the movie really had only the most tenuous connection with John Nash's life. He was brilliant. He was arrogant. He was mad. He married Alicia. And he won a Nobel prize.
Yet even after I read the book, and saw Nash himself interviewed (and heard him make discouraging comments that his schizophrenic son should employ more ""rational thinking""), I found that I still like the movie.
Maybe because I have wrestled with my own demons of mental illness (though mine are tame compared to Nash's), I found myself in sympathy with Nash's film self. I also felt for Alicia, as my spouse has had to go through some harrowing moments with me. Scenes in the hospital were a bit unnerving. Yet there a poignant hope surrounding the film, that those of us in the depths may find the light in the tunnel, and passage out of the darkness.Akiva Goldsman's script was both luminous and shadowy, probing the mind of genius and insanity with equal aplomb. Someone so complex as Nash could not have been brought to life by a poor writer. Sylvia Nasar's book is excellent; Goldsman's screenplay, though bearing only slight resemblance to the book, is excellent as well. The movie owes much to the screenplay's brilliance.Russell Crowe did a wonderful job as Nash, portraying the man on many levels. The one problem for me was his accent, or lack thereof. Only twice did he lapse into something faintly resembling a Southern accent. The rest of the time I kept hearing Richard Burton, particularly as George in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Crowe will be the perfect choice to play Burton's role in the remake.Jennifer Connelly was both strong and delicate as Alicia Nash. (It would have been nice if the film had at least hinted that Alicia is Hispanic.) Ed Harris rarely stumbles, and he was certainly in fine form as the hard-as-nails - and ultimately terrifying - William Parcher.  Judd Hirsch was unfortunately wasted in a throw-away part. Ulimately, however, it was the performance of Paul Bettany that made me go back to the theater a second time, and what will make me buy the video as soon as it is released. As the ""prodigal roommate"" Charles Herman, Bettany was a perfect foil and comic relief for Crowe's anguished Nash. The role of Charles may well have been the most difficult in the film, and Bettany did it proud. I was disappointed that the Academy Awards overlooked him.
Perhaps the film owes its heart and soul to its director, Ron Howard. I've never been a huge fan of Howard's pictures - though I did like ""Apollo 13"" (and ""Gung Ho"" had its moments: ""No more MTV! No more Twisted Sister!""). With ""A Beautiful Mind,"" Ron grows up. It's nice to see one of my contemporaries make good after many years of hard work. (You can always count on Ron to include his family in his pictures - Daddy Rance showed up in ""A Beautiful Mind"" as a mental patient, and Ron himself was a party guest.)While much of the pre-Oscar buzz going around was true - ""A Beautiful Mind"" does sugarcoat Nash's rather abrasive personality - the best thing to do is judge the film as a separate entity. Read the book for the life of John Nash. Watch ""A Beautiful Mind"" to see a beautiful movie.",A Beautiful Mind
564,kerridv,See it before you read too many reviews!,9,20 December 2001,"The best thing you can do for yourself before you see this movie is to stay away from all reviews! There is an element of surprise that is essential to this flick that the reviews are all giving away. If you haven't seen it yet, then don't read the rest of this. * * * * * *This is a biopic of celebrated math scholar and economics Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash, who suffered(here's the spoiler) from paranoid schrizophrenia. The film opens with his foray into school at Princeton, where is is already a social outcast, a quirky genius, and an excessive worrier of finding `that one orginial idea.' It is here he meets his best friend, roomate Charles (Paul Bettany), and his wife, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). He gets his idea, impresses the professors, lands a plum assignment at MIT, and marries Alicia. Life seems to be rolling along.Suddenly John finds himself in the middle of a plot to keep the Russians from obliterating America because he's an expert code-breaker. His life becomes a turmoil of secrecy and paranoia as he feverishly works to find conspiracies in magazines. When he fears danger, his paranoia gets out of hand, until Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) commits him to an institute and declares him crazy.Here's where the bulk of the film begins, and why it was important not to know whether he was crazy or not before seeing this. As you're watching this film, you're wondering, too, what is real and what is not. Is he really part of government work and is America in danger? Or are they delusions in his own mind? Not knowing anything about the film before I went it, it was exciting to watch; it is essential that the audience doesn't know what's real or what's made up because then you understand to some extent what John is going through. Had I read the synopses beforehand, I would have been robbed of this brillant cinematic trick.I don't know if the producers meant for that to happen, or didn't care if we were let in on the joke, but I do give them credit for not giving it away in the trailers. Jennifer Connelly gives an excellent performance as the backbone of the world crumbling around her; Ed Harris and Paul Brittany steal the show, and it doesn't hurt that Adam Goldberg is in it, either. Russell Crowe may see yet another Oscar nomination his way(though a particular gripe of mine is that how many math geniuses have the good looks or the physique of Russell Crowe? Hubba hubba). He does portray John with amazing emotion and wit throughout. I did find a few flaws with some of the scenes but it's Hollywood afterall. I thought it did a remarkable turn from your basic social-outcast-genius story to one of intrigue, excitement, and human spirit.",A Beautiful Mind

Russell Crowe was good, but it surely isn't his best performance (see The Insider, which is a better performance, better film). Obviously it was intended, but I felt that tricking the viewer into a spy/mystery flick and then pulling us into a mental disorder flick was disruptive. I also would have prefered the biography to be more accurate near the begining of the film. His character was a bit less likeable that the film portrays. Pehaps I am being too harsh on the flick, but perhaps others are just buying into the ""feel-good"" ""serious-drama"" hype. Oh well.",A Beautiful Mind

568,alexanderpetreski,Kudos for being laughable and dull at the same time,2,11 October 2021,"I've ner seen such a laughable biopic than this one. I remember watching this when I was very young, and I thought of it as an okay movie back then, but boy this movie didn't age well.The script by Akiva Goldsmith is atotal mess. Let's start with the first Hollywood cliché: so no matter how unlikeable and unrelatable our protagonist is, and don't worry he's going to be a dick to everyone, but as long as he's a genius (or the chosen one) every other character in this film will want to be friends with him. What Jennifer Connelly's character finds so intriguing about this guy, shall forever be a mystery. I hope the real John Nash wasn't this piece of work, because the scripts bends itself backwards to make him as unlikeable as possible but everybody is written to like him,
Meanwhile the movie never bothers to ""show"" what makes Nash a genius, it always ""tells"" through other characters. His theory is never properly explored or his genius, he's apparently good at breaking codes by looking at numbers. ALright, let's go into M Night territory.The movie makes a hard turn and changes the pace to hard drama, but the way Crowe is directed, sometimes borders on the edges of comedy. Seriously there's a scene where his wife tells him that the family might be more important than his work. Hard cut to Crowe neglectfully holding his baby in the kitchen with a catatonic look, that was definitely a comedy cut and it had me howling. The direction is what you expect from Ron Howard: bland, dull but gets the job done. The budget is the only thing that prevents it from being a b-movie. Even the soundtrack by James Horner is pushing way too much. It's one of those films that try to pander so hard for the Oscars that you need a shower afterwards.",A Beautiful Mind

It is through her that we begin to understand the range of problems and pittfalls Nash is facing, most of his own devising.

I, for one, did not know anything of his mental disorder when I first saw this movie.  I knew that he had one, but not what kind. So, I'm watching the movie and thinking, ""Ok, this is the story of a life of a man who worked for the government doing spy work and was always in constant danger.""  I was scared when the people who he thought were Russians finally caught them and of course I didn't believe them when they said that he was in a phsychiatric hospital, but the more that I put the pieces together, the more it made sense.  It was creepy in my mind when his wife goes back to where he left all those letters and unfathomable to me how a man can imagine everything that he saw and pass it off as true.  It must be a truly frightening life style to live not knowing what is real and what is imaginary.  Somehow, though, he overcame all these obstacles.  This is a great movie, but it loses one point because the part about the Nobel Prize at the end was unnecesary and I thought was just added in there to make it a feel good ending.

Look at it from that point of view and not a ""Big Brother view of John Forbes Nash"" and you'll see it as a well crafted feature.I've seen all too many movies where mental illness is put in a very camp way and over exaggureated (Think: Girl, Interrupted) but the way John's Schizophrenia was portrayed in this movie was realistic and heartfelt.

Compared to Shine - which shows you how well these things can be done, the images of insanity are dull, and the plotting is pedestrian at best.The inability of the director to face up to the limitations of Nash as a human being, the soppy ending and the cliched images of collegiate life let the movie down too - with a decent director, it could have been great.",A Beautiful Mind

581,Alex-506,"Overrated, standard fare.",5,24 March 2002,"Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind, which I just witnessed win Best Picture, is middle-brow, typical fare.  It is most definitely not Howard's best work (that would be Apollo 13, in my opinion).  While Jennifer Connelly gives an excellent performance, Russell Crowe has been a lot better.  Yet this is the kind of performance people often fall for, giving credit to the role's challenges than to the actual connection we have to the actor.  Yes, Crowe is techincally excellent (although his accent slides a little).  But is it a performance that inspires us or reflects ourselves?  I think not.  Crowe's performance was nowhere near the level of Tom Wilkinson in In The Bedroom.There are some pluses to the film: The aforementioned solid acting, a genuine attempt to put into cinematic terms the mind-boggling (pardon the pun) disease of schizophrenia (which someone in my own family suffers from). Although the film has been attacked by those who say that Nash's life hasn't been put into accurate context, my question is: who cares?  You don't seen biopics for hard facts unless you are a fool.  Just look at Nixon, Raging Bull, and others.  As long as the film itself is effective in portraying its character, that's all that matters.  A Beautiful Mind also contains some great moments.  My favourite is when Jennifer Connelly lets out one instant of frustration, smashing the glass in the bathroom.  It is so shocking and emerges from such quiet that the effect is quite profound.But the problems outweigh the strengths.  Some complaints:1.  The musical score is atrocious.  I can't believe it was nominated for an Oscar.  It is saccharine, violin-heavy, tearjerking and shameless.2.  The disease of schizophrenia is grossly simplified.  The fact that Crowe has these three characters who are so clearly obvious in what aspect of his psyche that they represent is a cheap trick.3.  The second half of the film becomes grossly repetitive.  We see Crowe walking, we see his POV of either Big Brother or his roommate or the little girl, and then he continues on in the face of his disease.  There were about SEVEN scenes like this.  I was growing bored...4.  There are too many Hollywood moments.  The little musical chord that strikes when we first see an aged Crowe and Connelly (Oh...how touching...they're still together after all of these years).  And worse is the episode with a beautiful woman that inspires Crowe to come up with his mathematic theory.5.  The mathematic theory isn't explained in nearly enough detail.  We are only told that Nash's work ""changed modern economics"".  Howard doesn't trust that the audience has the patience or the intelligence to be told how.6.  Back to the Hollywood moments.  I hate it in movies when we see something happen to a character in their twenties, and then this resonates while they are in their sixties.  We have just seen these things happen a few hours ago.  They happened a lifetime ago for the characters.  I know we remember some things forever, but A Beautiful Mind really stretched this effect.  Examples: the hankerchief that Alicia gives John, the phrase ""petrified, stupified, etc."" that John mocks his friend/adversary with when offered to play a game, and the full-circle effect of John receiving all the pens in that special room where he had once been snubbed.  (How touching...pass the hankerchief).  John may have been so deeply imprinted with rejection when he saw another man receiving the tribute, so it is possible that this would still have some resonance.  But the hankerchief is a typical Howardian Hollywood ploy.  And are we really supposed to believe that John remembers the exact order of words that he said to a man who offered to play a game with him FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AGO!!!!  Give me a break.I am not a cynic who doesn't like feel-good movies.  But the movies have to earn it, and A Beautiful Mind did not.  There are too many flaws in this picture to recommend it.  Rather, I would give it about a 60/100.  This continues a poor and long stretch of mistakes by the Academy in handing out the Best Picture (excluding Schindler's List and American Beauty).  Of the last TWELVE Best Picture winners, I have only really enjoyed four: the aforementioned Schindler's List and American Beauty (my two favourite films of all-time), Unforgiven and Forrest Gump.  Is something wrong with me?  Or is it the Academy?  Obviously, you know what I think.",A Beautiful Mind

584,Alcyryal,Definetly worth my time (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS),9,16 January 2003,"This film gives us a look into the mind of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician, and his endless battle with schizophrenia. Russel Crowe protrays John Nash with great detail, so well that I was able to believe that he was mentally ill. Director Ron Howard does an incredible job showing the frightening reality of this horrible disease by showing the audience what Nash was seeing. When the I learned the truth about what was going through Nash's mind, it shocked me, as it was designed to do. Ron Howard was also able to show one of the horrors of mental hospitals of old with the highly disturbing electroshock scene. It scared me to know that Nash had to endure this kind of torture(Which, by the way had no beneficial effects for the patient. It was used, in my opinion only for punishment).
Personally, I think that ""Lord of the Rings"" was the better film, and should've won best picture. But this film was deserving as well. I also have to say that I am frustrated with those that say the Academy pick the wrong movies to win Best Picture(""Forrest Gump"" over ""The Shawshank Redemption""). If the Academy likes a movie better than another, then by all means they have the right to pick that movie to win. So ""A Beautiful Mind"" comes out the victor in this battle for Best Picture. And it, like ""Lord of the Rings"" is a great film. Absolutely deserving for Best Picture. It is definetly worth watching.A BEAUTIFUL MIND: 9/10",A Beautiful Mind
585,DrMoonlight,Honest and touching.,8,9 January 2002,"I was a little skeptical when a friend recommended A Beautiful Mind to me.  My experience with Ron Howard's films has been less than delightful, and I was still angry at the dim-witted, wasteful Grinch released last year (especially when I learned that Dr. Seuss had refused every offer to let his stories be turned into live-action films). Thankfully, my friend's reccomendation was warranted, and I found this movie to be perhaps the most honest look at mental illness to come out of Hollywood in years.  I found this story especially touching because I recognized in Crowe's portrayal of Nash a strong resemblance to a very dear friend of mine, who posesses the same combination of psychotic tendencies and astronomical intelligence. Many film portrayals of mental illness show their characters essentially being cured of uncurable disorders.  Beautiful Mind shows a much bleaker reality.  Nash, like millions of others all over the world, can learn to adapt to some extent, but will live with his schizophrenia for the rest of his life.  As heartbreaking as Nash's story is, it is important to remember that among paranoid schizophrenics, he is relatively lucky to have companionship, employment, housing, and an intelligence that allows him to understand and fight his illness.  The vast majority of those with his disorder are homeless, friendless, and perpetually confused. But his fortune, for some reason, helps make him sympathetic to the audience, as  do a series of plot presentation devices which force the audience into his shoes in a way that very few movies have managed to do. Sadly, for all the strengths of this film (including an astonishing performance by Crowe), they are too often overshadowed by Howard's weaknesses as a director.  I was especially underwhelmed by his liberal use of Horner's mediocre soundtrack.  Many scenes would have been much stronger relying on the weight of the dialogue and the power of silence. The music was used in a way that was distracting and often made beautiful moments feel somehow manufactured and artificial. Beautiful Mind is, however, a beautiful film, and if you have someone in your life with a mental illness, you will find it particularly essential.  Even if you don't, this film is a powerful catalyst in helping us all understand",A Beautiful Mind
586,Eli_Cash,A Colossal Collapse of Faith and Integrity,3,14 June 2003,"Jon Nash's own marvelous, plagued, muddled and ultimately fascinating existence is one which may deserve cinematic portrayal.  _A Beautiful Mind_ is a pandering shameful corruption of a true story which should have been filled with compelling, complex, troubling characters.  Nash has been homogenized for the public gastro-intestinal tract and spewed forth by Crowe, a feat which is sure to be the nader of his acting career.  He is paradoxically terminally bland and oppressively obnoxious.  His wife's role played by Connelly is harmless and sincere I think, she is miscast (certainly not given the same depth as in _Requiem for a Dream_) and not to be blamed.  Harris has always performed better.I file this picture away with neighbors such as _The Rock_ and _Legally Blonde_, both shamelessly populist candy but, and this is the Grand Canyon of buts, both of these films are actually WATCHABLE.  On their own terms these two are probably better films for they are what they are, are exactly what they are supposed to be.  _A Beautiful Mind_ crumbles under its own stupendous pretensia, and is one colossal collapse of faith and integrity to be avoided if at all possible.",A Beautiful Mind
587,Conradical19,A beautiful film,9,17 April 2011,"What got me interested in this film was I was told it is about schizophrenia. I found it didn't spoil the plot for me though, in fact, it made it more enjoyable because I was easily manipulated. I was trying to understand throughout what it was that made the protagonist, John Nash (Crowe) schizophrenic. Then, when it gets to the point where it's made clearer, that's not the end of it! The rest of the film shows how he lives with the illness.This film starts off slow but it becomes a story of true love and determination. It answers the question, 'how do you get up from an all time low?' The ending almost brought a tear to my eye. One scene in particular is so tense, I nearly switched the film off! It just about made me shout aloud to the characters on screen. You will know what I'm on about when you see it. On the other hand, I do like Nash's chat-up lines. He's got more balls than me.The acting is flawless, especially from Russell Crowe. He is so different in this compared to his other films. His character in this is more vulnerable and fearful. The casting is very well done when showing the main characters growing old. I don't think they changed the actors either which is remarkable.As far as I know, this film is totally original and it's pretty realistic. Personally, I think it's far better than 'One flew over the Cuckoo's nest'. If you like this film, I recommend 'Shutter Island', the plot is unnerving but it has similar themes and it should manipulate you.That's the thing with this film though, it will be completely different watching it a 2nd time. I haven't watched it a 2nd time yet because I put most of the pieces together in my head afterwards. However, I'm sure it will still be an enjoyable film.",A Beautiful Mind
588,faded_Glory,Good in parts,7,22 February 2005,"I am in two minds about this one (sorry folks!). On the plus side, the way the movie depicts the mind of John Nash from his perspective is very good. I hadn't actually heard all that much about this film before I saw it, so I must be one of the few who didn't know for sure that Nash is indeed hallucinating until the scenes with the empty barn behind his house (Have you hearrrd the storrry of the Empty Barrrrn..). I am probably thick, but to maintain the uncertainty as to what is real and what is not until that far into the film is very strong, and really rams home what schizophrenia can be to those who suffer from it. Until that point, the film might have been just as well a political thriller instead of a psychological drama. Great, but it works only once, of course.On the minus side, the romance between Nash and Alicia is quite unbelievable. I don't mean later in the film when she is his wife and stays with him through his illness, regardless of his own suffering. This I can believe, there are many people so dedicated to their partner that they sacrifice big chunks of their own life and happiness to stay together when there is trouble. No, the silly bit is their courtship. If this is really how it happened in real life she is even more crazy than he is. Why would a girl respond to a total boor and social misfit like him? The guy is simply revolting, and I would think that an intelligent and pretty girl like Alicia would have no lack of better suitors from which to choose from.Russell Crowe's acting is reasonably good, if a bit on the side of overdoing it. He is best when he is under the medication, worst in his college days with the exaggerated spasms and speech problems. Good to see Christopher Plummer making an appearance, and he puts Dr. Rosen down very precisely, keeping enough distance to make it unclear for a while who he really is and what he really stands for.The cinematography is quite beautiful, I like the warm colours of the University surroundings, so suggestive of steadiness, calm and control, contrasting nicely with the turmoil of Nash's inner life. The ending with the Nobel prize acceptance speech is downright cheesy and disappointed me. This film doesn't need such cheap trickery to make its point.On the whole, well worth watching but parts of it are a bit too Hollywood.",A Beautiful Mind

By the time the movie ends, you will most likely be looking up John Nash's true story just because you connect with him in the movie (I would not recommend looking up the true story until after watching the movie, because it will spoil a twist in the movie).

593,JAM-52,A Top Notch Film,10,6 January 2002,"Ron Howard will finally get his due.  He has outdone himself - again.  He has put forth some very nice films, but this one tops them all.  I went into this film undecided about Russell Crowe.  I was not caught up in all the over the top praise that was handed out to him and the Gladiator film and the over praise for that outing caused me to wonder about his ability.  The combination of his performance in A Beautiful Mind together with his very nice showing in The Insider clearly display his credentials as one fine actor.  Whether this is the best movie of a, hopefully, high quality year of good films or it is the best movie coming out at the end of a particularly lousy year for Hollywood - it qualifies either way.  I wonder if we won't see Crowe miss out on an Academy Award for this one since he got the one he didn't deserve for Gladiator.  We really ought to see Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor Oscars and at least a nomination or two for Best Supporting Actor (both Harris and Bettany are very good in this film) out of this Beautiful Film.",A Beautiful Mind
594,fraserpatty,One of a dozen of the same type of movie...,2,30 April 2002,"Unfortunately, due to a type of treacherous nepotism in Hollywood, this mediocre movie won the honor which should not have been its due.  Ron Howard has played Salieri to much more deserving directors, with the academy's approval.  It will be quickly relegated to the ""what was that movie about?"" pile in a few years, just as Annie Hall has been.  If it had not been awarded this undeserved high honor, it could have sunken into the obscurity which is its fate with a little dignity.  Now it will always be remembered as the movie that made millions of people decide that Oscar was no longer worth watching.",A Beautiful Mind
595,SpinalTapFan,"Too imperfect to deserve so many Oscars, but a well-made and challenging work all the same",7,14 October 2006,"As with fellow Oscar-winner Monster, this biopic has received criticism for a few inaccuracies regarding the real life of the subject. Those in A Beautiful Mind are more worthy of criticism, or of clarification at the very least.From what I gather, the portrayal of schizophrenia is not accurate. John Nash did not visualise people, he merely heard their voices and interpreted them his own way. This limits the film's worth on an educational side, but does allow the film to take on more drama for those unfamiliar with Nash's life.Which leads me to the other big issue, the inaccuracies as to his romantic life. Not only is Nash's older son ignored, Alicia being from El Salvador originally is also overlooked, and their divorce and remarriage is not mentioned either.Worse to some, Nash's past rumoured bisexual relationships are airbrushed away. I don't feel the writers should however be blamed for this, for two reasons. Firstly, Nash claims that he had a level of identity crisis during his schizophrenic times, and attributes any dalliances with men to these. Hardly a view likely to be well-received by gay viewers, much less Hollywood's large gay presence. Secondly, homosexuality is almost entirely ignored in mainstream cinema, unless it is integral to a true story (such as Monster), and this might not be the best film to break it thought.When I first watched the film, I loved the ending - the whole 'triumph over adversity' feel combined with the touching 'I did so much wrong, but now I've found truth' speech seemed to justify everything. With the reality being somewhat different, it may instead have been phony Hollywood schmaltz. I don't know whether Nash's acceptance speech was similar to what was used in the film - if not, this is a major flaw if the film is to be viewed as a biopic.For all these flaws, we are still looking at an entertaining piece of work. Nash's mathematical achievements are largely simplified or overlooked, but this is fair enough - to most people it's an over-complex or boring field. Many will have left the cinema keen to research Nash's real work, and there are many places where that can be done easily enough. The same goes for the anti-Communism hysteria and status of the Nobel Prize for Economics which are mentioned by other reviewers.Above all, this is a human interest piece. A complex, flawed but gifted man struggles with complex demons and somehow comes out on top. He loses what could have been his best years, but enjoys a later-life renaissance and is accepted by the very people he once had (mutual) distrust of. Russell Crowe is superb throughout, Ed Harris is truly awesome, while Paul Bettany is perhaps best of all as Charles, who in many ways is what Nash deep down wishes he was but is convinced he is not - sociable, suave and popular with the ladies. He takes centre stage in the comic chat-up attempt in particular. If you're open-minded, but aware of what you will be viewing, give it a go.",A Beautiful Mind

It´s a realistic psychologic movie about a man who´s suffering from schizofrenia. There are a couple of thing that makes this movie great. First of all, the movie makes you understand a little bit how someone who has schizofrenia experience the world. Second, the two leading actors performance (Nash-Russel Crowe-and his wife) is really outstanding. By my opinion Crowe deserved a second Oscar for this performance. The third reason this movie is excellent is that the movie really does something with you; watching this movie certainly should be an emotional experience witch takes you in the life of John Nash, former Nobel price winner. Last, it´s a true story, which gave me an extra dimension to this movie. So, I can recommend this movie to anyone who´s kind of good movies, with a great script and excellent actor´s performances.

601,Kleister-Meister,"Well acted drama, though more entertaining than informative",8,21 September 2010,"The movie about highly skilled mathematician John Forbes Nash first seemed to me, as if it's going to be a mediocre try to show the life of a special, but uninteresting person. Until the great twist, that comes so unexpected it is entertaining, but not very outstanding. Though it really develops to a well-acted movie about the dramatic life of this poor man, and seeing this man being destroyed by himself is so stirring, that boredom soon is replaced by sympathy for Nash and his wife, who suffer badly under the circumstances that nearly destroy his life. Unfortunately the more this movie tries to be dramatic, the more Hollywood kitsch annoys the audience, so people who like happy ends will be satisfied. Beside that, it's a pity that only this special part of his life is shown to the audience, so we get more information about his tragic fate than about himself and his work.Still it is a really good movie about an interesting person, well acted by Russell Crowe, which is worth its money and I can definitely recommend it.",A Beautiful Mind
602,tg_prithvi,The best ever in my view,10,12 September 2013,"One of the best ways to describe this movie is that it is so realistic, which is also the very reason for my liking. In each phase of the movie, the Russell's character depicts the realistic nature of a human being, which indeed is reinforced by his artistic and more naturalistic way of acting only to make it more realistic and which makes you like it. Connelly is my favorite actress, however I am not biasing when I say, that she has performed her role so beautifully. I just started loving her after I watched this movie. So, basically, the movie is about a maths professor who is so lively and exuberant about his works and always tries to prove something. Is he really working as he thinks he is or is he just fooling himself?? Ron moved the movie so meticulously that the watcher doesn't get deviated or at least doesn't want to. I recommend everyone watch this movie unless they want to miss a work of masterpiece. I bet everyone cried at the end of the movie. I did. Though I guarantee you, its a happy ending.

The story itself details the tribulations of a mathematical genius only to discover the surprising detail of the cause of all the bad happenings halfway through the movie. The story itself doesn't feel 'slapped together', in fact, the story is quite good... if you're interesting in personal life stories. Russel Crowe's acting nearly puts a tear in your eye because you actually feel for him in certain situations. Superb on Crowe's part. What prevents this movie from being anything higher than 7 is the fact that the majority of the audience will think its a yawnfest, kudos to you if you are a patient person. Basically, it loses 3 points for not having wide audience appeal.

Just listen to it... it's like you can touch the source of all invention and life in the Universe... like you've been touched by a genius yourself... like enlightenment... like...--- The second is Russell Crowe's performance...I believe this is one of the highpoints of movie acting...

His roommate Charles is always there to help him get through the difficult times in his life at university. Russell Crowe is, again fantastic in portraying John Nash. With Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia and Paul Bettany as his roommate Charles, this film sets up to be a great film about the success of a gifted person. Unfortunately that is not how things progressed. John Nash's mind leads him down a self-destructive path that neither friends or family can save him from. With espionage and government intervention around every corner it is impossible to know which way to turn. Ed Harris is excellent as Parcher, the dark government agent who, it seems, hires Nash to work at a secret government facility to help decode vital information.

What a truly beautiful movie. This is a dignified, tender, sympathetic portrait of a genius, a true genius. I've always known that genius is a person who can see the answer before the question, and this is perfectly exemplified and shown by Ron Howard. When Nash sees mathematical equations in the prisms of light from drinking glasses that match with a bad tie, to the long shadows cast by glasses forming columns of groups, to the movement and replacement of certain women in the bar, John Nash sees his answer. It's all there in front of him. Ron Howard created a classic in this film.This is a tender and accurate portrait of a genius, and a moving portrait of a schizophrenic. Beautiful film.

But now that I have seen it, I wish I had used the time to do things that have more meaning, like reorganizing your sock drawer.  This is a manufactured film made expressly to win Oscars.  I have never seen as self-centered performance as Russell Crowe's.  Throughout the entire movie he might as well be saying ""I'm going to win an Oscar for playing this freak.  HA!""  He has no respect for the amazing man that he is playing, you can see that in his incredibly cliched movements that look like he read a book about what crazy people do, marked exactly where he was going to do these movements, and then executed them without thinking if this is the right time or if it makes sense for the character to do them then.  I was so relieved when he did not win the Oscar, but I didn't think Denzel Washington's performance in Training Day was all that spectacular, but it was more of a career award for him.  Russell Crowe, however, has had a career about as impressive as a box of hair.  Jennifer Connelly was just okay.  I didn't see anything spectacular or Oscar-worthy in her performance, she just sort of screamed and looked worried and disheveled.  The best picture Oscar could have gone to a much more deserving film like Moulin Rouge, instead of this heartless award trap.

The double tear-jerker ending, which I loved, made this a movie to remember. And, by the way, special praise to the make up for Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, who were both seamlessly aged so expertly that the process barely called attention to itself. Bravo!!  Four Stars!

All one sees on screen is (O-V-E-R)A-C-T-I-N-G rather than a believably portrayed character. One can never get past the fact that it's Russell-Crowe-as-John-Nash rather than just John Nash. This does not matter so much in other (types of) movies, but here it disturbs the whole process of spectator involvement, never allowing you to relax and settle back in your seat in order to watch the drama unfold.The film does manage to take the spectator into the world of schizophrenia and make it seem ""real"", and the moment of realisation (when Nash is suddenly able to separate reality from delusion) is cleverly done. As a whole, however, the film is belaboured and conventional, crying out for Academy attention with its uplifting love-conquers-all story featuring a mentally disturbed genius as the protagonist. (This practically sounds like the Oscar instruction manual on How To Get Nominated.) The attention was duly given. Never mind that the actual facts of the real John Nash's life were somewhat white-washed in the movie for mass appeal.Jennifer Connelly is a graceful presence throughout the film, but her character is too good to be true. Only one or two scenes show her as a human being with messy emotions and desperation rather than as that June Allyson cypher, the long-suffering 50s wife.

626,featherstone-758-470869,Beautiful And More,9,16 February 2011,"Beauty. The word every filmmaker wants to hear in relation to his or her work. However, achieving cinematic beauty is something else. Beauty lies in the emotion, dedication and passion of good filmmaking; beautiful films are the one's made for a purpose. This film falls into that category: it serves a purpose. It successfully investigates the implications of dealing with schizophrenia, from minor inconveniences to larger problems with the potential to deliver devastating consequences. Therefore this movie is not destined purely to entertain, but to educate. The story focuses around John Nash: A mathematical genius who attends Princeton in the hope of coming up with a mathematical theory which is 'original'. Under immense pressure to meet his ambitions as well as from his classmates, Nash eventually succeeds, working his way up until he became a professor at the MIT. Here he begins to notice the effects of his growing mental illness. He marries Alicia: one of his graduates but then begins to slip into a complicated world where he cannot differentiate reality from fantasy. Crowe pulls of the part brilliantly, delivering a merit- worthy performance. Equally as impressive is Jennifer Connelley with Ed Harris interjecting a solid part. The mood of the film swings, twists and warps the traditional pallet; enveloping the range of feelings of a true drama and packaging them into a complete thriller. This film is layered with emotion and passion: showcasing determination and proving that you can overcome your trials. It's pace fluctuates, making it exciting, dynamic and unpredictable, panning from quaint romance to exhilarating action. Howard succeeds in delivering a product which contains more than just pure beauty, but despair as well as joy. Wrapped up in this feature are messages that all people can draw from, whether you're ambitions and inspired or not. It reminds us all that life has its challenges, but also that those challenges can be overcome if we learn to ignore the hurdles whilst embracing the rewards. Prepare to be amazed, saddened, elated and touched by a movie which exhibits more than just the beauty of overcoming.86/100",A Beautiful Mind

629,trcbmc,Beautiful Mind is Right-On about Psychosis,10,15 January 2005,"A Beautiful DelusionThere is no point in being nuts if you can't have fun. (Mathematician John Nash in A Beautiful Mind)A Beautiful Mind is a biographical film starring Russell Crowe as mathematician John Nash, who suffered from schizophrenia long enough to become familiar enough with his demons to finally recognize them as such. That is a victory worth celebrating, and the movie does so, eloquently.Some critics of A Beautiful Mind compared it to Sylvia Nasar's 450-page biography of the same title, and said it did not faithfully portray the complexity of either Nash's life or his disease. That's asking a lot of a two hour movie. No, Nash did not have the visual hallucinations portrayed in the movie. And yes, the movie came nowhere near Nash's belief that he was receiving messages from outer-space aliens, calling him to found a world government. But the film did make Nash's delusions credible to the viewer. ""The prodigal roommate appears"" says Charles, arriving in Nash's grad-student life with a hangover. Charles is played admirably by Paul Bettany (later the ship's surgeon in Master and Commander). And, unless you are symptom-hunting from the get-go, Charles will be as real to you as he is to Nash. Only later will you see him as the flip-side of Nash's asocial personality, created by his imagination out of a very human need for companionship and love. And that is the way delusions really are. From long and bitter experience I know: Psychosis sneaks up on you hypnotically, like a blacksnake moving by imperceptible increments toward the creature it suddenly devours. Like Charles, and like the cartoon G-man Parcher (played by Ed Harris) who replaces him, delusions offer excitement. As the recovering Nash says wryly, ""There is no point in being nuts when you can't have fun."" And they're charming. They know how much more important you are than others realize, how central in significance.As a film, Beautiful Mind merited four Acadamy Awards. But for those of us who have suffered from mental illness its finest accomplishment is that it did not romanticize mental illness, as many movies do, nor attribute the disease to that movie cliché, the Horrible Repressed Trauma. Rather, it revealed what psychosis is like from the inside, and that also is a victory worth celebrating.Tom McClellan +++",A Beautiful Mind
630,bendipa,A beautiful snub?,9,22 April 2005,"So much cinematic output of late consists of ""action/disaster"" movies aimed at cheap thrills by the second. And the more explosions, murders, special effects, fights or macho posing takes place, the better the audience seems to like it. The film, 'A Beautiful Mind' could not be more removed from the glut of superficial puerile trash that predominates our screens nowadays.Russell Crowe, who has exhibited more than his fair share of violent and aggressive behaviour on set, (and sometimes off set too) has made an exceptional movie, with ABM. Here he totally relinquishes his aggressive, stereotyped image, in favour of a mild, eccentric and awkward academic, totally absorbed in his field of mathematics. So convincingly does Crowe blend into the character of John Nash, that it's almost impossible to believe that it's him playing this role. He even looks different, having lost a bit of weight for the part, although the bulging biceps are ever present. His acting is just brilliant, and Crowe proves once and for all that he is leagues above most Hollywood actors, and need never be typecast for violent roles again, because he can be versatile in character.Without going fully into the plot, the film basically is a two part study of schizophrenia, particularly from a victim's point of view. The first half of the film cleverly thrusts the audience right into the mind of John Nash, and the delusions he suffers. We share these delusions with him, and therefore they seem real enough in his mind (and ours) but baffling to everyone else around him. However, we are not really aware that Nash is actually a schizophrenic, until the film's second half. Up to then it's quite possible that Nash's growing alienation and secrecy about his work may have some genuine basis. There are at least three characters that the viewer is led to believe exist. One of them emerges near the start of the film, and unless you are extremely observant you would not realise he was fictitious, until all is revealed. We also notice Nash's lack of social skills, particularly with women, but despite this handicap he eventually manages to attract the attention of one his female students, destined to be his future wife Alicia, sympathetically played by Jennifer Connelly. The second half of the film deals with Nash's awareness of his condition, and his attempts to deal with it, and the strain it places on his marriage.Crowe was more than ably supported by the rest of the cast. Jennifer Connelly received an Oscar, as did director Ron Howard. And the film received 'Best Picture' Oscar. But as for Russell Crowe? He was nominated but got nothing. It seems he was deliberately snubbed in 2002, since he received an Oscar the previous year in 'Gladiator'. That's life, I guess!Films like ABM are far and few between. Maybe it's just as well since its welcoming quality reminds us how good films can still be, and that there are directors prepared to take a risk by not following the herd.",A Beautiful Mind
631,jacksragingbileduct99,A Beautiful Mind.....A Beautiful Film,8,2 November 2005,"This was a wonderful film, wonderful story, wonderful characters, and wonderful performances.This is a film that you don't watch just to kill time, despite the fact that it is over 2 hours long. To be a part of what it is and what is happening, you (as the audience) needs to zero in on the target of appreciation and understanding of John Nash(Crowe) and what his life has become as a result of what it has been.This was a film that I was glued to and the time flew by, because it seems like you go on a 'journey' with this character and you end up at the end in time to look back on it and think 'Wow, so that's what it was about' or 'That's what that meant'.As a person who has seen a few other of Ron Howard's films, including 'Apollo 13', it would be fair to say that this is no let-down.A film that really delivers you from reality.....4 stars out of 5.",A Beautiful Mind

The work of John Nash may not seem all that interesting when told by a normal person, BUT, the direction makes the story pop. The performance from Russel Crowe was superb. Overall, this movie nearly brought tears to my eyes in multiple scenes. The success of Nash in the beginning of the movie set it up to be happy-feel good movie, but devolving into mental illness turned the film on its head and gave more life than what I originally expected. The ending brings tears to my eyes. Sadly, the only thing I was frustrated with was that I only discovered the movie now, instead of years prior.

Unlike most biographies, the movie doesn't come off as a series of vignettes from the subject's life, it's all tied together very nicely and cleanly.

637,dribe,Most Overrated Film of 2001!,8,14 February 2002,"As a graduate film student, I watch hundreds of movies a year.  By now, I can tell a good film from a bad one.  A Beautiful Mind, as with most of Ron Howard's movies, is somewhere in between.  It has some satisfying moments, but just doesn't make it all the way to home base.  It's definitely an admirable effort and I did enjoy the film, but I thought it was lacking in dialogue, plot, visual appeal, and imagination. After watching A Beautiful Mind steal the Golden Globe, and quite possibly the Oscar, for Best Film from The Lord of the Rings, I have a new disliking for this mediocre film.  Anyone who has seen The Insider, also starring Russell Crowe in a drama about a real-life person, should know that it is a far more superior film in every aspect.  Go out and rent it now and you'll see that Michael Mann knows what he is doing.  And no recent film has better dialogue than The Insider. Getting back to ABM, the performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are pleasing, but Russell's character just seems to be an overly quirky and confused version of his character in The Insider.  And will somebody tell me how Jennifer Connelly has managed to look the same for the past 10 years!  Now that's impressive. I keep hearing critics comment on how ABM does such a wonderful job in getting the audience inside the mind of a genius and schizophrenic.  How do they do it?  Special effects.  I was not impressed by this, with the exception of the code-breaking scene.  And the entire movie is about a character that I don't really like.  What caused his schizophrenia?  In the movie, it is apparently John F. Nash's inflated ego.  He refuses to go to classes with ""mere mortals"" losing their ability to be creative.  He drives himself crazy because he wants to be more important than he really is.  And no one even mentioned his bisexuality and divorce from his wife... Well, if you loved this movie, that's great.  It's a relatively good film, much better than some of the trash that comes out these days.  And I don't believe in criticizing films.  Film, to me, is a wonderful and powerful art medium.  I fully realize how difficult it is to make a good film and how there are an overwhelmingly large number of challenges and obstacles to juggle with when doing so.  The only reason I'm writing this is because of the surprisingly high-regard people have for this movie.  It's not that great, and it better not win the Oscar even though that haunting prospect seems very likely.  I should also add that I have a lot of respect for John F. Nash, Jr. and all of his accomplishments.  It's just that this film doesn't accomplish as much.",A Beautiful Mind

I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't seen the movie, but I think the way the movie depicts John Nash's state of mind is brilliant.  Akiva Goldsman (Best Adapted Screenplay) and Ron Howard (Best Director) earned their Oscars for this movie.  The performances are also brilliant.  Russell Crowe should have won his second Oscar for his portrayal of John Nash.  Jennifer Connolly (Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), Christopher Plummer, Ed Harris, and the entire cast are excellent.The movie has been criticized for being too different from the book.  Books and movies are two different things.  I don't want to compare apples and oranges.  I think the movie should be judged on its own merits.  If people want to know the facts about John Nash's life, all they have to do is read the book.  The movie is entertaining in its own right.",A Beautiful Mind
644,EEMargolin,A Beautiful Story Told Poorly,6,7 July 2002,"While I deeply appreciate the contribution of Mr. Howard and the other contributors to this project to deal with difficult subject matter, I find there are many critiques I would choose to offer.  The license the film maker takes to entertain us leaves many truths of this story stretched far beyond the reasonable.  It troubles me that a serious film maker would make such flaws as are made with issues relating to facts that are easily verifiable.  For example, lectures are given prior to the awarding of a Nobel Prize, and acceptance speeches are never given.  Dramatic license is one thing, but his speech could have been written into the script in hundreds of other places, rather than leaving the masses with blatant misrepresentations.I adored the performances of the two main characters, though Ms. Connelly could have been given so much more.  Mrs. Nash is half of the story of Mr. Nash,  and yet her character was reduced to being two dimensional at best.  Mr. Howard and the screen writers all but ignored secondary characters, letting them stand merely as bridges to move from one main point to the next. This is completely irresponsible film making.  Has Mr. Howard become so comfortable and confident that he has forgotten what it's like to take risks?  I think he's the epitome of everything that is wrong with American film.  It's long on safe choices, short on quality of development.  I enjoy Mr. Howard's films for basic entertainment and storytelling value, and he does have a wonderful eye for background detail, among many of his other unmentioned talents.  I think he has promise, but his films are beginning to cater so much more to the masses than to true and honest work.  This leaves me both sad and bitter, because he could be a great director if he really allowed himself to take chances.  He plays it safe, and for that audiences adore him and he makes a studio very happy.  No doubt he will be regarded as one of the top directors of our time, but this regard does not make the fact true.  He could be so much more, and I for one keep paying to see that happen because I have hope.  Yet with each passing film, I find the same tired tread of someone who wants to make a spectacular commercially successful film, that I want to ask him to please do something incredible.  Ed Harris looks like he's becoming bored with his one dimensional sideline characters in all of his Howard films, and this is not fitting for such a wonderful talent.   Only two characters were allowed to really shine, and certainly they deserve their acclaim, if for no other reason than the direction is stale.The script was decent, but left so many incredible wholes that I can't imagine why it took nearly two and a half hours to tell this wonderful story of John and Alicia Nash.  It's taken me a few days to digest how unsatisfying I felt.  I became too dazzled by the two main characters o see the incredible flaws, and I can only feel sorry that this important story was not only a poor representation of Mr. And Mrs. Nash, but much fictionalized for dramatic license.  
This film should have been given to a more capable team, such as Steven Soderbergh or P.T. Anderson, or even Hal Hartley.  I think the film wouldn't have been as successful commercially, but artistically and for story content, this would have been a much better movie.  To Mr. Howard, I give the big raspberry.  Boo, I say. Boo.",A Beautiful Mind

As a matter of fact, I had once sent a resume to Univerisal Pictures years before that movie came out on a lark thinking because of my superntural dreams that God might be calling me into character acting-maybe I might play a ""heavy"" in a drug movie or something. Did Universal pick up on my resume and cover letter and decide to make this movie about Schizophrenic genius John Nash? I had bought the PBS American EXPERIENCE video A BRILLIANT MADNESS chronicalling the life of John Nash, too. Because of my illness the subject interested me. The real life of John Nash is a bit different from Ron Howard's fairy tale story. John Nash actually quit taking his meds after awhile and got better!

Thought provoking, intense, and incredibly acted, this film is a gem. Winner of 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. Also Nominated for Best Actor, Best Score, and Best Makeup. Russell Crowe stars in an amazing performance as the brilliant mathematician John F. Nash. John isn't social, isn't really popular, and definetly not great with the ladies. But, he is gifted with a brilliant mind. He solves equation after equation looking for an original idea to become well known and respected. He's well on is way, and is successful. Life is perfect. Until he is hired by William Parcher (played by Academy Award nominee Ed Harris)to break codes during a Russian conspiracy. Everything is going well until he makes a shocking discovery that it is all fake. The conspiracy, his roommate who he befriends, and the roommate's adorable niece. All fake. Schizophrenia has taken over his life.  His wife is the only thing that can help him get threw this. Alicia (Academy Award Winner (for this) Jennifer Connelly) is there with him threw the hospitalizations, the struggles, the good times, but more the bad. She sticks with him, and thanks to her, John is able to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994. Jennifer Connelly's performance was nothing short of brilliant. She is luminous and exquisite.  The Oscar was well deserved. You can truly see her struggle to help her husband, to raise her son, and to stay sane herself. And, Russell Crowe, Russell Crowe. Only nominated this year for Best Actor (beaten out by Denzel Washington for ""Training Day"". Personally, I thought Russell was better!), Russell is still is as good as he has ever been.

652,knipshun,Succeeds on all Levels,10,16 April 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSIt's hard to start at a certain point in praising this film.  It has been a few months since the movie's release but I just got around to seeing it. Needless to say, I'm glad the illness which Crowe possessed was not revealed to me (unlike the Sixth Sense was), greatly surprising me!  Russell Crowem the Aussie.  While not a big fan of him as a person (cocky and a bit rude), I cannot deny his acting skills.  He may possibly be the best actor at the present time, joining the ranks of Tom Hanks, Edward Norton, and Denzel Washington. Crowe's portrayal of the sick Nash takes on many levels of character development, essential in creating a good film.  The supporting cast around him merely made his performance look that much better, such as Joaquin Phoenix (no Oscar) did in Gladiator.  An array of emotions poured out by the transformed Crowe made me feel that Crowe had forgotten himself and had become Nash (much like Tom Cruise does with his characters).  This is what acting is truly about.  Anyone can see an actor (faker) and an ACTOR (if anyone gets what I am saying cause this messageboard wont let me use any damn italics).   I am aware that the story was Hollywoodized to make it the ""feel good movie of the year"" (geez...there seem to be so many of those), but I felt it was necessary to do such.  With a depressing story such as this one, a boost was definitely needed.  But not all the time, don't get me wrong.  Sometimes people just gotta die in Lifetime movies OK?  But back to the point.  The film won best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress, all which I felt were deserved.  I still question why Crowe's name was not amongst the winners.  I am not downsizing Washington's role in Traing Day whatsoever but if the entire rest of the crew succeeds in supporting the main star, shouldnt the main star win as well?  One lase point.  The film succeeds in letting you see what life is really about, love.  Crowe's character comes to the realization that love is not a mathematical problem that can be solved.  It is merely a feeling that cannot be explained.  In one of the most cliche but none-the-less tear-jerking lines at the end of the film, Crowe makes this point stick.  He calls his wife his ""reason"".  Sappy but Im a sucker.  I have seen only a few films which rank at the level which I am about to give.  Notice this is a film, not a movie (a film sounds more prestigious).

But as it continues on, he has a way of speaking and doing things that is very unusual and quite enticing. As the movie goes on, it becomes increasingly interesting, as characters are developed in a lovely and elegant way, and, as someone who had deliberately avoided this movie for the past 13 years, I found myself quite intrigued as to the point of the movie.First off, his behaviour seemed to me to be like that of a typical autistic, and I wondered if that was what his secret was. And when he was accosted and put into the mental hospital, I thought that he was a misunderstood autistic. And yet, apparently, this was all a secret as he was actually schizophrenic. Hrm. Nup. I don't think so.The problem I found, and this was a big problem, was when we discovered what his delusions were.The roommate, fair enough. You could believe that. Much like the imaginary friend out of Fight Club, but it was really him. And his niece too, fair enough. Believable delusions. An intelligent man could fall for that. Only problem is that neither of them ever age. But that can be argued around.The problem came with the Department of Defence delusion.Now, fair enough, he could be called to work for the Pentagon. That kind of thing happens, and they often call members of the public to help them out. We all know that that happens, and a mathematician being called in to do code breaking is not out of the question.Being asked to decipher newspaper codes is fair enough too. It is well documented that spy agencies use newspapers to send encrypted messages. But they use advertising - not articles. The complexity of getting a journalist involved is virtually unheard of in the intelligence community. But the idea of entire newspapers across 20 or 30 publications all publishing fake parts of articles to send encoded messages is a level of complexity that just simply wouldn't happen. One corrupt journalist maybe. But not that many. It just isn't logical.If he was just looking at advertising, fair enough. From what I have read, they usually use ""lost in love"" adverts to send messages. It was even shown on ""Mission Impossible"". It is easy as pie to put advertising like that in, you can do it anonymously and nobody checks what you put in. You could also put in fake used car ads and other kinds of advertising. But not articles. Not only was he looking in the wrong area, but the level of what he was looking at was all wrong too. In ""Mission Impossible"" they used newspapers to say that they were safe and in the prescribed safe house. In ""Kick Ass"" they used a website to say that they needed help. That is the kind of thing that thy are going to put in - not talking about where to bomb. Things of that level of security would be done behind closed doors face to face. It just isn't believable.And John Nash was a smart man so why didn't he work that out? That delusion was unbelievable. And I can't believe that he would fall for it. If it was to try to find bombers when they got out, fair enough. Trying to find bombers when they got out, using advertisements, fair enough. But just the level, well, surely he knew enough about the secret service to know that that just isn't believable.And the thing is that once he was shown evidence he should have been convinced - yet he still fell for it again. Smart enough fellow but he fell for it in spite of evidence. The evidence couldn't have been planted. The other thing is that the Department of Defence delusion was not a happy one. It was an upsetting delusion. When he discovered that his friendly roommate was a delusion, it would have upset him as that happiness would not be there. But on discovering that the horrible Department of Defence guy was fake he should have been happy. But he was not. Not happy because he is not as important? But he should have at least been happy that his life was not in danger.The only positive part was that he had managed to treat his illness without medication or help from anyone else. We know that this is possible with regular physical illnesses like the flu, and it is very encouraging to think that he could have done that.Only problem is that it isn't true. In spite of refusing medication, he still went back to hospital several times since he began trying to treat his mental illness without medication. Not a good movie, and I feel a bit sad for people that fell for this. Gripping and all but so unrealistic and just not true to his life.",A Beautiful Mind

664,Shlo,A Hollywood Illusion,2,21 April 2002,"A Beautiful Mind represents so much of what is wrong with Hollywood and the Oscars.  Though this film is largely vapid, trite, and completely fails to delve into John Nash's psyche at all, it presents the illusion of a strong character study.  The beautiful cinematography, musical score, and close-ups all work to create, like a formula, the illusion of feeling.  The audience sees (close-up + sad music + frustrated Russel Crowe = sad reaction).  Ron Howard provided the audience with all of the trappings they expect to see in an Oscar-calibre film and most moviegoing audiences have been trained to believe that slow-motion and nice cinematogrgraphy are the elements that make a good film.  Yet, this film completely lacks the kind of character development and true inner conflict that thrives in a film like Monster's Ball.  It is a veneer and never even attempts to get below the surface.  Ron Howard went fishing for an Oscar and got two.  The fact that Howard won an Oscar is embarrasing.  Not that he is an awful dirctor, but he's certainly not on the level that would warrant an Oscar.  He's best when he is simply entertaining -",A Beautiful Mind

The movie makers did such a brilliant job of fooling the audience. I was so fooled, I was afraid his friends were delusions.The only thing that disappoints me is that some of the things that took place in the movie never really happened and that disappoints me. But I do understand that it's a dramatization of somebody's life.

And it's also an irresponsible and grossly inaccurate picture of mental illness and its devastating effect on the family.This movie has taken a very sad story of a man with mental illness and turned it into an absurd fairy tale.That this film would be showered with awards is only more disgraceful.

I was awestruck by his performance in ""A Beautiful Mind"".  I also believe this will be the film that gets Ron Howard at least an Oscar nomination (having been cheated out of ""Apollo 13"").  The writing, all the supporting actors, the photography - everything was wonderful about this movie, which spans 47 years in the life of Nobel laureate John Nash.  It's at times frightening and pathetic, but you end up cheering for Nash in the end.  After seeing the movie, viewers will feel inclined to go back and rehash various scenes and say ""That's why that happened"" or ""I get it now!"" - something like ""The Sixth Sense"" made us do. This movie is well worth the money and the momentary yawn that might slip out during the mathmatical talk.

There is absolutely nothing about mental illness that ever  ""feels good"". Ron Howard beat out Robert Altman for this mess? What a travesty!  Mr. Howard didn't know what to do once he let us know that the character was just imagining the best part of the drama. I wanted to know more about how Dr. Nash spent his ""just hanging out"" time at Princeton. Like most people, I am intelligent enough to understand more about  Dr. Nash's work than the movie let us see.Sam Neil, not Russell Crowe, was the best actor in the picture. And why was the woman who played the wife even nominated for an Academy Award? Granted, she is very pretty and had one scene where she actually lost her genteel temper, but it was not award winning acting. The Academy must have been desperate for nominees.

I had remembered looking in the papers and reading reviews for it. Every single review was not four stars but three and a half stars. How goofy is that!? Anyways - I walked in the theater. I was probably the only person in there under 30. That depressed me. I quietly sat down next to a bus load of senior citizens. The movie theater was silent. The movie started and I tried focusing on it. Halfway into it, I left. I have never done that to a movie before. I was falling asleep. So I went into Crossroads - which was pure trash.. but I got more of a thrill out of THAT  than ""A Beautiful Mind"". So after Crossroads got out, I decided to go back into ""A Beautiful Mind"" - which surprisingly was still dragging itself along.. for another HOUR! So after that got out.. I overheard some of the old geezers. They were saying things like ""That film was.. uh (cough, cough) brilliant"". It was actually pretty funny.I could see Ron Howard sitting in his fold-up director's chair with his bull-horn and baseball cap thinking about his oscar-winning speech as he's directing this oscar-dribble. What I'm trying to say is - this film was purely made to win the oscars. And with Oscar-dribble, I mean it's one of those movies that is completely oscar-worthy, and nothing else. The film-makers were full of themselves everone gave into it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's purely oscar trash.",A Beautiful Mind
675,jaywelt,Beautiful Glimpse - Dangerous Theme.,8,17 January 2002,"I'm very torn over rating the job Ron Howard has done on this film.  There are hints of brilliance in the film, along with major gaps in character development and the portrayal of a theme that I think could be irresponsible. (See the last full paragraph for explanation on the problem with the theme.)It is difficult to say who deserves credit for exposing the horror of Schizophrenia.  Howard, Crowe, and the writers, Akiva Goldsman and Slvia Nasar all deserve consideration.  I suspect one of these four if not all of them has dealt with Schizophrenia on a very personal level.  All deserve credit for creating a wonderful and worthwhile movie to watch.  The portrayal of this illness was accomplished as well as I've ever seen done in a film, and that alone makes seeing it worth the price of admission. Russell Crowe is nearly perfect in this role. Despite a rumored comment* illustrating a complete lack of understanding of what Schizophrenia is, Crowe's performance pulls you so deeply into the movie, you may find yourself forgetting about the scrambled plot. Watching; is an exercise in voyeurism.  We get small glimpses into the life of John Nash here and there, but not quite the whole story.   Howard and Crowe team up well to portray `what it's like,' but I'm afraid the story was fragmented and left me unsatisfied.  I want to know more about John Nash.  If not for the brilliant glimpse into the undesirable `life' a Schizophrenic lives, this movie would not satisfy as well on other levels.  If you were to take Crowe's performance out, you may be left with a dull biography suitable for late night television.***Possible Spoiler****I've been trying to decide what I think of the first 45 minutes to an hour of this movie.  In one respect I feel cheated and tricked.  (Very well tricked I might add.  - Kudos to Howard on that.)  In the other respect, I think it is vital to feeling how `tricked' a Schizophrenic person can feel. I think the decision to take the movie on this route, accomplishes one goal while hindering the other.  On the one hand, it takes us on the hellish journey many Schizophrenics face; on the other hand it makes a mess of the plot and throws the continuity off.  If we were to say the plot is not so important, and that experiencing Schizophrenia is what it is all about here, then I would have to say this movie is a 10.***End Spoiler***One thing about this movie concerns me.  As the movie is coming to an end we start to see a `Love conquers all' theme emerge.  While love is powerful and beautiful, and quite possibly all we need, it cannot cure Schizophrenia. Many who suffer from Schizophrenia would be extremely lucky to ever experience the kind of romantic love John Nash is portrayed as receiving in this film.  I hope that not too many people afflicted with this disease watch this movie and come away thinking they need to run out and find someone to love them romantically in order to achieve their dreams and live a full life.  One of the major and most basic horrors that come with this disease is not portrayed in this film.  That Horror is; that many schizophrenics go their entire lives  - and never experience True Love.  I can't think of anything more horrific than that.My hat goes off to the family of John Nash for allowing Hollywood into their lives.  Thank you for allowing your lives to be scrutinized in order to raise awareness of this illness.*I heard that in an interview Crowe made reference to Schizophrenia as a ""multiple personality disorder"".  I do not know if this is true.",A Beautiful Mind

The very brain that helps Dr. John Nash to form mathematical equations and formulae to solve problems and discover new theories can also open the door for a new world which only he could experience.

It's an often powerful movie, and the acting is strong, but it's really nothing to put in a top 100 like this site's users have. Maybe if you know nothing at all about the movie you'll like it, but you only need to know that he eventually wins a Nobel Prize to know exactly how it will end, ruining most of the suspense. Still, I enjoyed the scenes with Ed Harris, he's wonderfully creepy as the mysterious agent. I also liked the way the movie showed how the guy saw strange patterns everywhere, that was pretty interesting. Jennifer Connelly is not near as good in this film as the reviews make her out to be. Her performance is not that big a deal. Russell Crowe was mostly convincing but often overly mannered as Nash.

680,stvincal,"HAS OSCAR LOST ITS ""MIND""?!?",1,2 March 2002,"****SPOILERS AHEAD****I've heard it been said that this film is ""not your typical Hollywood movie"", in that Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality, swelling violins and other devices used to club audiences over the head and send them home in a euphoric, feel-good haze that doesn't dissipate until the last bought and paid-for Academy Award is handed out on Oscar night.Yes, Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality.  And he stays away from everything else, too.  Including moments that might reveal character, facts that would tell an honest, cohesive story and ANYTHING that would help make a captive audience believe in and care about what they're watching. Instead, we're led along through a series of hokey scenes showing John Nash at school, clearly AN OUTSIDER (watch how he upends a chess board!  thrill as he tosses furniture out of a window!  cheer while he launches a textbook into a garbage can and teaches the class HIS way!). Every time a moment comes along that might actually reveal character...SMASH!...cut to ""two years later"".  Then Nash meets a girl in his class whose only apparent attribute is that she has the balls to tell a bunch of construction workers to shut up.  Soon they're pointing at stars, then they're on a picnic then...BANG!...suddenly they're married!  The entire flick has this rapid, TV movie-like pacing.  Nothing is ever earned.  All of the scenes are thrown at us in neat, easy-to-digest, simple-for-a-big-dumb-audience-to-understand fashion.  Yet despite this rapid (vapid) pacing, the movie drags and sags.As for a lack of swelling violins, uber-composer James Horner - raising ""Titanic"" - reprises the syrupy flutes from that film, to indicate to the audience of this film that THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT.  And a good thing, too, because the routine acting and the banal dialogue sure doesn't.
Russell Crowe's acting is uneven at best.  In one scene he comes off as a shy, innocent dullard, then he's an arrogant prick, then back again.  I understand he's supposed to be schizophrenic but there's a certain measuredness - a balanced realness - that's required to make any performance credible - even a schizophrenic.  This is not displayed at all, and the result is that he lost my believability for the character and my sympathy for his situation.  Top that off with an Aussie accent one minute, then some fake-o West Virginia country boy twang the next, then back again....there's a hundred other actors that, despite the handicap of Ron Howard's direction, could have brought this role to life.  Don't get me wrong.  Russell Crowe is a great actor.  From ""Romper Stomper"" to ""The Insider"" he has given some amazing performances, but he was really the wrong choice here.Jennifer Connelly, so great in ""Requiem for a Dream"", gives a throwaway performance here.  In her defense, the role written for her is a WASTE. In scene after stilted scene, she plays the dutiful, suffering wife. Fine, she stuck with her husband throughout his ""ordeal"" (such as it was....this movie's idea of the torment of an unhinged mind boils down to a roomful of magazine clippings and yarn! scary!), but WHY!?  Why not invite the audience into her mind as well, show us her trials, her demons, her reasons for hanging on?  Certainly someone living with a schizophrenic 24 hours a day must have some story of her own to tell?  Where is the slow, measured wearing-down of HER sanity?  Instead we get a marginal acting job of a woman staring out a window with tears running down her face.  POOF!  Suddenly they have a child!  WHY!? Was this planned?  What are the ramifications now? How does Nash perceive the child?  When the baby almost drowns (a scene that could have been and should have been extremely harrowing and emotionally wrenching) I DIDN'T EVEN CARE!!Finally, it's unclear what this film is even ABOUT.  Schizophrenia? ""Sybil"" - a TV movie - was far more compelling, believable and informative.  A mathematician?  What did he accomplish?  Aside from the windowpane scrawlings at the beginning of the movie, I never saw him contribute anything mathematical.  A teacher?  There is about five minutes of film showing him teaching, but fails to detail his accomplishments, his inspiration to his students, his relationships with his peers and other faculty - NOTHING.  A Nobel Prize winner?  For what?  Admittedly, I fell asleep during the last five or ten minutes of the film, just prior to him making his big acceptance speech.  Perhaps I missed some bit of information, but what did he win a Nobel Prize for, being a psychotic jerk?  The movie neither shows nor tells anything that might support otherwise.
In short, this movie is by-the-numbers filmmaking, and continues to add to the less-than-lackluster directing talents of Ron Howard.  From what I understand, John Nash lived quite a colorful life that included womanizing, a nasty divorce, homosexual affairs, violent outbursts and strokes of mathematical genius that apparently changed our economic system.  Was any of this portrayed in this piteous, watered-down film? NO!!! Somewhere here there is a good, compelling story that should have been told by a better director - and a better writer (it's not solely Howard's fault).  Instead we get this manipulative, clap-trap crowd pleaser, showered with Oscar nominations and (rather appropriately) destined to take its place alongside ""The English Patient"".  It's unfortunate that John Nash's life was reduced to this treacle.  This ""Beautiful Mind"" was a terrible thing for Ron Howard - and Akiva Goldsman - to waste.",A Beautiful Mind

685,The Mad Reviewer,"A beautifully written, acted, and crafted movie.",10,16 January 2002,"A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) Rating: 10/10A Beautiful Mind's greatest achievement, in my humble opinion, is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to ""sane"" people. The general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves, repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. But why? It's nearly impossible for a ""sane"" individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly, what that feels like. Without this essential empathy, many people become frustrated with the mentally ill, asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. We express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. It is incomprehensible.A Beautiful Mind does all it can to change that, and it succeeds. Unless you are familiar with John Nash's story, you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until part-way into the movie. He's eccentric, abrupt, and highly intelligent, but doesn't seem crazy. His delusions are as real as reality to Nash, and likewise, they are real to the audience, who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion.Incidentally, I came across a review from a ""professional critic"" who blasted A Beautiful Mind for including ""all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with Nash's work that was thrown in for Hollywood thrill."" I feel bad for that chap, since he missed the entire point of the film. But that just proves Ron Howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality.There are some truly shocking moments in A Beautiful Mind. When Alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house, I was eerily reminded of Jack Nicholson's wife in The Shining discovering his endless, typewritten pages of the same phrase. The scene that follows, culminating with Nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. In a moment, remembering Marcee, Nash has a flash of insight, and he finally accepts his illness -- ironically, through his intellect. When Nash imagines that someone is going to harm Alicia, he lunges at her -- and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless act of violence is a gesture of love, filtered through the smog of delusion.Now my take on the acting: Superb in every sense of the word. Russell Crowe is incredible. I can't stress that enough. There's never any question about the authenticity of his character. Crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age Nash -- his walk, words, and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. Crowe will get at least another Oscar nomination out of this one. And, he better win. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as well. And when Crowe and Connelly are put together, extraordinary chemistry erupts, they just gel together, they really belong with one another. Some people have had problems with the romance part of the movie, saying that the way John and Alicia even started seeing each other wasn't very realistic and why Alicia would stay with John after he becomes distant. But, I think that maybe it started out as just a crush, you know, and the math question she showed him was just her excuse for going to his office and she already knew she was going to ask him out before hand. Maybe she's just attracted to the kind of person Nash is? Who knows? A lot of people are attracted to the ""weirdest"" things sometimes. The crush took over the fact that he sort of insulted her work and she still asked him anyway. When you're around someone you like so much you can't help but be fooled by them. I can't really explain it, but I can understand why she still asked him to dinner. And I guess if you love someone as much as Alicia loved John, then you would stick with them through anything. Even how distant he became, she still stuck with him.Moving on, I think Ed Harris is, as always, great. Harris continues to prove that, simply because he's flawless. With delusions like these, no wonder Nash was torn between treatment and ""spying.""Simply put, A Beautiful Mind is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 15 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie (and still do), thanks to the Oscar-inducing performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players. They are not merely acting, yet are transformed into the characters, leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality.Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow, and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about A Beautiful Mind. Ron Howard contributes truly inspiring work to this film, and I hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.All I can tell you now is that if you're looking for an emotionally-charged movie that will make you cry, but still filters in some very funny moments as to lighten things up every now and then, with near perfect acting, cinematography, directing, editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of John Nash to inspire you, then consider A Beautiful Mind.I hope a lot of people see this film. Not just because Russell Crowe is a hunk or because it's a Ron Howard piece, but because you will learn something important. You will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. You won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themselves. And when someone you love is dealing with a disorder, be it schizophrenia or depression, you won't ask them to ""pull themselves together."" You will understand why they need your love -- because they are just as confused as you are.In closing, if Russell Crowe isn't awarded the Best Actor Oscar this year, then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished.",A Beautiful Mind
686,dw_krause,"If you can believe it, this is a love story. a maddening and seductive one.",9,24 January 2002,"The credits rolled and immediately my inner me said, ""Best Picture."" I say this a lot, of course, technically I'm allowed to say it five times a year. But I added, ""Winner. No doubt"" this time around- Never said that before. But, A Beautiful Mind is an Oscar darling. And it's appeal has never been so obvious- Character frailty, heroism, a powerful love story, resonant acting and writing and despite all the backlash from critics and purists regarding it's sexual ambiguity, something Blockbuster can carry. Remember American Beauty, in comparison, had subtle references too (actually to me they were blatant, but hey this is a general forum) and it still snagged the big statue.Which leaves me to Russell Crowe, whose performance in The Insider was as close to perfect as an actor can get (He 'vus robbed!). Of course, the voters knew their mistake (although it took him a year- see Gladiator- to get it right). To the film: Crowe's versatility simply baffles me here, once again, reaching deep within who knows where to become the math genius and Nobel Prize- winning John Nash. His preparation has to be extremely unique to continually put forth this much passion into each role. I'd love to know what he does- anyone?The film doesn't work, though, without Jennifer Connelly. As Nash's wife, she provides a potent chemistry with Crowe and an energetic calm that slowly creeps up on you. Not sure how, but I swear she steals some scenes away from Russy- but that's real, real chemistry folks, not the Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks kind. Anyway, all the sudden, after all the math wizardry, the psycho-babble and surprises (everyone knows this about a schizophrenic I'm sure, but there is an awesome shocker in here too) you come to realize. damn this is a love story!Thus, we steer are way to the captain of the ship. Ron Howard's direction here is, again, impressive- almost seducing you into understanding and thinking along with Nash's motives and emotional battles with himself and his relationships- the will-he or won't-he's are jarring and paradoxal, fun and draining all at once. A Beautiful Mind is by far Howard's most complete and compelling work  as well as his most important. Of course, he's working with talented actors who helped drive the films dramatic and emotional ranges. and a solid script. or should I say book. I'm not completely sold on Howard as a great director. I believe most of his films are largely in the IMDB 6-7 range, but this is definitely one that he deserves a 9 for. How much all this praise and these awards to come are a credit to him remains to be seen. Either way, A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful and unique love story. It shouldn't be missed by anyone.",A Beautiful Mind
687,lgkinney-1,How can this not be the best movie of the year?,9,12 February 2002,"Do not listen to others who say schizophrenia cannot go into remission, for John Nash, in real life it did just that.  The best movie of the year and one of the top movies of all time. Written beautifully, with acting that is truly outstanding, the movie is unsurpassed in giving viewers an insight into the horrific chasm one faces with this type mental illness. Russell Crowe accurately lives this character. Equalling or topping Dustin Hoffman's performance in ""The Rain Man"". (If you ever see any youthful pictures of Nash he even looks a lot like Crowe)This is a story of an affable but quirky young mathematician   destined to be one of the top two or three scientific minds of the twentieth century slowly losing reality to schizophrenic delusions. Crowe's portrayal of this character's struggle with the demons, and his emotional relationship with his young wife Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly, will leave you on the edge of your seat. Director Ron Howard's suspenseful crafting of the torments and delusions plaguing Nash are both masterful and insightful.

Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness. This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.

In short, the movie is about dealing with mental illness with emotion. The Plot of the movie is very interesting, touching. Great as a Biographic film, Great as a Thriler film, and also as a Romance film. A beautiful mind is very different than most of the films in the genre- psychological thriller (for example - ""The silence of the lambs"" , ""Black Swan"") mainly because of the use of emotional to solve the mental problem and find a solution for the illness. The Direction in the movie is extremely professional, Ron Howard definitely made his best work in the film, he pays attention to the small details. The screenplay is even better than the direction, clever and very original. The Acting in the movie is absolutely great!

It's certainly not a really bad movie it's just horribly middle of the road and only ever generates small moments of interest in an overlong plodding story. The subject should have been shown a lot more respect and also been given to a director with courage to show the whole story, rather than this sanitised version. Apart from maybe Apollo 13, Howard's films have frequently been too safe and bland and unsurprisingly this is no exception. What should have been a memorable fascinating story about a very complex man is littered with so much pap dialog, sentimentality and swirling orchestration, we end up not caring about anyone. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor as he has proven in most of his previous incarnations, but with this role he really needed a braver film maker to let him loose again. For lessons in how to film the story of a troubled mind, remember gems like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Jacobs Ladder - both far from sentimental but both totally moving and un-forgettable.",A Beautiful Mind

I liked the visual approach of the movie giving us an insight that was not available in the book, a novel perspective and an interesting solution, but I think that, as it was stated in the New York Times, the audience could have been trusted with the complexity of the situation. The portrayal of Nasar is so much more intense, and some much more realistic. I liked the movie, but would recommend that anybody who sees it read the real thing afterwards in a wonderfully written biography that shows you that life with a genious, with madness, with a mad academic world and in a paranoid era was very very far from the hollywood treatment of it. The acting by Crowe and the visual idea of getting us into that world was wonderful, but I hope that there is in the future more trust that an audience can deal with much more complexity.

Every scene is blandness epitomised- it's an interesting story, and Russel Crowe is a good actor, but Ron Howard has made such a hash of this it's incredible. I honestly think I could have done a better job. Not a single scene stood out- it all gelled into one mass of mediocrity. Ron Howard is carving a niche for himself as the most robotic director on the planet. No doubt the studio bigwigs love him.

That's really the curse of doing quasi-historical movies, I suppose. In any case, everything about Ron Howard's direction screamed BLAND. I thought Russell Crowe was decent in spite of Howard, and that Jennifer Connelly turned some dopey lines into a decent role. But despite all the polish, and a few enjoyable scenes, the story was hopelessly flawed. The work that got him the Nobel got barely a nod early on in the film, the love story which supposedly drives this was developed inadequately, etc. Perhaps Howard couldn't get any subtlety or depth because he was hamstrung by a merely adequate screenplay. I think, though, that subtlety, depth, and passion are beyond his reach.As bland as it was, it was still decent, and I'd probably give it a 7 out of 10 if I were in a good mood, but it was not really worthy of that Oscar, especially in a year when an achievement as magnificent as LOTR was up against it.",A Beautiful Mind

If you want to see a real nice and fun movie, see scary movie 2 or something really funny like ""not another teen movie"". However, i dont see how one can try to go into this persons mind, this is just a quick glance at something of course more complex and involved than its room to place in a one and a half hour movie. Instead, you should study some psychology, and in that case use this movie for some kind of acknowledgment of your already learned knowledge. The mathematic aspect is, as expected, strongly simplified, and a kind of a crack kids high in the cloud fantasy. Why dont we see more of the interesting works of this man? Probably because one of two reasons. We already have one reason; the time aspect. This is acceptable, if you dont count on getting the priorities straight, because the obvious time limit of a long film. The other possibly reason is because the film makers is thinking not many people would be interested in a film, harrowing about boring mathematical problems. If that is true or not, can of course be discussed. I however believe its perfectly a necessary component in this kind of movie.",A Beautiful Mind
705,mikevotto,Surprising Movie Experience,10,3 January 2002,"I don't expect much from Ron Howard these days.  I don't expect much from Russell Crowe either.  But this is a combination that just seemed to make magic.  I have given Crowe credit for his role in The Insider, but his role in Gladiator was not deserving of the Best Actor Oscar.  It was uninspiring garbage and it did not fit him.  Crowe has since redeemed himself with his role of genius John Nash.  About a year back, I picked up the book A Beautiful Mind and thought that this was one of the greatest stories ever told.  When the film was put into production, I felt cheated that a man like Russell Crowe was set to play Nash.  I was wrong.  Crowe grabbed this role and played it to the bone.  His character development throughout the movie was awe inspiring.I don't like Ron Howard.  He is generally out to make a blockbuster picture and it kills me.  Why?  Because he has talent.  Even though he was on Happy Days, he has grown into a very controlling director.  This man wasted his talents with The Grinch and A Beautiful Mind has brought back the visionary mind that I saw in Apollo 13.  This is simply his best work.The book had it all.

While a graduate in Princeton in the late 40's, he came up with his own ""governing dynamic"", a game theory - mathematics of competition, and after years of fighting his demons won the Nobel Prize in 1994. And this is a true story! Russell Crowe shows why he's a versatile actor by portraying Nash with sensitivity and passion. Jennifer Connelly did an excellent job as the woman who thought she was married to an eccentric man and did not leave his side after finding out about his illness. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer did a fine job in their supporting role of ""explaining and showing"" the mindset of a schizophrenic. Trying to tell this story is not an easy task yet director Ron Howard did it without resorting to sensationalism. This movie gave me an insight of what a schizophrenic goes through on a daily life; not being able to distinguish between what's real and what's reality is frightening or using one's energy to push away the illusion is exhausting.

708,tellusorbit,Brilliant both in execution and empathy,10,28 January 2002,"It has been a long, long time since I saw a movie like this one.  Akiva Goldsman's excellent screenplay brings out the humanity in mathematics and those of us who pursue its riches and secrets.  As a mathematician myself, I was impressed, not so much by the glimpses of mathematics this film gives the viewer, but in the way the academic culture at the very highest levels is recreated.  Things have not changed that much from John Nash's early days at Princeton to the present time at any major university.But, like ""Good Will Hunting"", this movie ultimately is about much more than mathematics.  The story of John Nash, his brilliance and madness, brought back many memories for me personally.  The consuming fire that goes with mathematical research is wonderfully depicted here.  His illness, paranoid schizophrenia, is so well portrayed by Russell Crowe, that I found myself thinking about my best friend who was driven to suicide by his manic-depressive illness.  I marvel that Dr. Nash's wife endured all the years of loneliness and emotional deprivation, but I understand because I went through much the same myself as my best friend struggled and ultimately lost his own battle.I am not a fan of Ron Howard's films.  They tend to overdramatize the emotional side of any situation he examines, and there are times I think he stoops to cheap sensationalism in order to make a point.  I did not get that impression with this film, however.  Akiva Goldsman's script and Russell Crowe's acting combine to lead the viewer into the wild labyrinth of an unbalanced, albeit brilliant, mind without resorting to cheap tricks to keep the viewer engaged.  The supporting cast sparkles as they make the viewer truly see what Dr. Nash sees, and without their performances, this movie would have been a colossal failure.  This movie is a real keeper.

Casting Jennifer Connelly as Mrs. Nash, Paul Bettany, and Ed Harris as John's schizophrenics' muses elevates the ability of the film to draw you into its complexities.

711,Dble07jamesbond,Best movie seen at the theater in a long time,10,16 April 2002,"A Beautiful mind was by far the best film I have seen in the theater for a little bit of time now. Before that I would say that the Sixth Sense was the best--although there were excellent movies that did come out after. (I had just seen those at home). Nevertheless, ""A Beautiful Mind"" should not be ignored and should be viewed by those who feel out of place with themselves and try their hardest to show their potential..but never seem to be able to get it across to someone. As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in ""Mind"". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparible to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's ""The Boston Strangler"". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstical that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed. Along with Crowe's magnificent performance, we were given a marvelous music score by James Horner. (I think that had Randy Newman not won simply for breaking his losing streak, Mr. Horner would have scooped up the award). The music added a beautiful tone to the movie and showed what Nash's mind must feel like within--eerie, confused, and beautiful. On a last note, As wonderful as Jennifer Connelly was in her role, I really think that her Oscar was uneccessary. She turned in a decent performance, but was certainly not Oscar caliber compared to the great Dame Maggie Smith's comic performance, and the ever charming Marissa Tomei's performance. But nevertheless, her Oscar just added to the movies list. :) If you intend on seeing a compelling movie with one of the best male actor's performance's in a long time, pull up a seat and watch ""A Beautiful Mind"".

Why does she so love this twitchy, antisocial ""Rainmathman?""Don't get me wrong.  The character of John Nash, as portrayed by Russell Crowe, is poignant in his brilliance and imperfect humanity.  I don't doubt that Alicia Nash was, in fact, devoted to him...but why?

Maybe he had angered many of the Oscar voters that year because there is no doubt he should have received one for best actor. Don't take my word for it, see the movie and judge for yourselves.  A stellar performance in a very good movie.  Accolades to Ron Howard for directing perfection!",A Beautiful Mind
720,burton_joanna,Exceptionally written and acted movie.,9,3 January 2013,"A beautiful mind was another superbly directed and acted movie both by Russell Crowe and directed by Ron Howard. The way Howard normalized Nash's schizophrenia and tried to get the audience to understand it more was an achievement in itself. At first it is hard to realize Nash's condition with all his eccentricities, abruptness and his incredible intelligence it becomes hard to know he is crazy. The way his delusions seemed so real it became hard to know when it was real and when he had his delusions. Some may criticize the movie because of the spy stuff and other stuff added as just another Hollywood thrill. This just shows the skill of Ron howard to create a picture of insanity identical to reality. While Russell playing nash you never question how realistic the portrayal is, he doesn't rely on makeup or anything elaborate, his walk, words and voice is what makes the character more alive. The performance of Jennifer Connelly was a very added addition to the movie. The chemistry between Crowe and Connelly really gel and you feel that they belong to each other. Every part of the movie came together perfectly and they all complimented each other that made it a more inspiring piece of work. A lot of people should see this movie not just cause Crowe is in it or of who made the movie but because of what you can learn by watching it. Hopefully learning compassion when dealing with the mentally ill. By new found knowledge the next time you see someone talking to themselves or someone you know has a disorder you might understand what they might go through and that they will be needing your continued love. Since they will be just as frustrated and confused as you might be. If you wanna see a movie where everything fits and everyone is at the top of their game then this is a movie for you.",A Beautiful Mind

It's not one of those kinds of movies I would view again,however is worth watching the once. I think this movie is inspirational and empathetic to those of us who may be perceived or actually experience psychological conditions similar to that of the lead character. It shows the progress and changes made in both scientific and the social understandings, while also reveling the emotional impact this can have on those close to us. The performance of the lead characters was generally good and the story line quite clever. I love a film with a good ending, whether this be happy or sad.

Russell Crowe played the part perfectly with what was definitely his best performance to date, the direction of this masterpiece was genius Ron Howard had you there with Crowe throughout and you could truly feel the depth of this movie and the emotions of its characters, Howard did a fantastic job of captivating the audience and really engaging you as the plot unfolds.

Half way though the movie I stopped and thought that I can't watch the rest because I know what is going to happen. This film did not connect with me because of how predictable it is. The part about this film that I enjoyed is the way maths is expressed in the film though technologies and special effects. This brought to the film something magical. This could either be bad or good. It can make this film less believable but then again we as humans love something magical and untrue to our everyday existence. When watching this film you see the underlying message of how our world is in need of a hero, that can test the great achievers before him and save the world from war. This film also rings truth to the fact the no one can be perfect and you will be banished from society if you are.",A Beautiful Mind
724,VinayNair,Beautifully made,9,11 May 2014,"At first glance, A Beautiful Mind is an inspiring tale about a ""genius"" mathematician who struggles with severe mental problems. And as long as we can focus on that first glance, the film provides compelling entertainment. I found myself caught up in the movie. Director Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood) delivers an intriguing story about a man struggling to maintain clarity as his prodigious powers of imagination bring him inspiration, delusion, true love, and trouble. How rare is this? A film out of Hollywood in which the hero's most heroic endeavour involves restraint and self control! But A Beautiful Mind presents itself as the true story of John Nash, whose mathematical breakthroughs have apparently changed the world. And there's the rub. I came away from A Beautiful Mind feeling inspired to learn more about this fascinating character. And the farther I moved from the movie, the more I began to see it for what it is: a fantasy, at best and at worst, a rip-off game by con-artist. Strong accusations? I suppose so. And for the record, I don't expect films that are ""based on a true story"" to be 100% factual. It's impossible to tell a story that is entirely true to its inspiration; we all invent fictions in order to convey aspects of the truth that are most important to us. But shouldn't movies that claim to be ""based on actual events"" seek to bear some resemblance to those ""actual events""? Is it too much to ask that the film makers and storytellers be reasonable in their embellishments? Watching this film, we endure the hardship of John Nash's mental problems right alongside him. Howard, who has proved time and time again that he can build a decent, workmanlike motion picture does his typically adequate job of telling the story. And the great Russell Crowe brings a lot to the production. Crowe, who deserved an Oscar for his work in The Insider (but received one for Gladiator instead, alas!) is fantastic. He transforms himself into this staggering, bewildered, tormented soul. In spite of a bland script, he gives us glimpses of a hurting spirit, an alienated boy, incapable of discerning the difference between fantasy and reality. It's hard to watch. As we watch Nash grow old, Crowe's performance and make up (some of the finest ageing make up I have ever seen) deliver a completely convincing human being burdened with challenges most of us have never imagined. Nash is a character who isn't comfortable with what we consider ""normal life."" In social circles, he's brusque and rude. Around women, he's awkward and downright insulting. At work, he ridicules the ""great ideas"" of his genius peers, calling their work ""derivative"" and declaring, ""There's not an original or innovative idea in any of it."" Nash's troubles stem from schizophrenic hallucinations, and A Beautiful Mind is the story of his struggle to reject false realities and hold fast to what is true. But he is calm, collected, and right at home whenever he's breaking codes and solving mathematical problems. We can see the potential in him, and so, in spite of his unkindness, we find Nash sympathetic. We root for him when he is drawn into working for a harsh and manipulative government operative (Ed Harris.) And we also root for him to overcome his social awkwardness when an admiring student (the radiant Jennifer Connelly) starts courting him. As a result, A Beautiful Mind stands apart from most Hollywood hero epics, in which we are told again and again to obey our hearts and our impulses. This story dares to suggest that the path to fulfilment and peace requires that we deny of self-destructive impulses. This is the most resonant chord in the film's dissonant symphony. At its heart, A Beautiful Mind is a parable about self-control, and about becoming a better person through the transforming of our minds.It's a shame, then, that the movie contradicts itself.For the sake of crowd pleasing, Howard abandons the thought of restraint when Nash is tempted into romance by a student named Alicia. The allure of a glamorous romance gets the better of him, and their plunge into passion is portrayed without any question about the propriety of such behaviour. Further, we are baited into cheering when Nash lashes out at those around him, because it makes for good spectacle.",A Beautiful Mind
725,krkmz_64,that was awesome!,10,23 December 2012,"Sylvia Nasar does a superb job of informing readers about John Nash's struggles with schizophrenia in the biography A Beautiful Mind. Nash, a Nobel Prize winner, is an eminent mathematician with (in the words of a colleague) ""a beautiful mind."" Unfortunately, it's also a sick mind. Although he manages to function ""normally"" these days, without the aid of medication, Nash is still a schizophrenic (who has an adult son who suffers from the same disease).As moviegoers know, Ron Howard directed the movie version of the book, starring Russell Crowe. While the film does a fine job of introducing audiences to the ins and outs of schizophrenia and the difficulties that caregivers experience while trying to assist someone afflicted with the disease, it shows only the tip of the iceberg. Anyone wanting to know more about what schizophrenia entails should read Nasar's book. It is gripping and reveals the agonies of a schizophrenic life. Thoroughly researched and effectively presented in a cohesive narrative which fully engages the attention of readers, this biography shows how Nash fell prey to the disease and how his family-first his mother and sister, and later his wife-sought to have him treated and provided with the best medical care then available. At one point that treatment called for electric shock treatment (as vividly dramatized in the movie).Nash's colleagues, many of whom had relatives who were schizophrenics or who were schizophrenics themselves, helped him time and time again, when he was at risk of becoming unemployed and/or destitute. Through sheer force of will, Nash managed to pull himself back from the brink and to pursue a life of domestic contentment and professional achievement. His is definitely a story worth knowing. And Nasar relates it in detail and comprehensively, helping readers to appreciate the horror of possibly losing such a beautiful mind.",A Beautiful Mind

Most folks will be able to predict one or even all, but, nevertheless, you are along for the ride with Crowe's character. Even if you are not as surprised by certain story breakthroughs as some will be, the connection you feel to John Nash is undeniable. You want to see him succeed and you want him to just get better.Either way, I consider this film melodrama, with some truly outrageous occurrences that push it into the realm of silly, but, not enough to ruin the overall impact of the film.This film requires your attention for full immersion into the story, but, you will not be disappointed if you put in the effort.",A Beautiful Mind

735,herrmann,A nearly-great film; top-notch acting,9,29 December 2001,"(a review to be read in conjunction with others - I'm not going to rehash synopsis and such)Having read Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Nash (same title), on which the film was loosely based, I was quite turned off by the trailer for this film (as other IMDbers have been).Luckily, the trailer was just a sad attempt at selling the film to audiences who would probably hate it anyway. A Beautiful Mind is an exceptionally classy film, by Hollywood standards. It's on the same level as Cast Away, both films having first-rate directors and casts.Russell Crowe has the tricky job of portraying a man who is a lot more comfortable within his mind than in relating to the rest of the world, and making us care about and empathize with him. And he pulls it off so well that to understand it you will simply have to see the film.Jennifer Connelly is just right for John Nash's wife, Alicia. What a shame that such an intelligent, beautiful actress has been consigned to so many junky parts in the last decade. Hopefully this will give her a bit more good notice.Everyone else is good, too, especially Ed Harris, but to explain further I'd have to spoil.Reviewers have criticized Ron Howard for straying dramatically from the story's biographical source, but then they would also bust him if he stuck too close to the book. The preponderance of changes can be fairly defended as reasonable attempts to bring things from the page to the screen, where people can visualize them. (Books have the advantage of not working in a limited timeframe).Why only ""nearly great,"" when everyone seems to be shouting ""Oscar!"" for Russ or Jen or Ron? Firstly, the music. I've never thought especially much of James Horner's conventional, boring scores and this one is especially disappointing. A more creative composer could have written something that would literally underscore the compelling emotional content of the film.Then, there a few spots, notably the end, in which nuance is thrown out the window (for a car chase or heartstring-pulling moments). Why wreck such a good, subtle film with a few drops of Hollywood saccharine fluid?Thanks for reading.",A Beautiful Mind

738,Maher-Shalal-Hash-Bazzy,Yet another example of why the Academy sucks,2,7 June 2002,"A Beautiful Mind was not the Best Picture of the year.  I'm sorry, but that distinction goes to In the Bedroom.  A Beautiful Mind wasn't even in the top 20.  The story was, for the most part, predictable and not involving.  I won't even go into the many, many inaccuracies in the film.  The entire time I found myself just wishing the movie would end.First of all, Russell Crowe was far from convincing as a genius.  His accent was beyond inconsistent and he never, not for even the smallest moment, convinced me that he WAS John Nash.  I can find solace in the fact that he didn't get the Oscar for this overrated performance.  It's a shame they can't take back the one they gave him last year.Jennifer Connelly was decent in a role that I, among others, feel should not have been categorized as supporting.  Either way, it wasn't even the best supporting performance of the year.  That prize should have gone to Marisa Tomei.  I think Connelly is a very fine actress and if she deserved an Oscar it was for her performance in Requiem for a Dream in 2000.  She wasn't even nominated for that.  What a travesty.  But I digress...I saw nothing in the movie that would have warranted a Best Director nod for Ron Howard either.  He's a capable director, but this was nowhere near an Oscar-worthy job.  Take a look at what David Lynch did in Mulholland Dr. or what Christopher Nolan did in Memento or even Ridley Scott in Black Hawk Down.  These are examples of greatness.A Beautiful Mind is not an example of greatness.  It is an over-hyped, overrated, piece of fluff trying to sell itself as something meaningful. And way too many people bought it.  With such extraordinary pieces of work submitted this year, what a true shame that this refuse was given the distinction as the best.",A Beautiful Mind

744,smordona,The story of a genius dumbed down for us yokels.,4,19 March 2002,"It's the usual problem with a film about someone whose accomplishments are less easy to demonstrate than touchdowns or legislation passed or wars won: How do you convey even a taste of what makes an artist an artist, or in this case, a genius a genius?Let me say right off that I don't particularly care about possible factual errors in a biopic, unless they're so glaring as to oppose the spirit of their subject (i.e., depicting Muhammad Ali as a Nazi or Himmler as a Muslim).What really bothers me about this well-acted (by the leads) but safe and pat movie is that the filmmakers had plenty of access to details of Nash's accomplishments, but decided not to let us in on the secret(s).  Perhaps the studio just decided we movie-going yokels wouldn't be interested in that kind of thing... and judging from the mega-box office success of the film, maybe they were right.The film is called ""A Beautiful Mind"", and Nash is a Nobel-winning mathematician, but rather than delve into exactly what made his theories so revolutionary, screenwriter Akiva (the Batman series, Lost In Space) Goldsman and director Ron (Night Shift, Apollo 13) Howard feed us the glowing comments of others & a cute but not entirely plausible explanation of Nash's revolutionary work.  Instead, the film focuses on (fictional) paranoid delusions in order to pander to the sympathies of some.  Why not show (rather than tell) us what made this man so brilliant?It's very difficult to create an artist, much less a genius on screen (""Pollock"", ""Amadeus"", and ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" are among the notable exceptions), but in my opinion that is what would have made this a special film.  Instead, it's the usual bland button-pushing, lifted by Crowe's extraordinary performance and strong work by Harris and Connelly in support.This one's not as hilariously undeserving of the statue as ""Gladiator"", ""Out Of Africa"", and ""Braveheart"", but it will settle in nicely with the likes of ""Chariots Of Fire"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in the bland and forgettable bin, should this heavy favorite win Best Picture in 2002.",A Beautiful Mind

746,yellowcherry,This film left me disappointed.,5,25 June 2002,"My friends highly recommended ""A Beautiful Mind,"" saying that it was a great movie that left some of them bawling at the end. However, I failed to see why this film has gathered so much praise and is being hailed as one of the best movies of all time.Russell Crowe did perform well and convincingly portrayed a ""crazy"" man. However, I felt no emotion throughout the film and only teared up when I saw that poor imaginary girl cry. Anything can make me cry...but only the sight of the little innocent face was able to evoke my tears in this work. I observed the struggles and pain that Alicia Nash had to endure but the film still failed to emotionally involve me. Occasionally, I wondered when the film would end as it seemed to drag on. The screenplay didn't seem spectacular and the film could have done a better job conveying the actual importance of Nash's accomplishments. From just watching the film, I didn't really understand why Nash received the Nobel Prize or what it was that made Mr. Nash so special. Maybe Akiva Goldsman's intention was to focus on the ""power of love"" during difficult times. Nash's character needed more definition and development as the film's drama was just like any other old drama in other films. The only difference that this film had from others was that it had a schizophrenic based on a true character and a younger wife suffering from the marriage she entered. Basically, I view it as a love story with a total of three scenes of flirting and then a woman having to put up with her psycho husband - who ends up smacking her down by accident and nearly drowning their baby. That was it. Oh yeah, the woman sticks with him for forty years that the audience barely gets to see. As for the main character, he makes some hilarious remarks, scribbles furiously, observes pigeons, cuts up magazines, gradually descends into madness, fights the Russians in his mind, takes steps toward improvement, gets himself into a hospital, digs his way into his arm searching for a mysterious code implant, ignores his imaginary friends, and then wins the Nobel Prize. Great! Just great. There was just something missing in that mix that would have made it more appealing to me. If it was supposed to be capitalizing on the Nashs' struggles, it could have had stronger and more developed relations/scenes between John and Alicia. A little more background on both of the characters would not have hurt as it was already so long. At the end, I was alarmed that Nash had already became so old. I was worried that I had missed the good part and anxiously awaited the last scenes. Was the scene where he got all of those pens supposed to make me cry? Why was he so respected again? The film never really told me.Overall, the film was ...average. The few moments of comedy was actually better than the slow and unengaging drama that made my head hurt. I don't know anything more about John Nash than I did before I viewed the film. It doesn't deserve to be in the top 250.",A Beautiful Mind

That guy from 'The Sound of Music.' Ron Howard. All these big names were attached, and it was based on a true story, so I was pretty excited about seeing it.Then, I saw the movie. I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed. The plot was thin and way too predictable (I knew from the get-go that the roommate was a figment of Nash's schizophrenic mind). And I didn't find some of the events that were triggered by Nash's condition to be very realistic. It felt more like I was watching a badly-written yet beautifully photographed after-school special. I just didn't experience Nash's fear the way he did. Maybe because I knew about the roommate, I can't be sure. But it the scenes with the agent just didn't do it for me. Overall, despite some of the awesome acting involved (Jennifer did deserve that Academy Award) and the beautiful cinematography, I felt like 'A Beautiful Mind' was overrated and nothing new. It was just too predictable, and after awhile, I really didn't care about the character of John Nash anymore. I wanted to hear more about how his wife and son coped, and I felt like we could have seen more contrast between the respect Nash got later in life with the skepticism and mockery he was met with when word of his condition became public.Sorry folks, but it stinks.

755,leoguy,A beautiful mind is a terrible thing to waste.,5,27 January 2002,"Having read the biography of John Nash, this film by Ron Howard was a great disappointment to me.  Nash's real life was much more interesting and complex than Howard's Hollywood version.  Films must, of course, take liberties with books, and, in this case, with reality, but a great writer and/or director knows how to find the necessary balance.  Unfortunately, Ron Howard chose to rely on ""gimmicks"" instead of true creativity in his version of John Nash's fascinating life.  What a waste!Do yourself a favor, read the real story and skip the movie version.",A Beautiful Mind
756,msusman,Another amazing performance from Russell Crowe,8,7 December 2001,"I was worried that Ron Howard would turn this fascinating story into another of his simple-minded, sappy movies. So I was very pleasantly surprised to find instead that the film resists simple explanations and solutions and avoids sloppy sentimentality until the final scene.  Russell Crowe is fantastic as always, disappearing into the character and evoking empathy for the troubled, brilliant John Nash, not pity. The film is moving and genuinely surprising. Definitely recommended.",A Beautiful Mind
757,freedom1122,Where's the Beauty?,2,31 March 2002,"I do have to give credit to Ron Howard for trying so hard to show us the power of the mind to overcome all obstacles. Howard's heart was in the right place, but unfortunately, the movie failed to demonstrate the intended message. John Nash does not overcome his obstacles completely. In fact, he is not completely able to function until he does take medication. While his struggle is appreciated, he isn't fully able to overcome his daemons, leaving this viewer feeling only despair at the end of the movie.",A Beautiful Mind
758,PhoenixBlade,A Beautiful Movie,10,28 February 2002,"A Beautiful Mind is definitely a beautiful movie. Please note that when I considering seeing the movie, I raised my expectations considerably. I knew how great the cast and crew were but was afraid of being sorely disappointed. Now, as I look back on the movie and some particular scenes all I can say is that there is no excuse for not to buying a ticket and sitting through two and a half hours of one of the most beautifully crafted, acted and directed movies of all time.A Beautiful Mind tells the story of the 1994 Nobel award winning Mathematician professor John Nash (Russell Crowe) since he arrived at Princeton University until today. Right from the beginning of the movie you understand that Nash is different from everyone else, but only about halfway through the movie do you understand just how different he is.Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant as Dr. John Nash and is to be put on an altar somewhere for every other actor to idolize. From the first moment you first see him in the movie until the ending credits you understand that he's not Crowe, he's John Nash. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as Alicia, Ed Harris is incredible as Parcher and so are all the other actors (especially Paul Bettany as Charles!).A word of warning, though, this is one movie that will definitely mess with your emotions and requires some kind of patience. But believe me, this is one of the most amazing movies ever. It definitely dethroned all my other favorite movies, shooting right to the top. If you see one movie this year, make it A Beautiful Mind.",A Beautiful Mind
759,ruralron,I loved it,10,5 January 2002,"Last year I was a bit upset when Russell Crowe won best actor at the Academy Awards.  Not that he wasn't good in ""Gladiator,"" but I felt that Tom Hanks was better in ""Cast Away.""  Now I find myself rooting for Crowe to win the Oscar for his portrayal of John Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind."" His performance was sensational.Generally, I'm not that fond of straight drama, being more attracted to action or fantasy/science fiction.  This movie was an exception. It's a quality job on all levels, a serious work based on a true story, and surpasses Apollo 13 as my favorite Ron Howard film.""A Beautiful Mind"" is a beautiful movie -- go see it.",A Beautiful Mind

I went in to this movie not expecting a lot, and came out crying at the end.  If you stereotyped Crowe from his performance in Gladiator (as I did) as 'just another pretty piece of meat', this movie will shatter that idea, and you will see how versatile he can be as an actor.",A Beautiful Mind
761,cyrus_ken,Excellent movie,9,11 January 2002,"Wow!! Russell Crowe can act. I liked the Gladiator, but in this role he demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt, he is a very good actor. His character reminded me of Rain Man but with a sense of humor. He made me believe in his character. John Nash was brought to life. The scene in the hospital, with his wife watching, was fantastic.

So, after just seeing it, I think it is a good movie and worth seeing. (If you are debating.) The story was a little different from what I thought it would be, it will surprise you, it did me. This is not a light movie it has a little bit of a heavy story that will make you think some.Ron Howard has done it again! The acting in Beautiful Mind was very good Russell Crowe played the role well, and I had forgotten that Jennifer Connelly was in this movie (very nice performance)I enjoy Beautiful Mind and I think you will too.",A Beautiful Mind

To a wanna-be economist like myself, watching such a great portrayal of John Nash is awe-inspiring. Yes, I am aware that some bits in the film aren't faithful to all parts of Nash's life...but as a film, very few can compare. Crowe plays Nash perfectly, and after all, a schizophrenic is surely a hard part to play.In summary, every detail of this film was truly great. I can find no fault in it at all...I can't believe its currently only rated 7.9 stars...it should be in 9's at least.Definitely, definitely watch it...",A Beautiful Mind

Incredible direction, incredible acting, incredible story, incredible everything.This is the type of film that actually needs to viewed more than once because the first time out you will be overwhelmed and may not actually experience all it has to offer. Not a typical Ron Howard film by any means.",A Beautiful Mind

But this one wants to be so much more than others and only partly succeeds at that. Like its main character, constantly on the search for ""the original idea"", something new, something amazing. And like the main character it tries to force things to happen. Russell Crowe does some class A acting, as do all others including especially Charles Herman and Ed Harris. Yet the movie gets hung up on spy stories and although they may not be real (but part of Crowe's characters sickness) they take up too much time...So go watch this one, but try to forget it was nominated for SOOO many Oscars...",A Beautiful Mind
772,cmsykes-2,A Beautiful Film,8,5 November 2021,"I knew roughly what to expect from this film just from hearing other's reviews about it. What I didn't expect was the dipping and diving as the plot took me from one emotion to another. This is really a film that deserves the credit it gets. It is pretty much as good a film could be before it becomes one of those artistic cult classics due to it's historical significance/novel storyline/first-of-it's-kind creative venture. It's not quite Shawshank or Apocalypse Now or The Matrix, nor is it trying to be, but it's the very cream of the next tier down. If you've seen The Imitation Game, or The Da Vinci Code, or The Theory of Everything, it's that sort of a movie, it reminds me of those beautiful stories done beautifully.In short it's a story of genius. As for the ride, yes I didn't expect so many tears, or smiles, or frustrations, or even LOLs. I also did a bit of research on John Nash afterwards, which I'd recommend doing to put things into perspective, especially if you're interested in Mental Health. How we used to treat these conditions in the past is truly the stuff of nightmares, and similar to The Imitation Game, it will leave you reeling and ashamed.....but is there a beautiful, happy ending....?....you'll have to find out won't you.",A Beautiful Mind

In fact the acting in this movie is pretty much flawless and very well cast. Jennifer Connelly (winner of Best Supporting Actress Oscar) is fantastic as the loving yet somewhat emotionally drained wife.This movie does take a fair while to really get going and for those of us who didn't get the highest mark in maths at school a lot of the jargon will go over our heads. But be patient by about the 40 min mark things start falling into place and the pace goes up a couple of gears with a few twist and turns along the way.The Cinematography is beautiful thru out so I have no complaints there. In fact I don't have many complaints at all its pretty much a flawless movie thou for me it just misses out on the full 10 marks because as previously stated there's a lot of things that went over my head and it takes a while to gain a decent pace. I would def recommend it to fans of Biopics and Drama.If You like movies such as 'The Aviator' 'Good Will Hunting' and the 'Bourne'series then you should enjoy this movie and vice versa if you enjoy the movie and after something similar those mentioned would be a good place to start.Thanks for reading really hope you enjoy this movie.",A Beautiful Mind
774,fernandolvenegas,Excellent human story,10,31 May 2002,"This is an excellent human story.  Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are both excellent.  I do wonder why they did not stick to the fact that John Nash's wife was from El Savador.  It would not have hurt the story and maybe would have added a layer to the character.  I don't agree  with the people who were upset over all of his life not being included, inlcuding suggestions that Nash had homosexual relationships.  This is a work of fiction, not a biography or documentary.  But I do think it is unfortunate that Latinos only get cast as parts specifically written as Latino and that anglo actors get the opportunity to play Latinos.  There is not equal opportunity in Hollywood and it is disappointing.  Anyway, getting to the story! - I do think it is a wonderful, human story.  Ron Howard did a great job and I think it deserved all the attention at the Academy awards.  It's nice to see something that is about people, about humna relationships, and about someone overcoming illness and obstacles.  It is human without being sappy.",A Beautiful Mind

It is beautifully orchestrated and so realistic that you cannot believe Russell Crowe is acting--kudos to Crowe and to director Ron Howard.Mental illness is too often seen as degrading and frightening, and is stereotypically exemplified as someone being ""crazy,"" ""loony,"" or sailing less than gracefully upon the ship of fools. ""A Beautiful Mind"" portrays not only the onset of mental illness but also allows the viewer an inside glimpse into the realities of the schizophrenic's un-reality. Beautiful, and above reproach!!",A Beautiful Mind
776,klassa,"good movie, but a far stretch from reality",7,18 August 2002,"I hate it when movies based on reality are, in fact, nowhere near the truth. If you read anything at all about John Nash, you'll see that both his life and his Nobel acceptance speech were nothing like what this movie portrays. I liked the movie, but would it have been such a terrible thing to make it realistic?",A Beautiful Mind
777,NKMacGuffin,"Crowe shines in this otherwise solid, workmanlike biography",7,1 August 2002,"Russell Crowe stars in the story (based on real events) of John Forbes Nash Jr, a mathematics genius. In the first third of the film, we learn that Nash is brilliant, intolerant of lazy thinking, and introverted to a fault. ""I don't like other people, and they don't like me"" he remarks. His whole mind is tied to creating a 'truly original idea'. Director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Ransom) goes to great lengths to show us how revolutionary and cool Nash's ideas are. Thankfully, Nash only explains himself once, and then at a suitably earthy level that everyone can understand.The first half of the film feels like Good Will Hunting crossed with North By Northwest. A math genius plunged into cloak-and-dagger intrigue. Only at the midway point do we learn that there's more in Nash's (and Howard's) Mind than we thought.Howard is the king of the safe, dependable movie you can safely take your parents to see. Nothing challenging, nothing revolutionary, just quality, mainstream entertainment. There's nothing remarkable here, except for another (sigh) revelatory performance from Russell Crowe. There are no great lines, no great scenes, but to watch Crowe react to the outside stimulus to his interior world. Howard draws out Nash's overactive mind through a labyrinth of mathematical notation, but we can see Nash's wheels turning in the eyes of Crowe.Jennifer Connelly (Pollock, Requiem for a Dream), in her highest profile role of her career, is splendid as Nash's wife and only connection to the real world. She is an intelligent, educated woman who loves Nash's heart over his mind. Her character is well-formed on the page, and she plays the conflicts between the heart and mind, the real world and the metaphysical, with grace.Ed Harris is Ed Harris. Always superb (Pollock, Apollo 13), he does a fine job as a G-man doggedly pursuing Nash's genius for the good of the country. In his 1940's spook suit, he looks tough and mean enough to beat up Humphrey Bogart.The movie has the potential to be excellent, but steps back into very good territory in the last third. When making a biopic of a real person (Nash is alive and well) you must choose whether to tell THE story OF a man's life, or A story IN a man's life. Howard tries for both and the movie suffers for it. Once Nash conquers his struggles, the film continues for (what feels like) twenty minutes, covering the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties and Nineties. This incredibly boring section is necessary to get us to a 1994 Nobel Prize nomination, and a completely fictional acceptance speech. The story IN his life was over decades earlier. If Nash were a fictional character, these 20 minutes would never have made the final cut. Howard felt the need (out of respect) to conclude the movie on the best, happiest, and least ambiguous note possible. No doubt can be left in the viewer's mind that everything turned out okay.Crowe shines in this otherwise solid, workmanlike biography. You can always count on Howard for quality product, but it wouldn't hurt the film to trim a little.",A Beautiful Mind

Jennifer Connely, who usually carries herself well  has totally bombed. Her over-acting and ridiculous appearence only added to the movies undeniable failure.

779,grimrocker,"Not a ""true"" Biopic, but makes the cut",7,16 November 2009,"Right, so with over a thousand comments (or reviews; whichever way you want to put it) why should you read this one if you chanced upon this? Well coz' this is about as honest as it can get from a pure movie-lover.If you want to really find out about the guy (John Nash) on whom this movie is based on, then you're better off reading about him on Wikipedia or watching a documentary called ""A Brilliant Madness"". While this movie appears to be a biopic on the genius-troubled-mathematician John, it actually portrays a lot of factual errors. So flawed as it may be it does come good in showing the spirit of the guy in discussion which no one dares question.I actually didn't enjoy the movie completely mainly because I saw through the script some time back even though I didn't know anything about the movie before watching it. I guess when you have seen quite a lot of movies on similar themes such as Fightclub, The Machinist... where the central character imagines things and people that are not, it's not hard for you to ""predict"" what's gonna happen. But then as the movie neared it's end I realized the movie is not so much of a puzzle as it is about the life of a brilliant mathematician told through a movie. So I started appreciating the movie at the end and it's suffice to say that I wasn't totally disappointed.The movie is best enjoyed without any strings attached; cos' the movie actually takes a lotta liberties with the original book it was based on. But the biggest flaw in my view has to be Russel Crowe who doesn't seem to fit the role he'd been given. I'd rather see him play roles like The Gladiator and these kind of roles should be reserved for more versatile actors like Johnny Depp. All in all a 7/10 seems good enough for this one.",A Beautiful Mind

This is a film in which at first you make your own decisions on what has happened and what is just in Johns mind. In the beginning you are unaware of his illness and the film becomes almost a spy drama, but things begin to change.  The beauty of this film is that you are not spoon fed the plot as is the cast in most of Hollywoods films, some could be confused.  You need to watch the film from beginning to end. This film draws you in and forces you to journey with John through his life and his troubles.  He should have got the Oscar.",A Beautiful Mind

Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia.

Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work.This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly.As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie.A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definitely the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade.

I saw on the trivia section attached to this film that Tom Cruise was set to play Nash. That would have not worked.Im truly glad he didn't. Russell Crowe inhibits Nash with every fibre of his being, for a while there you forget its him. Tom cruise had never done that for me.

It utterly concentrated on his schizophrenia and this is what point 2 is about. 2) Schizophrenia literally filled all the movie which got really really boring in the middle.

Beautifully played by Russell Crowe and Connelly, this film manages to move and engage you in the story thanks to the screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman and thanks to the soundtrack composed by Horner, beautifully directed by Ron Howard, but what the film is well acted, well- written and well directed, I did not like one thing, the film is based mainly on Nash's schizophrenia, but does not show his discoveries, the film goes forward in time saying that Nash has made the findings, but the findings are not in the movie shown, but only mentioned, I personally would have done even see the discoveries made, but belonging to this small defect is a film absolutely perfect, well acted, well directed and well written, and especially with a beautiful finish that between the title of the tail feels All Love Can Be beautiful song sung by Charlotte Church.

After reading Patrick Radden Keefe's book, ""Chatter"" the author gives an insight into the workings of the 'secret agencies' such as the NSA, CIA etc. The author goes on to tell us the difficulties of finding out information and that many people he interviews try to hide the fact that the workings of these agencies exist at all. It seems to gives 'us' an uncertainty as to whether we are being monitored, being surveyed on? by the outside world or is it just paranoia?I like the way Beautiful mind shows Nash continually looking for threats, not being safe in the knowledge that he holds a secret.But, although we find out that Nash is someone with a mental condition, i'm sure these worries do affect the 'real' people who work in the Cyrpto departments. It must be a challenge to keep things secret and not be able to comment on the line of their work with their family.Beautiful mind raises these issues nicely which i'm sure, in reality, do exist for some.The numbers are an interesting part of the film and for me as an art student it is interesting to see Nash go into cracking mode by filtering out the unwanted numbers and focusing on the connections between them.",A Beautiful Mind

The story is realistic that follows the real life of John Forbes Nash Jr, a math genius that suffered over the years due to schizophrenia. He is one of the few famous lunatics, and could saw the world in a way that we no one could imagine. What surprised me the most is that he overcame the mental disease by his will and after fierce battles with his inner self, he won the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his game theory in economic.During the hard time, his wife, Jennifer Connelly. The perfect lady who had a beautiful mind hadn't giving up him all the time, and saw him through the illness. Nash gave a acceptance speech as follows when he won the Nobel Prize.""I've always believe in numbers, in the equation and logics that lead to reason, but after a lifetime of search pursuits, I ask, what truly is logic, who decides reason, my quest has taken me through physical and metaphysical, the delusional, and back. And I have made the most important discovery of my career, the most important discovery of my life, it is only in the mysterious equation of love, that any logical reasons can be found, I am only here because of you, you are the reason I am, you are all my reasons.""",A Beautiful Mind

The one he failed to support financially. What about his strained relationship with his wife? What about the ridiculous and non-factual introduction of his imaginary friends, which are used as a Greek chorus by Howard and the writers, because they can't move the story along any other way. Don't waste your time with the movie, read the book which is infinitely more interesting and gives you a real sense of the human being. Not this badly directed and filmed Hollywood whitewash. Ron Howard is probably one of the least interesting directors working in Hollywood today. So save your time and money, watch the PBS documentary or read the book.",A Beautiful Mind
793,dm_rocs,Amazing Performances By A Stellar Cast,9,26 March 2005,"A Beautiful Mind was easily the picture of the year, and Ron Howard deserved the accolades he received. I don't understand why he is criticized by some as undeserving of the Oscar.The one thing that will always perplex me is the fact that Russell Crowe was over-looked for the Acadamy Award for Best Actor. Not only did his acting carry this picture, without it, it probably wouldn't have been so well received. His ability to capture the essence of the person he is portraying (ie. his portrayal of Dr. Wigand in The Insider) is unbelievable.To think that Denzel Washington won the Oscar for his portrayal of a ""bad"" cop in Training Day. Denzel is a great actor that I have a lot of respect for, but he shouldn't have been rewarded for this performance (he was better in Hurricane).I can't even imagine what the Acadamy voters were thinking that year.This movie is definitely worth the price of admission. It was also worth the purchase price. I get to enjoy it again and again.",A Beautiful Mind
794,monty_100,It Certainly is Beautiful,8,12 September 2017,"A Beautiful Mind is directed by Ron Howard and stars Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, and is about the life and career of John Nash, a mathematician who is studying at Princeton. Despite being a somewhat arrogant man, he maintains respect from fellow students and even attracts a women into his life.However his world comes to a crashing halt when the life he thought he was in no longer exists...The film is predominantly focused around the subject of mental illness. A topic alien for some, for others it makes the film really hit home. The film does a great job of explaining the basics while leaving out all of the difficult jargon and technical terms. It makes it become a learning experience for viewers.The chemistry between Russell and Jenifer is outstanding here. They play off each other so well, making a close bond between them develop very quickly and with so much richness. A highlight of this for me is the first date they go on together. Its a beautiful collection of small scenes and for me could of been a vignette standing on its own.A valuable message is made here. People with mental illness just want to be understood; to not be judged for the things out of their control. It is not their fault, and Alicia could see that in John. I suppose that this can be relatable for everyone and not just mental health sufferers. Accept people's quirks and only see the good in someone.I do have only a few slight reservations with this film. It isn't a true depiction of who John Nash was a person (Russells character being greatly romanticised), and the time line of events is incorrect at the end. However these are a few minor nit picks to what was an incredibly heart felt film, that wanted to spread whatever education and awareness it could around a subject people generally find uncomfortable talking about, but in this current time is gaining more a more momentum.Overall this was a very powerful film and deserved all of the acclaim and awards it received. I urge anyone who is unsure or who hasn't experienced mental illness in some form, to watch it. You may learn something new.",A Beautiful Mind

How can you have a biopic with a deeply flawed plot? I don't know but somehow this movie managed to make no sense. Russel Crowe plays Nash the way he plays every other character. This character works as a gladiator, not as mathematician. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this movie because of any glaring factual errors, although I have been told there are many. No, this is a work of fiction, and it fails as such. There is nothing to connect to on a human level in this film, except Jennifer Connely, but one strong performance cannot save the bad script and uninspired direction. Avoid this film if any sort of internal consistency or humanity are important to you in film.",A Beautiful Mind
796,dinethjay,Amazing.,10,27 June 2016,"I was initially reluctant to watch the movie as I had just watched the "" Theory of Everything"", but was eventually convinced by the raving reviews on IMDb.The movie is about the story of a brilliant, introverted, shy and often arrogant man named John Nash, a great mathematician who has made fundamental contributions to the fields of computing, evolutionary biology, economics and many more.The movie highlights Nash's struggle to break through in the field of science and his far more daunting struggle with paranoid schizophrenia a mental illness that begins to afflict him in his 30's and nearly devastates his career. Ron Howard unfolds the story through Nash's point of view and this helps to shine light onto the true chilling and terrible nature of paranoid schizophrenia in a way that no medical textbook can. We watch in horror as Nash's life crumbles before his eyes when he realizes that his best friend, and occupation are just figments of his imagination. The power of love and hope are shown as Nash's wife single-handedly supports the family and prevents Nash from falling apart and succumbing to his delusions.Russell Crowe's acting is phenomenal and he brings life to John Nash in a way that that I doubt no other actor can.This is a heart-wrenching, amazing true story about the life of a troubled man with a beautiful mind, and is one of the best movies I have ever watched.10 stars.",A Beautiful Mind

Is that plausible? Of course not. Schizophrenia it is.The movie is well-done, it is the first insights I have into schizophrenia. I found it interesting learning about Nash's path in life, his struggles as a student and as a sick person and his connection to academia. Naturally, the movie had to end in him claiming his nobel prize, that would be the only correct ending point.As a master's student in mathematics who is currently dealing with chronic health issues, I can relate to Nash's situation.

This film didn't just tell the story word for word for an audience to just to see what happened in Nash's life, director Ron Howard highlights his self-discovery experience especially and uses it as an educational tool for people to learn from, which is very important for people to understand how hard it is to acknowledge something harrowing like schizophrenia. The film makes you tag on to John Nash's life and you don't formally know he has schizophrenia until he finds out himself, at first you doubt it as much as he did, but it's what you're suppose to think. The film teaches you to empathise with not just schizophrenics but for all people who suffer different strains of mental illness.Howard converts psychological experiences onto screen in ways for the audience to experience Nash's episodes of delusions and hallucinations. This is a very substansial way of empathising for him and prove that something like schizophrenia is not easy to get over.Ron Howard further presents another theme which is the power of love. John Nash's life was going downhill but thanks to the help of his wife he manages to get through it. This shows that love is an excellent source of motivation for which you can learn from.A Beautiful Mind is an educational masterpiece",A Beautiful Mind

As the Nashs, Crowe and Connelly strike the perfect notes as foils for each other: he the tempestuous genius, she the calm that weathers the storm. And Bettany gives another strong supporting turn as Nash's ""imaginary friend"", as it were, a phantom of support that Nash is required to finally abandon for sanity.Only horrific aging makeup at the film's end prevent it from being a flawlessly executed piece of studio production.",A Beautiful Mind
802,haroonsheikh-78211,It was very intersting,8,1 May 2018,The story is well developed and unique idea with outstanding acting,A Beautiful Mind
803,Simbabbad,Schizophrenia is ragged and dirty,1,5 February 2002,"... and in *no way* as clean, logical, and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches.I'm 27, and I've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the film, I was successful mainly because of logic : because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality, and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. In the end, I was really successful because of medication, by the way, but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.So, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does it cheat with the main character's story (who wasn't faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a comforting, tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.Schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic *isn't* a ""normal man with a disease"", it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him, things like time, space, and people's personalities aren't solid things. He feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world which ""normal"" people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people, and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank, delusive dead end.This is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous ""cure"", tear-jerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, like in Lynch's ""Eraserhead"", for example. There should be *really* impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about *details*.I mean, watch ""Naked Lunch"", ""Lost Highway"", read P.K. Dick's ""Martian Time-Split"" or ""Ubik"", DO watch ""The Cell"", ""Perfect Blue"", ""Dark City"", or play ""American McGee's Alice"" on PC, and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. Don't watch the ""feel good"" movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. ""The Cell"" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary.Once again, Schizophrenia isn't about details, it's not a neat, tame trick played to you. It jumps in your face and won't let you go : walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go backward in time, you're not sure you're who you think you are, everything feels... strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama",A Beautiful Mind
804,edge-7,Movie is too distant to get feel attached to any of the characters,6,31 January 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" seems to buy into itself too much and leaves the viewer wondering what's going on.  Unrealistic and unexplained sequences that are supposedly only in John Nash's head seem to get in the way of a story that could be interesting.  We are never really told why Nash is famous or if he actually did work for the CIA.  The love story between his wife (Jennifer Connely) is, again, not realistic in it's approach. Why does she fall in love with him and, more importantly, why do they get married and stay together.  Russell Crowe is good as John Nash, but the distance created between the actor and the audience is too much.  Jennifer Connely is good as well, but it is hard to figure her character out.  I never felt attached to either character, and didn't want to root for them to overcome.  Some of the scenes between the two are so over-the-top; the star-gazing scene is especially silly.  The last half hour of the movie is better, as we know what is going on and his life is explained.  The first portion of the movie is distant and cold, leaving a lot desired by the audience who wants to know who this guy is and what is really going on.  It is unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" when it is such a cool surprise when you find out he is actually dead. The imaginary characters in his head are never explained to having any relevance to his disease.  Not that is has to be spelled out, but why a little girl and his best friend who he never had.

Although the story was a bit of fiction (they somehow left out the real reason Nash left Wheeler Labs), it was actually a beautiful, inspiring and powerful story. In addition to the excellent story and directing, the acting was fabulous. When we sat down in the theatre, I said to my girlfriend ""Russell Crowe has a monumental task ahead of him: convincing me that he's a math dork, not General Maximus or Officer Bud White.""  I have to say that if anyone deserves an Oscar this year it is Russell Crowe.  He makes the audience compassionate for his character in a way that is not often seen.  Paul Bettany, Jennifer Conolley, and Ed Harris were also excellent in the supporting cast.  Overall, I gave this movie a '10.'  It is rare when Hollywood puts out such a wonderful movie.

Simply put, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 8 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie, thanks to the Oscar-inducing performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players.  They are not merely acting, yet are transformed into the characters, leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality. Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow, and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Ron Howard can nearly be forgiven for his work on ""The Grinch"" for the inspiring work he has contributed to this film, and I hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.I know that most reviews give you a synopsis of the film, revealing many of its major details to give you a picture of whether or not you would enjoy a film, but I've never been one to spoil movies with plot details.  I can only tell you that if you're looking for an emotionally-charged movie with near perfect acting, cinematography, directing, editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of John Nash to inspire you, then consider ""A Beautiful Mind.""In closing, if Crowe isn't awarded the Best Actor Oscar this year, then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished.",A Beautiful Mind

The fact that Ron Howard directed makes it all the more worth seeing. I RARELY cry outside of moments with my wife and newborn son, but at the tail end of this movie even my eyes watered.

It will be a crime if he does not receive an Oscar for this role just because he won one last year.  Ron Howard has crafted a film of such emotion and power, it will also be criminal if he does not receive the recognition he deserves at Oscar time.  Jennifer Connelly is fantastic, as are the other supporting characters.  My only complaint about the movie is the choice of Charlotte Church for the vocals on the soundtrack; I'm not sure what it is, maybe her voice is just too ""instrument-like,"" but I was very disappointed in her performance of the love theme, ""All Love Can Be.""

This man, who saw everything in life a little different, was tormented down to his very soul by the part inside of him that seperated and made him the brilliant man he was.  Russell Crowe was able to lay every other character he's ever played aside (and even laid his own persona aside) to pick up and thereby bring life to John Forbes Nash Jr.  Crowe's Nash was multi-faceted, disturbed, genius, and passionate all rolled in to one brilliant performance.Some have much to say for Mr. Crowe and the kind of man he is.  His award winning performance in Gladiator was exhilrating and he very much so deserved the Oscar.  (Although, I think we all could have done without the inflated ego after the fact.)  But as an aspiring dramatic actor, he deserves every vote of his nomination for his portrayal of Nash.

You really feel for the mathematician as his problems worsen. That Nash is able to eke out so much triumph from his troubled life is a tremendous affirmation of the human spirit. It's based on a true story, but rather large liberties were taken with the story as it is told in the book. That's not really a bad thing, but somebody involved with the making of this movie did make a bad decision to use a rather common trick these days, used in movies as varied as ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Sliding Doors."" The trick involves presenting the audience with a point of view other than the standard movie narrative. The mistake made in this movie is that the view of Nash's hallucinations is presented so that the audience thinks there's a conspiracy for most of the movie.

817,brookifyd,Poorly conceived female character...,4,22 March 2002,"A Beautiful Mind does many things right: smooth, professional aesthetics, a solid story, and an interesting well developed character, John Nash (Crowe).  I did however have one major problem with the film-- the characterization of Alicia, Nash's wife.Although Jennifer Connelly may have ""acted"" well, I found her character highly problematic.  How could a smart, beautiful woman (studying at MIT) who seems so normal not have any qualms or relational problems with her husband?  Why, in the first place, would she be attracted to someone who appears twenty years older than her (whether he is or not), who is her teacher, and ultimately, a dork.   Even if the disbelief is suspended in considering the nuptials, why would she stay loyally at his side through all his psycho tendencies, and on top of that, not have any suspicion that she married a schizophrenic? Although this 'dream girl' of the movies may work in less respectable films or comedies, I was disappointed to find such stereotypical characterization in a serious, critically acclaimed film.    I'm sorry, but I've never met anyone like this.Part of the problem with her characterization I think stems from two ""Hollywoodisms"" to the adaptation: first, omitting the complex and confusing nature of Nash's love life (i.e. the period of homosexuality) in an effort to make the film mainstream friendly, and secondly, the technique of making his schizophrenia appear real for the first half of the film (ala Sixth Sense).  I don't think the film needed to address his homosexuality, but it did need to acknowledge and deal with his complexity in a sexual relationship, and the identity crisis that accompanies it.  His relationship with his wife, however, becomes too stable, too simple, and too easy. Yes she cries towards the end, and may get upset, but where are the problems in their relationship earlier, does this woman have a major issue with denial?  The stunt of not having his condition apparent for the first half of the film further complicates the character Alicia, as she also must be unaware of his condition for this portion of the film.  In reality, however, how could one be?My final criticism is that the pacing was too slow, but I won't rip the film apart any more.  I was just disappointed that such a rich characterization of an interesting man had to be sandwiched with plot candy and typical Hollywood notions of women.Brooke",A Beautiful Mind

The fact that Ron Howard directed this piece also put A Beautiful Mind into the ""must see"" category.And I was not let down.Russell played the role of a schizophrenic genius perfectly, with actions and facial expressions accurately reflective of sufferers of this condition. Whilst I felt the supporting cast merely held their own without any obvious standout performances, Ron Howard's brilliant interpretation of university life from the 1940s to the present capped off a wonderfully rounded story.It was refreshing to witness a narrative on mental illness portrayed from the other side of the fence for a change.

If there ever was a 10 movie, this is it.  A Beautiful Mind easily makes my top 10 list of all time.  Crowe's performance is unbelievable!  Is this the same guy who put an end to the Roman empire just a year ago? **SPOILER** In most movies that deal with someone battling a mental illness, you see the person from an external standpoint.  Thus, it becomes hard to truly relate to his or her situation.  However, Mr. Howard just about leads the audience to believe that they are out of touch with reality right along with John Nash. ** END OF SPOILER Suspense, drama, romance, comedy, what more can you ask for?

828,richajan-61591,I will watch this over and over again and love it even more everytime I watch!,10,5 February 2021,"I found many reasons to fall in love with this movie :Nash developed schizophrenia but shown so much of determination to cure it. From the description that Doctor Rosen gave about this illness, I felt that it must have been super hard for Nash to come out of it but he chose to believe the doctor and wife, he wanted to know what's real, he believed what's real when his wife and doctor shown the reality, he chose to not acknowledge his delusions.I liked that his wife too didn't give up on him, despite going through rough days, when she had to look after the baby on her own because Nash was too sick to care, when she discovered that Nash stopped taking his medications, when he almost killed their baby, when he didn't answer to his wife. She has been so much loving and forgiving towards him.I liked that she resisted every urge in her mind to run away from the situation, and she forced her mind to see the person she fallen in love with. John too wanted to try. He did put in serious efforts.On Nobel prize ceremony day, Nash said ""I always believed in numbers. and studied them throughout life. The journey taken me from physical to metaphysical to delusional states. But in the end I found that the logic lies only in the mysterious love. If you weren't there, I would not be here"". This suggested that now he learned sharing the credit too. Earlier during his Princeton days, he didn't like when all the credit wasn't given to him. And when he was young he used to place more importance on recognition rather than accomplishment.He had to fight his disease for many years before he gave this speech. now his son was young too. And he still saw those delusions. But he didn't shy away from asking his students - 'is this person real?' He was so surprised when he got to know that because of his work he got nominated for Nobel prize. this seemed cute.He evolved as a person too, earlier he seemed narcissistic.

833,JamesDean,An Unlikely Masterpiece,7,7 December 2001,"When I went to this advance screening of A Beautiful Mind I expected a strong film due to Ron Howard and Russell Crowe being associated to this movie.  My expectations were high and they were more than met, the preview for this film is kind of misleading there is really a strong story at the heart of this film.  It's not like a biography of John Nash it is merely based around some events that took place in Nash's life.  I predict that this film will grad a best picture, best director, best actor, and best supporting actress nomination when the academy awards nominees are announced in february.  The same way that other recent movies have had success by helping the viewer to escape this film helps you to escape but into a more realitic setting.  Crowe's performance could actually win him another oscar I know it's hard to win back to back but his performance is really THAT impressive.  But what really holds the film together is Jennifer Connelly who stole every scene she was in, in the harsh independent film Requiem for a Dream.  Connelly is the balance to the film because it's hard for the viewer to always understand Crowe's Nash.  Connelly gives the same kind of supporting balance to the film as Marcia Gay HArden gave last year in Pollock.  A Beautiful Mind will be remembered as the film where even Crowe's harshest critics will have to admit that the he's talented.",A Beautiful Mind

The direction was totally manipulative.  Only the acting, (which was still a bit of the showy ""give me an Oscar"" variety by Crow) kept me with this film.  The Sixth Sense plot line was predictable, and the staging was awkward.  I think it is a shame that so many movie people are jumping on the bandwagon of a mediocre film while ignoring the true classic of a week year.  LORD OF THE RINGS is by far and away the best film of 2001, and Moulin Rouge deserves credit too.  To see a really great Russell Crow performance, watch THE INSIDER.",A Beautiful Mind

Just when I thought I had a handle on the plot and was convinced I knew exactly what was going to happen, reality would drop from beneath my feet. Nothing was given away.

837,bm4972,Perhaps the most overrated big Hollywood movie ever,1,28 January 2007,"First of all, let me say that the featured comment on this movie cracks me up. ""A movie with a difference - It's realistic""? Ha. This movie is hardly realistic. It totally misrepresents the nature of Nash's delusions, and it criminally oversimplifies how game theory works. For example, schizophrenics never experience visual hallucinations, only auditory hallucinations, and Nash's delusions were hardly as quasi-patriotic and noble as the movie made them seem.This is your typical Hollywood movie, but perhaps because the eponymous mind was so brilliant, the movie has intellectual delusions of grandeur. Sure, the tolerably good plot makes it watchable, but this movie continually irritated me all the way through, primarily because it maintained a constant ponderous gravitas in an apparent attempt to suggest that there is some profound meaning deeper than the movie's plot. And that meaning just isn't there. The movie's huge mathematical, psychiatric, and biographical distortions were also frustrating. Competent acting and production are this movie's only redeeming qualities; the script is heavy, condescending, pretentious, and shallow. An awful, pretentious movie with no depth.",A Beautiful Mind

He did win the Nobel Prize.Pretty much everything else they got wrong.  They made his insanity much more interesting than the banality it really was.  They glossed over his first child born out of wedlock who he later abandoned.  They ignored the fact that his wife divorced him and never remarried him.

It made me laugh, it was intense at moments, I cried like I haven't in years and in the end all I thought about was driving to Princeton and taking the chance that I could actually get to see or even meet Mr. Nash himself.

840,Bob_St_Cul,"Right actor, wrong year?",9,25 February 2002,"I'm sure there are a few members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who are kicking themselves for giving Russell Crowe the Best Actor Oscar in the wrong year. Crowe won last year for the costume epic Gladiator, although nominee Ed Harris was more deserving for his work in Pollock. This year, Crowe's stellar performance in A Beautiful Mind could be overlooked simply because he won last year. That would be a shame, because Crowe's portrayal of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who has battled schizophrenia, is one of the top performances in film this year. Crowe covers 47 years of Nash's life, ranging from his grad school days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize. In between, he goes through hell.  In a role far removed from Gladiator, Crowe is utterly convincing as the troubled, socially inept Nash. From the film's beginning to the crisis point in Nash's illness, the tale is told from Nash's perspective-which gives director Ron Howard and scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman the chance to shine. Nash's delusions are apparent from the beginning-if you know where they are. They are interspersed with reality so well that they're bound to, at least partially, surprise the viewer when they are revealed. The result is a fascinating look at an illness whose hallucinations can seem all too real. Jennifer Connelly adds depth to her role as Alicia, Nash's long-suffering wife, who (at least in the movie) perseveres throughout Nash's illness and aids him to a gradual recovery. This film has been criticized for taking liberties with facts surrounding Nash. Some have argued that the film misrepresents schizophrenia and places it at the wrong time in Nash's life. Others have complained that the film fails to note that Nash fathered an illegitimate child, was divorced from Alicia for quite some time, and is allegedly bisexual.This is one of those movies where the results are powerful enough to justify a less-than-factual account. On its own terms, A Beautiful Mind is a moving tale of triumph over adversity, not to mention a classic love story.***1/2 (out of four)",A Beautiful Mind
841,halatalo,A hack of a movie,1,21 February 2002,"I didn't notice any comments here bashing this film, so I think I'd better add one; in my opinion, this was one failed movie. The only three things that kept me watching it to ending were actor Russell Crowe, cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer James Horner.Actually, the film starts pretty good. The first half hour reminded me of quality British dramas (like Chariots of Fire), and had a few marvellous scenes. Just as I was starting to think this would be a good movie, it started to go drastically downhill.The filmmakers (Ron Howard, Akiva Goldsman) get drawn into what appears like two subplots - one about Nash's love affection and one about his paranoia of communist spies - and lose the conception of the film. There's been comments of the film as a tear jerker... Sorry? I didn't find anything emotional about this movie. Towards the ending, it just keeps getting more and more like a bad TV-movie. All characters are poorly written, there is not one single good dramatic scene; a *lot* of the screen time is stolen by imaginary characters (they actually feel more lively than the actual people in the movie).The acting is hopeless; the dreadful direction makes all characters except Nash seem like cameos and the screenplay really feels as it is written by the fellow who wrote Batman & Robin (dah).And the fact that the film isn't thruthful to its subject doesn't make it any better, either.",A Beautiful Mind

844,bronx58,A thing of beauty indeed! Simply amazing!,10,25 December 2001,"Simply beautiful!!!  This film is without a doubt one of the best I've ever seen!  I was treated to a preview of this beautiful film in advance of its opening.  Like some of the others who have submitted reviews here, I too was completely thrown off by the trailer for the film.  I expected to find a mediocre love story taking place in the midst of some kind of quasi-thriller.  Boy was I in for a surprise!  This movie delivers on so many levels.  It was indeed a thriller (although of a different sort)...and also delivered as a love story on several levels.  Yes, the beautiful and talented Mr. Crowe affects what was in my opinion a convincing enough West Virginia accent, but more mind blowing was seeing him adapt his mannerisms, posture, and gait to the various ages, and stages, of Mr. Nash's life.  His performance was brilliantly subtle, yet right on the money.  What more can I say?  The man is a truly amazing actor!  Truly gifted!  As for other aspects of the film...there are those who find Ron Howard's style of directing to be somewhat heavy handed in attempting to extract emotions from the moviegoer - I don't necessarily share that opinion.  I prefer to think that his films are imbued with ""heart.""  I enjoy his work, and I feel that this film especially was directed with a truly artistic touch.  I never felt as though I'd been manipulated.  On the contrary, I felt as though I'd had the privilege of being allowed on a very special and exclusive journey, and found the experience uplifting.  The film allows the viewer to peer into a great mind gone haywire...and to watch him use his genius to put it back together again.  It allows us to share in some of the challenges and uncertainty which exist in the daily lives of those who have a loved one with this type of illness.  To see Mr. Crowe's oh so subtle, very realistic, portrayal not only of what a schizophrenic experiences mentally - but how he appears to those watching from the outside...well, this was truly awesome! He masterfully avoided going overboard with the role.  Playing John Nash with quiet dignity...not at all over the top.  Both Mr. Crowe and Ms. Connelly bring tremendous honesty to their roles.  I was truly impressed seeing the love, the resoluteness, and at the same time the weariness that settles in under such circumstances on a long suffering mate, all flawlessly portrayed by Jennifer Connelly.  She took us through the gamut of emotions that Alicia Nash must have experienced.  In the ""first date"" scenes, Ms. Connelly is a vision, and throughout the film she is the embodiment of grace and beauty.  Also worth mentioning, Ed Harris turns in yet another solid performance as the very creepy government agent.  Paul Bettany is a real scene stealer as Nash's roommate and confidant.  The score is simply beautiful and sets the proper mood at all times.  The film is visually stunning.  I can't see how this film won't snag Academy Award nominations all around, but especially for Russell Crowe and for Jennifer Connelly. Crowe should definitely take home another Oscar for this one!

845,dannyboy43,The Viewer becomes schizophrenic ... amazing directing...,10,25 December 2001,"Without giving anything away, I was amazed at Ron Howard's film technique to out Hitchcock, Hitchcock!  The viewer becomes highly, intimately involved with the lead character's condition by seeing what John Forbes Nash sees -unknowingly at first then surprisingly and brilliantly revealed without being tricked or melodramatic. The early treatment of mental illness, in this case schizophrenia, is graphically presented and portrayed, encompassing all the victims-both the person affected and the family/friends dealing with their loved one.  It is not preachy, yet it teaches as much  as any book or informative lecture(s).Nuanced performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris et al.  A Beautiful Movie.  Movie making at its best!!!",A Beautiful Mind
846,criptonix,Spectacular.,10,13 December 2003,"A Beautiful Mind is based on Sylvia Nasar's 1998 biography of Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr., but it is not another biography on film.  The film states before the credits roll, ""....The Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr. still teaches at Princeton, and walks to campus every day..."" but it leaves out facts that would have made Nash more human and vulnerable, like his being a bisexual in his 20s, his having sired his first child by a mistress, Alicia's divorcing him and their subsequent remarriage, etc. The Nash that comes out of this carefully recrafted biography is a romanticized figure arousing sympathy, an awe-inspiring victim-turned-victor; in short, a hero. But never mind.  One shouldn't expect moviemakers to gamble millions of dollars on an honest portrayal of one man's life, even if he were a genius who has been compared to Darwin, Mendel and Newton.  Let's just look at A Beautiful Mind, the movie, and size up Crowe instead of judging Nash. Crowe does a superb job of playing this tormented paranoid of a genius: his odd gestures, facial twitches, erratic glances, loping walk and his convulsions under insulin shock therapy all combine to wow the viewer anew with Crowe's acting prowess-especially when you recall the picture of invincibility and immortality the actor projected as the (Oscar-winning) hero in The Gladiator.   Indeed, it is Crowe who carries the movie from beginning to end, ably spurred by fine co-actors. That A Beautiful Mind won the Best Picture in the recent Golden Globe Awards-with Crowe as Best Actor and Connelly as Best Supporting Actress-is saying much about the technical excellence of the film.Families with older teen children may pick up a thing or two about the power of love and faith in A Beautiful Mind. Mental illness in the movies is usually shown as sensational, pathetic, perverse, laughable or grotesque. In this movie, mental illness is just a disease that stands in the way of a happy marriage-a cross to bear-but it is the cross that paves the way for the crown, the gore that leads to glory. For those who love and believe that ""something extraordinary is possible"" even in the darkest hour when they could see a loved one falling apart beyond recognition, that extraordinary something indeed happens: patient love frees the beloved from the clutches of madness and living death until the hoped-for dawn returns.",A Beautiful Mind
847,baj-2,masterpiece in audience envelopement,9,24 January 2002,The movie has the ability to draw the audience in the world of John Nash as he saw it as normal to himself without exposing the illness of his mind.

848,olsonjk,An Extraordinary Movie!,10,13 January 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of the most wonderful films I have seen in a long time.  It tells the story of mathematician John Nash and his rise to Princeton, to his fall with mental illness, to his rise as he overcomes his condition.  Russel Crowe's performance is certainly Oscar-worthy, becoming Nash on screen and realistically and emotionally portraying this character that is so different from others he has played on screen.  Ron Howard deserves a big nod, as well for successfully allowing the audience to get into Nash's mind and share with him his fears and relationships due to his mental condition.  Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris were also at their best in this film as supporting roles.  James Horner's music was both eerie and sympathetic to Nash's character and fit very well in the film.See this movie, folks.  You'll be glad you did!  Bravo to all involved!",A Beautiful Mind

Well, on second thought, it is and it isn't. Russell Crow has positioned himself for another Best Actor nomination. The only disappointing aspect of this movie was that we do not really get a true understanding for John Nash's genius. The movie would have been more complete if we knew why John Nash won a scholorship to Princeton, and more detail as to why he won the Nobel Prize. With that aside, however, this was an excellent film. The acting is superb and once you leave the theater, it makes for great conversation.

It is now one of my all-time favorite movies! The movie starts off a little slow, but it does a wonderful job of getting the audience acquainted with the characters - you fall in love with them and want them to be happy. So, when the climax hits, it takes you by surprise and hits your emotions. I won't give the climax - I actually had been told a little more about the movie than my friends had, but luckily I had forgotten. Not knowing some of the key ingredients of this film made it a better film by far. I'll just say there is a powerful twist in this film, and the topic is handled very well by the writers and by the actors (who all do a marvelous job! and the make-up in this movie is also terrific). If at the beginning you feel it is slow, please just stick with it!

But then there has been considerable press about the liberties with the facts taken by the filmmakers in presenting the story of John Nash and this made me wonder how realistic this presentation of schizophrenia was and whether, in fact, we were receiving Hollywood's view of the disease.Not a bad film - but not a particularly good one either.",A Beautiful Mind

To tell the truth, I can't recall seeing a film that is so overwhelmingly and consistently bland.  You can't hate it.  It tackles a worthy subject, and does an OK job of it.  The acting is OK, nothing outstanding, and Russel Crowe obviously has the Oscar Glint before him as he gets his hair styled in a very unattractive way for it.  The direction is, well, there.  Subtle, I believe is he word.  In the two and a half hours, I only had the urge to check my watch once, so that wasn't too bad.  There were absolutely no surprises, or twists, or memorable scenes, really.  It was just one of those films that you come out of and go ""Well, that was a film.

Which probably influenced me a lot because without the ""You must be so SMART"" bit, you end up with the story of a very unattractive man, with a mental problem, which never gets resolved, but moves nicely into the background.A good policy for the film itself.  Ignore it.  It's won't change your life, or entertain you, or enlighten you.  It's not really worth spending money on it.

Mental Illness needs to be understood, Beautiful Mind did a pretty admirable job of taking the often quieted nightmare of the former and portraying in a manner that seems comprehensible to the viewer.Still, the facts of John Nash's life don't match the story.

I couldn't stand Russell Crowe-or I guess I just bought into what the press said about him.  When I walked out of the theater with a friend, we were just shaking our heads.  I couldn't believe just how terrific the film was.  Russell Crowe has a fan for life in me.  His performance is so textured and right on.  I think when you are lucky enough to see a performance like that, you realize why movies are made in the first place. I am so happy for Ron Howard;I remember him most as Richie Cunningham.  I simply was astounded by this directorial turn.  So So different from anything else he has ever done.  My friend and I so badly wanted to believe that John Nash was okay that we kept on hoping he wasn't having delusions.  Now that's a treat.  When a director and actor can make you care that much.  I was very disappointed that Russell Crowe did not win the Academy Award.  Not that it matters all that much, politics and all.

864,sturmv,Fabrication,1,5 September 2003,"First off, the movie was not true to facts at all. I just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally I think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we ""lesser mortals"". 5/10",A Beautiful Mind

It's mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what's with all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowe's performance is little short of caricature. It is also rather offensive.

866,Skiitifucan,Russell Crow is indeed amazeing,7,19 January 2004,"**********************SPOLIERS****************** I had to right this paper for school about Schizophrenia and since i love this site i decided to submit. The movie, A Beautiful Mind, deals with the difficulty of living with schizophrenia. John Nash is a schizophrenic who attends Princeton University and is able to solve math problems that baffle even the greatest minds. Right from the beginning we noticed that social interaction is extremely tough for John. When John has to make conversation with other people we realize some of the first symptoms with his disorganized speech and disorganized thoughts and behavior. Throughout the movie we continue to notice he has much difficulty talk with others except when with one person. When John is with his `roommate' Charles we notice that all trouble talking and thinking is eliminated. From there we might understand that Charles isn't real and just a figment of the imagination. Later on when schizophrenic images have driven John to the edge Dr. Rosen confronts him at a math speech John is giving. Dr. Rosen gives John shock therapy and we see John having convulsions while strapped down on a medical bed. Besides the shock therapy Rosen also gives John a heavy dose of medicine and asks Alicia Nash, John's wife, to watch out for him. Dr. Rosen also has to face the hardest part of telling John that people he thinks he knows are not real. John has a tough time getting a grip on reality and sometimes can't even turn to his wife. During a schizophrenic episode while attempting to knock away `William Parcher's gun' pointed to his wife but instead hits his wife. This and John's forgetfulness with his baby so how hard it can be to care for someone with schizophrenia. With these two episodes Alicia even has to move out until John can understand what is real and what is not. A moment occurs when John comes to grips with reality with himself and tells Alicia that he knows that the images are not real. He says that Becky never got any older the images are not real. From this point we know John we fight these illusions until he is `better.' During the movie we become attached to his illusions and just as it is for John it is tough for us to let them go. Near the end John tells us when he is asked if the illusions are still there, he says that they are never gone I just don't answer them. Unfortunately at this time that's all that could be done. In the end John has triumphed in the biggest way, he has put the images out of his mind and wins the Nobel Peace prize. He then gives an emotional speech crediting everything that he has done to his wife, and rightfully so. What makes this so much more realistic is that it is.",A Beautiful Mind

871,gordoglo,A little silly,7,8 March 2004,"*MAJOR, DEVASTATING SPOILERS AHEAD*""A Beautiful Mind"" is well-acted and reasonably entertaining, but pretty silly as well.  The concept is interesting -- to show us the fascinating evolution of genius, then sort of pull the rug out from under us and show us what happens when a devastating mental illness is brought to bear on the workings of such genius.My main problem with this movie is the way in which the rug was pulled. Normally, when you have such a plot twist (a la The Sixth Sense), you can re-watch the movie and say, ""Oh yeah, it all makes sense now.""  But with this piece of cinema, there's no way you could go back to the pre-diagnosis parts of the film and say, Oh yeah, they thought he was crazy.  There isn't a single shot of someone looking at him oddly when he is talking to this imaginary roommate or fictionalized military man.  IN FACT, the movie even flashes ""The Pentagon"" -- and this early in the film, why would you even question it's NOT the Pentagon?  So we are either supposed to believe THAT really happened and his mind created this new character based on that experience, or (more likely, since later they imply the government would have no use for him), he made up that whole incident.  So I feel like the movie deliberately misled me, rather than allow me to lead myself down a wrong path.  That's kind of shameful, especially because post-diagnosis they made such a point of showing how this stuff was really fake.The silliest part of the way this movie treated the whole twist was when he was finally captured and taken to the hospital.  The men from the asylum just HAPPEN to be dressed up in the same style as the people in his dreams, and think the best place to take him into custody is while he's giving a lecture at the most prestigious university in the country.  Right.  Then, when they finally nab him, as he's screaming for help and being injected, everyone just stands around watching it and accepting it as if to say, ""Well, this looks really wrong, but I guess they know what they're doing.""I would also love to know who called these authorities.  His wife had to be convinced of his malady, and apparently his associates, who had something of a clue of his weirdness, didn't worry enough to alert his wife, which I would think would be at least step one before you phone the men in suits.If you aren't such a stickler for detail, though, it's easy to be entertained by this.

As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in ""Mind"". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparable to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's ""The Boston Strangler"". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstacle that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed.",A Beautiful Mind

What more do you need to know that the fact that there is an infinity in between any two numbers! In fact, when you think of any two numbers, or any number for that matter, it is somewhere from the infinity between any other two... continuity is made discontinuous instantly. Jhon Nash is a figure who lives it. Alisha makes love infinite. Nash drowns and develops gills. Alisha swims in the sky. The Noble prize in the end is often seen as belittling most of Nash's so called Rough work, which must not be. Well, I hope it helps you understand that there is an infinity within everything, more so in what we feel. It's a lovely story. Russel and Jennifer are immaculate and almost seem like living it all through.

But this moment is directly connected to those childhood imaginings, and for anybody who is on the downside of advantage and rely purely on courage -It's possible"" This movie tells a story of an impossible dream, the dream that John Nash someday might become what we refer to as ""normal"". The intelligence of Nash is obvious, and therefore it is no surprise that he discovers groundbreaking theories (his own original idea). However, the development of Nash is the centre of the entire picture, and Ron Howard has done a great job making these images possible. It's a great mystery to me that Crowe didn't win an academy award for this movie, his performance is excellent and flawless. The fact that Nash receives the Nobel Prize at the end of the movie shows us, the spectators, that with courage, heart, and soul our dreams are within reach.

Nash comes under increasing pressure to publish, but he refuses until he finds a truly original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates ""every man for himself"", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. This leads to a new concept of governing dynamics which Nash develops and publishes. On the strength of this he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by mysterious supervisor, William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense, to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns. He meets Alicia and marries while working at the US Department. Throughout this time he develops his schizophrenia and imagines people created by his mind. Alicia finds out that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia investigates and finally confronts Nash.Nash is the life and inspiration of this movie. He is a dramatic character and interesting. One wonders if the voices one hears is what he heard.

And I found the film pretty enjoyable and I reflected upon it even after ending.I found the rhythm to which the story was told perfectly paced and beautifully told, showing how Nash lived before, during and after finding out about his schizophrenia, and how he overcame it.
I give the plot and story a 8/10, because, as much as it entertained me - which it did - I was absolutely not paying that much attention, for the film didn't bring me that much closer to it. And, as much the film made me reflect how someone can be successful while coping with mental illness, I thought about it for two minutes before dropping. I'm not saying movies really need that, but a story as profound as this one could've.On the other end, we have the visuals.
The colors were beautifully executed. Being quite warm in times of genius creativity and cold in times of illness.
There was something great that came to my attention, those layered shots, which showed how separate Nash was from the world when he was thinks.
But that's how far it got. It was good, but not great.

A Beautiful Mind is a very enjoyable and involving drama, with many excellent turns from it's cast.Ron Howard could have one of the most sporadic directorial filmographies ever, featuring utter rubbish, such as the Grinch Who Stole Christmas and EdTV, great films like Parenthood and Apollo 13, and then cult classics Willow and Cocoon. A Beautiful Mind will no doubt go down as one of his best ever efforts, which is well-directed with eye-pleasing art direction and excellent cinematography.The film has a good story, and Crowe plays the part well enough. However, for me it is his co-stars who really make the experience enjoyable, with specific nods to Labyrinth star Jennifer Connoly, Wimbledon's Paul Bettany, and of course the legendary Ed Harris. I found myself just as moved by the side-story of Bettany's character as the story of our leading man.This film has helped further Bettany's career, and shows hope for all involved that they can go on to work on equally interesting and enjoyable projects. I only fear for Howard that he has raised the bar for himself so high that he will never meet it again.

As a university professor I was interested in the picture of academia in the 50's. The film then started to lose it's way. It threatened to deteriorate into a Hollywood spy thriller. The brilliant mathematician (John Nash) hired by dumb spooks. Just as my interest waned it turned out that the secret undercover work was actually a paranoid schizophrenic fantasy. Having being confronted by this debilitating mental dysfunction at close hand (my sister) for most of my life, the film became suddenly captivating. Here and there stereotype Hollywoood sentimentality prevents the film from becoming a really great film, but it remained stimulating and moving right through to the end. The next day I checked out the movie content with a genuine biography and interview with John Nash himself. The movie is not entirely accurate - Nash never actually had visual delusions, but he did experience voices. In the movie Nash is stabilizes and continues to take medication.

I think that One problem that I did have with it was that it really did not accurately portray schizophrenia very well. In the movie John Nash was clearly having visual hallucinations, which is really not that common in real life and the real John Nash even said that he never had visual hallucinations. However I guess that this just to make the movie more interesting. It would have been more boring if he was just having auditory hallucinations.

890,thossain-3,Ron Howard has no right to change the history of Game Theory,1,24 January 2002,"This movie is a premium example of hollywood taking a wonderful real life story, changing it altogether to make it edible for the general public and coming up with a movie full of lies. As just a movie, I can see some people will find it interesting. But the movie presents rubbish about Economics and Nash and, of course, game theory. Nash didn't invent game theory as the movie kind of tried to portray. He came up with a notion of equilibrium whoich is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel.  I think coming up with the equilibrium notion is more of a contribution than iventing game theory. But of course they had to change it to make it sexy enough. The movie is full of lies like this. I understand that most people will not enjoy the movie as much if it were truthful. Nevertheless, that doesn't change the fact that the movie lied about game theory. I think it was awful",A Beautiful Mind
891,noether,Strong performances but inaccurate portrayal of Nash,8,28 December 2001,"Crowe's performance is amazing -- he managed to realistically convey many of the mannerisms of mathematicians:I have encountered mathematicians in grad school who shuffled about, twitched and wore knit caps all day long.To get a better assessment of the real Nash, read Sylvia Nasar's excellent book. Nash as a grad student at Princeton was a bit more arrogant and a jerk than as portrayed in the movie.",A Beautiful Mind
892,ViolentVinnie,An ugly bore.,1,2 March 2002,"Moviegoers watch out! Russell Crowe is on the lose to bore you to death in this overacted, poorly crafted piece of Hollywood kitsch. Basically the movie is about the life and the fight with schizophrenia of John Nash, a college professor. So far so bad. As the story might have offered some interesting possibilities the film shows us Russell Crowe overacting as bad as he could possibly do. At no time through this 134 minute piece of boredom the viewer can actually believe that John Nash is supposed to be a mathematical genius. We rather get the impression of a clumsy, slighty overweighed farmer strolling around campus. The only reason one would stay in the theater is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris who delivers yet another great supporting performance. This is by no way an Oscar movie and I will cry bitter tears if Russell Crowe takes away the best male again. Avoid the movie!!",A Beautiful Mind
893,joyhanna,The Best of Crowe,10,3 March 2002,"A magnificent movie.  Russell Crowe moves from himself and all his other characters into a new level of acting and all-out emotional range.  You will be affected by this film.  Doesn't matter what the detractors say. Picture a deeply satisfying development of character in an intellectual struggle,a psychiatric collapse, a compelling love  and Nobel to boot.  But it is truly through Russell Crowe that this story will grab you and lead you to watch the many other films of his career.",A Beautiful Mind
894,kichel,Read the book,2,7 March 2002,"If you consider yourself an intellectual or a seeker of truth, read the book and don't waste your time watching this piece of technicolor drivel.  The lies so far outweigh the truth as to make it a betrayal of its subject and its audience.  That is despite good performances by Crowe and Connelly and some others and three false scenes clever enough to justify themselves.
I am not a mathematician or a scientist, but despite my lack of understanding, the first page of Sylvia Nasar's book was more interesting to me than the entire movie.Screenplays frequently change facts and oversimplify to convey important information or feelings efficiently and powerfully.  I'm not offended by such fictionalization per se.  But this movie takes a fascinating real story and completely ignores almost everything fascinating about it and tells a different, ridiculous story that would be journalistically justifiable but mediocre at best as art IF IT WERE TRUE ... which it is not.Until now I thought Moulin Rouge was the worst movie of the year ... I have revised my opinion.",A Beautiful Mind
895,bryankhalid,An excellent movie not to be missed!!!,10,6 March 2002,"The movie trailer itself and hearing those people who have seen it, saying it was a good story plot, makes me feel curious and at the same time eager to see it.Now that I've seen the entire film, It's truly a beautiful movie, A BEAUTIFUL MIND!!!!",A Beautiful Mind
896,beck-beck,Accurate depiction,10,28 December 2001,"If you know someone who has a mental disorder such as schizophrenia or manic depression, then you have to watch A Beautiful Mind.  This film will give you an incredible insight to such illnesses and the thought processes and experiences that schizos and manics sometimes deal with.My husband is manic depressive, and he was very touched by the film, and I completely empathized with Jennifer Connely's character.  It is a bit hollywoodized, but I do have to mention the way in which John Nash 'sees' patterns in numbers and words was an incredibly well done and accurate depiction.  Some people might not appreciate this movie, but that's probably because they believe this movie and these characters are not 'real' enough. Trust me, it is extraodrinarily real and moving.  And I can appreciate the ""let's try to cure mental illness without drugs or professional help.""  It is not a farfetched idea and it can work.",A Beautiful Mind
897,erik.p.lutterbie,A beautiful piece of fiction,3,15 February 2002,"Having now read the book and seen the movie, I wonder why the producers and director bothered calling this film ""A Beautiful Mind"". It is a piece of feel-good fiction that bears little resemblance to the actual life of John Nash (but it is a good candidate for the series ""History vs. Hollywood""). An Oscar nomination for best screenplay adaptation - what a travesty.I read that a one of the films staff indicated the movie was based on the architecture of John Nash's life, and that was more important than the facts. (Easily one of the most inane statements I've ever heard, but typical for Hollywood). I'm sure the picture will receive the Best Picture Oscar, but at what price to integrity and truth.",A Beautiful Mind
898,lesterix,Makes you think...,9,6 May 2002,"A beautiful mind is quite unique in its sort. The movie is about the famous mathematician John Nash, who we all know him from his famous ""prisinor's dilemma"" and other economical theories. After being a nerd with a cause in uni (Princeton, US), he comes up with a controversial theory about ""governing dynamics"". In the movie you see a great example of the prisinor's dilemma mentioned earlier: Four guys are sitting in a bar, they all see a bunch of girls but one chick stands out and all four like her. In stead of all going after one girl and end up alone, it would be better to do what's best for yourself and the group. So you choose one of her girlfriends and you all have sex. Makes you think...Anyway, doctor Nash marries a student, gets a kid and becomes schizo. Shiver.. shiver.. Nicely filmed but in the end, alas, the film becomes a hollywood flick (e.g. the really lame part where he gets all the pens.. dude!).All by all it's still a great movie and it definitely prooves for me that economics students as well as mathematicians are by nature a little 'twisted in the mind' ;)Thank you mr. Ron Howard.",A Beautiful Mind
899,Moraal,"A great combination of previous oscar darlings Shine, Forrest Gump & Rainman",8,24 March 2002,"What do you get when you assemble the geniality from Geoffrey Rush in ""Shine"", the intonation from Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman"" and the clothing ethics from Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump""? You get Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind a.k.a. John Nash, a brilliant mathmetician that keeps seeing (dead anyone?:-) people around him. Although I didn't agree with last year's oscarwinning role in Gladiator, I do believe that A Beautiful Mind gives Crowe the stage where he shows his acting ability to the highest level seen in recent years. The movie is a delightful adaptation from the original biography, althought it must be said that most facts have been interpreted ""politically correct"", unfortunately leaving out lesser flattering, but imperative facts about the life of John Nash.Jennifer Connelly, playing the role of supporting partner to a lesser fortunate soul, gives another great performance after gems like Requiem for a Dream & Pollock. Although she didn't convince me of the fact that she was a brilliant mathmetician, she did play the role of supporting half to the utmost possible level. Her beauty is unparallelled in recent years by any other actress, and even at the end of the movie when she's transformed into an older lady, all the make-up in the world couldn't make her lesser attractive!Ron Howard delivers a moving, mindbuggling bioepic that will have a profound effect on anyone that will come across it. It simply leaves you breathless and in awe of the great acting performances, brilliant editing and beautiful settings. A must see!",A Beautiful Mind
900,ShawnLucas,An Over Rated Mind,6,7 March 2002,"I watched A Beautiful Mind a few hours ago.  I hand it to Ron Howard and his producers for assembling a great cast.  But this movie is nothing new in many ways.  It is a wonderfully crafted love story, expertly technical but methodically predictable.Some evidence that the film is derivative were the special effects used to reveal Nash's observations of pattern and code.  Numbers light up off of pages of text.  Similar effects were used in Jody Foster's movie Little Man Tate, at least ten years ago, when Foster's character's son ""sees"" mathematical equations in a highlighted neon light fashion.  It is helpful for the viewer to see what the character does in both films, though not new now.Crew note: remove the marks for wide shots.  I saw a taped ""T"" on the floor in the Princeton tea room foyer.  Judd Hirsch as Einstein tells Nash that he won't receive the Wheeler recommendation, then the camera pulls out and Nash exits walking backward.  As the shot widens there you will see the taped ""T"" marks on the floor where Hirsch and Crowe were standing.I grew up near West Virginia.  I've visited and stayed in West Virginia and had friends from West Virginia.  Crowe's West Virginia accent was not heavy enough to cover his Australian.Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic and her acting was ineffectual.  Let me compare: Both women in Mulholland Drive showed much more depth and range than Connelly's Alicia Nash.  They did things, and caused things to happen. Alicia Nash does not cause anything to happen, and that may be a flaw of the screenplay.  I can read into it that Alicia helps John to understand love to be a real thing, as real as the universe is infinitely large.  But don't read to far.  A second thought though, the only thing that could stand up to Crowe's presence and stature, since he's won the Oscars and the Golden Globes, is Connelly's stunning beauty.  No current A list actress could act in such a simple fashion and be so captivating at the same time.The script and some of the actions were predictable.  For example the over used ""throw the glass at the mirror,"" when Connelly used it to exhibit emotion after being rejected by an over medicated John in bed.  Take Harris's posturing in Nash's office as evidence of Greek Tragedy style acting.  Harris holds open his jacket by resting his hands on his hips, thereby exposing an ominous pistol in a shoulder holster.  It is a menacing stance, but it is almost a stereotypical threat by someone with a gun that we've seen many times before.A Dr. Seus book is used as a prop, held by a young character.  Maybe Howard is reminding us that he directed that live action Seuss movie.  And more on the subject of Howard recycling from his past, a host of Howard's family worked on A Beautiful Mind, see film credits, as well as Harris appearing in Apollo 13 directed by Howard.Thanks to James Horner's stirring cello music for pulling my heart strings, yes, I cried.  When you see that A Beautiful Mind is truly about love, like I did, you'll cry too.  Forgive me, I fall for the emotional manipulation tactics every time a cello plays!  I am a sucker for a good movie.  And though it may be nothing new, A Beautiful Mind is a very good movie.",A Beautiful Mind
901,mrcolmer,Remarkable!,10,21 January 2002,"Even before A Beautiful Mind, I admired Jennifer Connelly, especially from Requiem for A Dream. Now I am enamored by her. What a remarkable performance in a truly understated role. From what could have been a shadow dressing performance, Jennifer made her mark from the first scene in Nash's classroom, coming across determined and powerful yet understated, to the last at Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize (in heavy makeup to the point you cannot recognize her). The genuine love, adoration and support shines through. Without having seen the movie or listening to Nash's speech, you know why she is there. Playing what I consider emotional courage is difficult. Jennifer has set herself apart from the field.Oh and that Russell Crowe is not so bad either. Setting aside Proof of Life, Russell has had a remarkable three-year run. From The Insider to Gladiator to A Beautiful Mind, Russell has shown the ease and skill to transforms oneself from character to character. It is astonishing to believe those were all the same person. But that is what an quality actor is supposed to do.
Ron Howard, the fantastical director of such fare as Willow, Cocoon and Splash, has redefined his abilities. Movies with no epic background or splashy effects but simply strong characters and story are perhaps the most difficult to direct. Robert Redford direction of Ordinary People was just the same. The movie is less about Nash's condition than it is about how love makes us crazy and how love heals us all. These can be subtly portrayed issues unless you have the wisdom and eye to protract them. Ron has brought out the best in his performers and brought out the best in John Nash, a man whose accomplishments or name I had never heard. The movie lets you know that you do not have to be crazy to be brilliant. But it helps.Come Oscar time, expect to hear these names over and over again.",A Beautiful Mind
902,matthew.mills,A BORINGful Mind / Oscar Travesty,1,25 February 2002,"If A Beautiful Mind wins one Oscar, it will be a complete tragedy.  This BORING, SLOW, DULL film may whet the appetites of Academy members, but audiences have literally fallen asleep at theatres.Jennifer Connelly, normally an amazingly gifted screen presence, phoned-in her performance.  And whoever did her ""old lady"" make-up at the end of the film should be banished to infomercials.Russell Crowe was better in ""The Insider"" (so was his make-up)and if he gets the Oscar for this film, it's only because of ""name recognition.""  Voters seem to champion an actor for role after role simply because he's a hot commodity (witness Tom Hanks' Oscar run).And don't even get me started on the lame plot of the film.  Oops, too late. Haven't we seen the real person/dead person/hallucination thing enough already?  And better?  Fight Club and Sixth Sense used this trick with much better aplomb.A typical studio picture with little or no depth, A Beautiful Mind is a waste of time and an insult to serious film buffs everywhere.",A Beautiful Mind

At least 4 times did i saw a microphone on the screen, my god ...  This picture is nominated for Best Film!!!It's a real shame that there wasn't more room in the script to show Mr. Nash's character.  The film let's you think that he has a real awfull character.Another thing that was very strange (except for the microphone's :-)), was the fact that Ms. Nash didn't age, or that it didn't look natural at all (especially the scene where Mr. Nash wins the Nobelprice).It's not all bad though, the movie touched me and i learned more about Mr. Nash.To end this, i like the idea of the movie, but they didn't do a good job to make it.",A Beautiful Mind

905,lightspeed7,possible mistakes,9,12 February 2002,"I too enjoyed this film very much. Often I had thought of Mr. Crowe as somewhat arrogant,which may or may not be true. But his performance was that of a gifted craftsman , therefore hat's off. I plan to see the film again to verify , but it seems Opie made two minor mistakes. One is they show a pacifier on the table where the scene should be late 1950's and is a nuk type pacifier which I believe didn't arrive until the 1970's. Again the other is I believe Mr. Crowe calls a friend ""mate"" in classic Australian form. If I'm wrong I'll acknowledge later.",A Beautiful Mind
906,callaweii,Best Movie Ever,10,27 December 2001,One of the greatest movies ever made. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly both give the best performances of their careers. Ron Howard will definitely get an oscar nomination. I read the book some things were left out but it doesnt matter it is still great. It doesnt show Nash's entire life. Just his life in college till when he wins thee nobel prize. When Russel Crowe wins his second straight oscar this year he will actually have deserved it.,A Beautiful Mind
907,kehsmith,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is a terrible thing to waste your time on",1,27 June 2002,"I cannot believe the people that rave about this movie.  ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a terrible thing to waste your time on.  The movie's direction is manipulative and the screenplay is horrid.  I thought this was suppose to be based on the true life of John Nash.  Didn't his wife divorce him in real life? Yes, she did.  Wasn't Nash a homosexual? (Nash says no, but.) Yeah, right, Mr. Nash.  Let's not use truths here let's just make up some stuff that an audience will like.  Well, Hollywood, I might have liked the movie more if his wife had divorced him or if there was a homosexual tinge to the film.  I needed to feel for the character and all this character was is a jerk.  Hell, he says it himself, ""I have a chip on both shoulders"".  The movie makes him come off as a womanizing jerk.  How can I care about him. Well, because Hollywood says we should feel for him and the media says it is a great film.  That's why we like it.  Give me a break.  I know this day will never come, but, I sure wish it would, when will people learn to make there own decisions about movies, music and tv shows, etc. instead of allowing themselves to be conned into liking something just because the media says it is good.  And, don't get me started on the Academy Awards because all that is now is a popularity contest.  The best films or actors or screenplays, whatever, might get nominated but they don't have a chance in hell winning, ie.  ""Memento"", ""Ghost World"", ""Mulholland Drive"", etc.",A Beautiful Mind

Combine that with having to go from college student to senior citizen, then tack on delusional schizophrenic!! How much tougher can a role be? But the performance was fantastic.

I heard many, many people disagreeing with his winning of best actor for Gladiator saying that there wasn't much acting involved. Russell being a primarily muscle actor...but this movie, A Beautiful Mind, Crowe nailed perfectly. It was absolutely incredible watching him play such a complicated character, and the story was so fascinating.  I think the movie is definitely Academy material, and all my money goes to Russell winning best actor.  That'll make it two in a row for him.  Ed Harris and everyone else were so great, I couldn't have spent my five bucks better than buying a ticket to this movie.",A Beautiful Mind
910,sickdroogy,A Hollywood-sized Lie,6,29 March 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is safe, conservative, Hollywood pap. It's not challenging, interesting, or even remotely intellectually satisfying. The film ""confronts"" schizophrenia by sugarcoating the truth with take-my-breath-away, ""Sixth Sense""-style revelations following straightforward (and egregiously inaccurate) visual hallucinations. The film claims that a scrambled mind can use that scrambled mind to unscramble it with the support and love of a good woman. It's an inexcusable lie, and irresponsible with respect to the truly horrific reality of schizophrenia. The film picked the perfect formula: take a real man's story, strip away everything but his name, pretend to deal with a deep issue (like mental illness), alter it to make it more palatable to mainstream audiences, slap on a happy ending, and open your arms for a slew of awards.  It is mushy, manipulative tripe and the worst Best Picture in recent memory.",A Beautiful Mind

I think he did a more than adequate job as Maximus in Gladiator, but his work in Beautiful Mind is much more worthy of an Oscar win for Best Actor.I know there are some hardcore critics that are upset with Ron Howard taking ""liberties"" with John Nash's real story. However, it did not take away from this being an OUTSTANDING film.Howard did a stellar job in making Nash's paranoid-schizophrenic characters seem real. The chase scene and his paranoid trip to his backyard hideout were especially well done.In the end, this film was much like Nash's theory which eventually won him the Nobel Prize- brilliant in parts, but not perfect. However, in the end the process of the theory and the process of the movie come together in the end to create a spectacle of a film.",A Beautiful Mind
912,nirvana57,Amazing,10,4 January 2002,"This is probably the best performance by Russel Crowe that i have ever seen, even better than ""Gladiator""! Ron Howard (director) and Russel really put together 'their minds' and created an unforgetable masterpiece that will leave you breathless. A story of love, genius, and madness, you are taken into a real life story of 'the brilliant John Forbes Nash', the famous mathematician. The set is Princeton University, and the story begins as John undergoes a mission to try and solve a mystery that has been on his mind forever. In solving and submitting it he is immediately set on 'the sailboat to fame' and later is recruited as a code-breaking spy by Ed Harris's character. In the process he is engaged in a relationship with his later to be wife played by Jennifer Connelly, but soon, John finds out that reality is indeed all in ""A beautiful mind""",A Beautiful Mind
913,WesternUnion,"Decent, but most definitely not Best Picture material",4,15 February 2002,"Totally agree with the users speaking out on Russell Crowe Crowe and Jennifer Connelly (as eye-candy radiant as ever) for their easily superior turns in ""The Insider"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" (in turn easily superior to ""Mind""). Now, on to this picture, which I feel is the worst of the Best Picture nominees this year.....Walking into the theatre beforehand I was well-aware the film was under a considerable amount of critical fire for glossing over Mr. Nash, the individual - making him out to be way too much of a saint - and his accomplishments. Now I must concede that - bearing in mind there's a great deal of validity to all those objections - however you want to cut it, film is just NOT the best medium to resort to for accuracy and factual glut to satisfy the average viewer. War extravaganzas like the recent ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" are glaring examples of such a fault.But even looking past what the film is lacking in biographical substance (not very easy), there's not a whole lot in ""A Beautiful Mind"" to recommend here:
* John Forbes Nash as Crowe capably inhabits him is awfully hard to care about from beginning to end, despite the fact that the actor labors hard to flesh Nash out. He's fighting a screenplay that is far more concerned with the delusions haunting him than anything as substantial as his real life, or who HE was.* Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer, each a great actor in a rather thankless role.* It painted a portrait of schizophrenia that came off as, for the most part, pedestrian next to others found in the likes of, say, Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" and ""Fight Club"".* This portrait is worsened by moments supposed to incite laughter from the audience as a result of Nash's illness.* It sprung a 'twist' halfway through that came off like lazy screenwriting or a half-baked rehash of the Revelation concerning people who don't actually exist, something Hollywood ought to retire for a while.
* Not an iota of depth, but a good dose of superficiality, is to be found in the movie's depiction of why Mr. Nash was such a brilliant mathematician or what attracted Alicia Larde to him in the first place. Or why she put up with Nash so long. (Alicia is underwritten to such a great extent, you have to admire that Jennifer Connelly doesn't emerge as defeated from the screenplay as you would think, either.)* It actually left me wondering, like many Miramax-backed yarns of late, whether the central motivation behind its making was to win Oscars - not exactly an uplifting feeling, but then again, I guess the movie must have failed in its obvious attempts near the end to inspire that.For all the faults of ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Gosford Park"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and several other films that didn't make the Best Picture cut, but should have, at least they didn't seem nearly as calculated, and had far more interesting methods of storytelling guiding them. (The fine Apollo 13 aside, I feel Ron 'Opie' Howard's talent is vastly overrated.) Neither did many of them seem to overstay their welcome as much as ""A Beautiful Mind"" (over 2 hours long).There are spots where the movie simply DRAGS, and threatens to drag the viewer's opinion of the proceedings down with it, despite the valiant efforts of Crowe and Connelly to inject some interest factor into Akiva Goldsman's predictable screenplay (Golden Globe worthy my A$$). At times they almost succeeded. In the end, they are the only elements of the movie worth all the Oscar buzz. Should you be in search of an adequate starting showcase for their talent, but not much more, look no further and check this one out, but brace yourself for the running time.",A Beautiful Mind

Of course, when the symptoms were revealed, one shared disbelief with Nash.  After seeing it early yesterday evening, I could not get my mind off the film.  I kept pondering in my own mind how it must be to be a genius who can conjure phenomenal circumstances outside reality.  I am still boggled.

In my mind, he should definitely win another Academy Award. If you don't particularly like Russell Crowe, see this movie anyway, if only for the performances of the many other great actors that appear. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Paul Bettany, who was one of the saving graces of A Knight's Tale. His performance was particularly convincing and realistic. I was expecting a good movie and it was better than good.

The way he walks, the way he slide himself between the gate at the abandoned warehouse where he thought was a Russian secret movement operation center, the way he talks, in fact, everything, was portrayed perfectly that it actually concealed that very russell crowe that i never actually liked.The movie was somehow close to me as my uncle, who was a genius,also suffered from schizophrenia, but passed away years ago. I cried when nash was seen sitting on his house balcony because i remembered that was how my uncle used to sit for hours, solving puzzles. the only difference is that, nash had all the chances and supports from peers and the society but my uncle never did. It was a shame.Connelly was good as ever, and she had always seen carrying this type of role. Loving yet not so mushy, smart yet vulnerable at time.Despites all the comments about the movie not being so realistic and not really based on the facts of Nash, i still think it deserves one the of the most beautiful movies i had ever watched.",A Beautiful Mind

Russel Crowes way of acting is amazing, Jennifer Connelly is unbelievable, too. They both, i hope, will get the oscars.

930,cinephile-48425,Just Beautiful !,10,9 May 2021,"As my headline says- Just Beautiful !This is the story of John Nash played by Russell Crowe whose brilliant mind has served humanity in several ways but at the same time caused horrific life situations for the man himself. John Nash's discoveries in game theory have a great impact on our lives everyday.John suffered from a disease called schizophrenia which made him think of several characters and life situations which never existed in real life. Even after undergoing treatment he was not cured fully and it caused so much trouble in his married life. But his wife supported him throughout this whole stage. Even though they had a new born child to take care of, she never gave up on John. Jennifer Connelly played the role of John's wife, Alicia Nash.Those delusions never stopped coming for John, later he said he got used to ignoring them. In later stages of his life, he also won Nobel Prize for his work in economics.This movie is portrayed in a very beautiful way. It shows the power of love and hope. One should never give up hope as John's wife always had hope that he will get better someday for sure. She never gave up on him. She always loved him irrespective of the external circumstances. This movie teaches us why compassion is very important when dealing with people who are in some kind of trouble. You will understand they are also confused and terrified and just need some love.As said by John himself in his speech dedicating to his wife, when he received Nobel prize "" And I have made the most important discovery of my career. The most important discovery of my life. It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.""",A Beautiful Mind
931,crhtnastheseus,hackneyed inquiry of existence,1,4 March 2002,"This movie has the _worst_ plot I have ever observed. Despite my best attempt to remain objective and view the film sans preconceptions (other than to be entertained), I found myself uninspired in the middle of the film.""A Beautiful Mind"" seems incapable of focus. The first half of the film seems to be a comedy, but the last half is a depressing clichéd drama. The film itself seems to be schizophrenic (even manic-depressive).There is very little that is original or innovative in _A Beautiful Mind_ [that is unless you consider reorganization of main characters mid-film innovative]. Furthermore, the answers provided by the film to questions of epistemology [nature of and limits of knowledge] and questions of existence [answers] are merely hackneyed drivel.Both _The Matrix_ and _Sixth Sense_ do a far better job of asking the same questions and providing answers.I do, on the other hand, concede that the acting in _A Beautiful Mind_ is worthy of praise. Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly do a marvelous job of bailing out an otherwise sinking ship. However, this movie does _not_ merit the Academy Award for Best Picture--an award usually reserved for a balanced film (acting and plot) [sort of a 'best-of-show' award].",A Beautiful Mind
932,brianlau01,A Beautiful Mind Conversion,10,10 December 2006,"The movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" is about the life of a noble prize winner John Nash. It shows how he get past all the obstacles and changes in his life to get to his success in the end. The genius John Nash goes through phases of conversions. The first phase is when he is normal and goes to Princeton and graduated after his mathematical theory proves to be correct. Then he moves on to the second phase in which he works in this agency and starts seeing imaginary people and hidden patterns which he believes it relates to military and the federal government. The next phase is when he marries his wife and diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has to take medicines to treat this sickness. He was fine for a while but the imaginary people comes back after he stops taking the pills. It not only distracts him but also threatens his relationship with his family. The next phase is when he finally has the determination to fight the sickness and ignores imaginary people and gets on with his work. He has a delightful family and he's also a professor at Princeton University. The last phase is him finally getting paid off with his hard work in his specialty and winning the noble prize. This movie demonstrates a person has to go through many changes or conversions in order to gain success in the end. That person also needs to be courageous, fearless and relentless to get past barriers that are holding him back from accomplishments. This is a fantastic movie that illustrates those ideas.",A Beautiful Mind
933,smcbride2001,"A good film, with some problems",8,30 July 2002,"First, I would like to say that I enjoyed this film very much and I recommend it to anybody.  However, I have noticed that many reviewers have commented on how they believe that Russell Crowe deserved to win Best Actor over Denzel Washington at the Academy Awards. Although Crowe did a good job overall, his West Virginia accent was very poor and at times he lapsed back into his native Kiwi accent.  Many times he attempted to cover his poor accent by mumbling his lines. Denzel Washington definitely deserved to win the Oscar over Crowe. My second problem with the film is that it is a Disneyfied version of the real story. While the film is excellent standing on its own, when taken in context with the book it comes across as a bit of a cheat.",A Beautiful Mind

Just believe me on that.Anyone, forget your high flying, action packed films that most of us love. This is basically a true film in every sense of the word.Believe me: It touches the heart and soul.I cannot understand why Russell did not  win the Oscar for Best Actor.

There were times during the movie when I actually couldn't figure out ""fact"" from ""fiction"".  That made the experience all the more gripping in the end.Whatever the controversy over the parts of Mr. Nash's life that were glossed over or left out completely; I think that ""A Beautiful Mind"" did an excellant job of being his acomplishments to light.The story was gripping, the direction was wonderful and the cast was first rate.",A Beautiful Mind

The story is compelling and gives the audience a chance to begin to feel and understand what goes on inside the mind of a person who has schizophrenia. Russell Crowe (of ""Gladiator"" and ""The Insider"" fame) does a stellar job and truly makes us believe that he is John Nash and is suffering from delusions. Yet something prevents this well intentioned film from ever actually reaching it's potential, the clumsy and inconsistent direction of Ron Howard.An overall good movie with one problem   *8/10*",A Beautiful Mind
939,pjbriddon,A wonderfully crafted and thought provoking film.,10,14 March 2002,"This is a film all about hope. It is a  deceptively simple drama about the life of John Nash, a mathematical genius who develops Schizophrenia.I must admit at this point that I have a medical background, and what impressed me most about this film was the way the story of the main character unfolds. As you watch the film you can see the main events happen through the eyes of John Nash himself, but it is not until later in the film that you realise what you are seeing is the gradual onset of his illness. Without spoiling the story, you can retrospectively see the unfolding hallucinations, delusions and paranoia developing.Russell Crowe is outstanding in his portrail of John Nash; few perfomances I have seen in recent years cry ""Oscar"" as loudly as this one. Perhaps the secret is in the understatement used, there are a few histrionic scenes, but generally you see the human face of John Nash throughout the film.There were a couple of very well created historical influences on the film, notably the setting of Cold War America, and the treatment and attitudes about Schizophrenia in the 1950s (now fortunately gone forever). If you do not know much about schizophrenia before you see this film, you will understand a lot more by the end.A wonderful, thought provoking film all about hope. Watch this film to find the solution.",A Beautiful Mind

First of all, it's a honor to see a scientist life with an amazing movie like this. It shows, ambition of a mankind can overcome everything. Especially a hard illness like schizophrenia. Then teaches us how the biggest thing on the universe, is love. Love, passion, compliment, sacrifice. And a brilliant, elegant woman that carries all of them. Alicia Larde Nash loved a man but lived a hard life with him. But she handled everything. Cause she believed hopefully waited. At least been honored with John Forbes Nash's Nobel prize and speech. Admirable role from Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly.",A Beautiful Mind
941,Lilibeth,Wonderful Acting,8,7 January 2002,"I have to agree with everyone else's comments about the acting in this movie.  Everyone was wonderful and utterly believable, especially Russell Crowe.  I am not usually a big fan of his (I thought Denzel Washington should have won the Oscar last year), but Mr. Crowe really hit one out of ballpark with this one.  He will definitely be nominated for his portrayal of John Nash.My only problem with the movie however were certain portions/segments of the movie that were just so ""unsubtle"" that I felt that we were being bashed over the head with the message -- such as ""love will conquer all"" or ""family really does matter.""  I rolled my eyes during a few shots/sequences, which, unfortunately, pulled me out of the ""world"" of the movie.  That being said, I thought it was an otherwise wonderful piece of storytelling, if a touch too Hollywood in wanting to spoonfeed the audience with some ""this is how you should be feeling/what you should be thinking of now"" shots or dialogue. I would have given this movie a 10 had they treated the audience as being just a little bit more intelligent.",A Beautiful Mind
942,scudder42,"Excellent, Oscar worthy performances.",10,14 January 2002,"I think this movie will be the one Ron Howard will be remembered for. His use of lighting and visual special effects sets the mood for John Nashs battle with schizophrenia.  I've always considered Howard a great director, but one that was limited to testosterone flics like Ransom, Apollo 13, or Backdraft. This movie can almost be considered a low budget, or independent film. Russell Crowe delivers an Oscar caliber performance as the tortured Nash; head and shoulders above his Gladiator role. Crowe gives in completely to the Nash character. Jennifer Conelly is excellent as Nashs wife Alicia. The last I saw her she was flaunting for the camera in ""Inventing the Abbotts."" Her performance is also Oscar worthy. Hopefully, this part will lead to more roles. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which is somewhat predictable, and doesn't really have any surprises, but nevertheless completely sucked me in. It's probably the best film I've seen this year; but it's only January. It's well worth the time and money.",A Beautiful Mind

The love story is wonderful too, but it's Russell Crowe's amazing portrayal of a man who has schizophrenia that makes this film remarkable.  You really feel for the character.

I was totally wrong. This movie is about life, love and overcoming obstacles that seem insurmountable.At its best this movie was funny, sad, touching, heart-wrenching, inspiring and beautiful. It will evoke every emotion possible out of you and leave you feeling drained...and you will love every second of it. It is skillfully written and there is never a dull moment. At times you are on the edge of your seat saying ""Oh, God, no..."" (I really heard that in the theater), and at many other times you run out of sleeve to cry on.At its worst the movie is a little confusing during a short time...but that is almost what makes it so great. It's confusing, and that's why you can relate to the characters so well...because they are confused, too. And, you will definitely want to see it again.

The detail and commitment that he brought to this role is something that we aren't privileged to see every day.  He has come a long way as an actor. Jennifer Connely is also quite the actress on the rise.  I enjoyed her performance in ""Requiem for a Dream"", but this role required a maturity and steadfastness beyond her years.  I feel that the creators of this film have managed to draw a chilling, accurate picture of the world that schizophrenics live in.Watching this movie is like listening to a symphony, viewing a priceless work of art and eating a gourmet meal at the same time - thoroughly satisfying all senses.",A Beautiful Mind

Since I had not read any review of the movie, nor did I know that the story was based on the life of Dr. Nash, therefore I was not influenced by someone else's analysis. I think Ron Howard definitely deserves recognition for his directorial efforts.  The young Mr. Howard has proved that you can still make good movies without profanity, nudity and extreme violence.  Thank you, ""Opie"".I was totally engrossed in the story and believed that Dr. Nash was truly a genius and the ""bad guys"" were trying to stop him from breaking the codes.

Sure, I tear up a bit when the national anthem is played on a sunny afternoon at the ballyard, and movies with pets as stars always tear me up a little.  But, even a stoic like myself cant help but be moved by Ron Howards latest creation, A Beautiful mind, starring Russell Crowe.I don't want to dwell too much on the plot, its essentially the story of a brilliant but crazy mathematician and his struggles to overcome his own delusions.  He is supported in his efforts wholly by his wife, played by Jennifer Connelly.The story, based on real events, is a good one.  But the real brillance of the film is the emotional rollercoaster it takes you on.  There is a point where I was saying to myself, ""wow this is really good but why on earth would anyone want to feel the things this movie is making me feel?""That of course, is the low.  At the other end of the spectrum is what turns out to be the triumph of the human spirit, represented in determination, perseverance, friendship, loyalty, and foremost love.I don't have a vote for best picture at the academy awards, but if there is a better movie than this one this year, I'd like to see it.

955,greenya,Astonishing movie that takes you within,10,16 November 2002,"This is not just ""another"" Hollywood movie, but entirely new, that really distinguishes from previous. This movie makes you believe in something. There is a possibility, that single man like you or like me could describe a whole world, but when it comes to real life nothing can help you more than understanding and support of your closest people. You will see, that John Nash is a genius, who develops something new, and gives whole himself to the problem. He is the man, who can find a  solution to this hard equilibrium. And this equilibrium is life. Sometimes it might be hard to understand the life. Who can tell you what is right or what is wrong, who can define what is real or what is not? We come to this point where only dedicated group of people can tell you what is right. These are psychiatrists. Group of people who decides whether human is normal or not. John Nash really had some trouble with himself, but this also helped him to       create his theory. Before this Dr. Rosen we think that everything what is happening around is hundred percent real. And this Doctor is just another person who disturbs John's work and life, but suddenly we realize, that John might need help anyway. At early stage of it it is seen that it is really hard for him to get along with himself and his wife. I would also like to highlight their relationship. Alicia is love with John forever and she will help him at any cost. Love is real John understood this words in its full meaning. His eyes told everything he really needed help, but not clinical just a little social. His wife was the only man on Earth who could help him and it is the only man who can understand him. Finally i would like to say that when something is right it will be right forever. And John Nash knew that he was right, and this helped him to do, what he believed had to be done. I have to tell that this is one of the greatest movie i have ever seen.",A Beautiful Mind
956,juddnelson,Russell Crowe is admirable,10,4 January 2002,"It seems that a lot of people that usually watch ""only good movies, not commercial products"" were turned off by the trailer.  I just hope they'll go see it anyway.SPOILERS**If this story can make the world see a face often hidden of the human being, and realize that somewhat sickness in the eyes of the society is not perceived as being so by the ""patient"" himself, than it should be watched by everybody.  Some types of ""sickness"" are not reducing one's intellectual and emotional capacities, but are enhancing them. This is a smart and touching movie.  Russell Crowe is completely absorbed (as well as fascinated I assume) by his character, and deserves a second Oscar for his interpretation of an imperfect genius.

I really am not a huge crowe fan, nor do i really care for the common chick flicks, but that is not what this movie is. If I remember anything about this movie ten years from now it will be the scene where Dr. Nash and the Nobel prize guy are in the cafeteria drinking tea, and out of nowhere that first guy comes up and lays his pen on the table for Dr. Nash. I am the most unemotional guy i know, but that scene at that moment really got to me and i will never forget it. This really is an unforgetable movie.

963,Living-Dead-dot-com,A Beautiful Movie,10,28 June 2002,"Amazing, beautiful, touching, interesting.These words can be used to describe A Beautiful Mind. I went to see this movie just because I hadn't yet and my father and I were out having a movie day to take in as many theatrical releases as we could.From the time the score started (which was about the time the Universal logo appears on the screen) I knew that this movie was my type of movie.First, the score: James Horner has finally outdone himself. As the master of rich, dark, beautiful, music, they could not have picked a better composer to score the film.The thing that I was most impressed with in this film was Crowe's performance as John Nash. Although he did not act exactly like John Nash, he certainly didn't act like his typical tough-but-sensitive character. His acting was brilliant.I was not sure exactly who Jennifer Connelly was, but after a little research I found out that she was the start in the old Lucio Fulci horror masterpiece Phenomena (a.k.a Creepers) and I had such a crush on her when I was around 12 or so. Her performance was stellar as well, but somewhat lack-luster next to Crowe's. I have seen I think all of Ed Harris' movies and though I think he is pretty good at acting, I can't see what all of the fuss is about. Did anyone see The Stand? Small part for such a huge actor, don't you think?Overall, I would rate this movie as #2 on my all time favorites, second only to Shawshank Redemption. See it today if you have not yet!!!!",A Beautiful Mind
964,artsydave,Hollywood suceeds with a beautiful mind,10,8 January 2002,"Hollywood didn't screw up! which is very suprising in this case because this is a very true life story of a man still living today, and an excellent depiction of the most misunderstood mental illness. Hollywood has long depicted schizophrenia as a multiple personality disorder which is horrible misinformation and not even close, but thats what everybody thinks it is, from tv and movies. Caution this is a very sad movie, and a suspense thriller at times as well, with comedic parts mixed in. But foremost it is a very sad movie, even sadder for myself, 21 and have struggling with schizophrenia for a while now. It was like the whole movie was about me and i cried harder than i have in a long time. This movies is an excellent drama, an excellent true life story and an excellecent representation of what schizophrenia really is.

This movie is extremely interesting, and is full of extraordinary scenes that are first rate by all who participated in this film.  Ron Howard, Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer.  Who says an actor cannot win an Oscar two years in a row. Russell Crowe deserves another Oscar for this role.  He has achieved the performance of a lifetime.",A Beautiful Mind
967,uramean1,Russell Crowe is a Beautiful Mind,10,28 March 2002,"In any movie the stars always take control of our lives for a couple of hours. But a great actor takes complete control until you idealize them and beg for more, more, more..I put Russell Crowe way up top that pedestal. You might say that to high for Russell Crowe but I say not. You had to see him five times to detect his all the theatrical tricks and see the artistry of a real genius. For in art and in literature, as it is, yes, in sports, it's the difference that really counts. In The Gladiator, Russell Crowe was all hunk and is ready to kill or die anytime, giving his life for the justice. He was all the raw rippling power of a professional warrior, all that a man could ever want to be. He fears neither man nor beast. Filled with faith for God and Country. In The Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe was the unlikely nerd in college, sexy professor, and - lo and behold! an old man-Crowe as John Nash.  A mathematical genius trapped in the wild world of schizophrenia, and the gladiator had completely disappeared. It brought me to tears and had the theater applauding at the end.  That was something I have seen since Gone with the Wind. Now that's a Winning combination and will always keep me coming back.",A Beautiful Mind
968,erica-27,And the winner is...,10,11 January 2002,"Mathematical genius John Nash (Russell Crowe) seemed to have all the skills he needed to succeed in life, without realizing he would suffer the unexplainable before actually seeing the rewards of that success.  A Beautiful Mind is a phenomenal movie about the unexpected turns our lives can sometimes take.  It's a story of a man any one of us would envy; living a life that would be our worst nightmare. Nash makes an astonishing discovery in graduate school and stand on the brink of distinction. Instead, the handsome and arrogant Nash finds himself on a painful and mind wrenching journey. After years of struggle, he triumphs over unimaginable odds and finally receives his acclaim late in life.Supporting actors Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg, Paul Bettany, and Jennifer Connelly provide Crowe with a stellar cast that adds depth to this movie that astonishes you and leaves you dumbfounded.  Words cannot properly describe this movie.  The acting is unparalleled.  I've never been much of a fan of Russell Crowe's, but I guarantee you that my respect for his acting has increased ten fold, if not more.  He gives the performance of his life.  He deserves all the recognitions and accolades the Academy or anyone else can give him.  Ron Howard, who directed the movie, has once again proven his talent in bringing to life the screenplay of Akiva Goldsman, based on the true-life story of Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash, Jr.The film score will haunt you with its beauty.  James Horner, who produced the film score for Titanic, has once again hypnotized the audience with what is sure to be another Oscar-award winning soundtrack.Giving this movie a perfect rating was not easy of me, but I couldn't in all honesty find any reason why not to.  The screenwriting, the music, the cinematography, the acting.it's all there and it's the best I've seen in a long time.  Normally you find a movie's virtues in parts.  One movie might have a great story but poor acting; another will have great acting but a poor script.  This movie will satisfy your appetite in a way no movie has recently.  I'm not by any means saying it is the best movie of all time. I'm merely saying it's the best movie I've seen in a while.  Watch, listen, and enjoy.let your senses, your mind, and your heart be delighted.
Enjoy the show!",A Beautiful Mind

Either I promptly forget it, or I keep re-playing scenes from it over and over again in my mind.With A Beautiful Mind, the scenes kept re-playing for me.  In great clarity. So much so, that I went to see it again.  It re-plays even better the second time around.  It is a film that is so layered that it deserves a second look.  And for those of you who do go to see what you consider to be good films a second or third time, well, you know what sometimes happens . .. the second time around, the film loses something, or you see its flaws, or the plot just doesn't seem as interesting.Not so with this film.

I have seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" twice already and was mind boggled by the power and quality of Russell Crowe's portrayal of the brilliant and troubled John Nash Jr. His performance ranks right up there with the other performers who portrayed troubled or disabled individuals, most notably Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", Robert De Niro in ""Awakenings"", Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"" and Al Pacino in ""Scent of a Woman"". Ron Howard's direction is superb, blending acting talents by not packing a lot of superstar punch into this film but by unleashing the power from his lead character and supporting figures. The movie is very-well made, extremely touching and very rewarding in the end. This is the best movie I have seen since ""Braveheart"" and I certainly hope it will grab awards for acting, directing, and best picture of the year.  9/10",A Beautiful Mind

I have seen the movie twice and will go again.My son graduated from college with honors and completed a portion of a masters degree before his mental illness manifested. Mental illness is a growing phenomenon in our society. Our systems are not set up to deal with the numbers affected. Health Care is inadequate and medications are not a quick fix. This movie will affect the way you view mental illness and respond to those who suffer. As with any trial in life, humor provides a respite.

The Creators of ""A Beautiful Mind"" used the same concept in this movie, a schizofrenic college student who overcomes his illness and becomes a nobel prize winner, and as you can see it's similar to the forrest gump story. that's why i give this movie only 9/10 1 point less for the originality, and everything else...brilliant! the cast was very good and the performance of russel crow was great. to conclude this pointless note i'm writing, i must recommend this movie to everyone who liked forrest gump, because you'll like it to.",A Beautiful Mind

985,Dick Murchy,A Near Perfect Effort,9,21 February 2002,"Ron Howard seems to be back in form with this nice movie. I even enjoyed Mr. Crowe whom I feel is an over rated actor. What has been troubling Mr. Howard's most recent movies is his temptation to paste them as American Pie slices of a generic visual experience. I didn't believe for a minute the cliche acting and directing in his Apollo 13 movie. But, here he seems to be back in true form more in touch with his early films like Parenthood and The Paper. If not for the sappy ending, this would be a perfect film. It is not the film that Lord of the Rings is or even The Man Who Wasn't There, but it will probably win best picture and Howard just may take in his first directing award. Too bad, because even though this is an excellant film, the awards should go to the best.

Its dealings with the reality of mental illness and its devastating effects on one's surroundings, family, and friends (and for that matter anyone close to the subject) are very accurate and seemingly brought into reality by Howard.  I feel that this movie has moved me in ways that no other movie has had the satisfaction of doing so.  I just think that the movie is a new look into the reality of the mental illness world and should make people aware that how they treat people really does matter in regards to their treatment, care, and healing.

Although the script 'skips' Nash's european period as well as softens some details of his life, it shows the world the bio of a man that wasn't such a celebrity but accomplished important goals.His theory opened new roads about taking life as a 'game' and that is not necessary to have a losing party when there is a confrontation.All the cast is fantastic(I have seen Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Plummer in Broadway and have admired them for many years)and each did an outstanding job.Mr Howard's direction shows his deep knowledge of the film crafting;  he is one of the top filmmakers of the past two decades.As you leave the cinema you are moved towards reflections about life, illness, love, companionship, science, and strength .I am seriously considering into seeing it again.

What purports to be a biography is not - all the parts which may upset an American audience have been left out. Couple this with a wonderful example of incredibly bad acting from Crowe (I liked him in Gladiator and LA Confidential) and I am amazed that this got any Oscar nominations at all. If this film wins it will be a complete travesty.,A Beautiful Mind
992,shaven_sinner,"Warm and Fuzzy, But Just the Facts Ma'am?",9,12 March 2002,"I have read many of the other reviews, both positive and negative. Despite being '000s of kilometres away in Australia, we receive many first-hand news reports on the Hollywood entertainment industry and, alarmingly, reports on alleged 'dirty tactics,' supposedly designed to ruin particular movies' chances of winning Oscars.I guess the studios will do what they do, simply because their revenues and budgets are dependent upon a movie's success and recognition from the Academy, in particular, and industry in general. It just seems disappointing that people will stoop to slurring a movie in the hopes that its success in any capacity will be diminished.We have heard that Russell Crowe's character, Nash, was homosexual, anti-semitic and unfaithful to his wife. I do not know whether these things are true, but I remember that after the release of Schindler's List, there was criticism that Schindler's infidelities and poor treatment of his wife were overlooked by director Spielberg.No doubt, the same people that are complaining about the leaving-out of facts would also complain about the movie being over-long, if extra time was taken to include the facts.The director uses the film to tell the story that they want to tell. They are given that perogative by the studios, ovbiously with the consideration of commercial viability being an important factor. To label a film as bad, simply because some facts are left out, is supremely ignorant.If factual deficiencies make a movie bad, then why are films such as the Godfather so highly-regarded? There is no factual basis behind the Godfather whatsoever. Additionally, its subject matter is repugnant, but the story is told in such a way as to make it palatable to a large audience. How is this different from A Beautiful Mind?I can not speak for Ron Howard's intentions, but I found ABM included sufficient positives and negatives from Nash's life to provide a balanced view. The man was no saint, but he was battling a disease that I personally had no conception of, until I saw this movie.There was a guy at school with me who had schitzophrenia. He suffered greatly, in addition to his disease, due to our ignorance of what he was going through. He was teased and ridiculed, much like Nash was, yet he has gone on to become a successful lawyer, after 6 years of study. This film has added to my understanding of others, much more than a mindless alien invasion movie or love story. Only the most cynical would overlook the value that this film has to understanding mental illness.
The point is that directors have limited time in which to convey their messages. Let's face it, if biographical films were completely true-to-life, they would all be 5 + hours long and very boring. The director must use his/her discretion to balance a feasible story with a consideration of the audience's need to be 'entertained'. The director could include many more facts from the character's life, but if they are not pertinent to the story that the director wishes to tell, then what is the point?Ron ""with cheese"" Howard, judging by the comments on this board, is renowned for making 'schmaltzy' movies. Well guess what people? If you don't like his movies, stop going to see them. Why see something from a particular director if you know that you don't like his work? It doesn't make sense.Personally, on the odd occasion, I enjoy leaving a movie theatre feeling like I have learned something and, dare I say, feeling uplifted and happy. You can try it too! See this movie.",A Beautiful Mind

When I went out of the cinema I remembered Dustin Hoffman's ""Rainman"". While Russel Crowe performed an paranoid-schizophrenic mathematician, Mr.Hoffman performed an autistic man. Both men played well. It is very sharp and terrific to watch a man who fights against his mind with the aid of his mind. Results are very impressive and dramatic. The film also gives messages to ordinary people like us by showing a genius' life story ""We live with our souls and minds, none of them by itself is not enough to live..."" And emotions cannot identified by facts, formulas or theories.""A beautiful Mind"" is a nearly perfect movie I think by a superior performance of Russel Crowe and scenario.

997,ekomi,This film changed my life,10,6 April 2002,"I've  seen  '' A  Beautiful  Mind ''  three  times  in  a  week  and  I can say  that  I  have  never  experienced  so  strong  feelings  watching  a movie ! I  knew  almost  nothing  about  the  movie  before. I  thought  it  was  a typical  Hollywood  movie  and  I  don't  like  this  kind. But  as  the film  went  on  I  was  left  speechless. Russell  Crowe's  playing  was shattering. He  really  stole  the  performance ; in  the  movie  you  see nobody  else  but  him. I  have  seen people  suffering  from  mental illness  on  the  screen  before ( Shine, Ð etc ), but  it  is  the  first time  an  actor  gets  so  much  in  the  flesh  of  the  role, without resorting  to  hyperbolic and  easy  tricks. It  is  also  Ron  Howard that deserves  congratulations. The  atmosphere  of  the  film  is  unique, something  that  must  also  be  attributed  to  James  Horner's evocative music. I  don't  think  I'm  able  to  talk  more  about  the  movie  and Russell  Crowe's  playing ; I  just  say  that  watching  ''A  Beautiful Mind''  was  one  of  the  greatest  experiences  of  my life. I  have  watched  all  this  discussion  going  on, about  many  incidents in  John  Nash's  life  being  omitted  in  the  movie  and  about  others being  changed. I  don't  think  that  the  presentation  of  all  actual facts  in  Nash  life  ( homosexual  relationships, illegitimate  child etc ) would  make  any  difference. The  central  point  of  the  story  was  a man  with  remarkable  mental  abilities, who  struggled  to  distinguish himself, to  prove  he  was  extraordinary; and  that  due  to schizophrenia  this  extraordinary  man  was  almost  vanished, but  he fought  his  illness  and  finally  showed  his  worth. That  is  what  I saw  in  this  story  and  what  moved  me  so  much. As  far  as  the  theme  of  schizophrenia  is  concerned, I  think  that the  film  doesn't  say  exactly  that  John  Nash  quit  taking  his medication. Of  course, he  continued  having  hallucinations, but  this continued  until  the  end  of  the  film, when  he  said  he  was  taking a  new  medication.I  know  the  message  of  the  movie  is  that  John Nash  fought  schizophrenia  with  the  power  of  his  will ; but  I  also think  the  film, in  a  clever  way, leaves  the  story  a  bit ambiguous.

1001,Nimrod1933,Magnificant,9,19 April 2002,"*Warning may contain spoilers*A Beautiful Mind-4 1/2 Stars (out of 5)- The academy's best picture of the year can be defined in two words: Russell Crowe.  He never ceases to amaze me, which this is the bottom line. Throughout the entire movie Crowe portrays the incredibly intelligent and schizophrenic John Nash unbelievably.  I am amazed the entire time at how Crowe pulls this character off.  His body language, movements, conversations and facial expressions are put forth with flawlessness, the kind that someone of only Crowe's caliber can deliver.  Having seen such programs as the Sixty Minutes report on the actual John Nash, I can tell you that Crowe resembles what kind of person I saw in the short interview of this man. Its not so much how he makes you believe he is John Nash, its how Crowe makes us believe that he really is sick mentally and the audience truly is reeled in by the emotion and actions and we begin to see just how serious of a disease schizophrenia is. Ron Howard deservingly received the academy's award for best director (although in my opinion it could have gone to David Lynch) for A Beautiful Mind.  Howard does a brilliant job of truly showing us what John Nash's world was like.  The portrayal of what Nash is thinking is nothing short of extraordinary, as we see him break the ""hidden codes"" throughout the newspapers as he races to save America.  The movie is developed incredibly as the audience is sure what is on screen is reality and what is happening in John Nash's life is what is actually going on in real life.  The audience is then shocked to learn that a good portion of what was going on in the movie and a good amount of John Nash's actions and work was for nothing as it was all in his mind.  Using this method to expose Nash's mental sickness is a crucial part to the movie and is what really makes it stand out as an accomplishment for Howard as director and Akiva Goldsman for writing the adapted screenplay.  Howard's camera angles and methods of delving into Nash's mind are excellent and give us the necessary insight into Nash's physiological state. My hat goes off to the beautiful Jennifer Connelly as well for her role as Nash's love interest and wife Alicia Nash.  I did not think I could like a role of hers as much as her role in Requiem For A Dream but she came close to exceeding her performance here.  She did pick of the academy's award for best actress in a supporting role, which I would have given her as well. Simply put, she was magnificent.  Alicia serves as the medium for John between reality and his reality.  It is her that keeps him in check later on when he is battling the disease and it is ultimately Alicia that keeps Nash alive in reality and gives him the strength to continue.  The final major scene, Nash's speech at the Nobel Prize awards, is a speech in which he only thanks his wife and though it is not a long speech or well written one, it is a speech that delivers the emotion and the gratitude to Alicia Nash that is necessary for the audience to view.  Ms. Connelly, throughout the entire film, delivers the acting and emotion that is necessary to make us believe that John's situation is as horrible and agonizing as it seems. A Beautiful Mind is an incredible journey into the mind and life of Mr. John Nash.  The film is executed with perfection as everybody does the job needed.  Ron Howard does his best work ever as director, Russell Crowe arguably puts forth his best performance on the big screen and Jennifer Connelly helps us to understand the frustration and pain that was prominent for the real Alicia Nash as well as for any other relative, friend or loved one effected by this disease.  This film truly makes you sympathize with the Nash's and what they went through, but it also makes us appreciate our minds to a great extent.  The exposure of schizophrenia through this film will do good for work to help those with the disease and it will also give the public a better idea of how horrible and serious this disease really is. This movie produces on every level and is among the years best without a doubt.",A Beautiful Mind
1002,jonwoolfrey,A movie with a difference - It's realistic.,10,2 May 2002,"I went along to the movies not really wanting to see this movie, thinking it was a 'girly' movie, one which had more technical skill rather than a storyline. I was surprised more than anything I could imagine. I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this movie just took me by storm. Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work. This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly. As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie. A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade. Perhaps politics played a bigger part than I previously would have thought.",A Beautiful Mind

His earlier performances only hinted at what he could do....... if given the chance. Now he had it, and I'm one of many who feel he came through with shining colors!

To think that we only use about 10% of our brains is sad in one aspect, that being what if we were to use 50% or 90% of our thinking potential where could we go? What could we do? But on a high note, now knowing what we do know, isn't a glorious thought that maybe we can try and find ways to tap into our minds? Imagine the rewards we could experience as humans, and what we could share w/ others.

1007,mikeymikec,A Superlative Acting Film,10,27 June 2002,"I have viewed ""A Beautiful Mind"" a few times now and I can say with great confidence that in addition to being a tremendous piece of drama, Russell Crowe gives one of the great acting performances I have ever seen.  Many films have been made with actors aging quite convincingly, but no 30-something-year-old has ever pulled off the aging process better.  Watch the scene where Russell is given the Nobel at Princeton.  As a man now in his seventies, his speech to the committee rep is masterful;  no contemporary actor commands the screen like Crowe.  This movie owes a great deal of its success to its lead.In the tradition of great films, Mind also benefits from strong supporting acting with the likes of Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and a thankless, yet crucial role by the always great Ed Harris.  As good as some of Ron Howard's films have been (Apollo 13, Parenthood), he buries the quality of his previous work with this one.  Kudos to those that had faith that a movie about an antisocial mathematician's life could be so engaging and moving.  The only disappointment for me was witnessing the politics that robbed Crowe of his Oscar.  You will be hard pressed to find a better performance in any film.",A Beautiful Mind

(May contain minor spoilers, but does not give away story)",10,29 March 2008,"This film has been classed amongst some of the most over rated films of all time by certain people and a certain magazine company. Despite this I thought the acting and directing was top notch. As for the story line, I believe this was well worthy of contributing to winning best picture at the Oscars. The story line grips all the way through and presents a massive twist half way through which keeps you interested and watching. A definite recommendation to anyone for this reason alone. The part that attracted me most about the film was how the mental illness was displayed. I believe they got this spot on and showed the symptoms of schizophrenia just right. I probably understood this more than a fair amount of people because I am well aware of the disease and its symptoms, as one of my family members is plagued with the illness. I believe to enjoy this film to a greater extent, I recommend researching schizophrenia and the symptoms. You will notice more minor points throughout the film which show off some of the less severe symptoms. These are only small points, but they all add up and produce an accurate image of what a person suffering with the mental illness would go through, which I found very interesting. Not many films like this around. 10/10",A Beautiful Mind
1010,susan_may21,Direction makes it beautiful,9,5 September 2002,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director.  Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness.  This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness.  Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.  Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient.

First of all, Russell Crowe gives an amazing and breath taking performance, but even more amazing than his performance was that of Jennifer Connelly. The chemistry between Connelly and Crowe was spectacular and believable, and contributed a lot to the greatness of the movie. It does not surprise me one bit that Connelly won the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role. She surely deserves it. I am slightly disappointed that Crowe did not win the Oscar for best actor. He portrayed John Nash perfectly from every emotion to every subtle movement, never over doing his part. The movie as a whole is a series of ups and downs. Your emotions will be thrown all around, and sometimes you'll just want to cry. The movie is brilliant and has a twist you would never see coming. After watching this movie I feel satisfied and as if I have just witnessed a masterpiece of the film world.

1015,plehman81,Cast can't salvage poor script,6,15 March 2010,"The 2001 film 'A Beautiful Mind' is the adapted story of Nobel Prize winning Mathematician John Forbes Nash. The film tells a coming of age story that focuses on John Nash and his struggles to overcome adversity as a scholar and as a genius schizophrenic. The film is directed by Ron Howard and features a rich cast of actors including: Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Josh Lucas and Paul Bettany. The film begins following the life of Nash, played by Russell Crowe, and his early work as a Graduate Student at Princeton University. After some key introductions to fellow students such as Martin Hansen played by Josh Lucas, and Nash's roommate simply known as Charles played by Paul Bettany, the film focuses on Nash's struggle to come up with an original idea that will earn him the recognition he eagerly desires within the academic community. Eventually Nash publishes a work that earns him the recognition he seeks and greatly impacts the field of economics. The film then shifts forward in time to Nash's career at MIT, where he and some of his class mates are working for the University as teachers and in cooperation with the United States military. During this part of the film, Nash meets a man named Parcher, played by Ed Harris, who invites him to work on top secret military code breaking projects but forbids him from discussing the operations with anyone. Nash is also introduced to the young Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly and eventually the two are married. The film then focuses on Nash's downward spiral into paranoid behavior that lands him in a mental institution where he discovers that his college roommate Charles and the government official Parcher are only figments of his imagination and symptoms of his disease. Nash is then confronted with the hardships of raising his family and dealing with the side effects of his medication. Nash then stops taking his medication and the pseudo-climax is reached during confrontation with his wife and his Doctor over this decision. Nash decides that rather than continue his medication he can use logic and reason to force himself to realize the characters he has created in his mind are not real. With the support of his wife Alicia, Nash returns to Princeton and his college class mate Hansen where he eventually begins to teach again. The film then concludes with Nash's consideration for and receipt of the Nobel Prize for his contribution to economics as a Graduate Student. All essential components of a good film are available alongside a cast of capable and talented actors. The cinematography employs effective techniques that complement the theme of the film. There is a fresh mix of both obvious and subtly disguised uses of lighting that are key indicators to the character's state of mind, yet all the lighting is used in very natural ways that add to the believability of the film. Sound is another key aspect of the film that complements the theme. Using very little background music or distracting sound effects the film relies on clear visual imagery in most of the key communication. However, these positive attributes aren't quite enough to pull the film out of its lackluster script.The theme of the film is nothing new to movie goers and film fans. A coming of age story mixed with ideas of complex human relationships set on the back drop of mental illness. You can imagine a dry and flavorless blending of 'Rainman' and 'Good Will Hunting,' though Nash never achieves the endearing quirks of Raymond (Rainman) or the impressive brilliance and genius angst of Will Hunting. Unfortunately the film's focus on the character of Nash and his ""beautiful mind"" leaves much to be desired. Crowe's performance does nothing to endear the character to the audience and does little to produce affect on the viewer. The viewer ends up feeling more attached to the characters that are invented by Nash and exist only in his head. The film never builds a clear climax and it only drags out and teases at the conflict that the main character ignores. Comparatively, the film 'Good Will Hunting' develops a main character that the audience can identify with and root for, whereas the character of Nash is Luke warm and uninteresting. Additionally, 'Good Will Hunting' develops a full plot that includes exposition, complication, and climax, where 'A Beautiful Mind' simply continues to cycle the exposition and complication stages of the film.",A Beautiful Mind
1016,matthewah101,A Beautiful Mind is a powerful work of cinema and is Ron Howard's most mature film to date.,9,8 April 2010,"Ron Howard is a descent director. He made film that are good and made films that aren't good. But if there's one film that Ron Howard did managed to make which was close to perfection that would be A Beautiful Mind.A Beautiful Mind is the story of the life of the famous mathematician named John Nash (played by Academy-Award winner Russell Crowe) as the movie starts off with him as an undergraduate at Princeton University. Nash is a very awkward person and seems to have some ""issues,"" but he is a natural born genius. He meets a peculiar fellow named Charles Herman (played by Paul Bettany) who happens to be his roommate and the two get along quite well. He meets other colleagues like Martin Hansen (played by Josh Lucas), Sol (played by Adam Goldberg), Ainsley (played by Jason Gray-Stanford) and Bender (played by Anthony Rapp) who will help Nash later in his life.Time goes on and Nash gets hired by a man named William Parcher (played by Ed Harris) who hires Nash for a secret military operation that involves Russian attacking the US with nuclear bombs. Nash also meets the lovely Alicia Larde (played by Jennifer Connelly) while teaching a class at MIT in which both of them have some sort of liking between the two of them.The movie goes on as Nash battles between keeping his love interest, his job, and his sanity.A Beautiful Mind is a fascinating work of cinema. What I adore about this movie is the acting. Russell Crowe is phenomenal in this movie and basically stoled the show. He turned from strong, warlike gladiator to odd mentally, challenged mathematician and still turned out to be great! The screenplay and the dialogue are exceptionally well. How the plot gradually unfolds is baffling and the dialogue is very realistic and not exaggerated. Overall, this film is great; however, there are some tiny problems that I have with it but it's still great. It's great because it shows the tribulations of mental illness and how it can affect the people around you. It shows that love is more than meets the eye. It shows that caring for someone doesn't mean giving up on them because they have an incurable problem.Ron Howard has presented us with a movie that is both entertaining and emotionally stratifying that it is worth your time to see this near-perfected work of art.

In the biography, one will find more about his realistic academic work and his own schizoid reality preoccupying him for decades.

1025,dskodie,Great movie!,10,11 December 2011,"I have seen A Beautiful Mind several times and I still love it just as much as the first time I viewed this film. Russell Crowe does a great job of playing the main character of John Nash. The title of this movie is very appropriate because the entire film is based on the way John Nash's mind works. You are led to think that the title is based on a man's mind and how truly brilliant he really is when it comes to being a mathematician. John Nash is on a quest to find a mathematical theorem which in itself is very interesting. In terms of the whole film, the title actually begins to take on a different meaning in the middle of the movie when the viewer discovers they have been witnessing a man that is ill. The reality that the viewer sees is actually the reality of a man with an illness. His wife in the film is Alicia Nash played by Jennifer Connelly who stands by her husband the entire movie. Parcher is one of John Nash's delusions and is played by Ed Harris. The theme of the film is more defined by the middle of the movie which showed that even though an illness was involved, John Nash still had a beautiful mind.John Nash proves in the film that the opportunity to be successful can still exist even if someone has something holding them back such as a mental illness. He ends up being diagnosed with schizophrenia and that is where Parcher, one of his delusions, becomes part of his life. As John Nash struggles through treatment he also discovers the true meaning of love with the help of Alicia, his faithful wife. She is shown throughout the film doing everything in her power to help her husband battle his illness and helps him lead a normal life. One of my favorite scenes which validates the theme of the movie is when a member of the Nobel Committee is interviewing John Nash regarding the process of accepting a prize if it were awarded to him. The man interviewing John Nash is basically asking him if he was crazy or if he would do anything crazy on stage. His response was very simple and straight forward stating that yes, he was crazy and that even though the medication does help, it does not eliminate the fact that he still sees people that are not there. Nash said that he chooses not to discuss them with anyone anymore, which proves that he has learned to live with his illness and still live a successful life. At that very moment his Princeton colleagues begin stepping up towards his table where the interview was being conducted. One by one they reach out to his table and present their pens to John Nash stating that it was truly an honor to have Professor Nash there. This action in itself was a big statement that solidified the success that he has achieved.The second part of the theme is in regards to Nash discovering the true meaning of love. This theme is validated during the Nobel Prize Ceremony in December of 1994 when the speech he gave was dedicated to Alicia. It was a very simple speech but powerful and important to his wife. The angle the camera uses in this shot at the Nobel Prize Ceremony included an appearance of John Nash towering above thousands of people giving a thunderous applause. The camera shot of the attentive audience during his speech showed their respect, and the standing ovation after his speech showed their approval. The colors used in this scene are warm including gold, yellow, and orange. The last look on Nash's face after his speech was priceless. He stood there in almost disbelief and looked directly at his wife who at this point was in tears. All of Nash's struggles throughout his life with his wife remaining by his side really gave the viewer a sense of satisfaction in the last scene. John Nash truly ended up being a successful man in more than one aspect of his life regardless of the illness he carried with him.",A Beautiful Mind

1027,mortenminke,A fantastic performance by Russell Crowe and a movie that takes a surprising development.,8,26 April 2004,"After I'd just finished seeing this movie I was amazed. I had heard some very interesting things about it before I saw it, but the twists and turns that the movie takes, well, they capture you.  In my opinion ""A Beautiful Mind"" sucks you in and doesn't let go before the last surprising turn has been made. On top of the plot being absolutely gripping you have the performance by Russell Crowe.What distinguishes great actors from good actors is the ability to play different kinds of roles. For instance Sean Penn has the ability to do that, and with this movie Russell Crowe manages that as well. After being a barbarian in Gladiator he performs fantasticly as a wise, but very geeky, math genius. All in all it's an must-see movie, which you won't forget right away.",A Beautiful Mind

Crowe is phenomenal, you really see how hard it hurts him to find out although his mind is his best asset it is also his worst enemy. Seeing the struggle as he tries to fight it even though it's so hard is heartbreaking, and you see it's killing him to not be able to work as he wants to be recognised and have his own accomplishments. Supporting actors help pull the whole story together, Jennifer Connelly in particular I thought this was one of the best roles I've seen her in, she seems to embody the way the characters wife would feel if it was to happen to her, going through all these different emotions yet still wanting to stick by her husband through it all as it isn't his fault. Ed Harris is also a great supporting actor in this film, fitting the profile so well that you actually find it hard to believe it's all in Crowe's characters head.

It is so, because the story is real and you're sure that what you see is possible (and that it isn't such a thing like impossibility). However, even this film has got some flaws. I am quite in favor of  Crowe, but he is just too fit for professor. The film also makes me believe, that Nash got Nobel Prize for the discoveries he made after he became aware of his illness, I mistook.

Its soundtrack is accompanying its motion frames as if it exactly knows about the underlying moments of sorrow and greatness this couple have been going through in their lifetime. Truly, what I interpret to be the inner core of the movie is that irrational thoughts and imaginations are the main keys to great discoveries. For any every-life concern there is an infinite number of solutions since life and the universe itself are non-linear systems.

1034,ambernixon-435-830643,A Beautiful Mind is a story about a man coming to grips with the limitations of his mind.,6,29 July 2012,"Russell Crowe, playing John Nash, makes the focus of the later part of his life trying to come up with a ""truly original idea"". As he attempts to achieve this process, we watch as he struggles with relationships and interactions with other people. Having limited social grace, in a notably prestigious school such as Princeton, serves to prove as almost rewarding considering his luck at catching the attention of women. This is most especially true as he meets a beautiful girl named Alicia, Jennifer Connelly, who turns out to be his new love interest. When Nash inadvertently becomes acquainted with a man named Parcher, played by Ed Harris, the reality lines become blurred as Nash struggles to figure out whom and what is real, and what is not. In watching A Beautiful Mind, one can see the common theme is to battling our own realities. Nash makes it truly his entire focus on strengthening and using his mind for realistic and meaningful purposes. In his attempt to develop ""a truly original idea"", he becomes engulfed in his own reality and is unaware that in fact he is displaying schizophrenic tendencies. Others are engulfed in their own realities as it took many years later for anyone to recognize his need for psychiatric assistance. Associated with these episodes you can see another storyline incorporated as viewers become aware of other's reaction to what is socially acceptable of the time. Although criticism and backlash may be less harsh than our current societal tendencies, Nash suffers from stigmas throughout the rest of the film. Each character faces their own reality, and deviation from what is thought to actually exist, to what actually exists. This film similarly relates to the movie, Fight Club, where an imagination of a counterpart and friend, alter the realities of many other individuals. When Nash suddenly becomes introduced to a young student Alicia, his social limitations serve him well by giving him an endearing and mystifying quality. As the film progresses you are drawn into his secret purpose of decoding cryptography. One becomes excited at his possible discovery and chance of leaving even more social woes behind in his rise to hero status. Ironically his very worst stigma, social awkwardness, is what saves his relationships and his life, but in doing so Nash makes difficult decisions about his treatment. Finally getting close to Alicia and securing their love, allowed someone to finally focus and see an unhindered view into Nash's mind. Crowe and Connelly give suburb performances when considering the emotional state in which they must become a part of. Crowes interpretation on one's reality breaking and social awkwardness is displayed brilliantly through his jerky movements, disheveled appearance, almost vacant eyes, and sometimes mumbling dialogue. Connelly's performance of a wife trying dutifully to support her husband makes one want to break down right along beside her. When she gets angry, becomes concerned, feels lonely, the viewer feels her emotions. Her downcast eyes and her posture begin to sag with the weight of her emotions. We feel her pain and hope for her to be strong for Nash, but also hope for her happiness and freedom of safety. Two techniques I viewed at associated well with the theme were lighting and angle. Lighting was very subdued, echoing the recesses of his mind. Nash constantly focuses on the task, the goal, not the excitement of the journey and other surroundings. Various times when Nash was in Alicia's company, you can understand the change of lighting to a brighter shade as he was happier, not trapped within the limitations of his mind, enjoying the moment. Angle was also very important to the film, as many times you can see how the camera follows him and his unusual actions, or the angle cuts to how someone is socially judging his actions. In addition, many of his earlier public scenes with his schizophrenic counterparts were filmed without his other peer's taking notice, so not only they but the viewer wasn't able to immediately establish anything was wrong. Regardless of whether one believes in the process of medicine to overcome your own realities, one can safely say the definition of reality is very different for every person.",A Beautiful Mind

A Beautiful Mind is Howard's best movie, and easily one of the best movies of the year 2014. Despite problems of structure and tone, and some crucial omissions from Nash's actual life, A Beautiful Mind has emerged as one of the season's most enjoyable and popular films. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give stunning, emotional performances in A Beautiful Mind. Ron Howard has crafted a masterful film that is a revealing look at mental illness and deserves to be seen.

I must admit I didn't have a clue about the disease. This movie provided a breathtaking look inside. Quite a revelation!Complements to Russel Crowe, who totally convinces, even as an old Nash.

1038,sully512000,"Great movie, bad portrayal.",7,4 December 2004,"I thoroughly enjoyed A Beautiful Mind. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone, and I often do. But to say this is based on John Nash's life in any way other than the most remote doesn't stack up. The seemingly endless onslaught of love and support put forth by Alicia to present an eloquent story is just that, a story, with no truth to it. They made no mention to the fact that she divorced him almost 30 years prior to his winning of the Nobel Prize. Granted, she did eventually go back to him (they were remarried in 2001, 7 years after the Nobel Prize), but to portray her the way they did is just plain bad form. If you are going to say a movie is based on reality, make it somewhat realistic. Like I said, great movie, horrible portrayal of what REALLY happened.",A Beautiful Mind
1039,cruzcontrol-1,Russel Crow hits it out of the park,9,7 September 2015,Russel Crow's acting in this story about a brilliant mathematician with schizophrenia is a difficult story that was well told. The movie and the acting especially spoke to me about how anyone even smart and talented people can be born with a disease and will have to be taking things one step at a time. Also the story hits close to home for me because my grandfather who was an inventor and electrical engineer also was battling schizophrenia before he passed away. The realism that Russel Crow portrayed in the moments when he wasn't quite clear and also how he was later able to get control over his beautiful mind really was well done and shows the amount of research that he must have done for the part.

What's the title of the movie? A Beautiful Mind, not The Truth of Mathematics, it's a movie letting us know how the mind of some perosn such as John Narsh or whatever his name is, giving us in details his life from beginning and end of how much mathematics influenced and not just that but his job and most of all his wife Alicia. Before I watched the whole movie I wasn't interested, I saw parts and it seemed real boring and not good enough for me. But the first 20 minutes of the movie made me think about whether I should pause it and get a drink or just watch the whole movie and then get a drink because the storyline was so good and so interesting.

The resilience with which he faced schizophrenia while publishing outstanding works time and again then going on to win the ultimate Nobel prize simply mesmerizes me.This movie apart from shahrukh khan inspired me to take Economics as a subject and I haven't regretted any moment after that.Instead of the mundaneness attached to mathematics by many he gives an artistic value to it simply admirable. I love the way he asks what are the other things people do in their lives while giving a questioning look to his friend a fellow mathematician. Each and every scene so beautifully merges to the next and keeps the viewer thoroughly engaged. When asked he sums up the difference between genius and excellence beautifully saying ''a lot''. great performances and the effect just stays on with you.",A Beautiful Mind
1042,wouter_groen,The title says it all.,9,9 October 2015,"A beautiful mind is a movie that shows amazing screenplay with breath taking audio support. I want to start by talking about the music that supports certain scene, the music is by James Horner and after watching the movie multiple times i still listen daily to the soundtracks. Their are multiple songs that stand out that can make my picture the settings of the movie. One of my personal favorite is 'A Kaleidoscope of Mathematics' and 'Creating ""Governing Dynamics""'. The movie in mainly dominated by its amazing actors that deliver a meaningfully message, but besides its actors it delivers a solid job on the direction. My personal opinion about the cast for certain actors is debatable, for example Paul Bethany as Charles. However i automatically fell in love with Jennifer Connelly that delivers a stunning performance as Alicia Nash. The story line is deep and meaningful keeping viewers attention until the credits roll. It makes good use of the effects of surprise and bonding. Even after many times watching the movie i see each actor as a new friend. This makes it extremely enjoyable to watch over and over again.",A Beautiful Mind
1043,jasonempires,Good acting,8,23 February 2005,"The most vital element of a film is the acting. Acting can make a film good or bad, especially for films in drama genre. ""A beautiful mind"" is a successful movie because of its fabulous acting. Russel Crowe acted as John Nash. His performance was excellent because he became the character. He shaped the characteristics, behavior and tragedy of John successfully through out the film. In the film, John is a pure genius who can solve problems that baffle most of the mathematicians. There is one scene in the university canteen where he discovers an essential idea of his 'Game Theory'. He brings the audiences into his world of mind with complicated thoughts and ideas. As I was watching the film, I could understand how brilliant that John is. But it does not mean that he is perfect. This arrogant young man faced the problem of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe performed as an insane person. John's life is tragic. I could feel the bitter he has tasted in his lifetime struggle, though he fends off his fate late in his life. After countless bitter, his contribution has been approved. I am relieved and I am proud of John. Jennifer Connelly acted as Alicia Nash. She shows mercy and love to John who is having a journey of self-discovery. For the most impressive part, I should mention the time when John disappoints Alicia again because of his failure to defeat his weakness. However, Alicia does not give up John. She grabbed his tightly and put it softly onto her chest. She also put her hand on his chest to show how deep she likes John and says, 'this is real' to bring him back to reality. Really touching.",A Beautiful Mind

1045,octopus77,Well the opening music is quite good; as for the rest...,5,13 April 2005,"The only thing ""genius"" about the movie is the opening piece of music. Unfortunately even it may get cut out when the movie is ripped/converted to DivX. The depiction of either ""the creative process"" or schizophrenia is very far from what they are in any reality that I am familiar with (I am not very well familiar with schizophrenia but I've seen crazy people and science is close to me). There is no drama in John Nash's disease. All of it seems like a normal life but with a few extra people appearing to the main hero that nobody else seem to notice. The depiction of drama that followed is very sketchy at best with several decades of his life compressed into just a few minutes. The movie seems to suggest that the Nobel Prize is a sufficient reward for all of Prof. Nash's suffering. I personally would not trade 30 or more years of my life for any prize.",A Beautiful Mind

1050,Gaitte02,Two stories for the price of one,9,4 May 2014,"Having seen A Beautiful Mind a few times now, it never ceases to amaze me how well this movie is put together. From the writing of the screenplay to the cast and crew, this film is top caliber and worthy of all of the Oscar nominations and accolades bestowed upon it. This movie is at its best when viewed the first time, but each time after I seem to notice something that I had not before. That is the genius of this film.Director Ron Howard leads a talented team of actors and actresses to deliver one of my all-time favorite movies. John Nash (actor Russell Crowe) is a mathematician who is battling the debilitating mental illness, Schizophrenia. Alicia Larde (actress Jennifer Connelly) is a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T), where John Nash is a professor, who falls in love with and eventually becomes his wife.There actually two good stories intertwined to make A Beautiful Mind the classic that it is sure to be. The first is the life and accomplishments of Nobel Prize, for Economics, winner John Nash; the second is insight into the disease schizophrenia, and the effect it has on John and those closest to him. Similar to Teddy Daniels, Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie Shutter Island, this disease takes over their lives. Eventually removing the separation between reality and fantasy.My first insight into the quality of this film appeared when John Nash, a self-described loner, is attending Princeton for Graduate school; he is housed with a roommate named Charles, (actor Paul Bettany). Charles is boisterous and out-going, where Nash is the serious workaholic. Charles is also a delusion of John's mental illness. Throughout his time in the film, Charles is ingrained into the scenes, whether it is playing pool or standing outside the Helinger's office, Hellinger is played by Judd Hirsch. The nuance I did not notice until the second viewing is that Charles, and similarly with the other delusions, only interacted with John Nash. Even when Marcee, Charles' niece (actress Vivien Cardone), was running around the Princeton campus chasing birds, none of the pigeons took flight in fear of her. The timing and tempo of the movie, made these characters appear as they are the same as John and Alicia themselves. It made later characters, Dr Rosen, more difficult to discern as real or not.Another quality of the film that I enjoyed was the use of invisible sound. There is a point in the film where Alicia is gathering clothes from a clothes line, she hears what appears to be cryptic radio chatter. These noises appear to be coming from the inside of a small garage at rear of the property. When she goes to investigate, she discovers just how far along her husband's illness has progressed. He was supposed to be taking medication to keep his illness under control. With this discovery, she knows he has stopped taking his medications and that theirs sons life is in danger.One of the more memorable moments of the film is a conversation that John has with Charles atop the roof of their dormitory at Princeton. It happens the day they find out that they are roommates; John is explaining to Charles why he isn't good with people. John tells Charles, ""The truth is, I don't much like people And they don't much like me"". Later in the conversation, they delve into why John is so driven to work as hard as he does; John states, ""find a truly original idea. It's the only way to distinguish myself. Only way to truly matter"". To me, those are very powerful insights about John Nash. The fact that he is having this conversation with a person created from his illness is telling to the seriousness of his disorder. John graduates Princeton and gets a job, teaching at the Wheeler Lab, on the campus of M.I.T. During his time there, he is contracted to do cryptography work for the Department of Defense (DoD). After finishing one of his jobs decrypting Russian code, John meets Parcher (actor Ed Harris). Parcher seeks Johns help decrypting more Russian code to help foil a plot to detonate a mobile nuclear device on US soil. Parcher, like Charles, is a product of John's schizophrenia. Where Charles seemed to befriend John, Parcher seemed to use patriotism and fear to get Nash to do what he needed him to do.Eventually, with the help of Alicia and Dr. Rosen (actor Christopher Plummer) John comes to realize that Chalres, Marcee and Parcher are not flesh and blood, but part of his illness. This is the turning point in the lives of John and Alicia. Up to this point, John has been in denial of the diagnosis from Dr. Rosen, even so far as to claim Dr. Rosen is a Russian doctor trying to silence him. John almost drowns his son in the bath tub, claiming that Charles was watching him; then he shows Alicia out of the way as he thinks Parcher is about to shoot her for treason. When faced with a return to the mental hospital for more treatment, John tells Alicia that he now knows that these people are not real, he explains to her, ""I know they are not real, Marcee never ages"".Through all of the highs and lows that are John Nash's life, there is Russell Crowe giving a superb performance. All of the symptomatic subtleties, from the unusual walk to the way he talks and averts his eyes; Russell Crowe is most deserved of his Oscar nomination. His portrayal, of both, John Nash and of a man battling a mental illness would be worthy of a nomination for either performance.",A Beautiful Mind

Now,i come to explain his character in this movie.A mathematician genius,who is surrounded by some jealous mates,who always try to humiliate him,but he never loses his temper except once or twice.He keeps on working with a great composure and proves his mettle.

1052,khaled_ee00,A Beautiful Movie,9,6 October 2014,"This movie was a great experience. A guy who is a math genius, all his concerns is about knowledge and scientific thinking, and to be a great scientist. He forgot the part of being a human which is dealing with people not only with equations. His personality could be affected by the way that his family raised him they may not encourage him to socialize, they didn't build his personality correctly or his parents died when he was young so that affected him badly. During university life his problem become more complicated his mind started to fill the missing part of his life by making a close friend that is not exist. Then after graduation when he didn't get the attention that he was expected to his scientific talent, he made out that important role. After getting married and his psychological problem was discovered I think the psychiatry treatment had a negative and a positive effect on him. The positive part of it is that now he knew that he has a problem, because if his wife told him that he had a problem he may not be able to believe her. But the negative part is that psychiatry treatment makes the patient feel that he is ""psycho"" no one would like to be attacked all the time. The atmosphere in the hospital was not helping him to be fine he got an aggressive medical treatment. I think that the psychological treatment is a very good way in dealing with those kinds of cases, because it helps the patients to be able to take decisions, to be engaged with others and to find the solution to the problem that they have.I think that what helped him most is the psychological treatment, because he felt that his wife love him and she encouraged him, so he tried his best to be better. Also the role of his friends was very important, because he started to fill the friends ""social"" part and the part of practicing science again. Finally his wife is the key for his success, because she made the other half of his heart that was missing back to him.",A Beautiful Mind
1053,yemiya,Looking through the window of the mind,10,13 July 2005,"The film A Beautiful Mind shows that the human mind is capable of creating its own reality separate and apart from the physical reality. The film showed how a illusionary reality could exist parallel to the real reality. Russell Crowe played excellent portrayal of Dr. John Nash an award winning scholar and mathematician genius The story was based on a real life: and director Ron Howard did an excellent job in shooting the film. The movie was not about the life of Dr. John Nash"" but it was about his mind A Beautiful Mind is a must see I have not seen a movie like this one with so much passion in creating a sense of reality: but at the same time making an illusion appear real The movie was very powerful in bringing its point across to the viewers. I would recommend A Beautiful Mind as a study guide for psychology majors because it is a good discussion piece. This movie reminds me of a powerful drama based on a real life story that came out in 1977. The name of the movie was Sybil, directed by Daniel Petrie. A Beautiful Mind is about the human mind and inner conflict, it makes you think and want to know more about the mysteries of the human mind... John refused to allow his delusions to take control as he gained back control over his life. The delusions became powerless, but they stayed with him, always lurking, waiting and watching, in the shadows of his mind. In conclusion my overall appreciation for the film and the theme's importance to the film is how the story was portrayed; giving the viewers a real sense of what mental illness must have been like for John Nash. The film was entirely based on the concept of the power of the mind and how John became a prisoner of his own mind.Looking out of the window of the mind: and working in the confines of his mind John live in two worlds: but one world only exists in his mind. The film gave me a better understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of mental illness and the devastating effect it can have on a person's life. The film showed that in the mind of the beholder in this case, John Nash; the physical as well as the illusionary world could exist parallel to one another. The film also showed how the illusionary world could take over and become precedent over the physical world. The film A Beautiful Mind was a story about mysteries the human mind.",A Beautiful Mind

1058,bogdanteodorescu-13157,A remarkable movie you won't forget,10,4 March 2018,"""A Beautiful Mind"" is brilliant. Brian Grazer and Ron Howard did an amazing job once again, the movie deserving the 4 Oscars and 4 Golden Globes, no doubt about that. It was clearly the best movie of 2001, actually one of the best movies I've ever seen. The movie tells the story of the well-known mathematician John Nash, picturing his life from the moment he arrived at Princeton, until the winning of the Nobel Prize in the late 90's (for his extraordinary work in game theory, his work being a true foundation of economics). ""A Beautiful Mind"" is pretty accurate with the historical truth, presenting most of the struggles in Nash's life, although not all of them. The plot was amazing, in my opinion another thing that impressed the people at the Academy. The viewer is made to see almost all the film through the eyes of John Nash, ignoring all the subtle hints at the mental-illness he is suffering of, everything making a lot of sense at the end of the movie. Also, the acting was amazing, and it really mattered. Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash was just stunning, culminating with the moments picturing Nash old and with his amazing body-language, the kind of things that even the best actors struggle with. This performance was clearly 
Crowe's best. Of course, Jennifer Connelly's acting shouldn't be overlooked. She knew how to handle all the moments of the movie flawlessly. In my opinion, despite everything else, the most important part of the film is John Nash's inner-fight with his problems. From the heights of academical glory and recognition, to the depths of his mental-illness, John Nash is experiencing everything. Above all, the film gets into the deepest of Nash's
mind of soul. The movie expresses so well Nash's genius that there are no words to explain. Truly beautiful and honest.No more words to say, judging with a very critical view, the film would get a rating of 9/10, because of the few historical truths hidden. Although, in my point view, the omitted truths can be easily ignored so it is maybe the most honest 10/10 rating I ever gave. The film is more than a 2-hour video, it
is the story of a genius, a story of both love and bravery. Bogdan Teodorescu, 4th of March 2018R.I.P. John Forbes Nash and Alicia Nash, 2015, amazing peoplePARENTAL ADVISORY!

1059,rishabhrbs,A Beautiful Mind,8,15 August 2016,"A Beautiful Mind (2001)Inspired by a bestselling biographical novel by Sylvia Nasar, the movie 'A Beautiful Mind' is based upon the life of Dr. John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel Laureate in Economics.Starting from his very first day as student in Princeton University, the film shows various aspects of Nash's life, his work at Princeton and MIT and with The Pentagon. He was the kind of person who dedicates his time to mathematics rather than interacting with his fellow student. He was under pressure to find an ""Original idea"" for his thesis. He got the idea when he and his co-students were discussing on various ways to approach a group of girls. At first the movie seems to be one having more technical things than a story. When half of the movie gets over, Nash's life suddenly took a turn for the worse. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The rest of the movie shows Nash's transformation from a person struggling with schizophrenia who is not able to identify what is true to one of the most significant contributor in Economics. The movie ends as Nash receives Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work in game theory.I really enjoyed the movie. This movie is a masterpiece and truly worthy of the Oscar which it won in 2002.Rishabh Bhardwaj",A Beautiful Mind
1060,rite2me85,"An intriguing and informative film, well worth anyone's time",10,22 August 2005,"In looking at the front cover and title of the film, one may immediately be put off by the overbearing seriousness that abounds from the films subject and setting. Yet it is the excellent stewardship of such a sensitive subject, performed by a cast of quality actors and produced by an equally excellent directing team, that makes this film so worth watching. It may not be an easy watch but it is none the less a must see for anyone involved or interested in filmography.The film opens with what appears to be the average scenario of a young protagonist (Crowe) in a fresh situation. Yet it is the development of the plain, to tell an amazing and indeed beautiful story, that allows the audience to become involved with that which turns out to be a far less than average reality.The film sticks well to the the story of the real John Nash, a genius whose talent is marred by mental illness, but extends this to educate its audience in the horrors of the abnormality it details. Extensive description of the condition here would potentially spoil this masterpiece for anyone who has not yet seen it, assuredly however, after watching it, no further explanation of the subject, explored through what is essentially a case study of the scientist John F Nash, seems necessary for an audience.The film occasionally fringes on the strange, but masterfully never to a degree whereby the viewer's attention is lost. It is, in fact, a delightful blend of the ordinary and the bizarre that is precisely what makes this film so watchable and informative. These well developed qualities however, are manifested through a brilliantly constructed insight into the mind of a victim which simply could not be accessed outside of biography.This film is certainly not recommendable to anyone looking for entertainment only, but for one who is prepared to be shocked, excited and taken through an emotional roller-coaster, this is a film well worth seeing.",A Beautiful Mind
1061,jessicasaxon,Amazing Film,9,29 September 2016,"This film had me captivated from the start and it should be on anyone's watch list. Also anyone who is a fan of Russell Crowe should watch the film. Russell Crowe's acting and the development of his character is of top quality. Anyone who is thinking about a career in acting should watch this film. It is a great film for people of all ages as it is interesting and informative. I could watch this film many times without getting bored. Jennifer Connelly's acting is equally as good as Russell's and her character has a very believable and raw emotional quality to it. Great acting, filming and overall production quality. It is not surprising that it won an academy award for best picture.",A Beautiful Mind
1062,smithc-07556,"From Book to Screen, Drastically Different",9,30 October 2016,"After seeing this film multiple times, it took me years to buckle down and read the book. It was is I was reading a different story. The film ""A Beautiful Mind"" starring Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris was a gripping real life story of Nobel Prize awarded mathematician John Nash and his out of the box way of solving problems and learning the greatest lesson of life. Director Ron Howard did an excellent job of selecting the right team to bring the story from book to screen in a way that would keep viewers inspired, intrigued and with the ending wanting to learn more about the real life of John Nash. Watching this film one time is not enough as there are many scenes and sequences packed with the building blocks that tell viewers how John Nash played by Russell Crowe how he went from an being normal to discovering his unique abilities. What's also inspiring John Nash's wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly and her undying dedication and loyalty through John's severe struggle of separating the real world from fantasy. William Parcher played by Ed Harris is a fooler in this film as we think he's one thing, but turns out to be another. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those films that you will never get bored of watching as it's not only inspiring, but you may catch a detail that you didn't pick up the last time around. As mentioned before, watching the film and referencing the book was shocking as so many details were left out that it seemed I was reading a different story and John Nash was more complex than the movie portrayed, in which the film character was a very complicated person. What both the book and the film did accomplish in sync was telling a story of a genius who wanted to discover the complex answers and found the simple solution. A definite must own movie.",A Beautiful Mind
1063,jhjr-76368,A Gift and a Curse,8,15 December 2016,"I have the health condition of clinical depression and anxiety by being bipolar with schizophrenia added to the mix. I say it's a curse because I don't handle everyday pressures from work, stress, marriage.. life well at all. The accumulation of it builds up and I repress it, in denial. It has cost me my job, home, wife, friends, etc. Little did I know 90% of marriages end in divorce with one partner that is bipolar. I'd wake up every morning with terrible stomach problems not even realizing it was anxiety. I guess as a man you just suck it up, but it caught up with me as work became more demanding. Thankfully with the help of medication it is managed somewhat although it makes me lethargic, tired, have memory/concentration issues, and not be as coordinated.Thing is, it is also a gift. Without sounding like a prideful person I am very intelligent. Certain things just come easy to me. Definitely not mathematics, like the movie, but in using logic, reason, and discernment. Thinking deeply on matters. I take any negativity in my life and try to flip it into something positive, using humor or finding a solution, a way around it mentally. Anyways, thanks for reading my post. Good luck to you if you are battling any health or family issues in your life. We all are it seems.",A Beautiful Mind
1064,snooks101,Beautiful Mind or maybe something else??,8,12 October 2005,"Russell Crowe was a good choice on portraying John Nash, but he should have done his research on Schizophrenia or the type of therapies that were done on patients with schizophrenia. This was the basic ""Hollywood"" view on people that have schizophrenia, even though Russell Crowe did a good job acting wise, there was a lot of information that wasn't told about John Nash, that would help the background of the movie, for instance that schizophrenia was shown in other family members, so it was genetic. I feel that the movie could have been set up a little differently, but movies that are based on true stories always hold things out. I guess no one really wants to watch a five-hour movie. Overall I give the movie an 8 out of 10.",A Beautiful Mind
1065,xteriors2003,Watch it at least twice.,10,23 November 2005,"This movie is so good. It is so well written, acted and directed. I really did not want to see it but one day, laying around I happened upon it and watched the whole thing. I was blown away. It was just so deep and touching. I loved every aspect of the movie but to really figure out some of the scenes, you have to watch it twice. Trust me when I say that you will not be able to stop after twice. It really is one of the best movies to come out in the past few decades.The acting is incredible. Russel Crowe really is gifted in this film. I cant say enough about it other than you have to see this movie if you like dramas.",A Beautiful Mind
1066,ladyluc128,A Beautiful Mind is a spectacular portrayal that love IS blind!,8,13 October 2005,"I find that usually movies based on true stories are more appealing to watch. A Beautiful Mind was quite enjoyable to watch because although the story seemed so far-fetched, knowing that there were aspects of truth to it made the movie very interesting. Two things about the movie that I appreciated most were: 1)Alicia's love for John Nash and 2)the representation of a paranoid schizophrenic's world through their eyes.People of the general public are often afraid to LIVE WITH(or near) schizophrenics, but are unaware of how much more frightening it could be to LIVE AS a schizophrenic. A Beautiful Mind provided a great depiction of the difficulties which a paranoid schizophrenic might have to endure. Russell Crowe's character, John Nash, provided viewers with a look at the scary world through the eyes of a paranoid schizophrenic. Crowe's character help others better understand that those who are ""insane"" are still human and are very well capable of feeling some of the same emotions that the ""sane"" people feel. Nash was able to relate and share the most important part of all human factors and that component was love. In subtle and indirect ways, love helped Nash realize that he was ill and love gave him the support to make it through his days. Nash was able to rebuild his life after schizophrenia through love and that makes me admire Alicia's strength to truly love him unconditionally.I did some research on the real John Nash's life and it was not as beautiful as portrayed in the movie. However,on the plus side, he and Alicia are married and he is still a mathematician at Princeton.I highly recommend this movie.",A Beautiful Mind

1069,hachenbb,Russel was something else!,8,10 May 2017,"This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John won Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory-- has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, the American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.",A Beautiful Mind
1070,rbbwllms011,By far the most brilliant movie I have ever seen :),10,25 October 2005,"A truly brilliant story, filmed in a truly brilliant fashion with truly brilliant acting by esp. Russell Crowe & Jennifer Connelly :) Very hard to top this movie for those fans who consider themselves to be(semi)intellectuals :) The complex subject of schizophrenia is explained in a way I have never seen before. Around this central theme, another very moving story evolves of true love by an incredibly courageous & wise partner as played very convincingly by Jennifer Connelly. The special traditions and customs of a typical upper class University add yet another fine flavor to this superb movie. Well deserved awards, but too few as Russell Crowe is simply magnificent :)",A Beautiful Mind
1071,birender,Excellent movie,10,11 June 2017,"One of my friends suggested me this movie. I wasn't aware of the plot beforehand. Neither I knew about the person on whom this movie was based. Which fortunately turned this to an even more intriguing for me. Maybe that is why my first recommendation would be do not research anything beforehand in order to avoid despoiling the surprises of this movie. These types of movies expect nil information about the plot on the viewers part. That is how they will successfully bind you.A beautiful mind is an American biographical drama film based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. In this movie, John Nash was suffering from a disease schizophrenia. Now the question arrives, What the hell is Schizophrenia? Imagine if you suddenly learned that the people, the places, the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been. What kind of hell would that be? This movie is the answer. It shows, How John Nash proves that psychiatrists were wrong about schizophrenia being a brain disease like Alzheimers and Parkinson's. How he refuses to hospitalize himself and courageously decides to tackle with the imaginary people inside his mind. This is the plot on which this movie is based.According to me, what makes this movie different from others is it's extraordinary attention to the details. There is nothing mentioned in the movie which could come in conflict with your common reasoning. There are no violation of nature's law, no preternatural intelligence, no ostentatious scenes which could be refuted by my reasoning skills. For example, When Parcher implanted IC inside Nash's hand which he used while unlocking the doors (by scanning his hand on the scanner). In the next scenes where movie reveals Parcher was a fictional character because of Nash's disease. I was in between devils and the deep as my mind was continuously asking why the hell he was not checking his hand for the IC? That would be the biggest proof whether the characters are imaginary or real. Guess what? Within few moments I see Nash scratching his hand for the IC. which made both of us believe that he was suffering from the disease. Again, when Parcher meets Nash and tries to maintain his credibility of his real existence. He said the IC which was implanted vanished because it was made of Radium which decayed completely. I was enthralled by this scene and for the second time along with Nash, I believed Parcher is no more a fictional character.I think, the rationality of this movie is what makes it so great. While watching this movie, I placed myself at Nash's situation, and was trying to figure out how I would deal. Believe me, the things which I thought I would do to solve these conflict, the same solutions Nash used in the movie. The only thing which I think only Nash could do was the finesse with which he dealt with such characters.Furthermore, the way this movie tries to explain things with rationality which themselves are irrational is simply beyond one's approach. Quoting one scene from the movie.When John Nash Proposes Alicia.Nash: Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment? I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data.Alicia: I'm sorry, just give me a moment to redefine my girlish notions of romance.Alicia: How big is the universe?Nash: Infinite.Alicia: How do you know?Nash: I know because all the data indicates it's infinite.Alicia: But it hasn't been proved yet.Nash: No.Alicia: You haven't seen it.Nash: No.Alicia: How do you know for sure?Nash: I don't, I just believe it.Alicia: It's the same with love I guess.There are still a lot more to say about this movie which I found highly admirable. Things which can only be observed and that's why you should watch this movie.",A Beautiful Mind
1072,daveykva,One of the finest films ever made.,10,11 June 2019,This is a movie that holds a place in my heart and in my opinion will go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made. Everything from the story to the perfectly cast actors. The story is delivered at a great pace and has some really touching moments that hit home.This film was introduced to me by my father and it will forever strike a chord with me emotionally.It would quite possibly be my go to movie to recommend to friends and family.,A Beautiful Mind
1073,sovmix,Superb representation of mental illness,8,5 December 2005,"The film is a little flawed here and there to my mind, such as when he pushes the desk out of his window (with his imaginary friend) and it seems that any subsequent inquiries by the authorities do not alert him to the non-existence of his 'friend'. But things like this are just quibbles. The film draws the viewer into what appears to be a plausible 'World of Nash', only for the whole thing to unravel before our eyes, with the realisation that much of what we have seen is mere fantasy. The film is a superb depiction of a very much misunderstood condition and a finely-crafted plea for tolerance. To my mind, the most moving part was the Nobel man deftly steering him into the tea rooms and Nash being presented with pens by his associates. I would never have watched this sort of film if I hadn't been talked into by my son. He's 16. I'm 53.",A Beautiful Mind
1074,Jync,A brilliant man who is a genius with numbers but becomes ill diagnosed with schizophrenia,8,30 December 2005,"A nice film which, I think, won an Oscar. It is a great and very touching movie which I like really much. I simply must buy it on DVD if it's possible because it is so great.Russell Crowe just acts so brilliantly with all of his emotions involved, especially in the scene where they tell his wife how often he is giving the medicine, and the co-actors and actresses also acts nice. Why haven't I seen this before. And I just love the way the movie ended. And furthermore I didn't knew it was real and that he lives in Princeton. I would like to meet him if I ever came there but who knows maybe I'll bump into him even though it is unlikely.Cheers, Johan",A Beautiful Mind

And as John had to learn so hard that he has to just ignore them, we can learn that by ignoring those thoughts or let's say, making sure that they are true, our life can be lived easier... Does it make sense? I felt it is so true for me that I decided to share it... I hope somebody else will also consider it true :)",A Beautiful Mind
