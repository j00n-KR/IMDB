0,TheLittleSongbird,The not-terrifying-enough supernatural,4,15 October 2018,"Have an appreciation for horror and there are a fair share of good to classic ones in the genre as well as a fair share of not so good and even downright bad ones. Really liked both 'The Conjuring' films so watched 'Annabelle', which has garnered a lot of comparisons to especially the first film (having been released before the second, though saw 'Annabelle' after seeing the 'Conjuring' films) hoping it would be in similar vein, purposefully not reading too many reviews (those read disappointingly indicating otherwise).'Annabelle' unfortunately turned out to be a disappointment. Have definitely seen far worse films, horror and overall (it's not even one of the worst of 2014), 'Annabelle' is not irredeemable. It sadly has a lot of faults that makes it a very lacklustre film, and if briefly comparing it to 'The Conjuring' it is nowhere near being in the same ball park. It is a shame because it does start off very well. It is creepy to start with and the Manson-esque attack is unsettling and staged very well. It looks good too, nicely shot and the set design and late 60s setting are both beautiful and atmospheric to look at. Similarly well done is the score, which does have many haunting moments. The titular character has moments of creepiness. Unfortunately, there are times where she could have done with more expression. 'Annabelle's' biggest problems though is that when it goes downhill, which it does do rapidly far too early, it is not scary, nor is it particularly interesting. Tension and suspense is nowhere near enough and the too infrequent scares are obvious and going-through-the-motions like. Didn't feel much palm-sweating or heart-stopping here. Much of it is basically formulaic storytelling, that is also on the dull side, and a constant ticking off of predictable shocks and familiar genre tropes, the type of scares the film is over-reliant on having no build up or suspense. Furthermore, 'Annabelle' has a banal script that has no flow or substance and direction that suggests their heart was not in it or at ease with the material. The pacing on the most part is perfunctory and the acting has little distinction, not amateurish but nobody stands out. The characters are not easy to engage with with so little development or much personality, while the ending is one big rushed anti-climax and things do get ridiculous and silly as the film progresses to an increasingly intensifying degree.Concluding, lacklustre. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Annabelle
1,Leofwine_draca,Horror tedium,4,24 November 2016,"ANNABELLE is another derivative horror film, very similar in look and tone to THE CONJURING, of which it is a spin off. The predictable story sees your usual happily married couple come into possession of a creepy doll and who subsequently find themselves menaced by ghostly events at their home.Needless to say this is a very traditional haunted house movie with nothing in the way of originality or freshness to recommend it. Mainly the film follows the wife as she's spooked by various apparitions and creepy stuff going on. The cast is made up of the usual priests, doctors, and disbelievers, and the scares are inevitably of the CGI-enhanced variety. When did modern horror become so passe? Well-telegraphed scares and endless supposedly creepy dread does not a good film make. Annabelle Wallis, who was quite dreadful in PEAKY BLINDERS, is equally unsympathetic here and ANNABELLE as a whole is a chore to watch.",Annabelle
2,SnoopyStyle,scariest thing is the sewing machine,4,21 August 2015,It's 1969 and the Manson family is in the news. Dr. John Gordon (Ward Horton) and his pregnant wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis) move into a Santa Monica house. He buys a vintage doll for her collection. They are attacked by a Higgins cult couple. The police arrives just in time. Strange things happen and the kitchen burns. They decide to throw out the doll and move to an apartment in Pasadena with their daughter Leah. Somehow the doll is in one of the boxes and Mia decides to keep it. Strange things continue to happen. Father Perez (Tony Amendola) and Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) try to help the young family.The last half of the movie is a struggle. At least the first half has the sewing machine. They're able to squeeze some tension from that prop. The gimmick is that Annabelle needs someone to voluntarily give up their soul. It makes the victim a pretty weak character. Essentially it preys on the weak and vulnerable. It's not scary. It's kinda pathetic. The movie relies too much on things moving in the background and other less than effective scare tactics. It adds nothing original.,Annabelle
3,claudio_carvalho,Unoriginal Chucky with Skirt,6,10 January 2015,"In Santa Monica, California, Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John Gordon (Ward Horton) are happily married and Mia is pregnant. John is concluding the medical school and does not have much time to give attention to his beloved wife, so he buys an ancient and rare doll named Annabelle for her collection. But soon their next door neighbors are attacked by two members of a satanic cult that break in their house and attack them after killing the neighbors. Mia and John are saved by the police officers and Mia needs to rest until the delivery. But there is a fire in their house and Mia early delivers a baby girl, Leah. The family moves to an apartment in Pasadena but first Mia throws the doll Annabelle away in the garbage. However she finds the doll in a box while unpacking things in her new home. Weird things happen to Mia and she befriends Evelyn (Alfre Woodard), who works in a bookstore, and she learns about an evil cult that wants Leah's soul. When John and Mia summons Father Perez (Tony Amendola) to help them with Annabelle, evil is stronger than the priest and he is sent injured to the hospital. Who may save Leah's soul now? ""Annabelle"" is an unoriginal horror movie with an evil doll that is a sort of Chucky with skirt. The plot is creepy in few moments only and never engaging. The story is weak but the performances and the cinematography are decent. I had great expectations with this movie and the deception was also great. But if the viewer sees this movie with less expectation, he or she may enjoy some fright moments. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Annabelle""",Annabelle
4,nogodnomasters,CRAZY PEOPLE DO CRAZY THINGS,4,12 November 2018,"There is nothing like a story about a haunted doll, without much doll. The film centers around Mia (Annabelle Wallis) who is trying to save her newborn child from being demonically possessed from a demon currently in the doll. Like vampires, souls must be offered to the demon before they can come in. Our couple don't know how to destroy the doll, no matter how hard they don't try. The local priest helps them out with advice as it seems demons inside of dolls is common place.Electrical devices turn on by themselves...ooh scary and Mia runs around frantically in the dark for about half the film. They could have easily cut about 30 minutes out of the middle and no one would notice.The production could have shown us some cult activity. Maybe see the doll do something horrific. Nope. Too low budget. It was just a bad script with actors who couldn't pull it off. Over-hyped.Chucky really spoiled me.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",Annabelle
5,kosmasp,Teaser,6,23 February 2015,"Conjuring was really good, so I do understand that quite a few people see this as a bad movie. It doesn't live up to what Conjuring promised or what we thought might be coming, but still it's not a bad movie. It's just a horror by the numbers where you can see and guess where this is going or when the scary bits will pop up.It takes itself seriously and it does play during the Manson Family time, which gives this an edge in ""realism"" if you want to call it that. So there is real horror involved to heighten things, but it might not be enough to satisfy most horror fans. Especially because of the mentioned expectations. A shame, though that still means ""Chucky"" remains the number one under the most scary dolls (low budget puppet movie efforts excluded)",Annabelle
6,classicsoncall,"""All she wanted was to be friends"".",7,1 November 2014,"First a story - this past summer I helped a friend empty the contents of the home he grew up in to get it ready to put on the market. Tucked away in an upstairs box was a porcelain doll that a friend of his mother had made. Neither my friend, his wife or their young daughter liked it much at the time (going back about thirty five years ago), so it stayed where it was. Retrieving the doll from the trash heap, I hit upon a devilish idea, right after my friend described the doll as the kind of creepy looking thing that winds up coming back after it's gone. Living several states away, and knowing it would be another week or so before my friend would be back home, I called his wife and arranged to have the doll stashed somewhere he would find it and make his prediction come true. When he finally got home and found it, the stunt now ranks as one of the all time greats.That's part one. Part two occurred a couple weeks later when I went to see a movie. One of the trailers was for ""Annabelle"", and right off the bat, Ward Horton's character walks in the house, sees the doll, and says (paraphrasing) - 'I thought I got rid of that thing'. So now the movie's out, and even though this isn't my usual cinema fare, I was having one of those ""Snakes on a Plane"" moments and decided to catch it after work yesterday. The thing is, it was Halloween and seemed made to order for this flick. I made it to a 5:15 PM showing and quite strangely, I was the only one in the theater. I'm not really the superstitious type, but once the nitty gritty stuff started occurring on screen, I have to admit I looked around every now and then to make sure nothing was creeping up on me.Even with that, I'm not going out of my way to say this was a genre defining horror flick because it wasn't. In fact it seemed rather clichéd for the most part, though it had some scary moments that even if you're prepared for, make you jump involuntarily. The creepiest was when the apparition of young Annabelle rushed Mia (Annabelle Wallis, there's a coincidence) and turned into adult Satanic Annabelle before disintegrating into nothingness. Remarkably, the film restrained itself from using the most obvious of horror clichés. Come on, I know you expected the doll's eyes to move during every one of those long close ups, right? Once the picture zeroes in on book shop Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) and her story about the car crash that killed her daughter, the ending became somewhat predictable. The final fade had sort of that old Twilight Zone quality where the spirit of Annabelle would find it's way to the next unlucky owner. And since I bring up the Twilight Zone, it's rather interesting that the writers might have borrowed from a Rod Serling script from a memorable Season Five episode of that series for the title of this picture. In the story titled 'Living Doll', actor Telly Savalas is menaced by his daughter Christie's new doll, who taunts the abusive husband and father with comments like ""I'm Talking Tina, and I'm going to kill you"". Savalas' character believes it's his wife who's behind the talking doll gimmick, the name of his wife being - Annabelle.",Annabelle
7,jboothmillard,Annabelle,4,16 July 2016,"I heard about this film during the time of its release, I knew it was about an evil doll, but I had no idea until I read into it that it was a spin-off and prequel to The Conjuring, I forgot that the doll appeared briefly in it, so I watched the original and followed it with this. Basically, set in 1969, in Santa Monica, California, Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John Gordon (Ward Horton) are happily married and expecting their first child. John gives Mia a doll she has been looking for as a gift. At night, Mia hears a murder occurring next door at the Higgins'. When Mia calls the police she is attacked by Annabelle Higgins (Tree O'Toole) holding the doll. The police arrive and kill her male accomplice, while the woman kills herself slitting her own throat, a drop of her blood falls on the face of the doll. It is revealed that Annabelle Higgins was part of the Disciples of the Ram, a satanic cult. Since she was holding the doll while dying, Mia wants John to throw it away. Later, a fire is caused, Mia escapes it but goes into labour. Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl named Leah and the family move to a new apartment. Mia is confused to find the discarded doll in amongst their possessions to unpack. As time goes by, strange paranormal activities are plaguing Mia and the baby. Mia finds out more about the cult Annabelle Higgins was part of, they sought to summon a demon by claiming a soul. With the help of bookstore owner Evelyn (Star Trek: First Contact's Alfre Woodard), who is haunted by the memory of a car accident that killed her daughter, they determine that a haunting is occurring, and it wants Leah's soul. They contact Father Perez (Tony Amendola) who agrees to take the doll and look into it, but the demonic spirit of the doll attacks the priest. The doll disappears, Perez in hospital warns John that his injuries were caused by the evil of the doll. Mia is confronted by the demon itself, holding doll Annabelle. Mia realises that the demon will only be satisfied if a soul is sacrificed. John and Evelyn find Mia before she is about to jump out the window with Annabelle, John saves her, while Evelyn takes Annabelle and kills herself, to atone for the death of her daughter. Annabelle disappears following Evelyn's sacrifice. Six months later, the Forms have moved on and have not seen the doll since, it is seen being purchased by a woman in a store, as a gift for her daughters. The ending tells that the doll is kept by Ed and Lorraine Warren in a case and blessed twice a month to keep people safe. Also starring Kerry O'Malley as Sharon Higgins, Brian Howe as Pete Higgins, Eric Ladin as Detective Clarkin, Ivar Brogger as Dr. Burgher and Keira Daniels as Young Annabelle Higgins. This does not work as well compared to The Conjuring, it has none of the style of a Chucky doll movie or something, Annabelle is certainly a disturbing looking toy possessed by a nasty spirit, but the story is rather predictable, and some of the scares fall flat, so it is a slightly silly supernatural horror. Okay!",Annabelle
8,BA_Harrison,Annabelle: you ugly!,5,8 September 2018,"When medical student John (Ward Horton) buys a rare vintage doll for his pregnant wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis), the last thing he expects is for his gift to become a source of unimaginable evil, but that's precisely what happens after Manson-like Satanic cultists violently attack the couple in their home and somehow turn the doll into a conduit for a demon.There's a nail-biting moment in Annabelle where Mia is absent-mindedly using a sewing machine, her fingertips getting nearer and nearer to the rapidly moving needle. It promises to be very nasty indeed, but winds up being frustratingly tame. That's the main problem with Annabelle: it never really delivers. Take the film's demon, for example: it provides a handful of lame jump scares, but it never actually does any serious harm. A freaky scene that sees Mia in an elevator that repeatedly arrives on the same floor had potential, director John R. Leonetti skillfully cranking up the tension, his evil creature lurking in the dark poised to strike, but in the end Mia easily escapes via some stairs to her apartment. I wanted to be terrified, but I wasn't.The other issue I have with Annabelle is this: who the hell would make such a freakin' ugly doll in the first place? In reality, no-one would buy something that repulsive. They'd be hard pushed to give the damned thing away, yet John pays a small fortune for the doll and his wife is only too pleased when she sees it. At least Chucky was reasonably cute (before his face got all messed up, that is).",Annabelle
9,paul_haakonsen,Seriously?...,3,9 January 2016,"""Annabelle"" was as pointless and ridiculous as it was devoid of scares. And that was awfully lot! And a lot of people had hyped this movie up to being so much, which really made it seem like a must watch movie. And when I finally got around to seeing it, I ended up being disappointed on so many levels.The story is a shameless cash in on a part of the popular ""The Conjuring"" movie in a vague attempt to bring life to the semi-creepy Annabelle doll displayed in ""The Conjuring"". It was weak soup boiled on a stripped down bone.Throughout the course of the entire movie I was waiting for something scary to happen on the screen. But nothing happened. Nothing! At best, the movie could muster a semi-creepy part with the basement / elevator / stairwell segment.Sure, the doll itself is a bit creepy, but not to a point where it becomes scary or disturbing. And having a devil, demon or Satan himself crawl around on the ceiling was just slapping the audience in the face.""Annabelle"" was a massive disappointment in so many ways. I love horror movies, but ""Annabelle"" belongs in the lower scale of scares and enjoyment value. If you enjoy a good horror movie with a properly though through storyline and containing scares, then your money is most definitely better spent elsewhere.",Annabelle
10,Coventry,The love-child of Charles Manson and Charles Lee Ray,4,28 February 2019,"""Annabelle"" is a spin-off of the 2013 hit ""The Conjuring"". That film was so successful and critically acclaimed that you honestly cannot blame the producers for wanting to squeeze the formula like a lemon and exploit every possible side story or creep-factor that can be exploited. As far as I remember, the porcelain doll Annabelle was simply a piece of eerie scenery in the original, but barely one year later it thus received its very own and hyped full-length feature film. It's certainly not a bad idea, but they overlooked one small but important little detail: ""The Conjuring"" was directed by James Wan, and he just happens to be one of the most gifted young directors of the new millennium. Wan has an incredible eye for sinister atmosphere, and all his horror films (""Saw"", ""Dead Silence"", ""Insidious"", ""The Conjuring"") are intense & horrifying. John R. Leonetti, on the other hand, is a decent cinematographer but a very mediocre director. Under his leadership, ""Annabelle"" is hardly more than a standard ghost-movie with predictable jump-moments and lukewarm scares. In 1970, in California, John and Mia live in a peaceful church community and are anxiously awaiting the birth of their first child. The loving husband he is, John managed to purchase a large porcelain doll for Mia's collection, and it promptly receives an honoree place in the baby room. Shortly after, members of a deranged satanic cult invade their home and one of them is shot dead by the police whilst holding the Annabelle doll in her arms. I reckon you can easily guess what happens next, right? Although linked to ""The Conjuring"", ""Annabelle"" feels more reminiscent to the original ""Child's Play"" and one of the numerous movies about the crimes committed by the followers of Charles Manson. In ""Child's Play', prior to dying, serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transfers his soul into a toy doll via occult spells, but here this seemingly happens automatically with the porcelain doll. The crazed Satanists are more than obviously modeled after the Manson Family members that murdered actress Sharon Tate and her friends. There are a handful of noteworthy sequences, but Leonetti focuses too much on the spooky doll's face rather than on plot development. Even the best sequences are derivative, like the little girls foreboding drawings, and the climax is extremely unsatisfying. Who is this Evelyn woman, anyways?",Annabelle

When they do, they are not exactly alone. The creepy doll, Annabelle, has somehow attracted an evil entity from the home invasion. Something very sinister is using the doll as a conduit to terror.This is a prequel to THE CONJURING. ANNABELLE, no doubt, will attract her own fans. One ugly doll for sure.

12,hitchcockthelegend,Tis time to move on from conduit demons.,5,21 March 2015,"It doesn't have James Wan's name on the director's chair, but it's every inch a James Wan film. There seems to be a rut that has emerged where this new brand of horror film makers can't see that recycling the same ideas is, well, kinda dull.Insidious, Dead Silence and The Conjuring have their critics (not me, I like them all very much), but the timing was right for them to hit the mark of many a horror film lover. Tapping into the fear of the doll and the demon hadn't been done for some time, certainly not with any conviction, so all good there for the fans.Annabelle spins off from The Conjuring, and Dead Silence to a degree, but just comes off as a lazy cash-cow. The doll is a spooky monstrosity (most unlike the real Rag-Dolly-Anna version), but it's all a bit of a con, the makers resorting to another demonic being, only Red Darth Maul has now been replaced by Blue Lagoon The Loon.Character's actions are often preposterous, stretching credulity to breaking point (I know you are being menaced by the unknown, but I got a conference to go to, sleep tight babe!). Elsewhere, while everyone acknowledges that what scares you is subjective, but the scares here are very thin on the ground, not helped by a dull script and bland lead actors.It's tidy enough a production, granted, but familiarity breeds contempt and it's hoped that Wan's return to the director's chair for The Conjuring 2 (where we revisit the realm of poltergeist activity), signals a return to form for his horror stable. 5/10",Annabelle
13,LeonLouisRicci,Sometimes Scary PrequelMore Than Just Jump Scares,7,3 April 2015,"Slightly Underrated Prequel to The Conjuring (2013), a Movie Based on a Real-Life Event, this isn't as Well Crafted but is a Competent Horror Movie that is More than Jump Scares, but Does Have Quite a Few of Those.The Opening Home Invasion is a Creepy, Disturbing Connection to the Sharon Tate Murders, that are ""coincidentally"" in the Movie's Time Frame of About 1970 and are Shown on the TV News, and is a Frightening Foreshadowing.The Devil Imagery is Lurking Everywhere and there are Enough Eerie Set-Pieces to Haunt the Screen and the Viewer with Dread and Despair. Apart from the Manson Family Tie-In, there are Also Similarities to Rosemary's Baby (1968), from Relatively the Same Time Period. So All of the References are an Ominous Link to This Story and its Milieu.Tepid Reviews and Fans of the Original Seem Disappointed, but there are Some Scares Here and is Recommended for Horror Fans and Especially Those that are Attracted to the Occult and Supernatural Stories with References to Religion. Note...Although the Doll is the conduit to the conjuring of the ""Devil Doings"", it is just that and not a ""Chucky"" Type of Animation and isn't quite a ""Killer Doll"", more of a gateway.",Annabelle
14,utgard14,Not Bad,5,1 November 2014,"I liked The Conjuring more but this wasn't half-bad. There are a few good scares and, overall, it's a nice one to watch with your significant other. That isn't to say it's particularly original because it isn't. It does borrow from other movies and peddles some clichés. Alfre Woodard's character, for one. One part I loved was when the woman didn't want to go back to the house after some freaky stuff went down. That's very refreshing. Usually in these movies people return to the house over and over no matter how scared they are. Of course that was somewhat undone by her being cool with keeping the creepy Annabelle doll that pops up after being thrown away.",Annabelle

Very disappointing prequel to THE CONJURING giving the origin story of the titular possessed doll which depicts vanilla bland couple Wallis and Horton beginning their lives together with a baby on the way leading to echoes of ROSEMARY's BABY and an overactive sound track. Woodard actually looks beyond bored in a quick paycheck as the owner of a bookstore that specializes in the supernatural (and has a personal risk at stake).While cinematographer-turned-director John R. Leonetti takes the reins for the first time as helmsman from producer James Wan, the rote storyline by Gary Dauberman fails to keep a decent scare ratio nor a sizable body count as anticipated. Better off watching CHILD's PLAY or a true creep fest like ""The Dummy"" from THE TWILIGHT ZONE. One genuine jolt does not make a sufficient thriller by any means.",Annabelle
16,view_and_review,Anna-bleh,5,4 March 2017,"I have given much of my valuable time to the horror genre and I have viewed so many disappointments. Add Annabelle to the list. Annabelle was facing two very stiff obstacles. 1.) It was following the very successful The Conjuring2.) Scary doll movies had already been done (see Child's Play and Dead Silence to name a couple). Not to mention other movies in which a creepy doll came into play (such as Poltergeist or countless other movies in which a doll turns its head or moves)Annabelle just didn't deliver. A husband buys his wife this doll as a gift to complete her set. After a tragic event the doll becomes a conduit for evil.

17,neil-476,Oh what a horrible doll,7,17 October 2014,"A young couple in 1969 Santa Monica come into possession of a rather unpleasant doll just as their next door neighbour's daughter and her boyfriend get involved in satanic slaughter a la Charles Manson, said slaughtering involving our young protagonists, the doll, and the young mum's pregnancy.This load of old tosh is a prequel to last year's The Conjuring, and purports to tell the story of the possessed doll Annabelle which resides in a cabinet belonging to the paranormal investigators of the first film (and which is actually a Raggedy Anne doll, not the horrible thing they have here).If you are a fan of this sort of film, you will either thoroughly enjoy it – it is atmospheric, has its share of made-you-jump moments, has adequate period detail, and features a tense and believable central performance from Annabelle Wallis as beleaguered young mum Mia – or you will be disappointed at the tramlines it runs along and the absence of any significant amounts of blood, dismemberings, satanic manifestations, and gore generally. While some of these are present, they are understated: this is more a movie concerned with impending dread.It passed the time adequately – in fact, possible slightly more than adequately.",Annabelle
18,anaconda-40658,Anna-Botch.,3,30 November 2015,"Annabelle (2014): Dir: John R. Leonetti / Cast: Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, Alfre Woodard, Tony Amendola, Eric Ladin: Wretched prequel to The Conjuring where we get to see where this possessed doll Annabelle originated and the couple that it was scaring the living crap out of. Set in 1967, although it never feels it. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton play a young couple. She is pregnant and he is a doctor. The doll Annabelle is given to her as a gift and immediately a couple next door is murdered and a couple occult freaks enter and attack them. Police gun them down but the female, Annabelle, manages to transport her soul into this doll. The couple are freaked out and decide to move but despite Annabelle going in the trash, she manages to tag along. Directed by cinematographer John R. Leonetti who also helmed the equally stupid Mortal Kombat 2: Annihilation. The structure is one lame jump scare after another from a static TV to a sewing machine that operates on will. Their newborn baby is the target and Wallis spends much of the film trying to convince people that she is not nuts. Horton is the absent husband who shows up when convenient. Alfre Woodard plays a wacko working at a bookstore who befriends Wallis. Tony Amendola plays the standard priest who attempts to transport the doll to his church and ends up getting his ass handed to him. Eric Ladin plays a detective who fills everyone in on the wack job cultists who attacked them in the film's opening. While the special effects are creepy and effective, The Conjuring was far more entertaining. Viewers will likely conjure up a fitting burial for this prequel. Score: 3 / 10",Annabelle
19,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Decidedly average if still enjoyable,8,18 November 2015,"After their home is invaded by deadly cultists, an expectant couple finds that a strange doll involved in the events has taken on a far more sinister life than they imagined and try to stop the deadly events from continuing.While there's a lot to like here, overall this one was decidedly disappointing. What really does tend to work here is the early scenes at the house where the growing build-up of the events here makes for quite a rather dark storyline here. The concept of targeting a pregnant mother in her home and enacting a blood-rite on her still-unborn baby that bonds her soul with a ravenous demon is unbelievably chilling and creepy, which makes it so much of a disappointment that it never really capitalizes on this idea by instead resorting to the second half with a series of ghostly flash images and quick-cut attacks that are so set-up and predictable that nearly every gag here, from the quick glimpse of the hands on the stairwell and the arm-grab in the darkened laundry room lowers this one slightly. However, the first half doesn't worry about this with the rather enjoyable set-up here as it goes through the early scenes of her pregnancy and the effect that has on the build-up by offering the chilling home invasion with the really enjoyable set-up here that makes for quite a fun scene ending in the brutal bloodbath that finally ends this. The eventual supernatural hauntings that occur aren't that bad following the incident while the scenes in the apartment after the move are even better here with the hallway ambush, the flash images of the ghost always walking around the apartment in the shadows and the big set-up here with the drawings done by the child eventually coming to fruition makes for a truly fun time here that makes for a great ploy to unleash the chilling action in the later half when the attempts to stop the progression of possession makes for some dark, chilling action within this, with the church attack and the eventual battle in the apartment to save their baby really ratchets up the tension and suspense here along with the fun action throughout the final half. That, though, again brings up the main fundamental flaw here with the film as not only does this make the film filled with routine and predictable scenes but the film does such a great job at showcasing something is wrong that their reasoning for not doing something earlier is seriously questioned. Staying in the house as long as they did after the initial attack is questionable considering what happened and all that follows, while the popcorn gag itself is so questionable that alone is quite unrealistic. Still, once in the apartment this one features so many fine attack scenes on both her and the baby that waiting so long to question what's going on that it's entirely unbelievable that takes as much time as it does to bring someone else in on the action. It's pretty big, and does hold this down somewhat though there's still a lot to like here.Rated R: Graphic Violence and continuous scenes of implied and actual threats to infants and children.",Annabelle

21,FlashCallahan,The 'Con'-juring.......,2,2 December 2014,"Yes, that's right, this movie is just one big com to get all the teens who wouldn't know a decent horror film if the power of Christ compelled them, and until we turn our backs on these sort of atrocities, decent horror movie like The Babadook, will be overlooked in favour of cattle prod scares..So the story goes like this. Bloke buys pregnant woman the Annabelle doll (with no special features), and they go to bed. Next door, some people who love Charles Manson kill their neighbours, and then they come for them. When the satanists are killed, a little tiny bit of blood goes into Annabelle's eye, and like 28 Days Later, permanently turns her....The first ten minutes of this are admittedly very creepy indeed, but as soon as the baby is born, this film just goes for the cheap jump scares that have graced our cinema screens since Paranormal Activity was introduced to us back 2009, and let me tell you, they are getting poorer and poorer as the years go by.But they always look good I the trailer, but that's because they show all the best stuff in the trailers, to entice people to spend money on this tosh.But the worst thing about it is, is that the writers just don't know how to end a movie. the Conjuring had something going for it, but just went over the top at the end. Same as Insidious 1, and 2. All great scenarios, but poor execution of a third act.But these will continue to be made, because people go tossed them, but mark my words,these won't be as fondly remembered like the slasher movies of the eighties, or the horror resurgence of the nineties following Scream.Poor.",Annabelle
22,Wuchakk,Ghost story or demon saga?,7,24 July 2017,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by John R. Leonetti, ""Annabelle"" stars Annabelle Wallis & Ward Horton as a young couple in Southern Cal suburbia in the aftermath of the Manson murders (1969-1970). The focus is on the former who's pregnant and gives birth in the first half. Meanwhile their house and, later, apartment is cursed and it's somehow linked to their creepy-looking vintage doll and a couple of Manson-ish occultists who invade their home in the first act. Tony Amendola plays their priest while Alfre Woodard is on hand as a concerned book store owner. This movie surprised me. I thought it was going to be a silly killer doll flick, like the Child's Play franchise, but that's not the case. While there are elements of a ghost story, this is more a demon tale; and the details to this effect are commendable. The movie's austere with a couple of genuinely scary episodes, particularly the basement/stairwell sequence. The CGI 'monster' is effectively realized and wisely not overdone.""Annabelle"" shows how the Manson murders were the death knell of the 'peace & love' counter-culture movement. Hippies would never be viewed the same after the horrific Tate murders of August 8, 1969. The drug-addled Woodstock took place just days later and it was indeed 'three days of peace & music,' but The Altamont Speedway Free Festival in early December (less than four months later) put the kibosh on the hippies' idealism forever. It's a shame too, as they had a hold of something real underneath their drug-obsessed fog (not that all hippies were druggies, but it was certainly the norm). If I may put forth a slice of personal philosophy, this movie illustrates how demons are viewed as the epitome of what is scary in modern culture. Yet the bible shows them SHRIEKING IN HORROR at the mere sight of the Mighty Christ. More than that, they BEG HIM not to torture them and throw their filthy backsides into the Abyss!

Regrettably, all the build up for the movie just fizzles out! What worked: The first half of the movie was intriguing. Set in a safe white suburbia 1960's California where a couple is hit with a radical 60's cult incident. Shock hits the suburbia environment and the couple's home. An interesting slow burn begins with noises at night etc as the terror begins. There was great build up! Regrettably, the makers of Annabelle did not know how to seal the deal. A mysterious new friend arrives, and a worried priest add new character development. The new friend becomes a one dimensional character, and the priest's role fades out. A scary build up, but the ending and near ending parts of the movie fizzles. The director and script writer did not know how to tie up the ending. You're kidding! that was my opinion with the ending. Someone always has to die in the end in a sappy cliché ending way. Six out of ten scares.",Annabelle

But besides that there is nothing worth seeing in this movie. Everything has been done before in other horror genre many times. Except it has been done better. There is no real tension or suspense in this one and everything just seemed forced most of the time. And when I mean forced, I mean it seems like the director and writers was just making stuff up as they go. It might have worked for a few minutes in ""The Conjuring"" but for a full 1 hour and 30 minute spin-off, it really really really drags. The only thing topnotch about this movie is how predictable it is. Overall, this is a waste of time, especially if you are a horror fan.2.3/10",Annabelle
26,Hellmant,When comparing it to the original movie it definitely falls a little short.,6,8 October 2014,"'ANNABELLE': Three Stars (Out of Five)Prequel to the 2013 hit supernatural horror flick 'THE CONJURING'. It's said to be based on another true haunting, investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren (the paranormal investigating team that the first film revolved around). This tale deals with the back-story of the doll named Annabelle (which was heavily featured in the original movie). The film stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, Tony Amendola and Alfre Woodard. It was directed by John R. Leonetti, written by Gary Dauberman and coproduced by James Wan (the director of the original movie). While it is frightening and creepy enough, at times, it's still not nearly as impressive as the original. The movie begins, in 1968, with two young women, and a young man, explaining to Ed and Lorraine Warren how they think their doll 'Anabelle' is haunted (it's the same opening scene as 'THE CONJURING'). The story then flashes back to a year earlier, 1967, when a young couple, named John (Horton) and Mia Gordon (Wallis), are newlyweds and expecting their first child. John gives Mia a vintage doll as a present; that she adds to her collection, in the baby's room. Some time later the couple is attacked in their home, by satanic cult members. They're rescued by the police, but then strange supernatural occurrences begin happening; all involving the doll 'Anabelle' (which was the name of one of the cult members). The movie is really slow paced but that's often to be expected, with this type of film. It does have that classic 60s and 70s thriller style to it and the frights, and creepy imagery, are done really well. I don't think the two leads are nearly as charismatic, or likable, as Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (Ed and Lorraine Warren) in the first movie. The story also isn't as compelling or genuinely frightening. Just as a stand-alone horror film it's pretty decent but when comparing it to the original movie it definitely falls a little short.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI",Annabelle
27,FeastMode,enjoyable horror flick,6,20 July 2019,"Enjoyable horror flick that was pretty creepy and suspenseful with some good jump scares and jaw-dropping moments. also completely breaks the cliche of the annoying skeptical husband/boyfriend, that made me happy (2 viewings, 6/20/2020)",Annabelle
28,Robert_duder,A decent little scare-fest that is mostly an addendum to The Conjuring,7,20 October 2014,"It seemed inevitable with the success of The Conjuring that a sequel would be in the works. It also seemed inevitable after they focused on the incredibly creepy doll in the showcase that they would explore that more. Did it need to be? Probably not. But they saw dollar signs and potential and now we have Annabelle. The film isn't a total loss but its also far different than The Conjuring. James Wan is currently a horror film leader and he goes straight from getting under your skin. He doesn't need terrifying gore or jump tactics to tell a genuinely creepy story. Annabelle goes in a different direction. It does try to set that tone of being disturbing and creepy but also features some really nasty gory scenes that made me cringe and for the most part it works for this film. I certainly recommend caution from any soon-to-be parents as the film mixes elements of The Exorcist and The Omen with a lot of horrible things happening to a very pregnant mother and then a new mother after the child is born. The Conjuring for me wasn't amazing but it was very good and it established some good groundwork. Annabelle builds on the world but at the same time does nothing to truly impress. The doll's background is lacklustre, the kills are done mostly in the shadows and you never really see ""Annabelle"" in action. This isn't a Chucky movie that's for sure and if the two ever went up against each other...Chucky would destroy her.The cast (much like The Conjuring) is quite good and definitely makes an okay script just a little better. Annabelle Wallis (who I thought the entire time I was watching the film was Dianne Agron) was very good as the expectant mother. She was a solid scream queen and definitely brought a realism and intensity to her role. Ward Horton who plays her beloved husband is also decent. He is sort of hit and miss in the role because sometimes he is playing it almost campy and then in the next moment he is much better. So he isn't as strong as Wallis but they are good together and he plays the role well. Tony Amendola is very good as their local Priest who plays a bigger part in the story towards the end. His character is painfully predictable and stereotypical but necessary for this type of film and he does well at it. Alfre Woodard is decent as a concerned neighbour who befriends our heroine. Her character is left a little underdeveloped and her presence is not entirely understood and feels a little forced but she is still good in the role.Annabelle's entire problem is that while it scares and makes your cringe, it could have been fantastic. Instead, its just okay. Its all things we've seen before so that makes it just a little bit stale. But on top of that it isn't a very well polished script. It feels like they had a lot of ideas and they crammed too many of them in at once. Fortunately for them those ideas work pretty well. The setting of the Apartment complex fits perfectly and there are certain camera angles and scenes that are shot very well and definitely make your skin crawl. The scene of Mia (our heroine) in the basement with the demon was particularly well done. Once again I wonder why they put a high profile film in the hands of someone who doesn't have a lot of directorial experience. John Leonetti's experience behind the camera is mostly with low budget straight to video and yet here he is taking this on. Still he shows some definitive style though I think its mostly lifted from previous James Wan films. Annabelle is good and fun but they really drop the ball on creating a worthy horror icon. Despite a few good scenes it ends up being average and mostly forgettable. I have high hopes for The Conjuring 2. 7/10",Annabelle

It's a ham-fisted and canon crunching off-shoot made for the sole purpose to milk money from a financially successful franchise. The plodding plot might as well be on a treadmill, the characters are as dull as safety scissors, the story makes little to no sense and the scares are so aggressively puerile that you'll struggle to even pay attention to most of them, especially considering that the feature itself is one of the most painfully boring I have seen in a long while.

This one is very psychological and doesn't have to rely on over the top jump scares or gore to get to you. This is also not cartoonish like the Child's Play movies.

The prequel to The Conjuring, Annabelle is based on the real-life devil doll exercised by famed ghost hunters The Warrens.

I've seen my share of scary movies and I have to agree this was pretty darn scary.Mother hen and goose, the jump scares are effective! 'Annabelle' is creepy as hell. Remember Annabelle - the crippled girl from 'Annabelle: Creation'? Well, she's back as Annabelle Higgins - named after the family who adopted her at the end of the aforementioned film. She's in the movie for just a little while - as a crazed woman who is a member of a cult - but plays a big part in the movie.'Annabelle' never really gets completely out of control like some films of this genre. The haunting is for most part very subtle, but there are some seriously scary and disturbing demonic images that will give you gooseflesh. Do not let young children watch this! Adhere to the age restriction, because this is guaranteed to give them nightmares. Even some adults might not be able to watch this creepy tale of possession.The acting was very good; especially Annabelle Wallis as Mia (Yup, the lead actress is actually called Annabelle!!). I believed her desperation, fear and concern every step of the way. The doll itself didn't really play a big part in this movie. There were moments when I felt they included scenes of the doll simply because the film is named after the doll, but in fact there really was no need for the doll at all. The demonic presence would have sufficed, and was a lot scarier since the doll was actually passive. Nevertheless, 'Annabelle' is a great addition to the 'Conjuring' universe.",Annabelle

I liked the interpretation of Annabelle Wallis who played as Mia and she was very good in this role. To sum up I have to say that ""Annabelle"" is an interesting movie for anyone to watch.

38,eddie_baggins,Only scary thing here is how bad this movie is,2,18 February 2015,"Living off the back of James Wan's effective and well-constructed horror creeper The Conjuring which took the box office by storm in 2013, John R. Leonetti's film centred around one of that films creepiest plot points of haunted doll Annabelle is an atrocious horror effort that looks to tick of every cliché in the horror book while portraying a wholly uninteresting story.By now it is somewhat expected that most horror films play out to some sort of seen before plan but Annabelle does so little to distinguish itself from any other such title that after half an hour or so you're wondering if anything or anyone will do something to save this film from the doldrums. In saying this one of the most shockingly scary elements to the film is just how effective its first 15 or so minutes are and for a while you'd be right in expecting the unexpected and enjoying Annabelle's success. From this effective and terror laden opening act however things slide rapidly downhill into a shoddily edited and staged story that forgets to provide either the chills, thrills or scares to even stand in the same room as its fine parent film.Calling this film Annabelle seems like a marketing ploy in false advertisement as after this promising beginning, Annabelle takes a back seat to haunted prams, evil bookshelves, Alfre Woodard looking for a pay check, possessed popcorn, societies of the Ram and various other insidious strands that all fail to scare or resonate. The filmmakers here clearly didn't know how to make a 90 minute movie about a haunted doll and their subsequent ideas can't really stand on their own from Annabelle Wallis's troubled housewife and enthusiastic seamstress Mia and her doting husband John played by the frighteningly bland Ward Horton through to any of the side characters this is a film that needed some more interesting distractions if Annabelle herself was going to be such a half-baked and underutilised device.If you're looking for some scares why not just watch the Conjuring again as I'm positive even a re-watch of James Wan horror would provide more intrigue and chills than Annabelle could even dream of. A shoddy excuse of a cash in, let's hope the second Conjuring journey is a whole league better than this nasty piece of trash, but then again what really did we expect from the director that bought us Mortal Combat: Annihilation? 1 evil bag of popcorn out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Annabelle
39,filipemanuelneto,Very weak.,2,8 August 2020,"Horror films are usually a box of surprises because it is not easy to know if they are going to be excellent or a total crap. I didn't have many expectations for ""Conjuring"" and I was pleasantly surprised. In this case, and knowing that this film came more or less following that one, I expected something with some quality, at least... but that's not what I found.This film is a horror story created around a vintage doll that is supposedly inhabited by a demon. The film even starts well and promises a lot, but gets lost along the way. I don't know what was worse... the script was weak, with a boring and illogical story, the scares are predictable (we foreseen it ten seconds in advance, no exaggeration). But perhaps the worst of all is the absence of any tension or suspense, that sense of danger or threat that makes even the stupidest horror movie basically work. The film never manages to build that and I just watched it with the emotion and interest of those who go to the grocery store to buy some fruits.The cast is weak. Ward Horton and Annabelle Wallis are the only actors with material to show some talent. Despite that, I cannot say that I saw a dramatic show. The material given to the actors is bad and none of the character has been well developed or stands out. The film was directed by John R. Leonetti, who is good at cinematography and should stick to it (the few films he has directed, including this one, do not inspire me to try again or recommend it as director). He was responsible for the cinematography of ""Conjuring"" and, as a result, these two films have a very similar look, which indicates that he left his stamp on the visual style and camera work here.Indeed, cinematography is very good, perhaps one of the strengths here. With an excellent balance of light and shadow, it knows how to give this film an elegant and, sometimes, sinister visual beauty that, unfortunately, the script does not follow and ends up without any practical use. The sets and costumes, very much like the 60s, also look great on the screen. The soundtrack is good, but not surprising.",Annabelle
40,TheMovieDiorama,Annabelle dresses up its chills in frivolous uninspired jump scares.,4,23 April 2019,"A welcomed spin-off to 'The Conjuring', considering its sub-plot involving the titular wretched doll certainly terrified many, if only it was handed to a more experienced director. Leonetti, who helmed such masterpieces like 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' and 'The Butterfly Effect 2', falls trap to the many pitfalls that plague low-budget horrors. Gone are the stylish suspense driven camera techniques that Wan confidently possessed, now replaced by lacklustre direction with two featureless leads and a second-rate script. No wonder Annabelle looks worse for wear, bless her! A husband grants his wife a collectible doll, which is soon possessed by a demonic presence summoned by devil worshippers who raid their home and attempt to attack them.A few terrifying scares that prove to be somewhat effective, notably the storage floor sequence and the introductory home invasion scene, which illicit one or two satisfactory jump scares. A demon's face barging its way to the front of the camera did nearly force me to change my underwear. Yet despite the promising horror aspects, no matter how infrequent they were, the story with its repetitious slow pacing and mundane dialogue was enough to make anyone fall asleep cuddling the titular doll tightly dreaming the words ""please just end it, end it now"". Wallis was insufferably boring with her constant whining and screaming, succumbing to the outdated ""distressed damsel"" trope, that I can only assume she was hired just for her forename. Horton was just as bad, portraying the most useless husband possible. But it's fine, because he just kept smiling.The plot itself lacked any mystery or suspense, mostly due to the way it was structured. It revealed all the details within the first act! Only to then conclude with an impeccably dumb soul trade thing that really made no sense, but by then I didn't care. The quality rapidly degraded as the runtime continued on, almost resembling a cheap dollhouse for Annabelle to reside in. To date, it is the worst ""Conjuring Universe"" film.",Annabelle

Unfortunately being a prequel was about the only connection this film would have, with an entirely new writing and directing team coming on board. The masterful director of 'The Conjuring' James Wan's (also of the 'Saw' series) presence was sorely lacking in this mediocre horror film that gets little reaction out of its audience.The main problem for me was a complete lack of menace from the doll. The movie is named after her, so surely she has to do something other than just sit there and look menacing for 90 minutes? Apparently not. The opening murder scene was actually quite well done and one of the few good moments the movie has. But after that things slow down and never really speed up again.

46,dfranzen70,Dull Devil Doll,5,12 October 2014,"A large vintage doll, possessed by a demon bent on reaping a fresh new soul, brings death and disorder to a young married couple in the early 1970s. The scares and jolts seen in its predecessor, The Conjuring, aren't nearly as prevalent this time around, to the point where one begins to relax or even doze off.Annabelle is about the events leading up to the events that lead up to those in The Conjuring. Mia and John Gordon (Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton) are about to be parents. John is harried by his stressful life as a med student, and to make up for aloof attitude he locates and purchases an old, large doll for his wife, who's been searching for the doll for years. But this fairly tale story is quickly shattered when, in the middle of the night, the Gordons are attacked by a crazed duo who injure the pregnant Mia before themselves dying by bullet or knife. One of the attackers is the estranged daughter of the Gordons' neighbors, the Higgins, who have also been slaughtered. The Gordons move to a new place, as would we all.Confined to bed rest for the final month of her pregnancy, Mia experiences some strange happenings. She hears whispers. She sees things. She nearly dies in a kitchen fire. It's the doll, I tell you - it's always something material. How else would a demon house itself while waiting for a soul to take? It's just logic. In any event, John and Mia enlist the help of their local priest, Father Perez (Tony Amendola), who is himself badly injured when he attempts to take the doll into his church for safekeeping. Yes, it's clear to all that demons are at work here.While watching this, I waited and wondered for the good stuff to come, the genuine scares. The first hour or so contains little of what might be considered a scare. It's not that the frights are inexpertly presented, it's that there aren't any to speak of. A lot of exposition appears instead. I began to hope that this would all be a setup for a cathartic finale.Mia becomes friends with a local bookstore owner, Evelyn (Alfre Woodward), who also lives in the Gordons' apartment complex. Coincidentally, Evelyn had lost a child following an auto accident for which Evelyn feels plenty of guilt. This becomes important during the finale, which is over almost before you know it's begun.There's some nifty sleight of hand in Annabelle, but since everyone in the movie (as well as the audience) agrees wholeheartedly that the demon does exist and that Mia isn't imagining things, there's no real suspense to be found. Even husband John goes along with things eventually. Such an understanding husband. Because everyone knows in their heart that these weird things are actually happening, there's no ambiguity about whether Mia is losing her mind. She's not.Short on horror and long on talk, Annabelle is a medium-low heat setting on a gas grill. Your food will get cooked eventually, but you may fall asleep waiting for it to come to its inevitable conclusion.",Annabelle

This movie gives you more background story on the mysterious doll, Annabelle, that, if you remember, was kept in a glass case and people were told to not open the case or disturb the doll, in any way, because it was dangerous. Now you can find out why. Annabelle-the actress-and Ward are a married couple that are expecting a baby in 1969. Ward gives her a doll-Annabelle-to fit into her doll collection; and at this point, it is just a plain, non-possessed doll, although it does look a little creepy. Then, their next door neighbors have a problem with a couple of Satanic cultist, who go on a murderous rampage and end up at Ward & Annabelle's house. During the excitement, the doll is infected by one of the cultist and things are set into motion. Alfre plays a book store owner that befriends Annabelle-the actress-and, of course, has books on just the right subjects. Tony plays the local priest; there has to be a priest in this type of movie that has knowledge about how to get rid of demons and evil spirits. It does have a few descent scares but it's not quite as good as the Conjuring was. Although she moves from one place to another place, Annabelle-the doll-is not actually shown moving around on her own-like a Chucky doll. I guess they did not have the budget to animate her. It's rated ""R"" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",Annabelle

Alfre WoodardAnnabelle Wallis and her acting in the film Malignant 2021 lead me to seek out this film . I heard it was no good .But after seeing Miss Wallis tremendous performance in the latest James Wan flick , I figured how bad could the film Annabelle be with her beauty and talent...... well she delivers here too !Wallis reminds me of the incomparable Audrey Hepburn.Coincidentally, Annabelle is the first name of the actress who plays title role of Mia.I must say, the early home invasion/cult murders sequences were quite harrowing. I like a period piece and the director nailed the 60's time with the props, cars , sets and costumes were rather well done bring you into the time period .The images of Charlie Manson and his f - up Helter Skelter playing on the Television in the back ground , set the ominous tone of this flicks opening act . For me ,what makes these types of films more compelling is the claim Annabelle and Conjuring films are based on accounts that paranormal researchers claim to be true. I think this movie got a bad rap . I think it is because it came out after the freaky Conjuring . Expectations were set at a very high bar. I classify it as a guilty pleasure type of horror film . And I rather enjoyed the ride. Maybe I am perseverating just a bit ,but Annabelle Wallis is just fascinating and pleasing to watch on screen .The doll wasn't as central to the story as one would expect, rather it was more of a symbol of evil in the film. The occult mixed with biblical entities of evil , namely the word ""Belial"" that can be seen in a book on the occult . Belial is a term occurring in the Hebrew Bible which later became personified as the devil in Jewish and Christian texts. This type of horror is guaranteed to get under my skin every time . 6.8/10TriviaThe movie portrays the Annabelle doll as a porcelain doll, but the real Annabelle doll is a large ""Raggedy Ann"" doll. The Warrens had a special case built for Annabelle inside their Occult Museum, where she resides to this day.The baby mobile hanging over the crib plays the same tune as the music box from The Conjuring (2013).The real Annabelle doll was given to Donna (a college student at the time) by her mother in 1970. She and her roommate Angie noticed that the doll would move subtlety, then within a few weeks became fully mobile moving from one room to another while they were gone.Ellen DeGeneres lived in the apartment used in the movie. While promoting Annabelle (2014) in her show, she explained that: ""The apartment in the movie was my first apartment that I moved to in L. A. That was the building I lived in, where they shot the movie. I was watching it going: 'That looks familiar', and it was my building. It was scary back then too.""The characters names 'Mia' and 'John' refer to the lead actors in Rosemary's Baby (1968): Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes. This movie is also about a young well to do couple in a luxury apartment having a baby in combination with satanists going for mother and child. The frequent noise of the neighbors in a adjacent apartment is a nod to the same movie.🎃 October 31 days of Halloween viewing 2021 🎃1. The Forever Purge F. T. V. Movie Theater 8/102.

51,estebangonzalez10,Who knew that eerie doll from The Conjuring could be so dull?,3,27 October 2014,"""There are things happening that I can't explain.""The Conjuring was one of my favorite horror films of the past decade and it even managed to make it into my list of the best films of 2013, which is a huge achievement considering I'm not a fan of the genre. Despite how much I enjoyed The Conjuring, I still had very little expectations for its prequel, Annabelle, because from the get go it seemed like the producers were simply trying to bank on the success of the first film. That is perhaps the reason why they rushed this film to theaters only an year after The Conjuring. The budget is surprisingly smaller and James Wan's direction is missed here. I want to begin my criticism with the technical aspects of the film because The Conjuring was one of the better looking horror films I had seen, but from the opening scene in Annabelle the contrast is huge. The lighting and the eerie setting that was so effectively used in the original is lacking in this prequel. It's strange considering that director John Leonetti was the cinematographer in The Conjuring, but here he fails to give the film a similar look. Instead of those amazing shots Wan delivered, we get several close ups of the doll's face which never actually does anything. This film looks as ugly as the vintage Annabelle doll does and it lacked the eerie atmosphere that worked so well in The Conjuring.If at least the story or characters would have been half as interesting as The Conjuring I would give Annabelle a chance, but nothing about it really worked for me. The story is predictable, the characters are uninteresting and boring, and there are very few scary moments. Leone should stick to his work as a cinematographer which is an area where he has proved to be talented, but as a director this is his third flop. If it weren't for The Conjuring's success this film would have been sent directly to DVD because even the performances were wooden. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton fail to deliver compelling and interesting characters we would care for. That lack of sympathy for them hurts the film's chances to scare us. The Conjuring had set up such an interesting premise that there were a lot of interesting things that could've been done with this prequel. Unfortunately here we discover that the doll that was the scariest thing in the paranormal investigator's closet (enclosed in a glass shelf) actually isn't all that eerie as it seemed thanks to Gary Dauberman's uninspiring script.Despite how much Annabelle disappointed me, I still have to admit there were two or three shocking moments that sort of worked for me. The film does become predictable and familiar at times relying on the sounds of rocking chairs and appliances going off on their own at night. After so many close-ups of the dolls face, it lost its eeriness. The three moments I will rescue from this film involve the opening scene where we see the neighbors get attacked by a cult from the window, then the scene we see from the trailer where the small girl runs towards the door turning into the adult Annabelle, and finally the elevator scene which was perhaps the scariest moment of the film. Other than those three moments I wasn't really shocked by Annabelle. The characters and the story were so boring that at times I felt like snoozing for a few minutes. It was a huge disappointment.",Annabelle
52,pixrox1,Why didn't they just mail that darn doll . . .,6,26 November 2014,". . . using the United States Postal Service?! ANNABELLE is about a family that just cannot seem able to rid themselves of a spooky plaything that nobody in their right mind would consider owning in the first place. But say you got really smashed and the next thing you knew you had woken up next to this demonic monstrosity? What to do. The LAST notion popping into a normal person's mind would be to simply chuck it into an ordinary garbage can, as the subhuman characters in ANNABELLE do. Anyone who has ever seen a horror flick of ANY kind (roughly 97% of the adult American population) would know that at the very LEAST, you needed to pick up a doll as evil looking as ANNABELLE with one of those scrapyard cranes, and drop it into a vat of molten metal (as in TERMINATOR 16, or FRANKENSTEIN 3). However, even THAT might fall short with ANNABELLE. What is a sure-fire way to destroy something? Hmmmmm. Then it hit me, when I emptied my post office box today. Some government bozo had crammed my high-end journal into it in such a fashion that the cover was pretty much ripped in half. Given the countless pieces of critical communications that have been disappeared without a trace by this same organization, I suppose I should be thanking my lucky stars that any scrap of my journal actually reached me at all. The bottom line is, had the ANNABELLE-plagued family--at the first hint of trouble--simply put her in a self-addressed box and mailed her via the U.S.P.S., everyone would still be alive today (except ANNABELLE, of course)!",Annabelle

However, John unwittingly purchases a doll that has had a satanic curse put on it by a satanic cult and both the satanic cult and the doll reek havoc on the couple and their new born child.After watching this film I was surprised to discover that there was quite a big difference between the rating of this film and the Conjuring (at the time of writing this review Annabelle has a user rating of 5.4 and The Conjuring has a user rating of 7.5). Whilst, I'm prepared to accept that The Conjuring is perhaps slightly better overall I really don't feel that Annabelle is much weaker in comparison.The directional style of this film is excellent and very much reminded me of Wan's style in The Conjuring (I didn't realise it wasn't Wan till I saw the end credits). Some may argue that Leonetti is aping Wan here, but I personally don't care as long as the film moves along a reasonable pace, and in the case of a horror film provides me with some good atmosphere and a generally creepy feel about it. Leonetti achieves this objective by providing long suspenseful sequences - although a lot of what you see here isn't original very little of it feels cheap or gimmicky (the only parts that did were the demons randomly appearing out of nowhere).The main failings with this film lie with the characters and the story; the couple in particular are rather bland and lack any sort of chemistry (this aspect is less important in horror films, but it's still better that it's there than not being there). Whilst Wallis showed on occasions that she could be good, Horton was just dull and wooden. The story isn't quite as strong as it is in The Conjuring and sometimes the creepiness of the doll and the frantic set-pieces are needed to make up for its shortcomings.Despite seeing it all before, this film did enough to work for me and the tight running time of 85 minutes means that it never outstays its welcome and never really became boring. It's far from perfect, but I think that a lot of people are being unnecessarily harsh on this prequel.",Annabelle

57,kluseba,Professionally executed above average horror movie but not a genre-defining modern highlight,8,13 October 2014,"""Annabelle"" certainly doesn't reinvent the horror genre but it's still an atmospheric, diversified and gripping movie that quickly grabs your attention and will haunt you until the very end. This movie has a better pace and no dull moments compared to ""The Conjuring"" but it's not as intense and scary as ""Insidious"" for example.I like the fact that the movie includes a little bit more than the usual supernatural elements. When the satanic cult members assassinate an old couple and attack the two main actors, the movie quickly starts to be really gripping. When a fire breaks out and menaces the pregnant main actress, most viewers were also on the edges of their seats. The haunting scene leading to and involving a stroller smashed by a truck is also very intense. It's a good thing that the entire movie doesn't only play at one location and only involves supernatural phenomenons.""Annabelle"" convinces with its steadily growing sinister atmosphere, a credible acting performance, a solid camera work without any unnecessary shaking, fitting sound effects and an atmospheric soundtrack. This movie includes almost no blood and gore effects and no obvious special effects. These elements make the scenario feel closer to some classic pioneer movies of the seventies. The realistic tone of the film also makes the movie more intense and easier to get into for most people.Even though the movie avoided a few stereotypes such as an exorcism, some parts were still highly predictable: the scared housewife nobody believes in, the wicked demon trying to take possession of a child's innocent soul and the heroic actions of an old pastor attempting to save a young family and community members are elements that horror movie fans have seen numerous times before. That's why the movie lacked some originality and ultimately tension towards the end as the ending was also quite predictable.Fans of traditional horror movies or more recent outputs by James Wan and his colleagues should watch this movie at the cinema as they are likely to enjoy this film. This movie isn't the best of the year but still a professionally executed and highly above average horror flick. I still hope that the next movies made by the makers of the last few horror blockbusters are going to write a more courageous script for their next project.",Annabelle
58,davispittman,Entertaining horror film,8,13 April 2017,"Annabelle is a spin off movie from the conjuring. Not really a sequel, it has no relation to the conjuring other than the Annabelle doll itself. Ed and Lorraine Warren are referenced but they aren't actually in the movie. It focuses on a couple that is getting ready to have a baby and they are living next door to an older married couple that has an adult daughter that's run away and joined a cult. At some point the daughter of the couple returns home and her and the other members of her cult do some very bad things.... and that leads to a demon possessed doll named Annabelle. The couple starts to experience mysterious goings on once they're baby is born and they've moved to a new home. With the help of a priest and a friend (Alfre Woodard) they try everything to keep their family safe and get rid of the evil. I really liked the actors and thought they did well with their roles. I liked Woodard's performance a lot, she was a very sentimental character, a newfound friend of Mia that helps them fight the demon. Annabelle Wallis (what a coincidence lol) was very good as Mia, the new mother who is the first to notice these satanic occurrences. I also thought that ward horton was convincing and a good pick to play the loving father/husband of the endangered family. The movie has some genuinely frightening moments. One of those moments being when Mia sees the demon in human form, that scene was scarier to me than anything in the conjuring or in the rest of Annabelle. I was scared more overall by this film than the conjuring. If you like a good horror movie, I suggest Annabelle. The ending is good too, meaningful in a way. 8/10.",Annabelle
59,3xHCCH,Had Genuine Scares That Worked!,8,2 October 2014,"We have met the creepy vintage doll Annabelle before in last year's excellent and very memorable horror film ""The Conjuring."" She was just the front act there, showing up only at the pre-opening credits sequence. This year, we get to know Annabelle more and how she came to be demonically possessed.The setting of this film is in the 1960s in a California suburb. Young couple John and Mia are expecting their first child. One day, John surprises Mia, who was a vintage doll collector, with a huge antique doll with painted ivory face wearing white satin dress adorned by a red bow. It just so happened that same night, crazy satanic cultists attack their home and there was resulting bloodshed. However, since that night, there was no more peace in John and Mia's household, especially after she gives birth to their daughter, Leah.I liked the throwback look of this film, with its faded color palette and meticulous production design. The architecture, interior design, fashion, hairstyles, television shows, pop music all captured the era so well. Even the look of cutie baby Leah was vintage, like the Gerber baby. These things also contributed to the scariness factor because of the limitation of technology that the characters have on hand. A big part of the success of ""Annabelle"" as a horror film is the effective lead performance of coincidentally-named Annabelle Wallis as Mia. The character's name Mia, I am guessing, is a tribute to Mia Farrow, who was the star of a horror classic of the 1960s, ""Rosemary's Baby."" The stroller Mia uses for Leah sure looked like Rosemary's stroller which is seen in posters of that old film. Ms. Wallis has an elegant beauty and her acting was sympathetic without becoming cheesy.Ward Horton plays Mia's husband John, who is a medical student, which makes a convenient excuse for him to be a skeptic and always on call during the night, leaving Mia in the house watching television or working on her sewing machine. Veteran actress Alfre Woodard is the only familiar face in the cast, and she plays their helpful neighbor Evelyn. Her character though had a story arc which probably the only negative thing I could say about this film.John R. Leonetti, the cinematographer of ""Insidious 1 & 2"" and ""The Conjuring"" makes an auspicious directorial debut with ""Annabelle."" He learned very well from his his previous director James Wan, who sits as producer of this film. You can see he has the eye for the perfect views for the most effective suspense and surprise. I liked the cinematography that employs camera angles that give you the point of view of the tormented victim so that you too do not know what will happen next. The suspense could be so intense so many times, with the excellent editing and splicing of scenes together accompanied by a swelling crescendo of music. The timing for the big jump scare was effectively surprising most of the time, even you were sort of predicting it to happen already.This is a film which may divide audiences as to whether it could match the successes of ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring."" As it is, I liked ""Annabelle"" more than I thought I would. I was expecting the worst, since I hated how the Annabelle doll looked and I can't imagine anyone wanting one like it in their house. However, the film managed to transcend that limitation and actually create genuine scares that worked.",Annabelle
60,masonsaul,Boring and bad horror,3,8 July 2019,"Annabelle is a surprisingly dull and boring horror movie. It's does nothing new, relies entirely on jump scares which aren't scary and has weak performances from everyone except Tony Amendola, who is good.

61,robertemerald,"Strange behaviour, but definitely a better made horror movie",8,28 March 2020,"The edits and the film techniques are almost as frightening as what is actually happening. They also serve to move things along, which is important as, so far in movies, there is no such thing as an no-warning blitz entity attack, unless it's the opening scene before the movie title pops up. I recently saw a movie called Dead Silence, also about a dangerous doll. Here's the thing. You can't compare Annabelle with that movie, it's a different tack altogether. Annabelle is not that different from many recent urban myth teen movies, particularly the SlenderMan/ Bye Bye Man/Midnight Man, or movies like Hannah Grace, Grave Halloween, Truth or Dare, La Llorona or The Vatican Tapes. I offer up these examples so people can know that this movie has far more in common with these than with the classic Dead Silence. Thing is, Annabelle is not a teen movie. It belongs in the Conjuring universe, which is, as I understand it, connected by two (very real) paranormal investigators. They don't make an appearance here, but this is about adults. Annabelle is set in the 1970s, but as it needs to be about creepy things indoors you probably won't notice. It's as accomplished a production as one would expect from the reliable Warner Bros. The initial attack by cult members is easily the most classic horror sequence in the show, but there are plenty of other great images, but, unlike Dead Silence, usually not involving the actual doll. It lost points from me because of believability. Early on it was established the mother was a freeze rather than flight or fight kinda girl, but, for me, this wasn't enough to explain her later hesitations to rush to put out fires, so to speak, particularly when it involved her infant. In any case, perhaps the movie was trying to imply mothers of the 1970s didn't watch their toddlers every second. I doubt that, but even so, after several entity manifestations one rather thinks that watching toddlers every single second would definitely be the rule. It makes for a great fright night, sure, but, again, for me, the movie thus just falls short of being the greatest fright night ever.",Annabelle

She brings much of the same mellow composure and grace that make her as beautiful inside as out; the kind of pure soul that is perfect for the haunting. There are times however when her refinement is so great that she seems not very impressionable. It's not like the movie needs a scream queen, but she fails to summon much fear or motivation from it.Annabelle is only an hour and a half long, but it feels substantially longer. The first half of the movie, is often so light in tone that it feels like a 60's soap opera that just happens to have horror devices. Director John Leonetti lets the movie drag along without a clear sense of direction. IF nothing else, at least he has a good eye for framing. The photography, which has a wide lens feel, is a blessing to a movie that is full of cursing. The best shots in the movie are the static framings that squeeze two or three rooms into the picture. These moments work by daring the viewer to search for what is not there. Absence is always more intimidating than presence. For the most part, this is not a scary movie. There is too much chaos and the images hinging on boo moments are all gimmicks that we have seen before; the self moving doors, phonographs, ghosts in white sleepers, the black biblical demon. The all thats missing is the cat jumping out of the shadows. The catalyst for all this unnatural mumbo jumbo, The doll who looks like an ancestor of Chucky. Leonetti likes to linger on her face just long enough to make you suspect that her eyes are gonna spring out of her skull. those who don't get goosebumps will probably find these shots somewhat amusing. The film gives you enough down time to contemplate how anything with a face like that could ever end up on the market.",Annabelle
63,pachara87,Annabelle ranks as one of the most entertaining Hollywood horror outings of the year.,8,14 January 2019,"With Halloween almost upon us, this is traditionally a time when low-budget horror movies loom ever larger in the cinemas. One of the biggest hits of last year, in terms of return for budget, was The Conjuring and Annabelle acts as effectively a prequel to and spin-off from that movie.Again based on the case files of real-life 'supernatural detectives' Ed and Lorraine Warren, Annabelle is in essence an 'evil doll' movie which explains how said titular doll wound up in a sealed cabinet in the Warrens' museum where, the credits inform us, it's blessed twice a month by a priest just to be on the safe side. Right so.Anyway, we're back in 1969 and the Manson family are on the prowl, as are various Satanic cults, one of which, Disciples of the Ram, murders John and Mia Gordon's (Ward Horton and Annabelle Wallis) neighbours and attacks them.Just as the police arrive, one of the cult kills herself and her blood drains into the eye of the doll which, it has to be said, is one of the scariest yokes you'll ever see.Subsequently the heavily pregnant Mia begins to have visions that some presence or other is after her baby and seeks the help of a local priest (Tony Amendola) and a woman who runs an occult bookshopAnnabelle works reasonably well in the first half, building up a nice sense of impending dread.

I was quite interested in seeing this movie due to it being a prequel to The Conjuring (2013), but honestly, besides those meager and small mentioning and cameo appearances, there's really nothing to tie this prequel to the original movie. It's still a scary movie, especially if you're someone who enjoy being terrified by those jump-scares, but for me, this marks a decline in the series' quality. The acting overall is below standards for me. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Norton both didn't give enough expressions that their characters feel just like cardboard cutouts.",Annabelle

With James Wan pulling out of the director chair, his legacy has been left open for other directors to take over. Well open season is over, for the infamous doll of the Conjuring has now got a movie of her own. Can Wan's big shoes be filled, or has the train of good horror movies run out of steam, leaving us again with Hollywood knock offs. Let's get down to the question you want answered. Is Annabelle scary? Well for this reviewer the answer is kind of. Like it's predecessor, this movie is a combination of jump out at you scares and creepy, paranormal activity. Blended together in decent harmony, audience members will get a nice variety of ways to make you squirm in your chair, and possibly scream. For this reviewer, the creepier aspects involved objects turning on randomly, or the random trail of pictures dropped by a devious shadow. Such random acts seem silly, but it's the subtle play of light, a thing you catch off to the side that really penetrates your core. We've all been spooked by something in the corner of our eye and this movie plays on it. Like Wan, director John R. Leonetti also is not afraid to have his monsters come out during the day. Yes, no manner of light can keep the creatures at bay, again removing a barrier that we normally turn too. Yet this movie takes it one step further and takes the creature out of the residence. Most movies keep the spirit isolated to one area, but Annabelle's wrath escapes out into the open, following our heroine and her cohorts around. This may not affect some, but for a few latecomers to the theater, they were not happy to lose that comfort. Such alterations in haunting strategies is what the horror world has needed, giving it a little extra kick to the scare factor that many films in this genre have been lacking. Of course the creepiest thing in this movie is none other than the doll herself. As I mentioned a year ago, Annabelle has the design that will chill just about anyone to the bones. In this movie we are given an exponential increase in that factor, the seemingly innocent doll being scarier than the thing tied with it. Her cold lifeless stare has a menacing glare to it behind those, pristine blue eyes. The charismatic grin holding a comfortable welcome laced with malice and evil and all of it is wrapped in a porcelain white package. What adds a little more scariness to it, is seeing the doll wind up in the strangest places. As the trailers state, it starts with a simple change in poster, but gradually turns to her ending up in the weirdest places that will make you cautious in your own room. Throw in the fact that her features morph over the course of the film, eventually into movement and well you get some factors that might have you screaming ""Oh snap!"" into the air. With all these factors you might think this movie is the scariest thing I've seen. Unfortunately that is not the case. The first reason is a big one, the trailers have shown you most of the scary scenes. That's right, a majority of the jump out at you moments and creepy happenings have been laid out for you in all their details. Sure there is a little editing to cover things up, and you haven't heard the spine tingling music that adds a little spice, but you'll see most of the moments coming. A second factor to the lack of scariness is that once again the camera foreshadows when things are going to jump out at you. The cessation of motion, the sudden quietness, they are still the classic factors to give away the ""surprise"" they had planned. Finally the third factor is the actual denizen that is using the doll. For the last year we've wondered what invisible tormentor was behind Annabelle, and in this film it is revealed. While the revelation was incredibly creepy, the actual look of the beast paled in creepiness to the doll. Yeah, the make up and special effects are good, and it's hiding in the shadows helps add a little edge, but one can see the aspects that inspired it's creation. What else does Annabelle have to offer? Well the story is not that bad, for writer Dauberman has done a nice job tying in character development with the horror aspect of it. However, the plot of this genre has lost the ability to be unique, and we have seen this tale told in previous movies, though the ending is halfway decent. As for the acting, they did a good job for this film with Annabelle Wallis being the main star of the show. Wallis does a great job playing the wife driven to the point of delusion, balancing her expected screams and whimpers with a decent dialogue. She impressed me even more with her delivery of her lines, the wavering voice a nice touch to emphasize the terror she faced. Annabelle is a decent prequel filled with the elements that made The Conjuring the ride it was. While the movie has been ruined by the trailers, this reviewer would say to give this a shot. Again, it's not the best installment I've seen, but it provides a good opening for the month of horror. My scores for this movie are: Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",Annabelle
66,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Could've been more,...ended up being standard",5,17 October 2014,"As recently as the last half a century, dolls have been mostly used in cinema and in pop-culture for their looks. It is very questionable to who ever constructed such toys would think they excited kids, rather than creep them out. When referenced, the most notable creation people remember is Don Mancini's Child's Play (1988) series starring Brad Dourif as the infamous Chucky. Another one that comes to mind would be James Wan's Jigsaw from the Saw (2004) series. Even Billy from Dead Silence (2007), who was also headed by James Wan had their share of memorabilia. Then when Wan's The Conjuring (2013) hit theaters, viewers were briefly introduced to Annabelle,...another doll with some serious attitude issues. So what is the story behind this new addition and is it uniquely different from that of our other doll counterparts? Mmm...tough to say. It has its moments but more often than not, it comes off as a standard affair.The Annabelle doll, like many others, was once just a collector's item. Unfortunately, the period of time at which it was made is the problem. During the late 1960s, a normal family is attacked by a group of cult members for unknown reasons and along with that the doll becomes possessed. Gary Dauberman's first theatrical screenplay isn't bad, but it also isn't anything special. The fact that after seeing this movie, the background to why Annabelle needs to be kept in a glass case at the Warren's is so important is clear. But other than this, the writing lacks clarity - specifically on cult rules. How does one possess a doll with such ease? Who actually possesses the doll? A newly created demon? Or the individual who possessed it in the first place? All of which these questions get relatively skimmed over with explanations like - ""Crazy people do crazy things"" or ""Cults summon demons"". These are very generic answers, considering the pace at which it runs.Cast wise, the family played by Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton put in believable performances but do not stand out. Even veteran actor Tony Amendola (better known from Antonio Banderas' The Mask of Zorro (1998)) plays his typecast role - a priest. It's nice to see him, but again, nothing new. The most likable character of the whole group was Evelyn (Alfre Woodard), a local bookstore owner. Evelyn had charm and character arc that was far greater than the rest. It's characters like these that viewers need more of. When it came to visual style, the majority of it was average to slightly above. James Kniest's cinematography is frequently flat. John R. Leonetti's direction is standard on most cases too. This is unfortunate due to how many horror films he's worked with in the past as the director of photography. This includes, The Conjuring (2013), Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013), Piranha 3D (2010), Dead Silence (2007) and Child's Play 3 (1991),....even Jim Carrey's The Mask (1994). In fact, there was a scene that could've been used as a twist ending but was then ignored. That would've been more horrific if it had ended like that.The violence is there but it is also very dry. I'm not sure if Leonetti was going for the ""less is more"" approach but it didn't work. Considering the scares aren't effective either because the Annabelle doll does barely anything. The movement of the doll is even more restricted and rigid than Chucky, Billy or Jigsaw. The only thing creepy about it was its face and never ending stare. Even eye movement or creaky head turning would've helped the doll feel more intimidating. The only elements that go above and beyond their mark are some tense scenes, special effects and music. The best scene to the movie is located in the attic. Whenever a baby cries,...its a bit unsettling. The special / practical effects look decent although what is given isn't frequent. Composer Joseph Bishara's music is alright. He does include emotional and creepy tunes, which involve heavy cello and piano. It's bit more effective than The Conjuring score he made a year before, even though it does borrow from it because the stories are connected. Is it a decently made movie? Assembly wise yes,...as an experience? Not if you seen movies like this before.Its connections to The Conjuring (2013) does give some insight but its own origins are bit cloudy. It's made professionally all the way down from its acting, special effects and music but it is rarely effective at being scary. Its execution is derivative at almost every level.",Annabelle
67,raulfaust,Bel Air,9,9 October 2015,"I'm aware that horror movies have gotten worse since the last ten years or more, and it's from such perspective that I'm writing about ""Annabelle"". First off, I would like to state that it's one of the best horror pictures I've seen since 2010. This film is filled with a terrifying storyline, which is able to scare every kind of public. Acting is VERY plausible and professional, allowing the characters to express reality to the spectator. Also, it's good to see that this project didn't copy the elements utilized in 2007's ""Dead Silence"", which was something I was quite afraid of. In fact, what really thrilled me the most was the serious and heavy directing from John R. Leonetti, which is what made everything else work out. All in all, I don't mean to look exaggerated or anything, but from now on, I'm inclined to personally consider ""Annabelle"" as the contemporaneous version of ""The Exorcist"", albeit it doesn't precisely talk about exorcism at all. Please don't hate me for that!",Annabelle
68,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Derivative, but better than I expected",7,16 February 2015,"Surprisingly good haunting flick. Satanists, breaking and entering, murder, demonic possession; clichés recycled from sensationalistic 1960s tabloid news, but it all comes together well, in this followup to the pointlessly titled, The Conjuring. Smaller cast helps keep this more focused than The Conjuring, and great set designs add to the film's atmosphere.My problem with this was its pacing, as the first thirty minutes, with the vicious Manson Family-esque attack, the most frightening to me, while the film's second act has its fair share of scares, the entire ordeal falls apart in a ridiculous, and predictable finale.",Annabelle
69,begob,Hard work ruined through laziness,3,16 December 2014,"Ah, I see what reviewers were getting at.This is a well produced but conventional horror with all the usual tricks. Young couple drawn in by grisly murders, the demon enters and follows them to their new life, the priest enters, and the conflict is on.Up to that point it's OK, with a few fairly decent jump scares. 1970 California seems convincing. The husband is dull, but the wife is well played.But what were they thinking in the final act? Half hearted, underwritten. I wasn't expecting anything fresh, but they really didn't work to earn anything from the audience.Nothing more to say. Oh - avoid the sequel.",Annabelle
70,moviexclusive,"A far inferior prequel to 'The Conjuring', this is a cash-grab exercise in mediocrity that trades in cheap scares than any genuine fear or tension",5,2 October 2014,"Whereas 'The Conjuring' rode on a wave of overwhelmingly positive test screenings to secure a prime release date in summer last year, 'Annabelle' seems to have taken the opposite route. Screened late or in some territories never for critics and audiences alike, it almost seems as if the producers want to keep the movie locked up – like the real-life 'Raggedy Ann' doll of the same name from which this was inspired – in a glass cabinet. And yet, the reason for their reluctance to unveil 'Annabelle' in the same way that they did for 'The Conjuring' is plainly simple once you've seen the former.First things first, 'The Conjuring's' James Wan doesn't return to direct 'Annabelle'; the Malaysian-born director serves only as a producer here and instead has relinquished the reins to his director of photography on the former, John R. Leonetti. Neither is 'Annabelle' scripted by the writers of 'The Conjuring', who – if it's any relief to fans of the original – are returning for the direct sequel 'The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist' due next year; instead, that credit falls here to Gary Dauberman, whose filmography before this consists of dubious direct-to-video titles like 'In the Spider's Web' and 'Swamp Monkey'. The point we're trying to make? Don't expect the same pedigree as 'The Conjuring', because there just isn't.It's unfortunate that 'Annabelle' gets immediately compared with the far-superior 'The Conjuring'; on its own, 'Annabelle' is a pretty average genre exercise that should satisfy those looking for a horror fix; but when you lay it next to 'The Conjuring', then this in-name prequel just is utterly inferior, and probably no more than an attempt to cash in on its predecessor's success to get more people into the cinema. Heck, they couldn't even get Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga to cameo in the scene where their characters, Ed and Lorraine Warren, frm 'The Conjuring' are clearly referenced.Since 'The Conjuring' is set in the mid-1970s, 'Annabelle' sets itself about a decade before, when medical school student John (Ward Horton) and his wife Mia (Annabelle Wallis) are a young couple living in a quiet suburban neighbourhood and expecting a baby. Mia is a doll collector, and Annabelle is John's surprise present to her to complete her antique doll collection – though why one naturally wonders just why anyone would want a creepy looking thing like Annabelle in their home. Anyhow, on the night they learn of the Manson family murders (Google that if you're keen for more information), their home is invaded by the daughter of their next- door neighbour.A Satanic hippie best described as a crazed demon worshipper, she and her boyfriend have just murdered her parents before proceeding to try to do the same with John and Mia. But the police arrive, and in the melee that follows, her boyfriend is shot dead while she slits her throat such that her blood gets into the titular creepy doll. None of this is a spoiler, since you already can see most of it from the trailer. After some weird and dangerous things happen in that house (from the usual moving of furniture to slamming of doors and leading up to the kitchen catching fire), John and Mia move into a new apartment in a new town, where John is to complete his residency.Needless to say, Annabelle follows them to the new place, and while John is away, proceeds to terrorise Mia as well as their newborn baby daughter. Who do the couple turn to? Well, as clichés go, John looks to a local elderly priest (Tony Amendola), while Mia confides in the eccentric black woman (Alfre Woodard) who runs a bookstore down the street with a convenient occult section. The entity responsible for the paranormal activities? It's a demon; and before you can say 'exorcism', Father Perez (conveniently) turns into the eager exorcist who tries to rid the demon from the doll – and if you need any clue as to how that turns out, well just re-watch the opening sequence from 'The Conjuring'.None of what happens is particularly scary in and of itself, because instead of the nice slow-burn type of atmospheric dread that 'The Conjuring' traded in, Leonetti insists on hitting his audience over their heads with repeated 'boo!' scares which are akin to the genre's junk food. Yes, if you're well versed in the genre, this is more about things jumping out at you at various moments – accompanied by appropriately sudden sound effects – than any genuine tension or fear. It is cheap to say the least, and lazy if you compare it against the well-crafted sequences which made 'The Conjuring' such a success in the first place.It doesn't help that Dauberman's script plagiarises elements from all the horror classics we've known – from the helpless mother to her logical companion to the local priest who doesn't need a permit from the Vatican to decide he wants to take on the demon to the peculiar black lady who actually knows a thing or two about the demonic stuff she keeps ranting about. There is nothing here that transcends genre mediocrity, and Leonetti's reliance on the frights of the lowest denominator doesn't help one bit.Like we said, though the producers of 'Annabelle' would gladly like for their film to be related with 'The Conjuring', that association is a double-edged sword. It will get fans in no doubt, but whether it leaves them satiated in the same 'scared stiff' way 'The Conjuring' did is clear – it won't. What that means in terms of goodwill for 'The Conjuring' franchise in general is still suspect; but here's something we do know – 'Annabelle' is no 'Conjuring', and at its best, is a thoroughly mediocre genre exercise that is good for Halloween but little else.",Annabelle
71,elliotjeory,Not the best,5,31 January 2020,"This film was ok, a little slow, nowhere near as good as Annabelle Creation. Very noisy too, relied on sounds for scares than visual.",Annabelle
72,quincytheodore,"Annabelle doesn't conjure any chill, she just forcefully smirks and stares long enough for a few scares.",5,1 October 2014,"While still possessing the same style of Conjuring, this is obviously a less exciting endeavor. The direction is a bit simple and rigid, borrowing much from old horror movies and surprisingly not enough sharp tension from the franchise. There's a merit on making it elementary, creating atmosphere of novel enmity for example, but the movie feels lackluster and mediocre instead. It still has some few good moments, although they timid or a given considering the blaring sound effect or repetitive close up on the doll are eerie by themselves.Story revolves around a married couple who struggles with unfortunate events all the while on the verge of delivering their newborn. It's a good setback to draw sympathy, albeit it's rather similar to Insidious and admittedly executed not as well. Annabelle Wallis as Mia Gordon and Ward Horton as John Gordon are serviceable and convincing enough as young parents, but they appear monotonous at times. There's not really much leeway as the plot progresses, those who have seen this kind of movie will probably foresee what the next scenes will be. Conjuring followed this formula too, yet it had much more impact and unless there's more intensity in future flicks, this recipe grows old quickly.The style and placement of camera are pretty unique, it allows audience to guess what lies in the corner. This kind of cinematography persists, mainly because the director also works on Conjuring, The problem is Annabelle lacks the disturbing gripping moments of the same style. There is no increasing terror or swooping fright, the scares themselves are quite mild in comparison. Harrowing soundtracks help immensely as well as the screeching noise or screaming infant, these are things that ooze fear even outside context so having less horror even with their aid is a little underwhelming.What frightening about this style is the fear of unknown, after it manifests it loses steam. No one wants to see tug-of-war with demon. Annabelle doesn't bring any tense build-up nor does she explode in big climax. There can only be some much they can squeeze from the doll close up and screeching voices. If it wasn't for the Conjuring marketing, this will be remembered as another average horror film, or perhaps it would've been better that way.",Annabelle

The Annabelle demon however, always intrigued me. And to me, this movie delivered in giving more explanations as to why the doll was possessed. With a more compelling script and pace, than in the other movies. I really like the message and the demon's aesthetic. Even though half of it appearances are clearly CGI, it was scary and the basement attack, had a chilling build up. The cast is probably my favorite of the Conjuring universe too, and all made their characters relatable and sympathetic. Unfortunately the sequels, though necessary, kind of spoil the effort.

The director of The Conjuring then brings us Annabelle which was an utter disappointment. It was very unoriginal, tedious, and had very little scares. The film goes a long time without delivering any scares. When something scary does happen it's usually cheesy like a girl in a dark silhouette appearing in a doorway, something everyone has seen before thousands of times. Aside from a few jump scares that come up every once in awhile, there were many scenes that build up suspense, only to lead up to nothing happening. Suspenseful music would start soaring for several seconds, the music would suddenly stop, and then the scene would end. It was very disappointing to me because I was expecting something serious to occur in these scenes, only to get nothing. Only the scene I found truly scary was when the mother reaches in the baby's cradle and gets grabbed by a creepy hand. Other than that, the film was not very scary.",Annabelle

Unfortunately, one of 'Annabelle' main flaws is its failure to build up any sort of tension, which is partly down to its thin plot.

But I can say that I found it to be fine and pleasant to watch. Sure, there are a number of well executed scares, but its 1969 setting and cinematography by James Kniest provide it with a dreamy quality. Annabelle isn't about gore. It's that rare film these days that aims to scare you by building dread with patience and restraint. Director John R. Leonetti should be applauded for this. The best executed sequence occurs at the beginning of the film when we get to see what happens to Mia (Annabelle Wallis) and John Form's (Ward Horton) neighbors through their bedroom window. On the downside the script by Gary Dauberman just doesn't have enough good material for the film's 99 minute running time. Just like in The Conjuring (2013) there is a buildup of scares until the shocking ending, but in Annabelle this becomes repetitive because the scares are practically the same. This didn't bother me much though because Wallis and Horton are charismatic enough actors to make us care about Mia and John. I definitely liked them more than the characters in The Conjuring. It's not hard to realize that Annabelle is influenced by Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. While it's not as good as that 1968 film, Annabelle is still a good time at the movies and I recommend it.

That is, it is a 'prequel', with events preceding those already seen. This is how we discover the truth about the facts surrounding its creation. After all, when it was said that she had belonged to a girl whose parents were murdered, it forgot to mention that they had been killed by her own daughter, who at the time was no longer a child and had left the family home to join a Satanist sect.

The director respects the story previously told by Wan, maintaining the constant dark mood of the plot. Your camera architects extremely effective sequences, even when working the clichés. Televisions and radios turn on and off by themselves and doors slam mysteriously, but there is a certain class in the way Leonetti records such phenomena. Despite not getting rid of the accentuated sound scares, the filmmaker succeeds in balancing psychological suspense with trash horror, fundamental for the good performance of the film. Aided by a montage that never lets the rhythm of the film drop, in sync with the powerful soundtrack by Joseph Bishara, Leonetti also brings visual proposals that cause anxiety in the viewer. A sewing machine can turn into a highly dangerous instrument, the basement of a condominium can be terrifying and a physical attack from a demon can surprise you.In addition to making reference to Wan's work, Annabelle composes small tributes to horror classics, from Rosemary's Baby to Scream. Roman Polanski's film, for example, appears in several moments of the film, which names its protagonist in honor of Mia Farrow, places its characters in a building (with basements and elevators) and uses the classic baby carriage as a narrative element. In the midst of these ""eater eggs"", Leonetti manages to work well with the static presence of the doll, preventing it from becoming a murderous toy. The film even flirts with deeper issues, such as motherhood and the strength of the bond between mothers and children. Noble intentions that come up against the limitations of the cast. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton try to make the public care about their fate, but it's her best use for showing how her disorder gradually grows. Horton barely knows how to balance the dramatic moments and has few relevant scenes. Tony Amendola and Alfre Woodard provide a good counterpoint to the plot. Amendola represents religion (incidentally, it is interesting how the film shows the religiosity of the characters without fanaticism) and Woodard could be better used as Evelyn, the mystical book seller.However, there is never, at any time, the creation of an atmosphere of horror in the least satisfactory. This is because, as much as we spend most of the film following Mia's daily life, we know little about who is actually saved some small hobbies. On the contrary, her personality is non-existent and her actions always reflect her ""mother"" status. John suffers even more from this lack of development, and were it not for the constant mentions of hospitals, it would be easy to even forget where he is at all times. It is imperative for horror films to develop their characters well, otherwise, no matter how many dangerous/terrifying scenes they contain, the audience simply won't care. What happens here is just the presentation of a couple we should root for without, however, being given a reason to do so, so the whole cinematographic experience is uninteresting.Something rarely happens in Annabelle. Even the amount of jump scares, a technique known to try to supplement this lack of an atmosphere of terror, is limited. The construction of tension seems to boil down to close-ups of the doll. The film lacks not only a better script, but also James Wan's excellent technique for creating unsettling sets rather than the constant sense of boredom that the work often conveys. Unlike The Conjuring, in which scares are built in a natural way, Annabelle goes against the grain, betting on easy scares and doesn't convince in several points of the script: with the appearance of the false priest with Annabelle's eyes, or the insistence on personify the devil, who looks more mischievous than behind a soul. Even within mythology, that being doesn't make sense: one moment he seems to want to kill Mia, the next he wants her soul - which should be given freely.The narrative drags on and has characters that just disappear. And they didn't even need to be there. The scene where Mia meets two children is only for the character to think that the macabre drawings were left by the neighbors. But the clear mention of what Annabelle did with her scary messages in the first movie was enough. Gary Dauberman's screenplay tries to apply a psychologist's tone to a story that we know a lot in advance is horror. Less is more: showing Mia as an unseen child stalker would be more psychologically disturbing.The doll becomes obsolete and look, it disappears from the narrative at times, losing its minimal function of bringing the devil towards the massacre of a family. The doll barely interacts with the story and at least does not enter into the embarrassment of carrying a knife and attacking the characters. She is purely an object to attract evil wherever she is. A kind of devil's puppet. So it's okay to evoke all the clichés. Unlike the film that serves her as her starting point, The Conjuring, Annabelle can't get carried away and lingers too long in minor and uninteresting aspects. There is also the priest who feels the presence of evil, the occult book reader who has a mysterious past, children who vaguely represent a kind of evil, in short, all the conventions have been used, which is not a problem, but they do not favor the narrative's progress in any way.It would be unfair to say the movie is all bad. In the first few minutes, the couple's relationship is well built; there is a parallel with a moment to historically situate the film - the crimes of the Mason family -; and the director knows how to position the camera, especially at the beginning of the second arc, when he starts using vertical traveling - up and down - representing, on an unconscious level, the presence of the supernatural. However, it's important to know that the story is completely fictional (if you believe the other actually happened): The Warrens have no record of how Annabelle ended up in the hands of the then owners. And that's interesting, because an original story would increase the possibilities, having only the tie that Annabelle would be in one piece for the next movie. Or not even that, it was just a little more daring.The main success of Gary Dauberman's screenplay is to make Annabelle terrifying from the beginning of the film, possessed or not. The sense of danger is always present and the doll works well as a receptacle for evil, without necessarily having to move to show the damage it can do. The obsession with close-ups in Annabelle's eyes is chilling! If, on the one hand, the screenwriter is quite happy to reuse clichés organically and bring new dreadful conflicts, ""Annabelle"" slips into its third act, with a solution too easy, perhaps to reinforce the intention that it could also become a franchise. Furthermore, the long-awaited pair of demonologists does not appear, it is just cited. But then we can even forgive, since the story is told before the case referred to by Ed and Lorraine Warren in ""The Conjuring"". Furthermore, the impression we have at the end of the screening is that the original feature is more impactful.As much as Annabelle is a derivative of Evil Summons, she ends up sharing few of its qualities. An extremely predictable and uneven script accompanied by uninspired direction resulted in a boring and forgettable film. The feeling that remains is that the film was only released to try to cash in on the success of its precursor is inevitable. There are good scare scenes, sponsored by the incidental sound boost, and a captivating story, but the plot is flat, with elements common to the style, and there are few surprises for the more experienced in the genre.",Annabelle
86,aesgaard41,Chucky has a sister?,7,23 October 2016,"I'm a big fan of horror movies, especially those that cater to the paranormal genre, which generally means I cater to haunted houses movies than anything else in the genre. ""The Conjuring"" was a pretty good movie up until three quarters through so the idea of a film based entirely on the Annabelle doll and avoiding the sudden turn to an annoying possession plot line seemed to have some merits. ""Annabelle"" fits in very well with the new twisted horror transition that created ""Insidious"" and ""Sinister."" It doesn't try to scare you with something, it just scares you. It doesn't waste time with the ""Chucky"" point of view of something running around at floor level either. The movie is completely revealed in the fears and experiences of Joan and Maria who own Annabelle who seemingly runs through the apartment from the top shelf, somehow returning when she is dispatched and even at times warping reality to cast doubts in the minds of the main characters. Some of the scares are reminiscent of scenes from ""The Amityville Horror"" and other films, but the acting and direction almost makes up for the fact. Where the movie really succeeds is creating a true paranormal horror character out of ""Annabelle"" in what has been lately a string of serial killers and undead maniacs since the 1980s. Bottom line, ""Annabelle"" is a return to the real horror movies of the 30s, 40s and 50s before the field was inundated by blood and gore flicks, and for that, I greatly approve.",Annabelle
87,swilliky,Decent horror film and addition to the Conjuring Universe,6,9 August 2017,"The creepy doll gets its own horror movie and somewhat of an origin story. Mia (Annabelle Wallis) is an expectant mother and doll collector who is given the porcelain figure as a present from her husband John (Ward Horton). He doesn't believe her when she says she hears a scream from the neighbors but investigates to find the neighbors bleeding. Mia is attacked by followers of a satanic cult and the woman cultist, Annabelle Higgins, kills herself when the cops arrive, bleeding into the doll's eye. Mia recovers from a stab wound to her stomach, though her child is still alive inside her. Strange noises start to sound in the night and weird occurrences like the sewing machine coming on as the doll shifts.John throws the doll in the garbage when Mia is disgusted by it being held by the murderous woman. When all the stoves mysteriously turn on starting a fire and something grabs her leg, Mia is taken to the hospital and has the baby. They move to a new apartment and attend a church service with a congregation led by Father Perez (Tony Amendola). Somehow, the Annabelle doll shows up again much to John's concern but Mia wants to keep it. She meets her neighbor Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) but is also haunted by a strange woman walking around her house while she sleeps. She sees strange things and tries to convince her husband who turns to the church.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Annabelle

Along with Insidious, there was genuine scares that stuck in your mind and had everyone talking.With Annabelle, first introduced in The Conjuring, we are given more of a slow burning drama, shot very much like its predecessor but not quite as scary.That said, my husband refused to look at the screen more than enough because of the wonderful use of sounds, and the site of the doll itself which I have since used to great effect at home when scaring him!But as a horror film maker and fan, I want something that will scare the crap out of me and have me boasting about it long after.Annabelle carries a few of those moments, but literally, a few. I don't want to go in to them for sake of giving anything away, but one particular scene left me cold and was wonderfully executed also.Others almost had the same effect, but while I am hard to scare, the husband had his head buried in my shoulder constantly!Annabelle wasn't bad.

90,ersinkdotcom,"""Annabelle"" is a worthy follow-up to ""The Conjuring""",8,4 October 2014,"Arriving thanks to the great success of James Wan's ""The Conjuring,"" ""Annabelle"" picks up where its predecessor began. I know that doesn't make much sense, but think of this supernatural thriller as a companion piece versus a sequel. While not as frightening or complex as the original, ""Annabelle"" is an effective scare fest filled with characters set up well enough to empathize with.A couple's home is invaded by satanic cultists. Shortly after, they begin to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll. Upon further investigation, the couple discovers the cultists have summoned an entity so malicious that nothing they did will compare to the sinister conduit to the damned that is now... Annabelle.Set in the 1970s, ""Annabelle"" plays out just like a lost film from that era. It takes time to set up each character and give the viewer a reason to invest in their lives. You get attached to them before unholy terror and tragedy reigns down upon each one. Another reason it plays out like a genuine treasure from the decade of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" is its focus on the satanic panic movement of the time. The drama unfolds as the Manson Family trial is playing out on the couple's television. It captures the paranoia of a time when cults and a serial murderer known as the Zodiac Killer was on everyone's minds. The American public was either fixated or unhealthily fascinated with the dangers of the occult.""Annabelle"" is rated R for intense sequences of disturbing violence and terror. Blood is definitely shed on screen and I agree that some imagery is beyond what we've come to expect from PG-13 movies. However, there's no nudity to be seen.For those walking into ""Annabelle"" expecting a ""Chucky"" movie, you'll be sorely disappointed. The doll is only one plot device used. The demon manifests itself using several different avenues which I don't want to spoil entirely here. The most prevalent one is that of the female cult member who ""infects"" the doll with her tainted blood.One thing I really enjoyed about ""Annabelle"" was its confidence in waving the flag of Christianity in a mainstream movie. The writers had no problem giving mention of God and Jesus Christ throughout the film. I'm not saying that everything in the movie is theologically sound, but the spirit and intention is there. I also agree with most of the explanations as to how demons come to be attached to objects.""Annabelle"" is a worthy follow-up to ""The Conjuring."" It comes as no surprise that producers would focus on the deadly doll as a means of carrying on what could become a franchise all its own. The creepy plaything almost stole the show. Just like Disney is doing with ""Star Wars,"" Warner Brothers could push out a spin-off film for each object in the Warrens' occult museum every other year directed by up and coming talent while James Wan handles the ""The Conjuring"" sequels.",Annabelle

A prequel to the previous year's THE CONJURING featuring the creepy- looking doll from its pre-credit sequence, Annabelle was also (very) loosely based on a true story from the files of paranormal investigators Ed & Lorraine Warren, only in real life it was a Raggedy Ann. I was expecting something along the lines of CHUCKY but, fortunately, the doll isn't possessed, it's just a gateway for a malevolent demon in search of a soul ...someone else's, of course. There's a few good ""jump scares"" and the entity is sufficiently menacing but, like its predecessor, the kind of chills the filmmakers are aiming for doesn't come from gore or CGI, more's the pity (for me, at any rate). It was produced by James Wan, THE CONJURING's director, and directed by its cinematographer in the obvious hope lightning would strike twice but one film of this type was probably enough. That said, ANNABELLE isn't bad, especially for a seasonal film, but a third entry (and I hear it's coming) would hold no interest for me without a higher body count dispatched in explicit fashion.

96,meydiana-65242,How anyone could rate this highly is beyond me.,1,31 October 2020,"Warning: Spoilers
There was such huge potential for this movie to be scary. Extremely creepy looking doll, backstory from The Conjuring , an old house and a baby. But instead of a genuinely haunting movie, we were subjected to an insulting plot with ZERO scares. I am not exaggerating. There were zero scary parts in this. Lots of zooming in on the creepy doll's face. You expect something to happen at this point. The head to move, the mouth to open, the eyes to blink. But no, there was nothing. Just a slow zooming in shot of a stationary inanimate doll.Look at the movie's budget vs. profit and you'll see why the producers wanted to make this movie. It was simply a cash making exercise with no thought given to the plot.This should not be classed as a horror movie. I've seen Scooby Doo cartoons which were scarier than this.",Annabelle
97,apryla-58795,Dirty Doll,5,20 January 2019,"I watched Annabelle: Creation first so I saw the part at the end of that movie that is shown in the first part of this film. I didn't get it when I watched Annabelle: Creation but now I do.This wasn't too bad. There were some genuinely creepy parts. Annabelle Wallis is beautiful but she's kind of a dud and she's boring. The lead guy looked more like a high schooler than a father and husband. AW looked like his older sister. He was kind of ""howdy doodyish"". They had no chemistry. He lacks something - his looks and his acting just don't seem big screen appropriate. That baby was so dang cute.A few questions, observations and thoughts...Why would she put the doll up on the shelf in the new apartment in the baby's room after making such a big deal about not wanting anything to do with it earlier.The doll is so dirty and tore up and it's face is creepy yet the lady at the end is just gonna buy it with no hesitation?! Who wants a crappy looking doll even if it is rare?!Who were those little kids on the steps
that drew the creepy pictures? Were they possessed when they did that? Were they even real or were they ghosts? They were being super secretive so I'm still trying to figure that out.A cop wouldn't just let a rando look at a case file and keep photos like that.Finally I don't think it's very respectful to make movies that reference the Manson murders or use them as a type of model for behavior if they aren't documentaries or movies that are based on those events. If handled respectfully and with the goal in mind to bring to life the victims then that's admirable. If the film is meant to humanize these people and show how truly awful Charles Manson and his followers were so that maybe it could be used as a cautionary tale I get it BUT in the case of this particular film it wasn't. Mostly teens watch these horror films so they aren't as familiar with the Manson murders as those of past generations. Those were real people with family members & friends -many of whom are still alive today. I just think it's in bad taste to use something like that as fodder for a dumb horror flick. It's insensitive and these writers and directors need to be more respectful when coming up with ideas. They could've made this movie referencing a random cult not specifically Charles Manson and it could have been just as effective. It's kind of shameful that the writer and director couldn't come up with any other ideas for a fictional film so they resort to using Manson...on a film like this-these types of movies that have no substance and are churned out on a regular basis. They are generally conceived strictly as cash grabs for entertaining teens who want films with jump scares and demonic overtones.

98,dfa120374,A Very Decent Prequel To The Conjuring,6,5 March 2015,"Annabelle is actually another pretty decent trek into the whole demonic/possession genre of film that doesn't really fail to entertain and is an enjoyable prequel to The Conjuring.I must admit, I was actually a bit wary that this movie was just another Chucky type of film, but thankfully it didn't go down that route. There are plenty of scenes where you do start to expect that, but like I said, thankfully it doesn't.The film starts off decently enough, but it does tend to drag on a wee bit for about the first 50-55 minutes with plenty of build-up scenes that have no real end results. I know a story can't really dive straight into the heart of the matter within the first 5 minutes and it needs time to develop (plus it would be hard to sustain any kind of tension for the rest of the film), but you still feel a bit disappointed when nothing much happens. The good news is though, that this changes and the film starts to pick up very nicely after the mentioned 50-55 minute mark, for which I'm thankful because what happens from here on in rescues the movie.The way that some of the latter scenes are filmed when the demon has become more prevalent is impressive, especially the doll levitation and the basement scenes. Also, with some very nice sound effects accompanying these scenes, you have a good few uneasy, creepy moments. Would these scenes have been creepier if you just heard the demon instead of seeing it at all i.e. The Blair Witch? Possibly, but the way you see the demon in Annabelle is similar to the way we see the demon in Insidious...never long, lingering views of it but just enough to freak you out.Annabelle is a nicely shot, well acted, and decently written creepy horror and if you enjoy movies similar to those like The Conjuring, Insidious, and Sinister then there will be a very good chance that you will enjoy this.Overall, it's nothing ground-breaking but it most definitely isn't anywhere near as bad as some people are making it out to be.",Annabelle

The one thing that stood out for me with this one was the scares.""Annabelle"" seemed like it refused to rest on a single scare type and the variety made for a film that definitely made me jump at times and give me goose bumps during other times. The film does a great job of using light and dark, is capable of making very scary day time sequences (a rarity in the world of horror), is not afraid to use subtle terrors or make use of the background, and has jump scares that are a world away from your typical, generic jump scares that pollute up too many scary flicks. While the film isn't the most terrifying thing I've seen, I did realize that a lot more care was taken with the scary parts than I had predicted and it made for a decent horror film.""Annabelle"" isn't going to be one of the ""greats"" on my list of favorite horror films but the film definitely was more entertaining and much creepier than I had prepared myself for.

It doesn't feel like a follow-up to The Conjuring. It begins with a scene that's briefly included in The Conjuring and it ends with a brief reference to Ed and Lorraine Warren, but other than that it feels disjointed, something that wants to fit in but will never truly belong in The Conjuring universe no matter how hard it wants to.Annabelle is a slow-burning story about a mother's love, essentially. It's surrounded by a cliched ghost story that, while visually impressive and with scares and tension that is successfully executed, doesn't live up to its predecessor. The acting was fine, and the story was entertaining in the moment but it's nothing particularly memorable.This is a film that was a lot of fun in the theatre but now, with the ever-expanding Conjuring universe in perspective, it's really the outlier in the group. Not a bad movie by any means but, considering it's marketed as being part of a bigger universe that fits together perfectly without this entry, it so evidently doesn't belong. It feels as though Warner Bros. wanted to profit off The Conjuring by pumping out a sequel as quickly as possible, so quickly that they couldn't get the actors for Ed and Lorraine on board so they wrote them completely out of the film, which is really the biggest downfall it has.

106,ArchonCinemaReviews,Vastly inferior w minimal scares - prod. comp about bottom line with this one,3,14 October 2014,"The eerie antique doll Annabelle featured in The Conjuring gets the titular cinematic treatment to attenuating effect.A spin-off from The Conjuring, the film Annabelle tells the unnerving back story of the possessed and disturbing doll.A humdrum couple whom is pregnant is readying the baby room for their imminent arrival. Mother-to-be Mia has an affinity for vintage dolls and receives rare Annabelle from husband John on the night her family is viciously attacked by satanic cultists.About the only thing that scriptwriter Gary Dauberman does get correct is the chilling scene where the cult members attack the Gordon residence. The circumstances of the event were well thought out, appropriate for the time period and moderately unexpected. Unfortunately this is the only horrifying scene of the entire film.Annabelle straddles the line between homage to the supernatural thrillers of the 70's and uninspired rip-off of the supernatural thrillers of the 70's. The scares are far more feeble and ineffective than its peers, either because they are incredibly cliché or just lamely repetitive. Any hope for truly unsettling scares are overlooked and post-production unnecessarily adds the deafening and notorious string sound effect at every opportunity.Director John R. Leonetti relies on loud sewing machines, loud record players and doors randomly closing for the regular frights of the film – all of which are just no longer scary anymore. The direction manages to lack all ability to add mood and tone. Leonetti is not opinionated nor deliberate in his styling and does little to assist in the few scares that are in the film.Perhaps Annabelle suffers from overly high and unrealistic expectations. I can't help but feel that if the production companies New Line Cinema and The Safran Company had not rushed to capitalize on The Conjuring's success and waited for a better script and more qualified director that overall a better film would have been produced.For FULL reviews of RECENT releases, please check out our website.",Annabelle
107,nitzanhavoc,Comparing to The Conjuring makes this feel like a disappointment. Still worth watching!,6,14 January 2015,"Let me start off by stating that as a devout Horror fan with a special liking to ghost stories, haunts and exorcisms, I have really enjoyed The Conjuring. Therefore, my anticipation towards this pseudo- prequel is to be understood, as well as my disappointment...Perhaps it was the fact that James Wan was only an executive producer of this film that has made it wreak of mediocrity, especially compared to the first. Most of this film's components are exactly that: mediocre. The acting lacked the charisma and screen presence of Patrick Wilson (Ed Warren in The Conjuring), though I must say that Alfre Woodard (Evelyn) and Tony Amendola (Father Perez) were certain light spots. The story feels like it came out of an automated template machine given the basic ""create me a mediocre haunting story"" order, and again, compared to The Conjuring simply doesn't make the cut.So why the slightly generous rating? For a few reasons:1) Say what you will, that doll is one of the scariest, creepiest and most horrifying things I have ever seen both on screen and in life. Whoever created that doll's exterior should be either given a reward for being a genius or committed to a mental ward for being sick in the head (and I say that with the utmost respect, that doll is a work of art). Unlike The Conjuring, Annabelle gives the doll a lot more well deserved screen time.2) The cinematography is at its best with the quick shots, giving the audience sometimes less than a second to realize what they're seeing. Showing demons, ghosts and such evil presences in that manner really adds to the fear factor in my opinion, for Hollywood is yet to realize how to portrait a demon that is scary for those of us who aren't religious Christians (and I say that with no disrespect whatsoever to Christians or Christianity). I like to use Insidious (another Wanderful masterpiece, if you haven't seen it stop reading RIGHT NOW and go see it) as an example - the one thing really lowering that excellent film's level is the demon shown there. In Annabelle, demons are shown, but for a snap shot, leaving much to imagination which serves to add to the scare gauage.3) Plot actually gets pretty intense towards the end, but only towards the end.So all in all, perhaps had I watched this film before The Conjuring I would have been able to be more objective, but seeing as how I am unable to ignore it's shortcomings - I give it 6.5, meaning you should definitely watch it (especially if you liked The Conjuring) but you shouldn't expect it to meet The Conjuring's level.",Annabelle
108,rajatdahiyax,There are some fright worthy sequences!!!!,6,2 June 2015,"Annabelle is a 2014 American supernatural psychological horror film directed by John R. Leonetti, produced by James Wan, and written by Gary Dauberman. It is both a prequel to and spin-off of The Conjuring and was inspired by a story of a doll named Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren.The film stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, and Alfre Woodard.John Form (Ward Horton) thinks he's found the perfect gift for his expectant wife, Mia (Annabelle Wallis) : a vintage doll in a beautiful white dress. However, the couple's delight doesn't last long: One terrible night, devil worshippers invade their home and launch a violent attack against the couple. When the cultists try to summon a demon, they smear a bloody rune on the nursery wall and drip blood on Mia's doll, thereby turning the former object of beauty into a conduit for ultimate evil.",Annabelle
109,LloydBayer,"As a horror film, Annabelle is technically effective but lacks a good story and the finesse of a seasoned film maker.",6,2 October 2014,"As a prequel and spin-off of The Conjuring – 2013's highly effective horror film – Annabelle does what it promises, even if it does so one jump and one jolt at a time. But that's all you get, jumpy scenes done to perfection, with little or no atmosphere and a story that disintegrates before it reaches a satisfying conclusion.One of the most important aspects of The Conjuring and older sibling Insidious (both films directed by James Wan), is the cinematography and how it wreaks havoc with the viewer's peripheral vision. By this I am referring to events occurring off-center, or in some corner of the screen that is oblivious to on-screen characters but very obvious to the viewer. Consider a scene where a mother watches over her new born baby. The scene is shot in the living room where the right half of the frame is composed of the mother and her baby and the left half is a hallway that leads to other rooms in the house. Without shifting focus from the mother and child, we see something or someone lurking in the hallway behind; something that shouldn't be there in the first place. While this tactic is nothing new to horror-thrillers, it works for the whole purpose of inducing dread, thick and slow, before the actual jolt hits a few seconds later. The scariest scenes in Annabelle are made up of these moments, and at times we are left guessing what lurks in the corners. And is probably why cinematographer John R Leonetti of those preceding films is tasked with directorial duties in this film, while Wan himself is bumped up to producer. Leonetti plays it safe by treading down Wan's beaten path but without any surprises of his own.Playing the aforementioned mother is Annabelle Wallis (freaky coincidence?) as Mia Gordon. Mia has a doll collection, one of which is the titular vintage doll gifted by her medical student husband John (Ward Horton). After surviving a horrific attack from a satanic cult, the Gordons have new guests that won't leave. At first Mia starts seeing things and becomes increasingly paralysed by fear while John begins to doubt her sanity. It's a stock approach to crying wolf in horror movies. It takes a while to dawn on them that something has latched on to Annabelle, making the doll a conduit with increasing intent on harming them and their new born baby. Consultations with a librarian and a priest reveal far greater implications, thus leaving these young parents to ward off hell by going right through it.On one hand, the look and feel in this film is a copy-paste version of Insidious, but concentrated with sporadic moments of numbing fright. We've seen it before in classic horror films – young parents who must literally go through hell to save their child's soul. It's the same concept here but effective enough for a low budget horror film. Like a stern disciple, Leonetti is on par with Wan's technical approach. Cinematography, hair raising sound design (including deliberate moments without sound), and some decent tension will garner a few screams from the audience, but that's about it. On the downside, there isn't much of a story for a script based on real events and don't even expect anything along the lines of an animated 'Çhucky' doll. It's not about what the doll can do but about what's in the doll -If only they had built on that frame of thought. After some well-timed jump scares in the first half, all we are left with is a murky conclusion owing to underwritten supporting cast members whose inclusion leaves the ending stale and cheap.",Annabelle
110,ericrnolan,"""Annabelle"" (2014) scared the $#@& out of me!!",9,24 September 2015,"""Annabelle"" seems like precisely the sort of horror film that shouldn't work. Thinly drawn characters wind their way through a series of overly familiar tropes, including, of course, the titular possessed doll. These characters make the same baffling decisions that only people in horror movies are stupid enough to make, and cavalierly remain in dangerous situations long after you and I would have gotten the hell out of there. The film is so reminiscent of ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) that for a while I actually wondered if it was a remake. And the script is pretty clunky — especially the coda at the church.Yet  ""Annabelle"" still works. This is a frikkin' scary movie. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.There are a couple of reasons for the movie's success, I think. First, it's beautifully shot and directed throughout an especially creepy apartment building. Our supernatural antagonists are (at first) wisely seen down long corridors and stairwells. There are some static shots of the doll but none of the silly cut-and-cut-back tricks to explain that it is moving on its own.Second, there is no ham-handed CGI to make the action cartoonish; there are only sparsely placed practical effects, and they work quite well. This felt like an effective old-fashioned 1970's horror movie about the devil.Third, Annabelle Wallis does well in her role as the young married couple targeted by Satan. She underplays it quite a bit, but she's still a good actress. (The beautiful Wallis is none other than the college student that young Charles Xavier tried to pick up in 2011's ""X-Men: First Class."" And, yes, she does have the same first name as the demonic doll. Weird world.)I was confused at first about the awkward and confusing bookends to the film; they're distracting and unnecessary. Wikipedia informs me that these are intended to remind viewers that this movie is a spin off of ""The Conjuring"" (2013), which is regarded by horror fans as superior to this film. I guess I'll need to watch that soon.",Annabelle
111,jmbwithcats,Neutered Genre,4,12 October 2014,"Annabelle is a movie that creates an amazing premise in the mind of the viewer, only to cowardly pull back from that and neuter the entire film into mediocrity... if you've seen the film or don't mind spoilers... continue on... There's a premise in the film that a demon wants take the child's soul... at one point the mother finds the doll in the crib and starts bashing it around... we then see what appears to be her real baby laying on the ground... we now believe she just murdered her own baby due to a hallucination by the demon, and now out of desperation, will allow the demon to take her soul or something along these lines... a real mind *beep* to get what the demon wants... but nothing of the sort happens, instead it's just another doll on the floor, baby is fine, but mother then thinks she has to kill herself to save her daughter, which makes no sense, because if she believes in demons, and she goes to church, she probably believes in God and must believe her dead daughter is now in Heaven, right? Well, it doesn't go that way either, instead she lives and the completely random black voodoo woman who has been helping them sacrifices herself... The ending would have been better if she had beaten her baby to death, and gave her soul to the demon out of guilt... The whole movie has no balls, and is a major disappointment, I would give this movie very few Tostino pizza rolls, and say, wait for Netflix/Cable/DVD to watch this train wreck.",Annabelle

I just think that this one was more entertaining and had some really scary scenes, unlike Creation.I also felt like some parts of this film were missing. The murder scene of their neighbors (done by their daughter) which is also used in Creation is kinda unexpected and when you think about it - kinda improbable. Especially what they were to do next. I guess there are many small details in this one and later in creation that does not really fit... but overall when you watch the films, you don't think about them.The librarian was an interesting character.

113,troyputland,Predictable.,4,6 August 2015,"Repetition springs to mind. From rocking chairs to creaking doors, Annabelle is full of horror traits done a thousand times over. The doll is creepy and the idea of satanic cultists murdering innocent people and attacking the main couple in the night is frightening. That's as far as the scares go. The Conjuring was a success, amplifying terror tenfold. Annabelle is the prequel, following the doll's dark beginnings to ending up in the hands of the Warren family. Annabelle's been rushed in to, scoring no originality and a story anticipated from a mile off, proving that truly terrifying horror movies are a thing of the (recent) past. It's very similar to Deliver us From Evil, The Woman in Black, Sinister and Insidious, with glimpses of Paranormal Activity. Watch the latter two for greater scares.",Annabelle

115,Thrashman88,Chucky For Grown Ups,6,19 January 2015,"Annabelle was fun to watch, if not being particularly scary nor breaking any new ground. While I have never seen ""Rosemary's Baby"", I instantly knew some key references in this movie: the young newly weds expecting a baby, a satanic cult on a rampage, funny things going about, etc. There's very little explanation to all the super natural occurrences through out the movie except that they are pure evil. But why? Why summon pure evil? To whose benefit? Who wants vengeance? Why things happen to this particular couple? Little details that could've given the movie more weight in the plot department are left to the audiences imagination. Although the movie avoids (for the most part) cheap ploys like the doll moving its eyes or going completely Chucky, it still leaves a feeling of deja vu, the sort of ""seen that, being there before, and seen it much better realized"" kind of feeling. The acting also feels stiff. I don't know if it was intentional or what, but for a loving mother like Mia, she feels cold and distant. Maybe this movie was a homage to that Roman Polansky classic and my feelings are that ""Rosemary's Baby"" will probably be a more satisfying film. Next!",Annabelle
116,dommercaldi,This Is Somehow Worse Than La Llorona (2019),1,14 October 2020,"Pros:
1. The wide shots create good tension as it gives the viewer a lot to focus on thus keeping you on your toes.
2. The sound-mixing is decent and it does its best to induce suspense and horror.Cons:
1. The score is overbearing and it tries to force tension but it ends up being highly annoying.
2. The Demonic Figure's (Joseph Bishara) existence adds nothing to the story and is nonsensical.
3. The jump-scares are poorly placed and executed.
4. Mia (Annabelle Wallis) decides to get rid of the Annabelle doll at the old house because of the cult murder it was linked to, but then she randomly retracts her ill-feelings towards the doll in the new house with little to no explanation.
5. The plot is highly repetitive as nothing of any worth happens and is inundated with cheap lazy scares.
6. The character of John (Ward Horton) is barely fleshed out and he could have been killed off early into the film as he does virtually nothing. And the character of Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) is clearly just inserted to pseudo-intellectually waffle on about spirits, and to make sure none of the main characters die.
7. The editing is over-the-top at times with the lighting flashing in a haywire manner, or with slow-motion needlessly thrown in.
8. The dialogue is often clunky, especially when it tries to desperately sound ominous and scary.
9. Annabelle Wallis' performance ranges from distractingly underwhelming, to obnoxiously overwhelming.",Annabelle
117,trublu215,Falls short of The Conjuring by a mile,4,4 October 2014,"Annabelle is the type of horror film you'd expect to come out around Halloween. Its cheap, somewhat creepy but especially, its forgettable. Coming off of the genuinely creepy and disturbing The Conjuring, Annabelle tries to cash in on scares we've seen before, plot points that are filled with holes, and acting that is wooden and melodramatic. Despite these lackluster qualities, Annabelle can certainly turn up the notch on creepy atmosphere but can't exactly capitalize on it the way James Wan did in The Conjuring. As a stand alone film, Annabelle can certainly wet your appetite for horror but stands so much in the shadow of its predecessor that its hard to really enjoy the potential of it all. The story tells the horror behind the now legendary doll that had us all gripping our theater seats last summer, turning what was originally a 10 minute story arc in The Conjuring into a feature length film. As one could assume, it becomes tired and exhausted after the first thirty minutes of the film. The story then tries to rehash The Conjuring, pitting a family against supernatural forces and blah, blah, blah. Quite honestly, I would have enjoyed this film much more if director, John Leonetti took some risk and changed up the storyline up from the original. But no, they MUST stick with what worked before. Something that worked for one film, doesn't necessarily warrant a complete rehash of it just substituting a demon for a doll. My problems with this film are seemingly endless as I write this review, pulling more and more negative out of it all than I can the positive. At times, Annabelle shows glimpses of promise but they are all crushed with familiar scares, shoddy acting and hollow writing. John Leonetti is no James Wan, that's for damn sure. Overall, Annabelle results in more of a sequel to A Haunting In Connecticut or James Wan's Dead Silence than to the superior and masterfully made The Conjuring. While you'll most likely get a couple jump scares out of it, Annabelle is a mere after thought and a nail in the coffin to whatever hopes the studio had in turning The Conjuring into a franchise.",Annabelle

Not soon after strange things start to happen around them revealing that there might be something to this doll.

Unfortunately all this film is is a mediocre and boring film overall being focused on this couple for the entire movie is the biggest problem with the movie. They are unbelievably generic, boring, blind, stupid and naïve to the point that you don't even care about them or their babies well being. The fact that they hear screaming coming from next door and don't immediately call the cops just show how dumb they are. Outside of the Cult attack the whole first hour it's just padded with slow walking scenes, staring and dialogue between the couple that is Really uninteresting movie doesn't really get any sort of suspense and tension buildup throughout the entire movie. Just having this doll sit there staring the entire time it's not interesting or exciting. You don't feel any weight or presence of it. The only exception is this one scene with a demon in the basement at this point it start to feel like it going somewhere but even after that encounter what's we're still sitting through us more scenes otherwise just walking around slowly when is this point it is pretty obvious what is going on.

121,SyoKennex,"Pros and Cons, but good for a spook",7,7 September 2017,"Released back in 2014, Annabelle is a movie that got a lot of attention in the horror genre. Based off the story of the original Annabelle doll, locked away in a museum for the occult, director John R. Leonetti brings to life one of the most iconic haunted doll stories known in history. I am utterly terrified of dolls, and I think that might have been why I found this film as scary as I did. I was surprise to find it had quite a low rating on IMDb, especially with the sequel just coming out before I watched the film. I fully believe this deserves a slightly higher rating than what it got.First of all, Annabelle Wallis was an absolutely amazing actress and stole the show completely. She did a spectacular job and she was easy to relate to; it was easy to feel the fear she was going through throughout the film – especially the basement scene. Following Annabelle, I am more than eager to go through her filmography and find more of her acting skills. She was just wonderfully talented.Unfortunately, this film does rely on a lot of old tricks of the paranormal genre. The seeing things, the writing on the wall, the demon chase up the stairs, and although terrifying, I would have loved to see more from this that wasn't the same as everything else in the genre. I feel like the directors and script writers could have done a lot more development with this. I am aware they were following the original real life story of Annabelle, but they could have enhanced it, made it a little more scary and not just another trope.There were cons and pros about this, and unfortunately, there were quite a few more cons than there were pros. However, this was still quite a good horror film, for the current age, and I'd definitely recommend this to those who enjoy being spooked.",Annabelle

The film has nothing setting it apart from other horror films. It's not scary because it completely lacks a creepy atmosphere, and the only way they get you to jump out of your seat is with loud noises (that's why they are called jump scares). This movie is so mellow and relaxed it made me fall asleep after about 45 mins. In short: it's a money grab, an artistically failed fabrication devoid of any inspiration.

If that fact alone is enough to get one person not to watch ""Annabelle"", then I've done my job as a critic.If you went into ""Annabelle"" wanting to see something along the lines of ""Child's Play"" or at the very least, a doll-centric horror movie where dolls are either animated in some fashion or at the very least, trip someone as they walk down the stairs, then you will be savagely disappointed. On the other hand, if you were a fan of the small snippet of Annabelle's story shown in ""The Conjuring"" and wanted a terrifying and in-depth origins story, then youwill be disappointed as well.Synopsis: With an engaging set up, set against the rampant cult-phobia of the 60's, ""Annabelle"" is the story of a couple living in California who begin to experience paranormal occurrences after the husband gifts his pregnant, doll-crazed wife a doll, that soaks up blood faster than a Bounty paper towel. After that, the plot falls pretty flat by turning its focus away from the scary doll element, as the story becomes 10% ""Rosemary's Baby"", 20% every single haunted house movie ever and 70% watered down scares.Aside from the fact that not for one second did I care about any of the characters here, for the most part director John R. Leonetti (the director of photography of ""The Conjuring"") does a lazy job of ""conjuring"" up scares. For about 80 minutes of this 98 minute film, every single scare follows the ultra uncreative quiet, quiet, quiet, LOUD, formula. About 20 minutes in, it becomes obvious that Leonetti is either just going through the motions or doing a rather poor job of plagiarizing much scarier films.Final Thought: Much like the countless throw away, straight to DVD Disney animated sequels to come out of late the 90's and early 2000's (Pocahontas 2: Journey to a New World, The Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea, Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True"") ""Annabelle"" (a prequel) is nothing more than a soulless money-grab from this particular production company, attempting to feed off the success of ""The Conjuring"". No mention of Ed and Lorraine Warren (real life paranormal investigators from ""The Conjuring"") no James Wan (the director of ""The Conjuring"") and not one doll-induced scare, all seemed to have a hand in making ""Annabelle"" a strikingly forgettable film. I mean, in ""The Conjuring"", the Annabelle doll is only used in all of three scenes, but due to some smart direction, those are some of the scariest potions of the movie. In ""Annabelle"", the titular doll is used throughout and it's not even a little bit creepy. What gives?",Annabelle

Or does the demon just need a safe space to come back to when it's done all its shenanigans? XD. This isn't interesting or scary at all. It's just random spirits appearing, she moves ONCE,pops some popcorn and learns to sew in the middle of the night. They definitely should have made the doll a Raggedy Ann or if they couldn't get the rights to that something very similar.

Leonetti Review O sweet a creepy doll movie, that's a prequel to the conjuring one of my favorite horror films, I mean what could go wrong. Holy crap was this the most disappointing horror movie I've seen since the nightmare on elm street remake and seed of Chucky. This film revolves around a woman who is being haunted by the evil spirit of a woman named Annabelle that has possessed her doll and wishes to take her newborns soul. It opens with the same opening as the conjuring and you can hear ED Warrens voice talking to a victim of the dolls evil deeds. The film then cuts to what supposedly happened before those events occurred before but I felt like their a lot of unanswered questions like how did they end up with the doll, the woman played terribly by Annabelle Wallis says it disappeared at the end so she could not have been the one to lock it up and leave it for her daughter. The father named John who is portrayed even more terribly by Ward Horton doesn't serve diddly crap, he's just there can't act and I don't like him. The one plays the pries however I actually liked him, I don't know I guess I have weakness for priests in this kinds of movies. The visuals are kind of cool, I mean there the best things about this movie, which can me kind of suspect that the director is only good with visuals and not storytelling cause the story just left me with questions that I would suspect answered in this movie. The one cool thing is when you see the doll movie cause man that is one ugly creepy looking doll. The ending piste me off a bit cause it felt like the first three Chucky movies but only with a baby and the doll not even almost succeeding or at least I don't think it was close to succeeding. Annabelle is a film that I saw no trailers or commercials for cause I had high hopes but those hopes went down the drain but had some nice visuals so I'm giving Annabelle a two out of 10.",Annabelle
128,MJB784,Scary good,7,21 May 2018,"It is a prequel/spin-off of Conjuring and I found it better and scarier than that. I recommend it, but not strongly because it is familiar to those who have seen the Insidious movies, Sinister or Conjuring because they all deals with supernatural forces following families in houses, which seems to be a new sub-genre in haunted house pictures. It's especially appropriate for pregnant women or those with newborns because it deals with evil forces begging to be human again by possessing a baby.",Annabelle
129,varghesejunior,Never been scared like this before.,8,23 December 2014,"A prequel of ""The Conjuring"", Annabelle starts off with a couple who bring home a mysterious looking doll in advance for the baby they are expecting soon, but along with it start to happen weird things, including an attempt of a cult couple to try to kill them, and paranormal phenomena wherever they go. It's upto them now to find out who or what is behind all this, and how the doll is related to it.I got really scared in theater – more than Conjuring. The film could've definitely been made scarier but was quite scary even otherwise. All actors have plated their parts well; the music score fits with the film. Effects are remarkable for a horror flick. But all in all, ultimately it's almost the same old stereotypical ghost film – a ghost woman, ghost girl, ghost doll, paranormal phenomena and exorcismonly in a different form.No harm watching",Annabelle
130,somf,Dumb and Dummier,4,1 October 2014,"When you see films advertised ""from the producers of"" or ""From the makers of"" it means virtually nothing. ""From the director or writer of"" is a different story. All the other taglines just are discussing where the money comes from. In other words, James Wan's creative talent is absent from this attempt to make something of the Annabelle story that opened the Conjuring. I think most everyone knows that the doll is more or less inanimate in the film which is a smart move. After 3 decades of Chucky walking around with knife in hand, doll's have lost their ability to scare on their own. So a back story of demon possession and such was brought into play. Annabelle Wallis who plays the main character Mia is an excellent actress , but in this role she is about as forgettable as they come.If you want to see Annabelle Wallis do some great work watch Peaky Blinders on Netflix. The third best TV show ever behind Breaking Bad and The Wire. I was not familiar with Ward Horton but thought he was good in the role of her husband. The biggest name in the film is the talented Alfre Woodard who is wasted in what has to be the most illogical and poorly written character in the film. She runs a bookstore that has lots of books about demons and the devil, so you figure she may make the story a bit more interesting. No such luck, the writer manages to even waste that angle. Her fate is to be the centerpiece for the lousiest horror film finale in years. Her actions and fate are ridiculous.There is an obligatory priest that played by Tony Amendola that sets up a couple good scares. And there are 3 or 4 times that you will probably jump, but 2 or three of those scenes are in the trailer. Usually a reviewer will say of a weak film, wait till it hits DVD, but my recommendation for Annabelle is if you want to waste you time on it, pay to see it in the theater where the loud sounds and the big screen will deliver a couple good jolts. If I had rented this film on DVD I would never have finished it. There will be a Conjuring 2 next year, and like it's predecessor, it will probably be a great film, but any similarity between this and the Conjuring, begins and ends with an inanimate doll.",Annabelle
131,abouhelier-r,Annabelle,6,13 October 2014,"A couple begin to experience terrifying supernatural occurrences involving a vintage doll shortly after their home is invaded by satanic cultists. Annabelle is produced by James Wang and directed by his preferred cinematographer of choice R.R Leonetti. This movie is kind of a sequel to The Conjuring and I absolutely loved The Conjuring. Actually Leonetti was director of the photography on Insidious 1, Insidious 2 and The Conjuring; which all three movies happen to be one of my favorites horror movies of all time. Annabelle is the creepiest looking doll I've ever seen in my life, who ever thought to bring it into their house? Really... Who on earth would put that thing in their baby's room? No one sain for sure. This movie is based on jump scare after jump scare. The horror is obvious, you know something is going to happen. There were not that much of suspense building over the film though and the construction of the scary scenes. In fact, the film making doesn't properly fit the tones of sound effects that are supposed to make you feel something very scary is happening. My favorite scene is the elevator/staircase sequence which is really cool. For the first hour of the movie nothing really scary happen, it's just some pretty creepy close up of the doll. And then, that's when all the real scary things properly start to happen, we can actually see the demon: that's cool. Finally in this film mostly all the characters were not that great. They are all flat and lifeless; narrating the story of a perfect couple with a cute baby on the way and money which comes from god knows where. Unsurprising. Overall Annabelle is a bit disappointing as it was so predictable, it's not as close to be as good as The Conjuring.",Annabelle
132,krycek19,Barbie and Ken get a doll for a threesome...,1,21 October 2014,"Seriously, the Young couple look like Barbie and Ken dolls. He's handsome and boring and she's pretty and boring. And so is this so called horror movie.Apart from the movie itself, being boring and predictable, the couple act moronically throughout the movie.1: why would anybody want a creepy doll like Annabell in the first place? 2: after they move to an apartment after the first hauntings, the doll is in a moving-box even though Ken threw it away. And Barbie is not freaked out by this at all and decides to keep the doll?? 3: after Barbie and Ken and the cliché-priest finds out that the doll is possessed by a demon, they don't destroy the doll, which would probably destroy the demon as well. No Barbie throws it around and yells at it. And the priest takes the doll with him to his church where he is almost killed by the demon.4: as for the exercising couple that is not even in the movie, they're boring as well. And a franchise about that couple seems like a really bad idea.5: the exercising couple keep the doll in a glass box to keep the demon trapped. Again, destroy the doll and destroy the demon.6: why did this movie get an R-rating? There is no blood in it, no nudity, no swearing.Apart from a few creepy scenes and only one good scare, this movie isn't worth watching.

I loved The Conjuring - this is nothing like The Conjuring. At all. It's a blatant cash-grab and a terrible one at that.There is zero tension throughout this movie. Zero suspense. Everything is reliant on close ups of the dolls face to ""creep"" us out and really long periods of time where NOTHING HAPPENS. Literally, it's about this couple that we do not care about and their stupid problems which we care even less about. I don't know if they were trying to build suspense in these scenes but in order to build suspense you actually have to care about the characters. Or at least have, you know, suspense; a lingering sense of danger. This had nothing. And holy hell that ending. The positives of this movie: The lead girl is beautiful. She's easy to look at. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. That's it. The characters are horrendous and the acting is even worse. Seriously if you're going to make a movie this awful at least have the decency to take an acting lesson or two. It's a dreadful watch. Please, don't waste your time with this cash grab sh*t stain.

135,utahman1971,Boring and not scary,1,4 October 2014,"Figured this would be just like The Conjuring, another TV-14 movie put on the big screen with a slap of rated R on it. The Conjuring was so boring until last 5 minutes, and still was nothing much at the end. Now this one considered sequel (prequel), which is not any better at all. Boring doll that doesn't move until the end. Wow, do the directors know what scary is, and the rating committee. It seems like they hired a teenager to give should of been PG-13 movies a rated R rating, and say it is the scariest movie of the year award.I think they need to rehire the MPAA. They have no clue what a rated R movie is anymore. What's next NC-17 as a rated R movie, like rated R movies are starting to be like PG-13 ones? Seriously, this is getting pathetic. I thought James Wan's movies were getting bad, but this is bad as James Wan's. Well, if you enjoy boring and not scary movies or think PG-13 movies are scary then this one is for you.I can't stand falsified ratings any more. Saying something is Unrated and its actually like rated R, and R like its PG-13 is sad and pathetic, and needs fixing badly. Were losing the good gore that is better than this boring no swearing, no nudity, no scares horror movies like these.I am not watching The Conjuring 2, because the first one was so bad I could of fell asleep, but I just sat there the whole movie saying when is it going to start? Never did until last 5 minutes, and same with this movie.I just can't say enough of how bad this and The Conjuring was bad. If they showed these on Television like the other horror movies that get things cut out to not be shown, these two would not have anything cut out. It would be the whole thing shown, because there is nothing to cut out that is bad enough to even bother anyone.Like I said its like watching TV-14 movie on the big screen.",Annabelle
136,HorrorFan1984,Annabelle,8,12 April 2020,"This film introduces Annabelle, the evil possessed doll that was locked away by the Warrens in The Conjuring.We meet John and Mia who are expecting their first child. John pulls out the porcelain Annabelle doll as a gift for the new baby on the way. After a home invasion by a deranged man and woman causes the death of their neighbours and attack John and Mia, they move out of their suburban home and in a luxury apartment in Pasadena. The movie makes sure we notice that the blood of the dead home invader goes into the doll when she kills herself.Once at the new apartment, we see the regular day to day life of John and Mia with their newborn Leah. John goes to work to work each day while Mia stays at home and watches classic soap opera General Hospital. Very 60's housewife vibes which makes sense since that is the era this film is set in. Not before long, Mia starts seeing shadows at the new place, electronics start turning on and off without her touching them, and the woman who tried to kill her appears to her more than once. All seems to be connected to the Annabelle doll and the two deranged people who were a part of a satanic cult that invaded their home at the beginning of the film.Annabelle is a wonderful horror film. It doesn't rely on gore and CGI effects and let's the small things matter most. We get demons standing in plain sight which viewers have to catch out of the corner of the shot. And once you see the images it has major impact. There are some really good chase scenes between the demon and Mia throughout the apartment complex which were very well done. We don't see much of the doll moving around like Chucky would, and I'm really grateful for that. Less is more, and the things we don't see are sometimes scarier than the obvious in films like this.I really enjoyed Annabelle Willis' performance as Mia. She gave me some serious Dianna Agron vibes ala Glee and character Quinn Fabray. Willis had great chemistry with on-screen husband John played by Ward Horton who did an equally good job in this movie. Alfre Woodard was a nice addition to the cast as well with her supportive role of Evelyn, the neighbour who takes a liking to Mia.All in all, Annabelle is a pretty scary horror film that did very well at the box office for good reason.

But I'm getting ahead of myselflet's start with the story. A man buys a super creepy doll for his pregnant wife — she collects dolls, even ugly, creepy ones that would give Charles Manson nightmares — and then they get attacked by cultists. A female cultist named Annabelle is killed by the police, and her body is found cradling the creepy doll. Does the couple move out? Nope. Do they get rid of the doll that was cradled by the serial killer woman during her final moments? Nope. Do creepy, evil things start to happen soon after that? Yup! The clueless couple eventually accept that they are being haunted, and after befriending a woman (played by Alfre Woodard) who has some experience with the supernatural, they figure out what is haunting them, and why. How to stop the powerful, malevolent forcewell, that's not so easy.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Annabelle"" is the scene when Annabelle levitates, and the evil force that is making her rise is shown.""Annabelle"" is told with a leisurely pace — many would call it boring and slow, but I didn't mind it too much because it revealed much of the mindset of the female half of the couple, and that mindset is crucial to the finale. What I did have a problem with is that the scares were too few and far between; and the Woodard character did something at the end which I found to be out of character. Although there was a scene in the second act that was supposed to set up what Woodard did at the end, it still made no sense after I analyzed Woodard's words and actions. It just completely took me out of the movie and my mind was screaming ""Shenanigans!"" Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Annabelle
139,hoernkeem,"Annabelle (2014, John R. Leonetti) Demonic doll spun out from 'The Conjuring' has lackluster start",5,11 February 2021,"Annabelle (2014, John R. Leonetti)
As major franchises build massive extended universes to mixed success attempting to copy the Marvel mold that template is also being put to functional use at the mid-tier level as well. 'Annabelle' is the second movie in the mid-budget Conjuring universe. This film expands on the story first touched upon in 'The Conjuring' about the mysterious possessed doll we see securely locked in the Warren's Connecticut home in the 2013 film. For some unknown reason this film doesn't tackle the topic of how the doll came to end up in a glass case in a Connecticut home cum museum, but instead picks up the story in 1967 as a young, promising doctor purchases the doll for his wife who has a collection. Soon after mysterious things start happening such as a grisly murder next door. The young couple flees to L.A. in an attempt to start from scratch but with the demonic doll in tow things continue to spiral downward. The plot becomes pretty generic possession type fare at this point. About the only interesting thing in the whole story is the fact that the lead character is played by a woman named Annabelle. That's a mildly creep coincidence, right? Beyond that this movie is okay but in the realm of thrillers and horror you need to do much more than this pedestrian story to really make something good and memorable rather than what this film is which is bland and forgettable. While this film is entirely fictional many know that Annabelle is based on a real doll, however, that doll looks nothing like the doll in the movies, but for those who know what they are looking for you can see the original type of doll in the end scene as the camera pans around a secondhand store where Annabelle lies in wait to find more unsuspecting folks to torment. That was a nice little Easter egg. Beyond that there was nothing in this film that lives up to 'The Conjuring' lineage and this is just a basic throw away film and pretty much the definition of average.

The attack scene at the beginning was cool and there were some segments in the film that were genuinely creepy.
Here are the negatives. This has to be some of the worst editing I have ever seen. It does rapid cuts which make no sense story wise and makes some scenes linger way too long. The rest of the cast's acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. The father actor is either not trying or trying too hard. The character Evelyn is established halfway through the movie but she has no character and you can't get behind her. When she sacrifices herself at the end of the film, you don't feel for her because she has no character. The tone is really inconsistent and the cinematography is bland and boring. The camera work is also terrible. The type of camera they use changes every couple of scenes and it looks terrible. Overall, the plot does not work.
Annabelle provides a handful of creepy scenes with a good lead actress but fails in every other aspect of a good film and fails to do what The Conjuring did right.",Annabelle

147,MUFCOK,Had it's moments where risks could have been taken by the creators to make this a much better horror film,7,24 October 2014,"I am a fan of the horror movie genre. I often go into new horror films at the cinema never expecting too much but for some reason, even though I have seen countless crap horror films, I still go whenever a new one is out. I wasn't expecting too much from Annabelle, I hadn't seen any trailers, read any reviews and had seen very minimal advertising for this movie. All I knew, when I entered the cinema, was that it is a spin off to the Conjuring. I was a very big fan of the Conjuring and it is one of my favourite horrors in recent years.The film is set before the Conjuring and tells the story of how the doll Annabelle becomes possessed and how it effects its first owners lives. It starts with the doll moving around on its own, popping up in different places and slowly moves on to much more less subtle and more haunting things.Annabelle has a similar feel to the Conjuring and even the Insidious films. It has similar styles with similar music and builds its tension in a way that you sit there watching it thinking 'have I seen this before?' Now don't get me wrong, Annabelle won't win any Oscars, it is far, far from perfect but it does offer some good jumps, good scares and an average storyline which is decent enough for a 90+ minute horror flick.The problem with these films, which is a problem with most modern horrors, is that they are so clichéd that it becomes tedious and Déjà vu like. The tension builds, the nervy music begins the camera pans around and you are simply waiting and expecting something to happen. Nothing ever seems to be out of the box or unexpected. There are some ways that I believe this movie could have ended and the director could of took a few risks and took a different approach but once again the director opts for the easy way out and follows the clichés.The Acting also leaves a lot to be desired, the main leads are not very convincing, especially the character of John Gordon. The Character Evelyn is trying too hard to be mysterious and it carries on for so long that you lose interest and don't really care about this woman and her story. The script is not great and some of the dialogue is very questionable.Overall, Annabelle offers some good jumps and does its job well enough to warrant viewing it. I wouldn't say you should rush to the cinema for this one buy is certainly worth a watch when it comes out on DVD/Sky Movies.7/10",Annabelle

Halloween treat.",6,14 October 2014,"This is the supposed story behind the creepy doll within the glass case featured in last Halloween's superior haunted house thriller, ""The Conjuring"". Demonology experts, Ed and Lorraine Warren collect the cursed objects that inhabit or potentially exert demonic forces on their owners creating everything from hauntings to demonic possession. This film is its worthy prequel but lacks the overall intensity and coherency of its predecessor as well as any appearances from Ed or Lorraine Warren themselves. The stage is well set for a horror film as this takes place in the 1970's during the infamous Tate/LaBianca cult killings by the Charles Manson family which prompted homeowners to begin locking their doors at night due to the horrific crimes committed by satanic hippie cults in that time. Likable couple, Mia and John Gordon are expecting their newborn baby any day when a frightening experience stirs their happy home. Cult members attack them in their house, but are eventually brought down by police, and one of the cult members holds Mia's new doll in her arms. As time goes on the normal haunted house movie clichés and disturbances ensue, and sympathetic mother, Mia must battle the demonic forces at hand. This is ultimately a horror film depicting a poor new mother who seems to deal with a terrifying entity all on her own. Picture perfect husband is so positive, that he is oblivious to the problem that plagues his wife and newborn baby. Obviously the doll is a conduit for the evil presence that is after Mommy's soul and uses her love for her child to get it. Its a solid premise that is muddled and overachieved by inconsistencies and strange decision-making. Mia decides to get rid of the doll for its sheer creepiness, and after the doll mysteriously returns, she decides out of the blue that she wants to keep it? Actions like these are never fully explained, and a likable bookstore owner, Alfre Woodard, although an excellent character, she provides the final answer that makes the ending seem rushed and pretentious. Overall, after forgiving this film for its obvious flaws, on a good note, the doll is extremely creepy, the movie is packed to the brim with startling moments, a scary, black demon creature and good performances that create genuine tension and paranoia make this an average Halloween flick for 2014.

Annabelle pulls out the normal, clichéd stops, closing doors, rocking chair sound effect, child laughter, an oblivious husband, and, of course, an all knowing priest while adding nothing new to the genre. Nothing here felt surprising at all, it didn't even feel like it was well done either (unlike The Conjuring which was extremely clichéd as well, but so very well put together that it was good). As for the story, it just seems to make no sense why the family would continue to own that doll after it was found in the hands of a murderer and then suddenly reappears after being thrown out. Perhaps the biggest issue with the movie is that the doll itself just isn't effective enough or that we don't see enough of the demon using it as a conduit. Movies like Child's Play (where the doll had a personality and was unpredictable) seem to be more intense because the dolls are more of an actual character rather than a portal for the supernatural. I will leave you with this final thought, the 15 minutes or so that Annabelle is featured in The Conjuring are FAR more harrowing and chilling than the whole 90 minutes of Annabelle.",Annabelle

Following the horrific events, they start experiencing supernatural occurrences involving a doll owned by the couple. Let the horror begin or not. Annabelle is the clichéd example of bad horror movies. It is cheap in all respects, cheap acting, cheap story, and most of all cheap scares. Avoid this movie unless you want to fall asleep like a baby, which is obviously contradictory to this movie's objective.Full Review:For those who don't know, Annabelle is a prequel/spin-off from the movie The Conjuring directed by James Wan. The Conjuring was a great horror movie that kept me up at night, at least for a little while. So I was more than looking forward to Annabelle for a good scare this Halloween season. Instead I was hugely disappointed and felt I wasted my time.Usually with my reviews I start with the positives, so here they are: haunting creature's design is interesting, and oh there is this one other freaky scene. That's it, that's all I got.This movie was so bad that I felt like I was watching a parody of horror films. This movie could have been called Scary Movie 29 and it would've made more sense, but no, we have Annabelle. So let's talk about the acting shall we. Now for horror movies I don't need Oscar level acting, of course not. But they at least have to be functional enough to convey some kind of concern or fear. Instead the actors are more wooden than the doll we are supposed to be scared of. This brings me to the scariness of the film, or lack thereof. There are literally two scenes that were genuinely creepy and unique, but both of those combined comes to about a 1min in the total run time of the movie. The rest of the scares are all horror clichés like staring long at the doll with creepy music, or woman walks past a doorway, or now it's a little girl walking a past a doorway. Even the way they place the shots of the scenes are so obvious that you already looking at the spot you know the ""scare"" is supposed to come from.All in all this is just lazy filmmaking. It's as if they took a bucket, filled it every basic horror trick, and dumped it on the big screen. I have litmus test for the effectiveness of these movies: do I leave the lights on longer than I should before going to bed and/or do I need to watch some comedy show episodes. Annabelle fails on both, that's also considering I walked home alone in the dark because my bike was broken. So if you looking for a good scary movie or even good movie in general, avoid this at all costs.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Annabelle
155,leoxatzian,Falls way short of it's potential.,3,14 February 2020,"Instead of being even partially based on the supposed true story behind the titular doll, ""Annabelle"" chooses to create a completely fictional narrative all of it's own. While that isn't in any way a bad idea, what ends up hurting the movie is the undercooked, boring and somewhat uneventful direction in which it decides to take the story it makes for itself. At the end of it all however, a horror movie is mainly judged by just how scary it is and in the case of ""Annabelle"", with only the exception of a handful of moments, staring at the poster for a while will most likely be more unsettling and frightening that sitting through the actual movie.",Annabelle
156,CowherPowerForever,Before The Conjuring.......,5,3 October 2014,"Annabelle is a very simple horror film that follows the doll Annabelle from the film The Conjuring. While The Conjuring was a powerhouse of a film, Annabelle seems like a quick cash grab from the producers and studio. This film doesn't have the same feeling that directing icon James Wan brings to his horror films. While the film is not a total wash out, it might not be for everyone. The following is my review of Annabelle.The film was written by Gary Dauberman, who is only known for his much smaller direct to home video horror films. In Annabelle you can clearly tell Dauberman wasn't playing with a full deck of cards. The story follows Mia(Annabelle Wallis) and John(Ward Horton). This young married couple is about to welcome their first child into the world, when John brings Mia a gift. The gift is of course the doll. From this point onward things start to go haywire for Mia and her family. The priest comes in, and you have heard it all before. Nothing new or exciting at all. The film holds pretty well together for the most part, and moves by very quickly, meaning it doesn't really drag on it spots. While it clearly doesn't have the energy of a James Wan horror film, the pacing and characters work well overall. Of course characters as always in a horror film have to make questionable decisions but, that is to be expected. Overall Gary Dauberman gets a barely passable grade for this film.The film was directed by John R. Leonetti, who was the Cinematographer from The Conjuring. This is also the first major film he has directed in seventeen years. This film relies mostly on jump scares to get the audience into this. A seasoned horror fan like myself doesn't fall for that kind of gag. Other than the jump scares there is nothing that will make you scared of this film. For a film that takes place in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the film fits perfectly with nothing out of place, fine detail. That adds a great element to the film. The Conjuring takes the cake in that regard if you want to compare the two outings. The acting just over average. Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton work very well together, and the secondary actors fill other voids nicely. For a genre that mostly offers up awful acting, this film should be proud of delivering something that is not poor. At the end of the day this film is simply filler until the next Conjuring movie, and Leonetti took the paycheck as he knew it was going to be a giant success. Leonetti does a passable job with Annnabelle but, he is nowhere near the legend that is James Wan.The film was scored by Joseph Bishara, who not only scored The Conjuring, but also worked on the James Wan film Insidious and Insidious 2. The score in this film is not as good overall as The Conjuring but, Bishara still delivers some creepy music throughout the film to keep up the tension. So, overall Bishara completes this spin off film with flying colors.In closing, Annabelle at the end of the day is a horror film that is meant to fill time before The Conjuring 2 is released next year. Taking a character from that film and spinning into it's own film was smart by the producers but, it leaves an overall average feeling in my opinion. Fans of the genre will rush out to see this film on opening weekend, much like I did. Others who may not be that into this genre or maybe didn't enjoy The Conjuring should sit this one out. A home video rental or stream is the best bet overall in my opinion.5.4/10",Annabelle
157,ahegde3149,Don't have high expectations,4,13 January 2015,"The Conjuring was nice suspenseful horror by James Wan which worked well at different levels. Now we have Annabelle a prequel to it giving us the origin story of the possessed doll which was more of the side story in The Conjuring. So those who liked the first film will be excited about this one too. Unfortunately it falls short. I had very low expectations after seeing low ratings but it was pleasant surprise that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.The movie is a slow burner, so if the impatient ones might easily get bored with this. We have a standard couple Mia and John. Mia played by Annabelle Wallis (felt like intentionally cast for coincidence!!) and Ward Horton as John. Not so much great acting skills can be expected here, anyways they do a decent job for a horror film. Mia is pregnant and one day John gifts her a doll to add to her collection. No guesses which doll and we are all like ""no! what are you doing?! don't keep that!!"", lol. Well actually the doll isn't possessed yet, it was just another cute doll until one day a terrible incident occurs followed by more horrific encounters. Well that's where I will stop, it has short run time of about 100 minutes and there not much of story. It is actually great that they didn't drag it much.Directed by John Leonetti who was cinematographer with James Wan for The Conjuring, there are many nice shots and couple of jump scares for those enjoy it. I also kind of liked they kept the pacing slow, which built up tension and suspense steadily and gradually. Well most of it is what we already scene in many horror flicks. But original horror films are so rare these years. Even with recycled material, the film worked for me as it looked technically sound for such a low budget film. It was good old school horror with not much CGI gore and stuff. The scene where Mia gets stuck in elevator in the basement was really scary and my favorite from the film. There are many more scares which I did not see coming and were quite unpredictable. The background score almost similar to The Conjuring again generates the scary tone required thus works effectively.Overall, I had a good time even if it was just an average movie at best. The weak point was the script, which I wish was better written. Also director doesn't try anything new and innovative for which there definitely potential. Still, Annabelle works just fine for horror genre as it does have enough amount tension getting built up plus scary moments making it worth a shot.RATING: [2.5/5]",Annabelle
158,hfreinoso,Awful... Horrendus,1,2 November 2018,"WOW... Disgrace to James Wan. The acting and directing is bad in a very bad way. In the conjuring, she was terrifying AF. But in this film it's just laughable.
I expected more from this film. 1/10 at best.",Annabelle
159,jacklmauro,Fair But Promise Wasted,6,23 January 2015,"Yes, the doll is just creepy as hell. Yes, the performances are fine, and it's always a joy to see Alfre Woodard. And, yes, there is some outstanding Wan-like directorial technique. As in: the early attack scene framed through a background window, and precisely the right number of seconds of the camera fixed on Annabelle. What goes wrong is basic logic. Sorry, but it just kills me when this is sacrificed. C'mon, now - the husband merely accepts that the doll he threw into the outdoor trashcan is now in a box, sent over with the others? The wife's remark that there was confusion because of the fire...no. The house didn't burn down and it's a stretch to believe that a neighbor or fireman found the doll (somehow) in the garbage and made those efforts. I realize it's a minor point, but these are the lapses that greatly weaken a horror film. Then, one has to chuckle at a priest who, believing in A as a demonic instrument, blithely chucks her in the back seat. Worse, though, is the 'chase scene' aspect to the final thrust. It's not that it doesn't work; it's that the road is just too, too familiar. I also had a problem with Woodard's sacrifice. That is, I don't quite get that her reason to live, as revealed by her daughter's loving spirit, is to present her soul to the DEVIL. Too bad. A creepy doll flick deserves better.",Annabelle
160,politehere,Definitely One of the Best-Looking Horror Movies around But..,5,13 January 2015,"Annabelle had great looks to it. I enjoyed the colors, attractive / handsome characters, and the general atmosphere of the movie; however, like most modern horror movies I didn't find it all that scary. In fact, half of the time I was yawning and couldn't care less about what happened to any of the characters. I've seen way too many horror movies to be scared by something like this. I was startled twice, but none of the scenes that were supposed to send chills down my spine worked for me. I liked this movie more than The Conjuring because of the bright colors used in Annabelle. The Conjuring, although very well-acted, is one of the most clichéd and boring movies I have ever stumbled upon. I know most people will disagree, but it had nothing new to offer other than the same old stuff we had seen in dozens of other Exorcism movies. Now I don't want to bash the Conjuring in this review, but I can't help it, because Annabelle has tried to follow the same pattern as the Conjuring, and as such it seemed like a rip off, although the Conjuring was really nothing but a rip off of dozens of similar Exorcism movies from the past. In my opinion, Annabelle is a good way of killing time, but if like me you've seen too many horror movies, don't expect to be frightened by it.",Annabelle
161,tstudstrup,"Barbie and Ken make a ""horror""-movie",1,23 October 2017,"Seriously, the young couple look like Barbie and Ken dolls. He's handsome and boring and she's pretty and boring. And so is this so called horror movie.Apart from the movie itself, being boring and predictable, the couple act moronically throughout the movie.1: why would anybody want a creepy doll like Annabell in the first place, aside from adding it to a creepy doll collection? 2 why would a young attractive woman in her twenties own a creepy doll collection? That's something an old lady who has lived alone would own. That or 20 cats 3: after they move to an apartment after the first hauntings, the doll is in a moving-box even though Ken threw it away. And Barbie is not freaked out by this at all and decides to keep the doll?? 4: after Barbie and Ken and the cliché-priest finds out that the doll is possessed by a demon, they don't destroy the doll, which would probably destroy the demon as well. No Barbie throws it around and yells at it. And the priest takes the doll with him to his church where he is almost killed by the demon.5: as for the exercising couple that is not even in the movie, they're boring as well.The Conjuring movies suck!!And a franchise about that couple just don't work.6: the exercising couple keep the doll in a glass box to keep the demon trapped. Again, destroy the doll and destroy the demon.7: why did this movie get an R-rating? There is no blood in it, no nudity, no swearing. And it's not even scary. It feels like a low budget made for TV horror movie. Apart from a few creepy scenes and only one good scare, this movie isn't worth watching. If you like horror movies with dolls and those movies certainly can be creepy, I recommend Dead Silence. Directed by James Wan that produced and uncredited co-directed this garbage.",Annabelle

The story of the doll how did it become the famous Annabelle we all know now.It started good those scary scenes were hitting the right notes then I felt they tried to make it extremely scary but turned out to be funny. There were some scenes which made me realize that this movie is being rushed just to make up something for the viewers. This movie made the conjuring doll a joke. I felt the leading actress did a really bad job as she literally had no fear on her face. The ending was so dumb they tried to make it unpredictable but utter rubbish. If you have watched the trailer of this movie then u have watched the whole movie cause those are the scary elements you have to see in the whole movie.

164,hotrobinproductions,Conjuringverse review #2 (read my others),4,1 July 2019,"Oh god, after watching the conjuring I was going into this movie not expecting what the magic that movie pulled off... but I sure as hell was expecting at least a movie with something to bring to the table. This film is very boring, dull and uninteresting. The beginning is ehh. Once things go crazy in the beginning it was pretty thrilling but after that it's just a huge mixed bag with overall bad qualities, literally so many of the horror this film tries so hard to rely on is closeup shots of Annabelle with the music then it cuts. It's annoying and overtime it gets tiring and very repetitive. This film has one of the most dumbest third acts I've seen in a horror movie. Third acts can make or break the film. This film was already broken from the start but it fell even harder. Dialogue was bad so many things were bad. There's a scene in the basement that I found pretty thrilling but other than that this movie is dog crapActing 7/10

165,Beard_Of_Serpico,"Garbage, don't bother.",1,22 February 2020,"I was seeing a girl at the time who loves horror movies and she wanted to go see this movie at the cinema. Not being a big fan of horror movies i wasn't too excited about it. I love movies like The Thing and the original Fright NIght but i knew Annabelle would be garbage, i mean just look at it.A guy buys his doll collecting wife a doll which looks like a creepy horror movie doll and she never comments on how gross it looks, she's delighted like ""Oh my god thanks i love you!"" it's so ridiculous and unintentionally funny. Soon after that scary things start happening to them.
The wife is a typical dumb horror movie character and much of the movie consists of scenes of her alone in the house hearing a noise and then going to check it out only to be frightened by a jump scare (The lights in the house don't work because of course they don't). This happens multiple times throughout the movie. There is one legit creepy scene involving a demon in a dark room but other than that it's pretty pointless and bad.This is typical B horror trash which is cheap to make but for whatever reason people flock to see it in the cinema so it makes a ton of money.
Because this was cheap to make and it made money there's now sequels.

166,andreascaloni,OK,6,21 April 2021,"Annabelle is a prequel to 2013's The Conjuring and the second installment in the Conjuring Universe franchise. The film was inspired by a story of a doll named Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren. The movie isn't as good as i was expecting due to some bad acting, a mostly bad final act and it's visually flat. However it has a great, full of tension and well directed scene in the middle of the film, and a solid and entertaining first half. It isn't very scary or remarkable but it's still an entertaining ride.Rating: 6.",Annabelle
167,alexcomputerkid,Annabelle is a big disappointment,3,27 October 2014,"Every once in awhile a horror film uses a doll and it comes in all different ways. The classics like Poltergeist or the 2013 The Conjuring used it as as an element and not as a main plot device. The first type of doll movie that used a doll as a main character was Magic, a ventriloquist with a young Anthony Hopkins as the magician. It was in the 80's with the first Child's Play that changed the doll concept somewhat. Yes, he was another killer but the doll named Chucky was so revolutionary because he was a character and was actually given something to do. Due to the fact he was a children's doll, this made him even more creepy. Following after Chucky, there were similar dolls films like the Puppet Master series or Dolly Dearest which were clear inspirations for those to follow. Horror director James Wan is famous for following the trend of dolls in the 2000's with the torture film Saw, Dead Silence and of course The Conjuring. The doll concept is one that is hit or miss in films ultimately . Based off the The Conjuring doll Annabelle, Annabelle is a prequel to The Conjuring and showcases the doll before the events of The Conjuring. Set in 1967, the couple of Mia Form (Annabelle Wallis) and John Form (Ward Horton) are expecting their first child together. John gives Mia a doll she has been looking for as a pre-baby present and for the nursery that has been set up for her. You could definitely say that Mia is fan of dolls as the room is essentially a nursery filled with close to a dozen dolls. After a vicious attack at the house by people from a cult, the doll eventually becomes possessed from the cult member Annabel Higgins. The possessed doll is then ready to kill.Being that The Conjuring was set in the 70's, it makes total sense as to why this film was set in the 60's. From the style including cars, houses, hospital and even showing an interesting clip of Maryland Manson, a infamous killer during this time, all of these are all examples of the 60's timeline being used. At the same time, the 60's aspect makes this film seem so silly. When is the last time you ever heard of woman during pregnancy on bed rest by a doctor? It is also so cheesy watching a couple trying to get reception on an old television. The baby is in an old baby carriage makes which me really question if this is stealing from the classic Rosemary's Baby. Annabelle ultimately along the way is a horror film where we should care about the characters. The couple surely is likable and going through the exact opposite of what they should be going through when trying to have a baby. The couple are too simple in substance though and really I didn't feel much sympathy for them unfortunately. The local book store owner Evelyn (Alfre Woodard) plays an original character which by the last act turns into a very predictable character and meets a very cheesy ending. If we boil it down to just one thing, the biggest problem with the film just might be the doll itself. The doll does have an interesting look and feel with its design and color. That said, we are never given an explanation of what makes this doll so special and why the mother thinks it is so. For the most part, this doll is sitting around in the background of scenes and really if we didn't know, this doll could be looked at as just a random doll in background shots. Not in any shape or form does this doll provide any types of scares. Not even small jump scenes.In the end, Annabelle is a big disappointment. The Conjuring was a film that was just asking for us to have this prequel because that movie made the doll so intriguing. We weren't asking for this type of prequel though as this movie is very boring, choppy, and lacks ideas. Annabelle is a film that will go down as one of the biggest misses in horror in quite some time. In the end, Annabelle is a big disappointment.

168,dineshaishu,Annabelle,6,27 May 2019,"As a prequel and spin-off of The Conjuring - 2013's highly effective horror film - Annabelle does what it promises, even if it does so one jump and one jolt at a time. But that's all you get, jumpy scenes done to perfection, with little or no atmosphere and a story that disintegrates before it reaches a satisfying conclusion.One of the most important aspects of The Conjuring and older sibling Insidious (both films directed by James Wan), is the cinematography and how it wreaks havoc with the viewer's peripheral vision. By this I am referring to events occurring off-center, or in some corner of the screen that is oblivious to on-screen characters but very obvious to the viewer. Consider a scene where a mother watches over her new born baby. The scene is shot in the living room where the right half of the frame is composed of the mother and her baby and the left half is a hallway that leads to other rooms in the house. Without shifting focus from the mother and child, we see something or someone lurking in the hallway behind; something that shouldn't be there in the first place. While this tactic is nothing new to horror-thrillers, it works for the whole purpose of inducing dread, thick and slow, before the actual jolt hits a few seconds later. The scariest scenes in Annabelle are made up of these moments, and at times we are left guessing what lurks in the corners. And is probably why cinematographer John R Leonetti of those preceding films is tasked with directorial duties in this film, while Wan himself is bumped up to producer. Leonetti plays it safe by treading down Wan's beaten path but without any surprises of his own.Playing the aforementioned mother is Annabelle Wallis (freaky coincidence?) as Mia Gordon. Mia has a doll collection, one of which is the titular vintage doll gifted by her medical student husband John (Ward Horton). After surviving a horrific attack from a satanic cult, the Gordons have new guests that won't leave. At first Mia starts seeing things and becomes increasingly paralysed by fear while John begins to doubt her sanity. It's a stock approach to crying wolf in horror movies. It takes a while to dawn on them that something has latched on to Annabelle, making the doll a conduit with increasing intent on harming them and their new born baby. Consultations with a librarian and a priest reveal far greater implications, thus leaving these young parents to ward off hell by going right through it.On one hand, the look and feel in this film is a copy-paste version of Insidious, but concentrated with sporadic moments of numbing fright. We've seen it before in classic horror films - young parents who must literally go through hell to save their child's soul. It's the same concept here but effective enough for a low budget horror film. Like a stern disciple, Leonetti is on par with Wan's technical approach. Cinematography, hair raising sound design (including deliberate moments without sound), and some decent tension will garner a few screams from the audience, but that's about it. On the downside, there isn't much of a story for a script based on real events and don't even expect anything along the lines of an animated 'Çhucky' doll. It's not about what the doll can do but about what's in the doll -If only they had built on that frame of thought. After some well-timed jump scares in the first half, all we are left with is a murky conclusion owing to underwritten supporting cast members whose inclusion leaves the ending stale and cheap.",Annabelle

I try to the review the ones that stick out in my head for some reason mostly because they were either really good or really bad. This is one of the ones that stick out for the latter reason. I saw a documentary on the real Annabelle which this movie is loosely based on. Watch that instead. It's more educational, factual, interesting and actually creepier. It's also shorter. A full length film should not have been made about this. It's loosely connected to The Conjuring as a prequel I guess. I don't know. I got lost somewhere either because the story was convoluted order I didn't care so much that I zoned out. I guess there was a real supposedly haunted doll named Annabelle and the legend is actually pretty creepy. I remember I saw this and Ouija together. What a disappointing night and I really like horror movies, so I usually go easier on them. I am tired of PG13 horror movies.

The start was like watching some kind of soap opera but in a good way letting the audience build a connection with the characters especially Mia played by Annabelle Wallis (strange name coincidence there)who played a strong part I thought.The Doll was very spooky looking but the best part for me without spoiling anything was the scene with the doll next to the window with bright sunlight streaming in and the doll raised into the air (look in the background - very scary and well done) On the whole a good movie and in my opinion leagues ahead the Babadook which is getting loads of praise from movie critics.

I also loved the 70s vibe, and the lead actress Annabelle Wallis playing Mia was also excellent.the movie had its shares of scares, jump out of your seat surprises but nothing over the top, it might not be as scary as people might be expecting and hence some of the negative reviews here from other users.

The movie is also pretty cliché' and falls into a typical cheap haunted house trick with nothing surprising or genuinely scary here.

It uses the same tactic to lure the audience to check in the cinema - the success of previous film; but once it is presented on the big screen, it is just a meaningless effort from a lazy screenwriters who combine the idea in Paranormal Activity and other horror genre. Most of the eerie and scary scenes are already in the trailer and the lack of creativity in the plot prove that the studio is trying to make fast money, without realising that the film has a bigger potential to follow the success of The Conjuring by taking more time to think of a better story for the doll. Although the ending actually links to The Conjuring, it is just a wasting time film that anyone who gets into the cinema just to be frightened by the scores composed, and soon realise that it is much better to spend time rewatching Child Play at home.",Annabelle

180,Clintekabor,I like your dolls,7,29 December 2020,"Annabelle is a compelling horror film that has a well paced story and is effective and honest with it's suspense and jump scares that will keep you on edge and hooked until the very end.When I found out that the Annabelle story was loosely based off true events it made the film even more appealing to me.One of the early sequences involve members of a satanic cult who break in and attack John and Mia in their Santa Monica home immediately after slaughtering their next door neighbours in cold blood and it was filmed with such potency that it felt so oddly realistic. It immediately grabs your attention and from this point on you feel heavily immersed in the story.The demon in Annabelle was intimidating and fascinating. A dark entity with gargoyle facial features and ram horns curving around it's head. I absolutely loved the scene about halfway through the film with the storage lockers and it's here where we get our first real glimpse of the demon.An absolutely terrified Mia after coming into physical contact with the entity rushes to the elevator only to realise that while the doors shut it just won't go up to her level and every time the doors open again she is still on the same floor. Each time the doors reopen you expect to see the demon coming towards her or that it will suddenly appear in the darkness. Finally Mia is forced to get out of the elevator and make a run for the stairwell. The camera angles are hiding both our and Mia's peripheral vision in this scene and so it does a tremendous job of keeping your mind guessing.The sequence looks dark and frightening and you feel trapped and fearful for Mia, and can't help but put yourself in her shoes and realise how vulnerable she is in this situation and that there is almost nothing else she can do.It was thrilling to see Annabelle doll jerk from the floor and then suddenly come to life only for us to see past the deception and to the demon holding Annabelle up from behind like a puppet. The scene shows that the demon has attached itself to the doll like a conduit which makes you feel such a force of power from the entity's presence.Only a couple of negatives for me was the more times you see the demon the more you are desensitised to it which takes away it's frightening appeal. Secondly as the plot goes on it starts becoming a little predictable. There is not much that completely stuns you, and the ending doesn't really thrill you as something you are likely to remember after the film ends.This is a reasonable scary story that is unique in its own way. I got more than I expected with Annabelle and the cinematography was amazing. I'm also a big fan of James Wan's work and what he does with his films so if I see his name in any production then I won't hesitate to put that film on my watch list.7/10",Annabelle
181,FluffyPantsReviews,Unpopular opinion- I love this movie,7,17 July 2019,Probably my least favorite of the 3 but I actually love this movie. Why do people hate this movie with a passion? They say that it is not that scary but it has one of the most terrifying jump scares I have ever seen when the demon jumps down from the ceiling. Also the sequence down in the storage facility at the apartments is so scary.,Annabelle
182,Chiller7,A weak entry in the Conjuring series,6,30 September 2017,"I've been on a Conjuring series binge recently. I enjoyed Conjuring 1 & 2 and rated them both 10/10. This spin off, Annabelle, however... unfortunately this one was kinda weak, not in the same class as the other two. Now I'm just hoping the sequel, Annabelle: Creation, will be an improvement.Something about this one just didn't work that well. I guess, one problem would be that the scares seemed over-reliant on some of the same repeated tricks: flickering lights, or some machine turning on when no one's around, or sounds of a baby crying, or something appearing in the room behind a character. The movie repeated these tricks so often that throughout the movie I actually found myself constantly correctly guessing what kind of trick is going to be coming next.And everything felt a little too static. In other words, motionless, if you know what I mean. The premise does revolve around a doll, of course, but for too much of the time in this movie, the scares are supposed to be coming from nothing that's visibly moving on screen and that just ends up kind of unexciting.There was also a problem with some underdeveloped characters and potential plot lines that go nowhere: The kids on the stairs, the noisy upstairs neighbors, the bookstore owner whose occult connections were barely explained, etc.I should end with some positive though. Annabelle Wallis is pretty good at acting scared and has no hint of her real-life English accent when she speaks, so let's all applaud her acting talents.And the best moment in the movie involved a child running towards a closing door. I won't say anymore, except that it was a great scene and I'm really astonished that they managed to achieve that shot, however they did it.",Annabelle

184,j-madej,"""Annabel"" is not as quite awful as ""Chucky"" but it could have been so much better.",6,2 October 2014,"Do you know that feeling when you are watching a movie that is full of elements or pieces that are not only inspired by other films we've seen in the past, but are evident rip off of concepts, scenes and characters that you've seen before done in much better way. This is what you will feel watching the newest horror film ""Annabelle"" from director John R. Leonetti who was an actual director of photography on excellent ""Insidious"" movies as well as ""The Conjuring"" which was't bad in it's own right. His other directing credits were far from A- list and this is what we feel watching his newest directorial attempt. There is a strong feel of inspiration from Roman Polanski horror masterpiece the ""Rosemary's Baby"" in fact the main female lead is called Mia (Annabelle Wallis) same as Mia Farrow an actress in the original ""Rosemary's Baby"" playing the titled Rosemary Woodhouse who suspects that her baby is in danger from the satanic cult that wants it to become a Devil reincarnate. Leonetti sets up the story in 1968 just after the Manson Family murders of Sharon Tate and LaBianca which shock America to it's core and forever change the collective feeling of innocence and safety created in post war America. The lead characters are a young couple who are expecting a baby. They are being witnesses to horrendous crime committed next door which eventually drags them down into conflict with Satanic Cult which is trying to summon the demons. As the attackers move on onto the next target, they are being stopped by the Police and one of them commits suicide and her evil soul enters a creepy looking doll Annabel which was a present form a young doctor John (Ward Horton) to his wife (Annabelle Wallis) and his unborn daughter. Fast forward few months ahead and this young family is living in the new home and go figure the evil followed them there attaching itself to the doll. They try to get ride of the doll but is it not too late to be saved...? Reading this you must admit that ""Annabelle"" sounds like a many other movies put together and not even James Wan (super talented original director of ""Insidious"" and ""SAW"" movies) as a producer was enough to make this film a cult classic. All things considered at least the acting was good starting from very lovely Annabelle Wallis who displayed a sense of confusion and fright that was deeply felt by the audience. Her doctor husband played by Ward Horton had that 1960 old movie star look and delivered believable characterization as a husband who as a doctor does not fully believe his wife until it is too late. All the other supporting cast did well. I must say there are some scary moments in ""Annabelle"" but the cinematography often looks digital breaking the believability factor which is a must, for the full experience in horror film. You can hear that ""Annabelle's"" sound and music design was heavily inspired by ""Insidious"" which in itself if a very good thing because for those who understand filmmaking, great sound and music design is a half of the success in horror. Sadly the other more visual half did not deliver as well as we hoped for. ""Annabel"" is not as quite awful as ""Chucky"" but it could have been so much better.For more of my film reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Annabelle
185,jenniferlynn-49555,Disappointing,2,30 September 2018,"Catching up on the franchise before we watch the Nun. I actually forgot that I had already seen this. Truly, I thought wow, how'd I miss that. Started watching it and it all came back. I found myself making jokes outloud instead of being ""scared"". Like when the boring wife hears the sewing machine and comes around the corner, I said watch Annabelle is making something. 
How about, I can't live in that house anymore, so instantly move into an apt that is 3 times the size of the house before. Yeah I'd be happy too. 
Oh you threw away that creepy doll and now it's somehow in the moving box in our new place? I know, it's perfect overlooking the crib. You see the scary cult lady, that killed herself in your tiny house, while holding that creepy doll... it's not a bad idea to leave the baby alone while you go down to the buildings basement to recycle a box. 
The scariest part in the movie was watching that poor adorable baby have books falling all around her. Honestly it was pretty bad. Like someone else said, the movie is the demon playing with a doll instead of the possessed doll we all came to see.",Annabelle
186,brailsford,Well it got one detail write. The Doll was possessed,1,7 June 2015,"That said after that point, it went in a laughably dumb direction so filled with clichés and and stupid lines it was about as memorable as being chloroformed.I saw the conjuring which did a pretty good job staying true to the source material (a little Hollywood glamorizing, but my biggest beef with the movie was that ed did the exorcism and the new look of Annabelle)For whatever reason the movie became about a baby and a mother and other stuff (I mean yeah they had to do that cause movies about bad things happening to teenage friends would never work as a horror movie) The movie effectively is so boring recounting any line is next to impossible. The most memorable scenes involve jumpscare porn. I mean record players turning on, shadowy figures running around and jiffy pop catching fire (40 years of horror and we still resort to jiffy pop catching fire in horror?)It amazes me how little the writer put into learning the real story or just how little they felt was worth adapting as the true story actually wasn't so bloody boring. Don't waste your money, or the time if its on cable.",Annabelle

188,Amityville15,Not scary...,5,12 November 2014,"A couple expecting the birth of their first child are violently attacked just minutes after the culprits murdered their next door neighbours. When the police burst in and shoot the culprits dead, the blood from the bullet wound of one of the murderers is transfered into a doll. Sometime after the attack, the doll returns to take the soul of their new born baby.This film starred: Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton & Tony Amendola.Annabelle was released in 2014 and is a spin-off to The Conjuring. In my opinion this is a poor film, I didn't find it scary and in fact quite boring. There was a couple of chilling scenes like the basement elevator scene but nothing to rival the scary scenes in the conjuring. I don't recommend this film because chances are you will be left disappointed by this film. **/***** Poor.",Annabelle
189,livin_the_weekend,"Creepy doll, predictable film",6,26 October 2019,"*NON-SPOILER*There have been plenty over the years and horror films that are based around a doll/dolls are always going to be creepy. The thought of something that is made to be a child's play toy being possessed, (when it resembles a small human) is definitely hair raising. The storyline is clearly well thought through and it does work, it just isn't the most enthralling. Definitely worth a watch but it doesn't stand out.",Annabelle

Actually the whole genre is getting annoying to me now.So as always you get the disbelieving one (there's always one in every movie) and this movie is the husband. Was his name John? I think it was as it was constantly ""John can you do this"" ""John why you not at home?"" ""John John John""...everything she said to him it had to be her 'overreacting' or 'imagining' things...zzzOn the flipside she seemed such a difficult woman to be with like the husband couldn't do anything right. Ugh",Annabelle
191,CrisMovieCorner,Chuckys awful sister!,2,27 October 2014,"When I heard that ""The Conjuring"" was getting a sequel based on the unbelievably disturbing ""real"" story of the Annabelle doll I was so pumped! Not only am I a HUGE lover of the Horror genre, I am also a pretty keen follower of the ""real"" paranormal (not to say I am a believer, just a very keen enthusiast of the subject). The doll still sits today in the museum started by The Warrens, how messed up is that a museum dedicated to the most sinister paranormal objects in the world, I'd LOVE to visit it one day!Opening up with the same scene in which ""The Conjuring"" did, two young women and a young man are telling Ed and Lorraine Warren about their experiences with what they believe to be a haunted doll they call Annabelle. Cut back a year and we are now with John (Horton) and Mia (Wallis) who are expecting their first child, John gives his wife a doll that she has been searching for, for a long time.As Mia closes in on her dude date, something unbelievably horrific happens, a couple/pair of Satanic cultists break into their home attacking Mia and stabbing her in the stomach, both cultists end up dying in the house. The female cultist named Annabelle Higgins dies with the aforementioned doll in her hands he blood lands on doll starting what will be the worst experience of the young couples lives. A short time passes and Mia is now seeing shadows, shadowy figures, hearing noises resulting in her horrible realisation that something evil is after her new born baby.Overall, the film was a complete and utter let down, if ANY Horror writers/directors see this read this line carefully; !!!LOUD NOISES ARE NOT HOW JUMP SCARES WORK!!! Lazy film making at its best, making watchers wince through using loud noises is NOT how Horror works, it NEVER has been, ANYBODY could make a film in that way an call it Horror. The scenes do make you jump, not through fear of the film, just shock in the boom as you do when you wake a sleeping person with a bang.The main problem is James Wan when creating the film that spawned this sequel ""The Conjuring"" (review coming in the next couple of days) created a beautifully made Horror that felt like it took place in the 70s. Unfortunately, John Leonetti fell on his face in this aspect, he just robbed tropes and elements from 60s & 70s Horror. He fell into the trap that lots of modern Horror directors do, just paying homage to the greats does not add to your film, if anything it takes away from your film leaving the fans with a sense of let down. There is an over use of panning reveals (if you are not familiar is panning through a room an passing a door/window to reveal something in the background) it happens so many times that you feel no suspense watching them.All ""Annabelle"" truly offers is the chance to wince four or five times through sheer ear pain, none of the scenes will built any tension for the viewer, they try to build up but fall flat on their face. Unlike ""The Conjuring"" which builds scene to the point in which you feel the tension, this film is a misguided idea of how to rob a genre by using ""jump scares"" to bring in a younger/inexperienced audience who know no better due to the massive decline in modern Horror. Most fans of the genre will be sitting there twiddling their thumbs waiting for the film to actually end, and may I add I did not they needed to redesign the look of Annabelle I personally find the doll much creepier, I get why they did it though, the fear of porcelain dolls is a mass fear. The film itself is really not the only problem, Wallis and Horton are boring throughout, Wallis mumbles most of her lines and you struggle to truly grasp what she is feeling while Horton is the opposite his overly emotion acting feels forced. There is one scene that was done pretty well, which is the only reason the film didn't get a zero or a one star rating, that is the basement/storage unit scene, I can highly recommend you check that scene out on maybe YouTube or something. Other than that, I highly recommend you get your evil doll Horror fix from ""Child's Play"" (1988), ""Dead Silence"" (2007, which was director by producer of this film James Wan) or ""Dolls"" (1987).",Annabelle
192,sforrester-3,Bog standard horror fare,6,19 October 2014,"I didn't absolutely hate this film, nor did I love it and probably in a couple of days I'll have completely forgotten I watched it. The acting was solid, I liked the period the film was set in and there were a couple of good suspense moments involving a sewing machine.Now, that was the good news, the rest of my review will be less than positive I'm afraid. As with many horrors these days, it seems to have been written using a standard horror film app. I can actually imagine them ticking boxes...satanic cult, check...creepy doll that no-one in their right mind would ever buy, check...wise priest who instantly believes aforementioned doll is possessed without question, check...handy neighbour with knowledge of the occult and who is willing to sacrifice themselves for someone they've known for two minutes, check.That is basically my whole issue with this film, there was nothing to make it stand out. With Alfre Woodard's character Evelyn, it felt as though she was shoehorned in so the heroine had a way out of dying. The doll, when purchased, was like Chucky after the third or fourth film. If you are going to have a doll in a film, at least at the beginning, it has to look normal. I don't even want to start on the ending.Overall, if you are seeing it for free it'll pass the time but I personally wouldn't even rent it.",Annabelle
193,cornflakeboy20,Creepy Victorian Doll: the movie,5,1 October 2014,"In the first, rather scary, scene in the Conjuring, featuring the Annabelle doll, I wondered, what kind of woman would ever buy a doll that creepy looking? Apparently no one. Since the real Annabelle was in fact a simple Raggedy Ann doll. This movie purports to tell the whole story behind the doll, almost none of which conforms with reality (meaning the ""true"" story as it was given to and told by the Warrens). We meet a bland, prosaic young couple about to have a child. The wife has a doll collection decorating the child's room (Before she knows if it's a girl or boy), and the husband buys her the Annabelle doll, which is supposedly an expensive collector's item meant to match two similar dolls. Following an attack by two cult members who lived next door, the Annabelle doll becomes possessed, doing usual ghost things like operating a sewing machine, and record player. Later, she seemingly tries to kill the baby in its womb, contradicting the later explanation that the doll is a demon host looking for an innocent soul. Luckily, a kindly mystical black woman owns a nearby bookstore with a well-stocked occult section. The wife and her friend discover the name of the cult to which the neighbors belonged, but use absolutely none of the information to defeat the doll. In fact, there are many threads that dangle and go nowhere. We meet two children who seemingly draw pictures of the baby being hit by a truck, and then the children are never seen again, and bear no relevance to the plot. The fact that the mystic new age black woman is willing to go to any length to protect this bland white family may strike some as offensive, especially since it appears nowhere in the actual story. Like most films of this nature, it is practically an advertisement for the Catholic Church and Christian religion in general. The Warrens also investigated the Amityville story, whose victims were also Catholic, and the book featured an introduction by a Catholic priest. Essentially, these stories say, for better or worse, that Catholics are the religion feared by the devil, and the only ones capable of eliminating supernatural threats from demons. The Warrens, in fact, keep the doll in a case protected with a cross, and blessed by a priest. As for the movie itself, it features a couple good jump scares. There are a couple scenes strongly reminiscent of Japanese horror (Dark Water and the Grudge especially). I've seen this type of movie done better and much worse. I have no idea why the R rating, except possibly the religious iconography and injury to a priest and pregnant woman. But honestly, this could play on television barely edited, if at all. You can definitely wait for this title on video.",Annabelle

195,pzct,Annabelle 1st movie is solid to me,7,28 November 2020,"Apart from what people say
I honestly didnt really see much problem with this film. It was creepy and creative with its scares. It was a solid film overallPros:Creative Scares - To be honest, one of the things I love about supernatural horror movies is when they get creative with its scares. Such as the scene where the mother was in one room staring at a little girl in the room in front of her. She began running towards the room as the door closed. Once the door closed her out of frame fully, she burst through the door as a grown women. So really, creative scarsAtmosphere - I was on edge because I didn't really know what was going to happen. The mother wasnt safe where she went. Even out in public where she saw a women holding her baby. So the atmosphere was chillingCons -Mother's Decisions - I'm not sure but I feel like the mother has made some dumb decisions in the film. I felt like she did but that's probably just meThe priest is hurt...how? -
I'm dead honest the priest went up to the church, the doors open and he was literally pushed backwards. And For some reason it ended him up in the hospital. Literally he was pushed backwards onto the ground XD
Like what?And the ending of Annabelle Creation left me confused for this movie beginning. She successfully got the soul but in this film, she targets the baby/mother soul. I was confused on why she neded another soul. Maybe she wants to stay young so she transitions between souls?Overall
I didnt really think this film was terrible
Just solid at best",Annabelle

I'm also a fan of the new wave of horror. I'm a fan of the Conjuring as it was a film that made me think the art of a horror movie is back. First off... this isn't made by James Wan... it's made by it's filmographer so off of the bat you're probably going to get some cool scenes but perhaps lack of character development. The budget of Annabelle is $5 million (that's 1/4 of what the Conjuring cost). Let me tell you the script is the weakest part of this film.The movie starts off slow... this is where the film should really get you into the characters but there isn't much here, it's generic. It's the weakest part of the film. You have your standard couple... man goes to work, woman stays home and experiences weird stuff. The problem with this is that it's hard for you to bother to relate to the characters. This kind of kills the film for me. There were actually a lot that could have been explored but they didn't touch like the kids in the apartment.Now the good. There is very little CGI - perhaps none. It's all old school. This is something that anyone could actually film.... chair moving, oven is on, someone standing there. It's good. It works. There's a great scene here with a baby. Are there enough scares? Not really. The pay off for the film felt like they might have fixed the movie for censors but even though the film is Rated R.There's a lot missing in this film. It's not horrible. It's worth a rental. It's your average horror movie.",Annabelle

So when I heard they were doing a movie on Annabelle my first thought was they were gonna do the original story with the two girls, but instead I got a film with two characters I'm not even sure existed.First of all the film does have a creepy vibe to it, which is always a good thing in a horror film, something a lot of them lack. The doll itself, even though it looks nothing like the actual doll, is creepy (if not a little too cliché). The atmosphere of fear the doll pours out makes the scares all the more jumpy. I jumped several times in fact.What I wasn't too keen on was the Insidious demon like creature you see throughout the film. I thought it took away from the creepiness and gave it less mystery and more showy.Other than a few flaws it is a pretty decent film, but nothing as good The Conjuring by any means.",Annabelle

But what I found was a horror movie which became a victim of its own success. The hype created around its making was not completely satisfied as the best scenes were revealed in the teasers and trailers and some of other horror elements turned out to be, for the lack of better word, predictable (like injury from a sewing machine, baby being the centre plot and some more).But I am not going to deny, yes the movie did have some of its own horror elements (the carpet-moment, noises-on-top moment) but they were just not enough to satisfy the thirst. Lack of too many characters, lack of an in-depth into the cult mentioned, lack of in- depth about the said demon, presence of demon in very few frames all let to an ending which felt more like abrupt than like an end. If anything the popcorns jerked inside the tub but none of it overflew while for ""the conjuring"" almost all of it spilled with some of them flying to the back seats.The absence of the stewardship of James Wan was felt on the whole.

201,fatemaster2003,Over-hyped!,5,5 October 2014,"The hype of Annabelle, the doll, started up when it showed up in The Conjuring for a couple of seconds long, a way for the director to say, ""we're gonna make a movie about the doll."" And in just a year time, more or less, we got the movie, Annabelle, acting as a prequel to The Conjuring.So, maybe people would put their hopes up because The Conjuring was actually a success. And besides, we're talking about a possessed and really creepy doll. It should be good too, just like The Conjuring, right? Well, as much as I wanted to say that Annabelle is good, the truth is, it's just a mediocre horror movie, delivered to drive the curiosity in all horror movie-goers up, which for me is not that successful.It all started with a collection set creepy doll (later on named Annabelle), was possessed with a supernatural power that was disturbing. From there, everything went awry, just like your typical horror-genre movie.It's true, there's quite a lot of fear factor that can make you jump out of your seat at the time or even some scene that made you started to cover up your eyes in case something scary might jump at you. I have to say, PERHAPS, that's because people have watched The Conjuring and they expected the same thing to happen in Annabelle. For me, it's only that factor that actually makes me 'on-alert' with my hands.Other than that, nothing. It's just your usual, day-to-day scary movie that will just go by and be forgotten, only to be remembered when you watch The Conjuring again. And MAYBE, just another speculation of mine, that's the reason why Annabelle was designed like that (the real Annabelle doll was just a Raggedy Ann), to make us remember Annabelle as shown in the movie. Just too bad, the director couldn't effectively make the best out of the creepy doll...As for the script and actors + actresses, they are neither good nor bad.

In a nutshell, this is a female version of the Chucky series, however this doll is silent and for the most part doesn't move, except in one scene. Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one, including me, so take this with a grain of salt.",Annabelle
205,alucard_castlevania86,Not As Scary As I'd Hope It To Be But It Had Its Moments,6,2 October 2014,"I came to this movie very excited. After the promising a plot story and amount of horror being shown in The Conjuring that was just plain awesome, I expected Annabelle to have more or less the same amount of horror quality being shownGetting straight to this movie, it had a really interesting concept on the origins of how the doll was possessed. Not what I had expected since I thought she was going to be something like Chucky from Child's Play. Instead the Annabelle is more like the gateway boundary between and our world and Hell itselfAll the actors equally acted well for their part in my opinion but there wasn't one who stood out the most to me. I expected the Warren couple to make an appearance in this film but apart from a few references in the film, they never showed up. It could really have changed the outcome of the events it they had did arrived to helpThe aspects of the film here in terms of camera works and editing of the film were well shot and put together to help make this into a good film but nothing unique and it just help flowed the movie to go forward. I expected some flashbacks in between the scenes and show us a little bit of maybe how certain things turned out to be the way they are. But for this film, the lighting and sound of the film was what made it really great. There will definitely be moments where you feel like you want cover your eyes or look awayMy favorite scene which I'm sorry that I just have to tell (but you guys can already see it in the trailer) will have to be the transition change of the little Annabelle girl running up into the room that the character Mia was in and instantly turns into an adult monster like Annabelle after bursts through the door while still chasing after her. That shot in my opinion was done to perfectionOverall, not really as scared as I'd hope it to be but it lived up to the potential. However, this movie in my opinion definitely could not match up to The Conjuring. I'd give it a 6 out of 10",Annabelle
206,neoclone07,A cool movie to take your girlfriend,6,13 October 2014,"OK, first things first, I have to mention that this short review might have one or another spoilers bellow, so, stay warned and take care about what you read.Just went to a movie theater with my girlfriend and, though we both enjoyed the movie, it's all about the same. Of course, if you're light on the horror genre, like my girlfriend, you'll get a couple of jumps off the seat and will experience some tension here and there. But don't expect more than that! Some parts of the movie are a bit scary and disturbing, like the moment the main character realizes that there's something else besides her and her baby in the room, lurking in the darkness, watching her every step. Put yourself in such a dark scenery... you would s**t your paints off, I bet.However, I can say that Annabelle is a mix between The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby and Child's Play. Get the best elements in those great movies, put them in mixer and presto! you'll have Annabelle.I won't even mention the acting!At some point of the movie I almost fell asleep.The acting is extremely dull!All in all, Annabelle is cool movie, for a night of fun with your girlfriend, if you really want to stay cozy with her. If you're a true horror movie fan, like me, will notice all the flaws and lack of originality it has. That said, I'll wait for something better to spend my money on.",Annabelle
207,juanheights,headline,6,11 November 2019,"Re-watched this one recently and now I remember why it didn't really leave an impression like it's sequels. as the first of the trilogy it had the burden of building the characters and world up, which it failed to do. none of the characters felt fleshed out, leaving the viewer to not really care what happens to any of them. for most of the film you feel as if you're watching a slice of life film instead of a horror one. it finally starts to pickup halfway through the film although the ending doesn't really feel earned and the conflict happens and dies out too quickly as if it remembered it had to happen. the second film did a way better job at being a spin-off film for this important entity of The Conjuring universe.",Annabelle

212,mejaflora,Horror movie starring Ken and Barbie & the Doll of Doom that does nothing,1,27 December 2014,"Having the doll do absolutely nothing must have saved them a LOT of money. There are so many close ups and camera panning towards the doll and all that to see her do a big NOTHING! After the third time panning towards her face, there should be a running bet. Maybe she will blink, or sneer or maybe do the Macarena. Really, I would like that because the Macarena scares the *beep* out of me. Old people swinging their hips, that's like inviting death to dance with you.Then they throw a generic looking demon with a very familiar face and horns. I could have sworn I've seen that demonic face somewhere. What's that movie starring Harry Potter but with horns? And guess what, he's moving the doll all over. That IS a spoiler that shows how the doll is able to levitate. The movie just gave us a spoiler, can we sue them???? So if there is a sequel and the doll starts floating around and doing the backstroke, there must be a stage guy there doing the work, just dress him up as a demon so he will look like part of the movie, right?And the actors were not able to save the movie even if they wanted to. Wooden acting, blank facial expressions. We have cookie cutter Ken and Barbie in a perfect life, and what's more perfect when they meet the first stranger in the movie who became a friend and this NEW friend is willing to sacrifice her life for the white Barbie because she feels guilty about her own daughter's death. Oh yeah the stranger-turned friend-turned willing sacrifice-turned soul now belonged to the devil is black, so check that list. And there ain't gonna be any mother daughter reunion there you know, it's a totally different zip code. I'm sure wherever the daughter is, she's shaking her head thinking 'That's not what I meant you are supposed to do Mom. You could pray more for my soul, that would actually help and do some charity work or something. NOT give your bloody soul to the devil!""Back to Ken and Barbie, could you act a little bit more distraught when you thought your baby is lying dead on the floor instead of smothering him in your chest possibly killing him in the process? Shouldn't the first thing you do is check his pulse, give CPR and then maybe at the same time realize that you are french kissing a freaking doll? And Ken! You have perfect hair, the perfect job and I love a doctor who spent his time sleeping beside a patient's bed. And who didn't think that Ken and Barbie had the WORST reaction time in history? Did you count how many seconds it took for any of them to react when they hear something? How many seconds did it take for Ken to stop and think and think again when he hears his wife scream? Can someone take his soul please? Oh wait, he would take too long at the window to jump. Probably couldn't figure out if he should land on the front or back, which would be prettier? Barbie didn't disappoint at the window scene. She took long enough for black stranger to form a crazy idea in her head. Barbie is probably hoping for that. Let the stranger-turned friend-turned willing sacrifice do the jump. Maybe Barbie is smarter than we realize.Overall, not worth to be included in any horror list. Best buried and forgotten or in Hollywood terms, rebooted.PS. They started the movie interviewing the 2 girls who had the doll. Shouldn't the movie be about them?",Annabelle

In my opinion, this movie is scary. Now, what is scary is obviously different from person to person. But one thing I think everyone should be able to agree on with this film, is that being scary is at least the goal of the writers and producers. A lot of films under the category of horror, don't necessarily have fear as their primary goals. For example, movies like Cabin in the Woods, which are comedies with a horror theme.In contrast with the rest of The Conjuring series, this film starts a bit slower, and gets stronger towards the end. Also, the intensity of the story line isn't on the same level. In my opinion, this gives Annabelle a slight advantage over The Conjuring, since I become desensitized to threats on screen if they become too intense.",Annabelle
217,susana-c-fernandes,"Better than The Conjuring, slow paced but good",7,9 October 2014,"I enjoyed Annabelle, maybe because I was keeping my expectations really low after the disappointment The Conjuring was to me (a basic possession/exorcism flick, completely unoriginal).Annabelle is a slow paced movie that builds up tension only to let you sigh in relief when the actual scare doesn't get to happen. This may not appeal to everyone, but it worked wonders for me. There are many scenes in which you're grasping your chair, thinking ""this is totally going to happen"" and then it doesn't. There are only 3 or 4 real jump scares in the movie (some of which shown in trailers, which is BAD). The end result? A non-predictable plot loaded with tension and creepiness. The only flaw in Annabelle, for me, was the lack of a truly horrifying image that would burn itself into our minds and give us nightmares. For me, that is an essential element to create an excellent horror movie.All in all, Annabelle is an entertaining scary movie. It doesn't make you jump every 5 minutes but let's you get familiar with the characters before starting to put them through hell. And that's what I look for in horror: characters I can empathize with, and not wish they die already.*****SPOILERS FROM HERE ON*****Yes, the demon was creepy but didn't have enough time or visibility on screen (which may be good, because he could look silly and ruin everything). Apart from it, there were two main disturbing moments for me: the elevator/stairs sequence (that impotence feeling of having no way out was great) and the baby-hitting sequence (that made me sick). The doll never actually moves (on her own, that is) and this was also a positive point for me. I guess people were expecting Chucky-like moves, but the fact they chose to leave it out only added suspense to the movie. I was ALWAYS waiting for the doll to suddenly jerk her head or something. But nope, they didn't go down that easy scare inducing road. Now.. the ending was a little too fast for me though. That lady's decision to jump out the window was a little ""light"". She was there and next thing you know she's out the window. Maybe they could have worked that scene a little better.",Annabelle
218,tim-arnold777,It will trigger Annabellactic shock,7,4 October 2014,"Maybe not the most disturbing horror/demonic movie, but it's up there. I thought the story was substantial enough. The dots are connected as to how Annabelle became a conduit for a demon and how the person(s) who conjured up the demon were destroyed as a consequence of the actions that malevolent spirit drove them to. The corollary of the Manson/Tate/LaBianca murders were a nice touch and fit nicely into the chronology of the franchise. Effective use of imagery, movement, sound, and scoring to put viewers on the edge of their seat. I glanced over to my 19 year-old daughter who loves scary movies and found her sitting in a fetal position with hands poised to cover her eyes. My Christian peers would think I'm a horrible father for condoning such a movie by taking my daughter to see it...but theologically I found the content to be biblically accurate and that there certainly IS evil in the world. And I believe that evil was set loose in our world when humankind chose to mistrust God, and summon the power or purview of God's enemies.",Annabelle
219,msmchug,"Great horror, good scares but could have been better!",8,2 November 2014,"I was a big fan of the conjuring, so when I seen the trailer for Annabelle I was already hooked. It felt like a long wait but It was worth it. The film starts the same as the conjuring with some scared nurses saying the Annabelle doll had been terrorising them and the story goes back and tells the story of how the doll came to be possessed. Basically a young married couple get there home ransacked by two crazy murdering cult members - who attack and nearly kill them. The police save the day but the crazy cult woman dies holding Annabelle and a drop of her ""evil"" blood drips into the dolls eye. Strange and unlucky things start to happen, and the build up is really slow. There's not many special effects and the film feels retro, my only criticism is there's almost to much background to the story, there's quite a big character build up setting the husband and wife scene. Waiting for the baby... But When the frights come they really do deliver. The mum Mia really is a great actress, she is believable but not over the top. Wish the same could be said for her on screen husband who seems wooden and just limp. At first I found him off putting but luckily he's not in it a lot.When the young couple move to a new home things really pick up pace. Mia wants to protect her young baby so she reads more into what could be causing the presence and gets help from a priest and makes friends with Evelyn from the book store. There was a really tense scene where Mia goes to the basement and the door gets stuck, four or five times, it just keeps opening in the basement where there's a devil/ goat demon awaiting in the dark shadows. This bit had me on the edge of my seat! The horned demon is very scary a bit like the one in insidious. The last twenty minutes of the film is brilliant, the story comes together in a great climax with the demon wanting satisfied with a sole and it looks like Mia will kill herself to save the baby.. However the priest and book lady won't let that happen. Everything appears to end well but of course nobody knows where Annabelle is.. But the viewer knows she moves on and ends up terrorising the nurses. I love horror films and this was not a disappointment. Had a feel of drag me to hell mixed with insidious. i would recommend this film and I really enjoyed watching it!",Annabelle
220,mathijsschaap,Better when you know more about the real story,7,22 January 2016,"After watching ""The Conjuring"" and being terrified to insomnia by this brilliant movie, ""Annabelle"" could not be ignored. However, it a huge letdown the First time I watched it. I guess that, like so many others, I expected a possessed doll. The real version of Child's Play's 'Chucky' sort or less.But after reading ""The Demonologist"", which contains a complete chapter about the real story of Annabelle, I realised that the doll was never possessed by a demon. According to the Warrens, demons do not possess dolls or other lifeless objects. They only possess people. The doll was merely an instrument used by the demon. It manipulated the doll.So I decided to give the movie another chance, and it was actually way better than the First time I watched it. I was more able to understand the story that the movie makers were trying to tell.Of course, other than ""The Conjuring"", less and less in this movie was truly base don the real life story concerning the Annabell doll. The real doll was a Raggedy Ann doll, not a porcelain doll.The characters in the movie are merely fictional and not base don real people.

221,kooldddon,Disappointed,5,11 October 2021,"One of the most highly anticipated horror movies of our times, Annabelle directed by John Leonetti is both a prequel and a spin off to one of the most scariest movies of all times The Conjuring. The film is based on the true story of the origin of Annabelle doll. The film revolves around the ever so common and safe plot of a demon haunting for the need of a soul and how the doll gets possessed or to be exact how it is being used as a conduit by demonic spirits. The lead actors Mia played by Annabelle Wallis (strange xD) and Ward Horton do a pretty great job at being the family in the centre of action. The film starts with the opening scene of The conjuring and moves further taking us into the past showing the origin of Annabelle doll. The film has quite the bone chilling scenes and sound effects which make it scary but not as scary as The Conjuring if you want to compare the two. The climax was a bit let down as i was expecting something different. Nonetheless it is still a good horror flick to watch and fans of this genre will be drawn to it. The most horrific part is the doll, and you cannot help but think about it every time you sleep at night.

Yes, there are a couple jump scares but the beginning of the movie is as good as it gets, and only gets worse and worse. This film steals elements from Paranormal, Insidious and has ZERO originality. And what it steals is the best part of it. It spends no time establishing what is terrifying these people the way Paranormal does - which generates the psychological thrill as the audience pieces it together with the characters. The acting is mediocre AT BEST. Basically you saw almost all the scary parts in the previews and the actual plot(s) are disjointed and make no sense.

226,ZChrisJ1995,"Pales in comparison to ""The Conjuring"", but still provides a few decent scares",6,11 October 2014,"Heavily marketed as a spin-off of 'The Conjuring', 'Annabelle' aims a bit too high for its own good. Nevertheless, it still proves to be a perfectly competent modern horror flick, with more than a few effective scares. Focusing on a young family in 1970's America, 'Annabelle' depicts their struggles, initially against a murderous cult, then the titular doll who has been possessed by an otherworldly entity. It was good that the creative team at least attempted to flesh out the main characters, trying to give them substance and warmth as opposed to making them the usual one-dimensional, sex-crazed teenagers. However, a lot of the dialogue-driven scenes that strive to do this are poorly-written and awkward. That being said, these do still help the audience empathize with their situation. The film's structure and build-up in terms of suspense could have been more refined (particularly in comparison to 'The Conjuring'). Whereas preferably I thought the film should have begun with smaller, quieter fright sequences that proceeded to build up to something larger across the course of the narrative, 'Annabelle' instead pounds the audience again and again, only to die down for another five minutes. This does kill a bit of the film's potential momentum, but ultimately this structure is redeemed by the sheer effectiveness of some scenes. Being directed by a previous cinematographer, many of 'Annabelle''s sequences are highly inventive and frankly, terrifying. Shadows and obscure camera angles all assist in this cinematic creativity, making sure that you'll never look at bedroom doors or stairwells the same way again. Though it does sometimes falter in terms of its dialogue or its narrative structure, 'Annabelle' gets by on the brilliance of some its fright scenes. Though by no means as good as 'The Conjuring' or any of the horror genre's classics, 'Annabelle' is still a worthwhile experience for those who want a decent scare. Or several.",Annabelle
227,Drive-in_Zeppelin,"Bland, lacking any terror or suspense, and so very dull",3,6 October 2014,"Going into this film, I had heard a lot of excitement from folks simply because it was a prequel to The Conjuring, and James Wan was producing and John Leonetti directing. Having not yet see The Conjuring, I can only remark on Annabelle as a generic 'horror' film - knowing very little about the actual events on which the story is based or how it fits into this grand lineage of recent horror films. I should have known I was setting myself up for disappointment when the girl at the box-office said The Box Trolls was a scarier film, and sadly after watching, I whole-heartily agree with her. Annabelle was bad, not in that Paranormal Activity way, but it was about as boring and uninteresting. Being a seasoned fan of the horror genre, I'll admit I had reasonable expectations coming into this movie. Going off the trailer you have a creepy porcelain doll, some apparent possession angle with demons,and a well established producer/director in James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Dead Silence). What followed for the next 98 minutes was just a pitiful attempt to mash so many elements from other, more famous horror films together with something that resembled a story.The story, or lack thereof, is basically that Mia and John are the clichéd horror characters of a late 60's possession film that have all of their hopes and dreams set out before them. Mia is about to have a baby and John is about to start his residency to become a full- fledged doctor. John then gets Mia a creepy doll and the horror shenanigans ensue. (Supposedly)Specifically Mia and John's neighbors are brutally murdered by satanic cultists and Mia is subsequently stabbed in her pregnant belly by one of the attackers. Although the baby is fine, the neighbor's daughter (one of the attackers) ritualistically kills herself and her tormented soul is somehow swept into none other than the creepy doll John gave Mia as a gift. I'm really at a loss after reading some of the other reviews that are praising this movie for things like character development, a suspenseful story, 'genuine' scares, and being the perfect movie to start the Halloween season. This movie has none of that. The story is horribly clichéd and just tries to reinvent movies like Poltergeist, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and Paranormal Activity into one. As for character development, you need actually need characters that you grow to care about that aren't simply a bad caricature of someone that'd likely be in a horror film i.e. the doubting husband, the occult-friendly neighbor, etc. I was just hoping that someone would have a gruesome death to distract me from twiddling my thumbs .Also if you're looking for a 'scary' movie you've come to the wrong place. There are a handful of 'jump' scenes that are few and far between, and none of them are anything more than gradual silence followed by a jolt of unnecessarily loud audio. It was quite an annoyance to a few of the folks in the theatre that had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom. Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website",Annabelle
228,jacob-m-ford97,Biggest problem: it wasn't scary.,5,3 November 2014,"Halloween night and, after returning from a very unfrightening costume party dressed as an even less frightening Santa Claus, I decided I wanted to be scared. So I hopped on the internet and found the popular 2013 horror flick ""The Conjuring."" Two hours later the movie finished and I was well into November first, flinching at every little sound I heard, and trying to fall asleep as my feet tingled in fear of being pulled from my bed. For anyone who has seen ""The Conjuring,"" you know the exact feeling. Now I'm not a particular fan of horror films, they are extremely overdone and rarely well, but this one got to me. From my limited experience, ""The Conjuring"" is certainly the best horror movie I've seen. Then they went and made a prequel.""Annabelle"" is the prequel to the ever so successful and ever so creepy ""The Conjuring."" The premise of ""Annabelle"" is that one shot in ""The Conjuring"" where the same Annabelle doll turns her head and you wet your pants. The plot, however, is found in an average everyday couple and their newborn child. As a gift to celebrate the new baby's birth, the husband (I'm saying husband and wife because as soon as the movie finished I forgot their names) surprises the wife with a doll. After a traumatic incident where the neighbors are murdered by members of a satanic cult and the husband and wife are attacked, one of the attackers commits suicide with the doll in her hands. Some evil spirit then enters the doll, and the average happy family soon begin to experience the horrors of a demonic presence.The happy couple, Mia and John Gordon (I just looked up their names on IMDb,) were played by Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton, respectively. I was not impressed by either performance, as they were both very single noted. Ward Horton in particular had zero depth to his character making him entirely forgettable at the times even when he was not on screen. In ""The Conjuring,"" one of the strongest things about the film was the performances. Patrick Wilson was fairly dull as well, but Vera Farminga and Lili Taylor gave the film a depth that really brought it to another level. This was nowhere to be found in ""Annabelle."" Alfre Woodard provided some interesting development and did save a couple scenes, but she was simply not allowed enough screen time to have any sort of effect on the final result of the film.John Leonetti took the director's chair for ""Annabelle,"" after being the head cinematographer for James Wan during filming of ""The Conjuring."" This is not the first time Leonetti has directed a sequel or prequel to a film he was head of photography. There is one consistency throughout his work though: the originals were fairly well received but when Leonetti was placed as director, the sequels were widely disliked. This is Leonetti's third film to direct, the first two were ""Mortal Combat: Annihilation"" and ""The Butterfly Effect 2."" It is a wonder to me that the prequel to ""The Conjuring"" was placed in such unreliable hands. However, it was, and ""Annabelle"" was the result.As the previews finished and ""Annabelle"" began, I adjusted in my seat, bracing myself to be scared. Leonetti used a clever tool in beginning this film by using the same shots that began ""The Conjuring."" Unfortunately, after using up all these shots and displaying the title with a climactic musical swell, it went black. I was sure something was about to jump out and scare me. Instead, I looked up and I was in church. And a nice church too; very well lit. Church finishes and after a very lovely conversation with some friends, our average couple returned to their suburban California home with palm trees in the yard and the sun shining as bright as ever. At this point I almost began to wonder if I had sat down in the wrong theater. This continued for the rest of the film. There were different scenes where circumstances would climax and it would be fairly frightening, but seconds later it was morning again and the birds were chirping.The thing that made ""The Conjuring"" work so well was the constant feeling that something awry was about to happen. It was the polar opposite here, where I found myself feeling like I was watching a pleasant drama rather than a horror film. It could be that was Leonetti's intent, to make you feel comfortable before he scares you, but it simply didn't work. In the end, the only credit for scares that got me go to the film's musical composer Joseph Bishara. Save some weak dialogue and performances, ""Annabelle"" was a decent film overall. It just wasn't scary. So as I walked out of theater, the doll never bothered me anyway. I give ""Annabelle"" a 5.0/10.",Annabelle

Alfre Woodard shows up to collect a paycheck and her final exit from the film is one of the most ridiculous, borderline offensive things I've ever seen.The good news is - it could only go up from here and the film's sequel/prequel isn't half bad.",Annabelle
231,marinamaru,not for me,4,2 November 2021,"I've watched some of the conjuring and annabelle series. I could actually enjoy scenes of demon's attack and action but the whole series are full of ''god'' things and they just cringe me out. They are for those who believe that ''god'', which is just a male being, created us (lol) , protect us from the evil and blah blah things. And what? Even babies given a birth by women risking their life are creation of that male?? How greed.",Annabelle

She is so cold, so fake, I believe she never lived the events while acting, I am so disappointed that somebody decided to grant this role to her.The Audio in this movie is also terrible, the Audio Engineer made every conversation a whisper, and every horror scene a set of screaming sound effects ... the thing that made me switch the TV volume up and down all along the movie, please think about a better way to make people jump out of their chairs next time.Overall I would have given this movie 10 out of 10, it is a master piece and we don't usually see many horror movies with such interesting story nowadays, but I will take 1 point for the terrible actress and 1 point for the horrible Audio Engineer.",Annabelle

We've seen all that before. However it is nicely done so one can't complain too much about the picture. This movie will scare you if you watch it in a cinema. The sound, huge screen and lots of girly shrieks create tension and dark mood. All that aside and the movie lacks. I didn't quite catch the connection of the satanists to Annabell, why the scene of a crazy attack at the pregnant woman? Why the bookstore lady condemns her soul surely knowing that will keep her away from her deceased daughter? Why wouldn't the woman and her baby move out of the spooky apartment, maybe into a church or somewhere safer? This and many other plot mishaps make this movie less enjoyable. It has some good ideas, dialogues and believable acting but all in all it could have been better. As said before, if you go and see it in a cinema on a night out with a bunch of friends you won't be disappointed but when you start analysing this film....no just don't analyse it. (curious if they're making a sequel though)",Annabelle

This is...OK?There's not much to say: it's a generic horror movie of a kind we've seen a thousand times. Very on the nose and the mystical black lady doesn't help.It's not easy to really root for Mr and Mrs Wholesome USA...And another thing: the original Annabelle is way scarier. Admittedly this Annabelle is the more creepy looking in her own right and I would NOT like to go to sleep in a room with her in but when contextualized into a horror movie, scary looking things are not scary. You need to use harmless looking things. So the used Raggedy Ann concept would have been much better.",Annabelle
237,haseebguru,"Annabelle: Underrated, The Conjuring & The Insidious: Overrated",9,12 January 2016,"First of all I am not against The Conjuring and The Insidious, I liked both movies when I watched them first time, but that is the problem that those movies didn't attract me to watch for second time though The Conjuring is a lot better than The Insidious but still not as creepy and scary than Annabelle.Like any normal IMDb User, I had very low expectations from Annabelle because of such low rating as my ratings always matched with overall ratings but this was one of exceptional case when I surprisingly liked the movie against low ratings.I couldn't find any problem in this movie. Genre wise it was hell scary and did everything to me which a best horror movie does to its viewer. Gave me Nightmare as I finished it at 2:00 am, increased my heart rate to almost 100 BPM and even next day I was in Annabelle Zone.Some scenes were really terrifying including Sewing machine scene, climax scene, Church Father's Car scene and my favorite Elevator scene.Another positive note of this movie is that it is a believable and loving story of a family. The Cast did perfect job to their characters especially the leading actress coincidentally-named Annabelle Wallis as ""Mia"", she did an excellent job and got a loyal fan in me. Also would like to mention Ward Horton, who played a role of Mia's husband ""John"", did a superb job.Direction wise movie was fabulous despite the fact that Director of this movie was new, he did an incredible job and I want him to direct Annabelle 2 as well.At the end I would like to say that I had no intentions to write review for it and I found my thoughts in some reviews too but it's just to add a number to supporters of this movie and I will recommend it to everyone who are a fan of arguably believable horror movies.",Annabelle
238,WildWombatt,Good movie,8,5 October 2014,"For those that compared this movie to the Conjuring, you will probably be disappointed. The movie plays out very similar to Insidious, so if you enjoy that one, you will enjoy Annabelle.Do not compare this movie with The Conjuring, it isn't similar to that one much at all. People consider Annabelle to be the sequel, but in reality, it's more of a spin-off. They are making The Conjuring part 2 after all.When I went to go watch this movie, I lost excitement after reading the negative reviews - most of them saying the movie was boring and nothing happened. To my surprise, the movie wasn't like the reviews at all. I enjoyed the movie, and something DOES happen throughout the movie. You won't be sitting there waiting 30 minutes for something to happen.My only complaint with this movie (many people didn't like this either) was that the doll didn't really move. Many others expected it to be like Chucky, but in actuality, the doll was being ""haunted"" and there are demons involved. If you watch this movie expecting it to walk around on its own and killing people, you will not be content. However, if you're into creepy dolls or enjoy jump-scares, I recommend this movie.",Annabelle
239,eliza_gaskell,Too many jump scares,5,29 July 2019,"Whilst the storyline premise itself was unusual, it was shot exceptionally well and the cinematography was great. BUT the whole movie was predictable, with shots set up to scare people and Annabelle is just plain lazy.For example for some oddball reason, the husband gifts his pregnant wife the most ugliest and freakishly creepy looking of dolls - Annabella. Yeah that's right - the husband brings evil into his loving family home and the wife places the doll, front and centre in their child's nursery.....why?Sadly, it has too many jump scares in this movie. In the end I just said to hell with it and watched it with captions and on mute. The characters were making stupid choices where I just couldn't give a rats about them.Is Annabelle a better movie than The Conjuring? The answer is NO. The Conjuring is a far more superior movie. Still if you want to watch all the movies in the Conjuring universe, Annabelle is a must watch movie.",Annabelle
240,prahladagarwal,Best to be avoided,5,28 January 2015,"What separates a good horror movie from a bad one is that the latter creates sudden shocks and surprises during the playtime while the former creates a constant fear not just during the playtime but also has reminiscence after the movie. Annabelle, a prequel to The Conjuring, falls under the latter category and fails to impress unlike its 2013 hit sequel. The movie has a very predictable sequence, unimpressive storyline and not so frightening background score. The Conjuring had created large expectation for Annabelle with its own brilliantly researched surprise elements, good cast and relatable fear. However, Annabelle even fails to come across as an ordinary horror flick if not being a prequel to The Conjuring. Probably James Wan should have directed the prequel himself!",Annabelle

It references to 70ies horror movies(Exorcist, Omen) , even before that (Rosemary's Baby) I thinks there's some good solid acting, a lot of nice scares... The only negative I can say about it is that it might not be too original but I've been seeing a lot of horrror and this one really pops out for me! So I really don't understand why people keep trashing this movie! Look at it as a tribute to those directors that made fantastic horrors! Close your curtains, put the volume on high and appreciate this one, like I did! Glad I didn't listen to all my friends who said it was trash!",Annabelle
242,sean73267326,Pleasantly surprised.,8,18 October 2014,"Look, I mean how many horror sequel/prequels have ever been good? Let's count. Dawn of the Dead was good, Evil Dead 2 was good, and Aliens was good. Three, by my count. But honestly, these films are all over 25 years old, and Hollywood can't even get original horror movies right these days (at least not often). How on earth is a quick cash like Annabelle going to be any way decent?Well, miraculously, even if it doesn't compare to the films I already mentioned, Annabelle is a very smart, clever horror film, that manages to create a lot of suspense, only bringing out the big scares after enough of it has been generated. If you've seen The Conjuring, it's comparable. The films feels similar in style, but somehow a lot tighter; it's been pared down quite a bit. What that means is that a lot of the opulent, almost overwhelming atmosphere of that film is gone (and it's missed, if I'm honest), but is instead replaced by shorter, sharper shocks, with a lot more focus on the main story and the characters (who are unusually well defined and acted for a horror movie, especially the two female leads; for once, these people don't act stupid, and don't feel like stock horror movie victims - hurray!).Speaking of the story, it's actually pretty decent. I'm not going to ruin it, but it's engaging if not exactly amazing. It does its job just well enough so that it feels like more than just an excuse to scare the audience, or get a bit more mileage out of the titular doll from hell. The scares are very well crafted. One or two are a bit hammy, but for the most part a lot of horror films could learn from this one. One particularly masterful sequence involves an elevator and had the whole cinema holding their breath; you'll know it when you see it. Another part - totally unmentionable without spoiling but spectacularly creepy - pretty much raised the roof.Films like this aren't ever made to be high-art, they're made to get a specific reaction from an audience, so when a film like this does come around and turns out to be well crafted and fun, it's a rare treat. It's not perfect, but then I didn't need it to be to enjoy it. If you're planning to go see it, ignore the negative reviews. It's a treat.",Annabelle
243,spam-778-616598,Truly good - in a vintage way,9,1 November 2017,"This movie goes in line with such horror classics as Barbaras Baby, the Exorcist, The Omen etc. It takes the time it needs to fully develop characters, to make you feel for them (if that is in your capability) and fear for their sake. It's classic, sometimes subtle horror, with really well placed jump scares (and I've watched a lot of horror movies). It's definitely not a splatter nor a thriller nor a teeny-screamy, so don't expect one. This is a movie of a young family that is haunted by evil. The characters a believable, good-hearted and intelligent, and a hard crack for the evil forces that haunt them. It's ending doesn't come as such a surprise - thus only 9 stars - but it will keep watchers on the edges of their seats anyway.

I mean some people are comparing it to Chuckie, when it was not even close. OVERALL: I give this movie a 4/10 and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you do see it, do not bring children under 14 to it. RATING: 4/10 AGE: 14+.

What I got was a life-sappingly boring marriage drama featuring special guest appearances by Generic Ghost Girl #43894337 and Beelzebub, directed by a man with a fetishistic obsession with utterly pointless zoom-ins. What made this whole thing plummet down to a 2-star-rating for me, despite its rather high production values, were the completely vacuous characters and their never-ending conversations filled with nothing but tired platitudes and forced melodrama.

It was scary in a few places like when pregnant Mia was dragged, the little girl turning into a scary possessed lady, the appearance of the black demon from the ceiling, etc. But for most part, the movie was fairly slow and also, it wasn't really scary. Also the lift scene and the basement scene could've been a LOT better. The doll did NOT do anything for most part of the movie and was just lying ... or was still ...for WHAT? It did not move places much nor do anything ... But it is a good watch ... just not scary enough ...

248,vinzarka,Waste time!,2,8 January 2015,Just a bad copy of horror movie. The script and everything is this movie is not new at all. Just didn't understand the reason why the company should spend so much money for such repetitive subjects?! The actor are supposed to be more scared and realistic in the same time...but they look just blocked and no emotional at all. There are also some other points of script that are not easy to understand and i perceived the further scene because of the same subject i have seen in other horror movies. Did the fantasy die in the script? The additional role of the library woman is not necessary. However she enters in acting so immediately without any strong reason of communication. It looks she knows and sometimes she doesn't know what is happening with Mia. Strange and confused acting!,Annabelle
249,IMDbUser1002,Very enjoyable & scary!,7,29 November 2016,"Annabelle is a well-made prequel to The Conjuring, that I really enjoyed. Although the movie isn't the best I have seen, I still managed to thoroughly enjoy the movie, and I would strongly recommend you watch it. I'd definitely say it deserves better ratings/reviews than it has been receiving. It does a decent job of balancing the plot advancement, and frightening scenes. Unlike The Conjuring, this movie isn't based directly on real events, although there are some aspects taken from the Annabelle case that was investigated by Ed & Lorraine Warren. The plot of the movie is intriguing and pretty easy to follow, if you pay close attention. I was immediately interested upon the first paranormal event. As for this movie being scary, I'd say the concept of a doll being a demons conduit is very scary. The movie does have quite a few jump scares that would catch any off-guard viewers, and some very prolonged suspenseful parts. The climax of the movie is very intense. The doll is very well-designed for it's evil role in this movie. It's definitely creepy enough, and I like how it slowly begins to appear more sinister throughout the movie. I also really like how we never see the doll move, yet it's still extremely obvious that it is responsible for the demonic activity occurring in the house. Having seen The Conjuring, The Conjuring 2, and Annabelle, I'd rate this movie 8/10. I am also really excited for the sequel to this movie, Annabelle 2. I hope it's equally frightening and enjoyable!",Annabelle

252,helvin3,Annabelle the doll is scary. This movie is not.,1,9 January 2015,About a minute into this film I squealed out of fear when they put the Annabelle doll into frame. I have a genuine fear of dolls like this. They freak me out. Therefore I was excited about this movie - I sincerely thought that there would finally be another movie out there that would manage to scare me (I have 3 in total so far). Sadly this is not the case. The movie was boring and predictable. The worst thing was that they have this terrifying creature-object-thing to make good use of and they failed miserably at using it. I'm genuinely disappointed at the reuse of the same old washed up horror storyline. How'd this script even get approved??! booo!

And it's not boring because of bad CGI or bad acting or bad scares - because there is none of that in it. There's nothing in it. The demon guy pops up in a ""cool"" shot or two but, meh, the whole film is like watching porridge cook in a microwave for an hour and a half.2/10 from me and most of that is for the production values.OK so apparently I need to write more to pass the IMDb submission test, so, um, there's a piece of paper on my desk, it's a bit warped because I spilt water on it.

255,mitchw-61-305942,A Big Problem,3,18 October 2014,"This movie would have been much better if we had some decent actors. They can act, they just can't act well. The only cast members who could act were the shop owner, Evelyn, played by Alfre Woodard, and the neighbours played by Kerry O'Malley and Brian Howe. The neighbours dialogue was a bit off but they can still act. The parents were dreadful in my opinion. They were ""acting"", and it ruined everything.The script was okay. It could have been better. I think there was realism there, just not enough, especially for the parents. Perhaps it was just the acting. Maybe if the acting was better, maybe the script wouldn't seem so mediocre. It's better than anything I can do for sure, but still, nothing special.I did like a few of the scares. Scares do not have to be original to be scary, just as long as they are scary. There were startles that worked really well. It's hard to be truly original these days. There are more movies being produced than ever before.What else can I say? I can't remember the score so I suppose it was neutral, and the cinematography was good. I didn't find anything creepy about Annabelle. I do not find dolls scary. Nor did I find Chucky scary. Actually I never saw Chucky because it looked ridiculous. This movie only appealed to me because it was advertised in relation to The Conjuring. They got me.",Annabelle

His whiny over protective wimp of a partner is just as annoying in my opinion. I feel nothing for them, which creates my first big dilemma as in a horror you kind of need to give some what of a dam what happens to your protagonists to feel unnerved and scared 'for' them right? Annabelle the doll is kinda creepy.But that is literally all. This movie is droll and predictable I could pre guess every minute of it. I know it's based on ""experiences"" relating to the Warrens but as I don't care for them I really was left feeling nothing at the end of this one.I went into it expecting very little luckily so wasn't under any false illusions.",Annabelle
257,Demetrius_Stork,Decent flick worth checking out,7,26 November 2015,"The credits from the movie are still rolling as I type this, so the film is still fresh in my mind as it should be. Coming in, I saw the somewhat negative reviews and had low expectations as a result. In that respect at least, Annabelle did well in it's mission. For starters, the movie is shot very well. Cinematographer James Kniest and director John Leonetti deserve props for some really quality shots especially in some of the opening sequences. There are some really good long shots in this movie as well, where the shot will be on something scary or intimidating and instead of cutting as any other film might do, it stays on said shot creating tension and good scares on occasion. Secondly, the movie does contain some moments that made me shudder or almost cover my eyes, which I give the movie a ton of credit for. The main villain of the film is designed well and really gave me the creeps especially during one sequence close to the climax. You'll know the one when you get to it.However, aside from those positives, the film does have many faults. The acting is mediocre or even just plain bad at times. During the climax, when the actors are supposed to really show their best stuff, I was very underwhelmed to say the least. The climax was lame too, with a weak resolution that doesn't make any sense and scares that couldn't live up to some of the quality scares of earlier in the film.The movie falls into a lot of tired clichés as well, which is unfortunately something that is to be expected now in horror films. Overall the film really didn't do anything new in terms of scares, plot or even characters, you've seen it all before.In conclusion, despite it's many faults, I would recommend it. It certainly can scare you and sometimes the movie can really get you drawn into the action. I'd say check it out but don't expect it to blow your mind.",Annabelle

260,ricsim78,Thanks for NOT making this like the real legend Hollywood!,3,4 October 2014,"Where do I even begin with this one? I just came back from seeing this and I am near angry from what I saw. It is best to read this if you have not seen this, if you do then you have been warned! Okay, so the movie has NOTHING to do with the real Annabelle legend, and the doll itself is so ugly, who would even want it? The real Annabelle doll is a simple ""Raggedy Anne"" doll, this thing looks like a monstrosity! The acting was pretty decent from Mia, and her character is not as stupid as most in this genre, but a lot of this movie insults your intelligence! The husband is a ""generic loving husband"" but he has a so-so screen presence. The rest of the people seem just around in order to be killed off and/or attacked by ""Annabelle"".The doll: is all ""Hollywooded"" up, creepy eyes, looks like a boy doll, creepy realistic eyes. They should have kept the doll as a simple looking doll (especially if it was authentic looking to the real doll) that would obviously be desirable. No, they had to make it look all creepy. This alone may actually hurt sales of the movie, which I feel is deserved.The story: Again, just as an excuse for things to happen. A couple are about to have a baby, he buys her a doll because he feels guilty, said doll happens to be possessed by a demon. Weird things start to happen, building in intensity until the final ""confrontation of evil"" Yep...must be a typical generic Hollywood horror movie plot! A lot of boredom hits you as the story is just like watching a typical newborn baby toting couple trying to make it in this world. Radios go off on their own, sewing machines, devil worshipers kill neighbors and try to attack the main characters. That is when you know stuff is getting real! The real Annabelle doll was a Raggedy Anne doll that was owned by two nursing students. The doll would be found moved from where last left, impossibly standing on it's own, and weird things would happen. James Wan should have kept the story as the legend, as the real story was a lot scarier than this generic tale.There is some pretty scary looking scenes, the ones who had the demon in them were well done, even if he looked like a black version of the demon from Insidious. The doll itself never moves, it just sits or lays there, looking menacing. It also gets more and more ugly as the movie progresses. James Wan claims that he would have had issues with the Raggedy Anne right holders, but he could have made the doll ""alive"". Instead, it just seemed like a demon ""around the doll"", not contained within it.I am so sick of Hollywood messing up my favorite ghost stories! ""An American Haunting"", and now ""Annabelle"". What I went to see was the legends unfold on film. Instead, ""An American Haunting"" had little to do with the actually Bell Witch legend, and blamed the haunting on John Bell molesting his daughter! How would you like your ancestors to be be chastised by Hollywood? If I was a descendant of the Bell family, I would be outraged by that! ""Annabelle"" is very poorly executed, often boring, and all about ""convenience"" instead of a thing called ""Plot"". Horrible and disappointed!",Annabelle
261,lupanminefujiko,can't avoid from death,9,26 July 2016,"The horror movies tend to focus on the way of showing the ghost and how to shock us. But in which case, the story line of the movie tend to be bad and the story doesn't make sense, and the horror movie in which the dolls are the ghost side is so difficult to make because the CHILD PLAY sires get in the way. But this movie success it completely. At first, you may think that this is the common horror film, but it will change after a while because the ghost doesn't show up entirely. So, what is the fear in this film? In horror movie, the lead character often fight with the ghost or resist it for surviving, however in this movie the lead character don't do anything because the ghost can't attack the human, then the ghost takes a baby of a mother, lead character, to kill her. What this film focus on is the death. The people in this film only suffer from the fear of death. And the ghost shows up a few times; the scene is the most terrible in the horror which I saw, then please be careful to watch it and please don't look if you have dolls.",Annabelle

Is a biiiiiiiig step backwards. James Wan and Leigh Whannel's involvement in this flick was limited to only as producers rather than screenwriters and directors as they did The Conjuring. Yeah, you can see the problem can you?So, the story. A wife and husband are living in a house and the wife is pregnant and is only days away from giving birth. Suddenly, the wife is attacked by crazy people who are part of a cult that are influenced by an evil force. An evil force that seems to be coming from—you guessed it, Annabelle the doll. The mother then gives birth to their baby and as the doll stays with the family, more and more supernatural incidents occur.Oh man, where do I begin with this? First of all, that's not even what the doll looks like in real life. Google it and see what how inaccurate it is. And the biggest problem of all? These jump scares are SO clichéd and so predictable, it is nowhere near entertaining in the least. The characters aren't even that interesting or not event that intelligent. I know people have to be stupid in horror flicks, but they are so dim-witted, you can't get behind them. ESPECIALLY the husband. Oh GOD, he is so absent minded, you just want to smack the hell out of him and yell ""GET A CLUE!"". And the design of the doll is so over exaggerated, it comes off as corny. And that's another problem: They place the doll next to the crib of the baby and seeing how (unnecessarily, mind you) creepy enough as it looks, why would they place it next to their child?! No normal functioning person would find this doll charming or cute! That thing is nightmare fuel! And on another note, the writing is awful. REALLY awful. There's one scene where the wife just randomly says out loud what's going on. Like, ""oh no! There's got to be another way! I have to find another way!"". What, is she narrating a comic book?!The film falls really hard because unlike The Conjuring, where they heavily relied on atmosphere to build up the suspense until the scare itself in a clever way, they just throw in jump scares in your face over and over. And they're SO repetitive. It's one of those scares when it's a fake-out and then five seconds later, BAM it happens. Tired of it? Don't worry, there's like 50 others to sit through.Ugh. So yeah, this is just another horror movie with nothing to offer, nothing to be entertained by and nothing to remember. The characters are idiots, the script is clumsily written, the scares are mundane, and the plot is clichéd to the bone. You want a good scare? Read the actual stories behind Annabelle. They are actually really eerie. So, if you're looking for creativity and scary fun, skip it and be more afraid of Barbie dolls.",Annabelle
264,nightwing90,Don't Expect A Masterpiece Like The Conjuring,5,5 November 2014,"Conjuring was one movie in the horror genre that stood out for its narrative and treatment in horrifying the audience to the maximum with its visual and sound effects though story wise it was the same thing of possession that we have seen numerous times in films. But it served the ultimate purpose of frightening the audiences. Now we have a prequel following up The Conjuring as Annabelle begins before the incidents unfold in Conjuring. About Annabelle, the film is watchable and scare the viewers but somewhere, the zing or the X factor is missing here to make it a memorable, well crafted and an effective horror flick. So this an average film when compared with some classic horrors.John and Mia are a happily married young couple expecting their first child when John gift Mia a big doll. But they are in for a nightmare as strange things happen in their life once this doll enter their life. Yes you guessed it right; this doll is possessed creating havoc in John and Mia's life that continues after Leah their baby is born. Rest every thing is a predictable drama with familiar climax and series of events that we have seen and is quite common in horror flicks.The film has few moments that will scare you but those are very limited to make Annabelle a highly engaging film. No comparisons can be made between Annabelle and Conjuring as the latter is far ahead of the former in many aspects. But as a separate movie, Annabelle is passable with least of expectations. The actors who portrayed John and Mia were good in their respective roles. A lady character enter John and Mia's life at the fag end of the movie and it was a nice performance from her though the role was small. Last but not the least, Annabelle the doll deserves a special mention with that smiling but haunting looks. On the technical side, visual effects were OK along with good sound design. Overall, without a comparison with any of the classic horror movies and conjuring, Annabelle is passable and qualify to be an average film.",Annabelle
265,girlhamsem,"not a great horror movie, but not the worst out there",6,24 March 2020,"The movie started out good, but half way through it seems to go downhill.
I liked the scare jump, but wished it has more..horror to it.
the acting was good too, but to me, in the last 45 minutes it look like everyone was drained and that they didn't do their best, even in the moments when we 'have' to feel sympathetic towards the mother, I didnt because it doesn't look like she really wanted to save her daughter, and the the way it was filmed too, I'd have given it a pass if it was made in 90's or even early to mid 00's , but it was in 2014..all in all, it was a good movie, great to pass time ''espically now we all in quarantine''.",Annabelle

In my opinion, I thought it was a worthy installment to The Conjuring universe.However, Annabelle does have its flaws. I did see the average rating on IMDB and had low expectations before watching the film, but I always give films their chances to be good. Turns out there are good moments in this film, but I do understand other moments that made audiences believe to be one of the worst movies they've seen.I like the characters and their personalities. I love the suspense of the scenes. I also like how the film didn't rely on jump-scares to bring the horror out of the narrative. And lastly, I loved the romantic chemistry between Mia & John and how they genuinely care for each other.Now for some critiques. The film does focus a lot on Mia perspective. I really do wish John could experience more of the paranormal activity other than the beginning scene when he fights against the possessed neighbors. Evelyn's appearance felt like she came out of nowhere and tries to get involved with the Form family. Probably just me. And there were some horror scene that felt a little dragged too long than it should've been.Overall, I didn't think it was bad. Agree or disagree, just give it a chance to be good.",Annabelle

There are a lot of modern horror films (and even a number of older ones) that rely on fake music scares. This movie is the pinnacle of the worst of that. I jumped once when the music abruptly changed. The reason I jumped was not because the film was scary or even atmospheric. It was just the cheapest trick I can remember seeing in a long time. It also felt like an ""action sequence"" in a stale film that builds nothing out of nothing. The only reason this movie will be noteworthy in the future is when people say this was ""Alfre Woodard's worst film"" to those who think she has none. What in the world was she thinking? The only true mystery of this movie for me is why anyone does like it. It is a rushed sequel that insults the previous film.",Annabelle

271,da_zapata,Proof that Spinoffs Can Go Terribly Wrong,4,10 November 2014,"If you're even the least bit familiar with my reviews and genre preferences, you know about my love for horror. I watch too many gore-infused horror flicks dripping with cheesiness for my own good, and even the worst of those have outdone the disaster that is Annabelle. Presented before us is a film that exists as a side-story to the highly acclaimed horror favorite of 2013, The Conjuring. (If you have yet to see it, DO IT ALREADY. YOU'VE HAD A YEAR.)So goes the tale of Annabelle, a doll presented in the introduction of The Conjuring, determined to terrify and revolt with its roots in Satanism and demonic entities. We begin Annabelle identically to The Conjuring. That's right, folks. The first few minutes are just carbon copies from The Conjuring. Eventually, we are presented with the necessary ""One Year Earlier"" frame, outlining the much-anticipated roots of Annabelle the doll. This is when we meet Mia and John Gordon, a happily married couple with a baby on the way.Without giving too much of the plot away, here's an introduction to Annabelle: Mia and John experience a home invasion by two members of a Satanic cult. A female cult member stabs Mia in the stomach just as the cops arrive and is shot, bleeding onto the Annabelle doll as she dies. Mia, John, and the baby survive the attack, and their baby, Lea, is eventually born. However, there is a deep uneasiness lurking underneath the surface, and the couple moves homes after Mia begins to experience paranormal events she believes are linked to the attack.From here, you expect Annabelle to kick it into full gear as it delves deeper into the Satanic and supernatural abilities the doll now possesses. For the most part, it presents them, but in the most mundane possible way. Annabelle is a film that builds in intensity but eventually fails to lead anywhere. We expect big thrills to come, and we are left empty-handed almost every single time. The scares are cheap and the film's opportunity to explore the mythological aspects of Annabelle and the cult responsible for its demonic possession are left untold. Instead, we get 98 minutes of suspense, leading to nowhere but a terribly executed finale. It feels like a drama film desperately attempting to be considered horror.The scares in Annabelle, I will admit, are spine-tingling at times. There are several minutes in the film that are fulfilling for horror fans like myself, but the fact that it is only several minutes of the film proves that Annabelle is an awfully executed piece of cinema. The pacing of the film is highly uneven, the acting is subpar at times, and the script leaves much to be desired. For an October release, we deserve better than a poorly written, badly directed horror film like Annabelle.I will admit, there is a possibility I am being more critical of this film due to my love of The Conjuring. And yet, in the scope of Annabelle existing outside of The Conjuring universe, Annabelle still feels like a lousy film. Few will enjoy it as a new favorite cult classic, but only if absolutely none of it is taken seriously. Believe me, with this film, it's not very difficult to accomplish.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",Annabelle

The husband of the girl was to flexible, it that's the right word. For a horror movie this one had minimum jump scares.

The problem with so much emphasis on that prop: a forsaken story whose linearity fails to build tension, and also makes the plot easily predictable.Acting was bad (specially that of Mia). Additionally, we have plot holes. For instance, there were no solid basis on why Anabelle decided to possess that specific doll and haunt that specific family. Would have she attacked the Forms had not John enterd her parents' house that night? If the demon's ultimate goal was to ""devour"" (?) a soul, why waste so much time haunting a mother and not just take away the baby as soon as possible? Also, why on earth would Evelyn get so deeply involved with that family to the point of taking her own life to save the baby?Maybe there are more unanswered questions, but my point has been made.",Annabelle

(spoilers) it starts off pretty good with the creepy doll Annabelle, and the freaky hippie cult killers (Manson famiyish). but beyond the opening, there is nothing that was really that scary or disturbing. most of the violence happens off camera and there is a lot of build up with no pay off. there's a really cool looking demon that receives too little screen time to make it interesting. i found myself hoping there would be more of a connection to the satanic hippie cult as i like the late 60's/early 70's and Satan worship, they just seem to go together. I recommend watching The Devil Rides Out, Rosemary's Baby, or Race With The Devil over Annabelle. I still can't really see why this movie was rated R. I've seen more violence in a Roadrunner cartoon.

At the beginning of the movie I could see the year was not 2014 by looking at the cars on the street, yet I was not sure what year it was suppose to be. When I saw the newspaper and the year was 1970, I remember that year because I was 21 years old, yet I do not remember dialing ""911"" to call the police or an ambulance; I do remember dialing ""0"" to call the operator to get the police or an ambulance.

Leonetti, taking over directing duties. What I found isn't a horror movie - it's a boring one.To me, one of the things that makes a horror movie great is its connection with its characters and how they react to their given circumstances. In Annabelle we really don't get much of either. Still sub-par, Annabelle Wallis does the best job of making us feel what she's going through. The rest of the characters are inserted in the movie as typical horror clichés - a priest and a book store owner who believes in the occult. The husband is inexplicably devoid of common sense and really does not come off as caring very much about what is happening.The doll itself is another large problem with this movie. It's just not scary. I'm not sure what they could have done to make it better but there were a few times I caught myself giggling.When the movie reached its climactic scene I wasn't surprised. It was flat and even threw in an antagonist from a prior movie (or at least looked like one) that could have been used much better.The only reason I'd advise watching this movie is an example of what not to do.

289,allisonlscates,Annabelle: You're in for a scary ride,7,6 October 2014,"I just got finished watching Annabelle, the prequel to The Conjuring. My only fault with this movie was that there didn't seem to be an actual plot; it felt like a lot of scary stuff was just happening. However, I found the overall movie to be very scary and I thought it did a great job of building suspense through sound, imagery and lighting. Not knowing much about the movie before I saw it (aside from the fact that it was about a doll), I didn't know what to expect from this film. I thought that it might be slightly reminiscent of Chuckie, where a doll goes around terrorizing people, but Annabelle is much more than that. The first 30 minutes of the movie nothing scary really happens. We just get introduced to the characters and learn how the doll gets possessed. The main characters Mia and John live in Santa Monica and are expecting their first child, but after they are attacked in their home, they relocate to an apartment in Pasadena after John gets offered a new job.It is after they start living in their new apartment that the paranormal occurrences start to occur. What I liked most about Annabelle was that it used a lot of different 'monsters' and 'scares' throughout the film as opposed to it solely relying on the menacing looking doll. There are a few occurrences of invisible things pulling Mia. Doors repeatedly open and close on their own. Electronics start turning on by themselves. We see a dead woman walking around haunting Mia. And perhaps the scariest monster was the Demon/Devil that we see repeatedly midway through the film. An interesting thing to note is that although the movie is titled Annabelle, we never actually see the doll 'move' and that these paranormal occurrences seem to only effect Mia, her husband John never experiences anything. I also liked how the film used lighting, sound and imagery to scare the audience. Annabelle is filled with a lot of long, dark corridors. Lights flicker on and off. There are a lot of footsteps and thuds. And of course the classic which is loud fast paced music, followed by silence, then a screamer. I also really liked how the monsters actually looked scary and not just silly (like the monster from Insidious). Overall I really enjoyed this movie. It made me and my boyfriend jump several times, so I found it to be pretty scary. The actor that plays John (Ward Horton), I found his acting to be pretty mediocre to terrible, but that didn't ruin the movie for me. Also, the ending is not the best but, I would watch this movie again.",Annabelle

Annabelle was introduced as a mild character in The Conjuring that seemed not to have much meaning behind it, but, as the story led on, Annabelle is the reason why The Conjuring happened in the first place. Using the use of Annabelle as a demonic character was an additional attribute to the horror story leading on from The Conjuring. Annabelle was an amazing horror flick with great scares that are unexpected and unpredictable. I was on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the screen the entire time.

293,markhale-22640,Dummied down,4,9 September 2015,"A dichotomous spurring sub-plot from its conjured sister, the devilish dolly from the ""The Conjuring"" manifests its feature length solidity with similarly fathomable truth. Bolstered by its historically accurate credo, the real-life accounts of psychic investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, the accursed bisque (in actuality a Raggedy Ann) becomes demonic conduit for - yet again - an occultly idolised grim hellbent on - you guessed it - sapping the souls of the innocent. If I've made the film sound rudimental and routine, thats because it is.Though anachronistically sturdy in recreating a 1970's vibe: TV sets like chunky microwaves, the ideologically pruned nuclear family, archetypal catholicism, society's infatuation with the occult and druidism, women represented as maternal machines with a knack for sewing - and mention of Manson's racially apocalyptic helter-skelter - what Annabelle lacks is some proliferant panache in its antique format. The short-lived killer toy sub-genre has elapsed, be it or not that the doll has long been considered an evil- harbouring entity in folklore. Blame the cabbage patch kids in the 80's, a craze in adopting toys as kin and provoking emotional attachments to prepare adolescents into parenthood from the earliest of ages. Chucky winces in his good guy dolls box, for annabelle trips up drastically short - perhaps the tagline 'based on a true story' really hindered the film's intensity, perhaps its just not fashionable to lever fear from toys - unless its an enchanted Xbox or psychopathic PS4.I've got no strings So the doll - it looks creepy, but all the way through the film, the viewer sees nothing. No creepy head-turning, eye-rolling - just implied movements and a semi-serious, prudish levitation scene. Static camera shots, extreme close-ups, creep-zooms and abstractions but no gimmicks. The final act of Toy Story, with Woody on the barbecue grill warning Sid to be nicer to his toys, imbues a greater dread. I've got stringsA concerto of violinists stab their instruments. Juxtapose the recorded sounds onto any suspenseful moment. Amplify the sound to a million hertz. Voila, a simulated scare tactic so effective it requires no visual connection. Humdrum being the optimum syntagm, aside from one particular scene (involving an elevator), the film struggles to breakaway from generic traits in an almost desperate attempt to scare. Taking the bisqe-uit, it's a surrogate spin-off too placid for outright franchising, 'Annabelle' loots upon accolades of its mongrel parent.The real shame is that its just not scary. The narrative just too conventional, the suspense just too hammy. Highlighting its few violin-sawing jump scares, ""Annabelle"" is a commodified marketing campaign to whet the appetite for the second ""Conjuring"".",Annabelle

297,vikasthegunner,Fails to Engage,6,14 January 2015,"My friend and I considered watching 'Annabelle' on the big screen. But we put off our visit to the cinema and decided to wait for the DVD instead. It turned out to be a good decision. While 'The Conjuring' did nothing new to the horror genre, it was still a solid movie that hit all the right notes. When a spin-off about the creepy doll was announced, I was suitably expectant, though fully aware that the movie might fail to impress, as most spin-offs generally tend to. As horror movies go, the plot is straightforward; happy family – Quiet life – Bad purchase decisions – Trouble comes knocking. The actors are serviceable at best. Ward Horton simply exists to play the supportive husband whose duty is to innocently wonder if his wife is losing her mind. Alfre Woodard is the sympathetic neighbor who seems to have the right answers. But it is the leading lady herself who stumbles. Annabelle Wallis who plays the role of Mia Form is hard to empathize with. Throughout the movie, with deranged satanic cultists, ghosts and demons running around, she remains largely composed. A horror movie's biggest draw is its ability to depict the abject terror of its protagonists and for someone whose life is threatened by supernatural forces beyond comprehension, our leading lady manages to retain an air of aristocratic primness as though the things happening to her are as bothersome as milk gone sour. The movie could have made good use of the fear of the unknown. Instead it puts a face on everything and offers simple explanations for every occurrence. The doll itself manages to lose its scare factor by the end. This, in my opinion, is the movie's biggest drawback. Rent it if you'd like something that doesn't tax your mind.",Annabelle
298,sof_gr,Not satisfied,3,31 October 2014,"Annabelle as a character and of course by appearance is very scary and the cast was satisfying. The sound of the cinema made it scarier and I wouldn't expect to feel so terrified if I had to watch it at home. During the movie I was really scared only three or four times and that was all. Classical story of a thriller. In addition, the trailer revealed many things about the movie, so I knew what was going to happen in some crucial parts of the movie just by having watched the trailer. This fact was very disappointing. Generally I expected much more fear from this movie and I was not as satisfied as I thought I would be.",Annabelle

300,coldfusion9797,"It's Slow, Not Bad",6,3 May 2019,"I'd heard that this film was bad, but with the new Annabelle film approaching I decided to watch it anyway, and catch up on the one film in the Conjuring franchise that I hadn't seen.
The production quality, as is the case with the whole franchise, is great. Annabelle isn't a poorly made film, it's downfall comes from the slow plot. That being said though, I understand what the writers were trying to do, they are trying to root this film in reality. The climatic 'scare' moment when Annabelle levitates isn't scary on screen, but if you take a step back and think about what it would be like in real life, it would be terrifying.
Unfortunately, that's not enough to elevate this film to the level of others in the franchise, but it's certainly not as bad as I was lead to believe.",Annabelle
301,drewmeister11,Best comedy of the year!,3,5 October 2014,"I went to see Annabelle on the good faith I felt towards the movie it was spun off from, The Conjuring. To put things in perspective, I enjoyed the Conjuring but didn't find it particularly frightening once they revealed it was another exorcism movie. However, the cinematography and the repeated tendency to make legitimately scary scenes without relying on jump scares earned some serious respect from me, and I went into this expecting a similar experience. It was not to be.First off, the clichés in this movie are overwhelming. From the disbelieving husband to the wise old black woman who dispenses sage advise when exposition is needed, this film hits on all the tropes we got used to seeing in horror movies back in the '80's. It also relies heavily on jump scares to trick the audience into thinking it's scary. When you use wind to make the audience jump then you are probably doing it wrong. They heavily foreshadow certain elements and devices in several places only to have it either turn out to be completely irrelevant or a total letdown. Early on they keep showing her at a sewing machine with her fingers right next to the needle while she distractedly watches TV. ""What's going to happen?"" you wonder, ""Will the machine whir violently out of control? Will the ghost startle her so much that her fingers get stabbed and sewn up?"" The answer is none of those things. She accidentally cuts herself watching TV, but then washes it off like nothing happened and goes back to work. Then the house catches fire (not because of the sewing machine, though).There are also certain plot points introduced only to never be explained, such as a symbol that's left upon her arm that she finds in an occult book (of course there's an occult book lying around, why wouldn't there be?). They point out that it's from a cult, but never explain what the mark itself means. My friend had to tell me it was some mark of a ram's head, but I thought it looked like a really shoddy attempt at writing the letter 'A' in cursive. It's also a little strange that the demon left the mark on her arm just by grabbing her, only to have it disappear a short time later.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that there's a demon in this movie. Apparently even the director realized that a possessed doll wasn't very scary and decided to have a demon appear halfway through to scare the woman. This made no sense since up until this point it seemed pretty clear that it was a cultist lady who was possessing the doll. So it turns out that a demon was moving it around the entire time? Why? Well, supposedly it's a link to our world for the demon to come through. Even though he has no problems leaving it far behind, can seemingly teleport it at will, and whose very presence seems to change the entire tone of the story. It makes it even more nonsensical in that there is no reason for the doll to be moving around. If the demon is just picking it up and moving it when nobody looks then... why? What does that gain him? Is he just messing with everybody? When you realize that this entire movie is basically about a demon playing with dolls it becomes a lot less scary.What's sad about the demon is that his main appearance in which he confronts the girl in the basement is actually really damn scary. However, since it's more or less his only real scene I couldn't help but feel it was extremely pointless. I'm not even sure right now if the movie was about the doll or the demon since it was that exact moment that the entire movie derailed itself into an unfocused mess that left me with more questions than I was likely supposed to have about the film.This is a movie I really wanted to like because of The Conjuring, but since the audience kept laughing throughout the film (except for some high-school girls sitting in front of me who kept whispering how they were ""about to cry"" only to turn around after the movie and assure each other that they totally weren't scared you guys)I feel like I'm not alone in the assessment that it was actually a comedy in disguise. A comedy with some scary bits, to be sure, but a comedy none the less.",Annabelle
302,bryllefajardo,"Had moments, but overall a mediocre movie. Probably because of the bad acting.",6,5 October 2014,"Yeah, so first of all, I had high expectations for this movie but I tried to lower my expectations because reviews were bad so I liked it but nah, it still disappointed me. Why?I hated how all the characters lacked common sense. The female protagonist's (Annabelle Wallis) acting was just... plain awful. I cannot withstand her bad acting because it made some scenes feel so lame. There were many useless scenes to extend the running time of the movie that made it even worse. i.e: The kids sitting on the stairs. It really made me thought that there was something wrong with them but no, after that scene, they just...vanished. And I was like, seriously?! no explanation for the subplot?! It was like a good subplot that had a lot of potential to get a backstory added into the movie but was just used to consume the running time because the only scene that made it worth watching was the Elevator Scene. 5/10 I'm guess pretty generous for giving a 5 but it really deserves a 4/10 because of it's mediocrity.",Annabelle
303,marcellhernandes,Simple and good movie,8,16 July 2016,"I don't understand why people don't like this movie. Well, maybe I do. The same happened whit the Thai ""Shutter"" and its called ""sequence"" ""Alone"". The last movie is very good, but it has no direct connections with the first one. And it is frustrating, because of the expectations. The same happens with Annabelle. It's a good movie, with a very simple production. Story's OK, it's not a Chucky like story. I should say that the movie is so simple that I could have made it myself. One of the costumes was terrible. That's the only reason why I'm giving 8, because they had funds to do it better. But the Story's OK and there's something else: Annabelle actually exists. Search the Warrens' Museum before you watch the movie. It's a very nice add to the conjuring story (but not a sequence, neither a prequel, so don't expect any links).",Annabelle

The soundtrack is wonderful. I wasn't expect which the movie was so demonic and terrible. I recommend for the all fans of the horror movies. The actress Annabelle Wallis act so good, I've never see her in a horror movie and she makes a great work. When I saw the doll I think how much she is ugly, ""God have Mercy of your Soul"" is the slogan of the movie, The priest (Tony Amendola) act better than ""The legend of Zorro"" and the others movies who act. In The Conjuring the haunt is a horrible witch, something more human. In the Annabelle the things are more scary and creepy with a mysterious demon with a black and creepy face.",Annabelle

I know the trailer says 'Before The Conjuring, there was Annabelle', now I've seen The Conjuring, and it wasn't fun! As soon as I saw the Annabelle doll, I didn't want to watch. I'm not too bothered by story's of china dolls, and how devil spirits are supposedly best suited to them, but surely the doll doesn't look like that in real life? Why would your husband buy that for you? It doesn't make sense. Obviously, like other scary films, it involves a baby and has old fashioned music. However, the trailer to me shows how Annabelle takes horror to a whole new level. Random people walking through their house while they sleep? Dressed in white robes? If it is a true story, my head would be messed up! I rate the trailer at a 4, I think it's too much just for a trailer.",Annabelle

310,brandonchristie82,A whole lot of nothing.,2,3 October 2014,"I went into the cinemas expecting to see an average horror film, since the Conjuring surpassed my expectations and included genuine scares. Wow, was I disappointed. This film's first hour lacks any content - almost absolutely nothing happens. When things do get amped up, it only happens in one scene and for a couple of minutes. The relationship between John and Mia doesn't exist - they're a couple yet the scenes between them are awkward; the acting is atrocious in this film. The so called horror scenes are generic, cheesy and short-lived, toppled with repetitive music we've heard time from time. Legitimately half this film (no joke) is wasted on slow zoom ups on Annabelle's face. And of course, this film just had to have an irrelevant scene of a girl in a white dress with long black hair - have western movies not gotten past the whole concept of the Ring? Stop obsessing over that idea and make your own!! This film lacked content, acting, a story line, characters I gave a crap for and genuine scares. Waste of money.",Annabelle

Some likely waiting to compare it to The Conjuring, others followed the fact that a spin-off cant make a good movie. For me both were wrong.This movie isn't The Conjuring at all, and in my opinion does brilliantly as a stand alone movie. I though the story line was near perfect for what the film had to achieve in its ending, the story was quiet overall but very sharp when it had its moments. And this is something that personal preference takes the reins with. I think the story would have got overcooked with much more than what was there in terms of horror ""Action"".Annabelle Wallis did very well in this movie too I think, a very well cast character, light and serene always makes for a better main character in these types of movies for me.I see this movie as a movie all of it own that just happens to explain a small part in The Conjuring rather than a spin- off.

I felt no real connection to any of the characters, and to be honest, I couldn't have cared less if they lived or died. The rest of the franchise has put a lot of emphasis on character development, but I didn't feel any of that in this movie.I don't have much to say about the acting, which I suppose is a good thing. Great scream-queen material from Annabelle Wallis, which could have saved this movie if they had given me even the slightest reason to care about her character. As with the rest of the series, the look and sound of this movie is top quality, and you can tell there is a lot of expertise that goes into the cinematography and sound design of this movie. I thought the scares were one of this films best qualities, with a few moments that really made my jaw drop, but unfortunately there were too many lulls between these moments to keep my full attention throughout.With all that being said this is a perfectly competent horror movie that is more than worthwhile if you are a horror fan, and absolutely not one to miss if you are a fan of the Wan/Flanagan brand of horror.",Annabelle

I've seen a LOT of horror films (as one can assume from my user name), so I'm more critical than most of horror films but this one was honestly very well done. The actors did a fantastic job, the baby was adorable, and that elevator scene and the stair scene following it were absolutely phenomenal! I don't jump, scare, or become startled easily at movies whether in a theater or at home but this one managed to freak me out and make me jump a few times. The elevator scene just kept me on edge waiting for the demon to reappear and grab her or drag her or something! Then when she was running up the stairs and stopped to look back and all you can see is this vague dark outline and your thought process goes ""Wait is that the demon...? I think it is. Oh god, it is!"". Truly classic horror movie techniques. I get so tired of slasher films that only want sex, rape, nudity and blood. I'm sorry, but a man running around just cutting off naked girls limbs isn't really terrifying. Also the part with the priest running into the church with the doll, I expected the girl to be standing in the church all like ""Haha holy ground my ass!"" and then slaughter him, but instead he went flying back towards the street where she stood which caught me off guard and made me jump a little.The only part I'm still a little unsure of whether it was beneficial or negative is when Mia (the mother) is in their dining room and the doll is sitting on the ground then floats up and you see the demon/creature thing standing behind holding it and it shows its face... It's definitely a decently creepy demon, I just sometimes prefer only a somewhat reveal of it like when it was on the stairs. I feel like showing its face completely can take away the horror of the unknown.Really, people should give this film a chance.

This movie, however, irked me so badly that I feel the need. Let's start off by saying that the title of this movie is 'Annabelle', correct? Yep. So where is this doll the entire movie? Nowhere. That's right, this is where the plot falls apart and everything goes downhill from there. The doll is hardly in the movie at all. She moves a total of maybe two times (excluding the 'climax' of this movie in which she is overused). I had a very hard time finishing this over-hyped example of trying too hard to be original. The beginning is too slow and it doesn't get to the point until the movie is just about over as well. By the end of the movie, I just wanted it to end and was happy that they at least hadn't killed off the bookstore owner... and then there is yet another attempt at being original and failing miserably. This lady (who, by the way, had nothing to do with any of this) plummets to her death out the apartment window and gives her soul to a demon. It was this part that enraged me the most for the mere idea of killing a good character off when there was no reason to and another ending could have been made (because the director clearly wasn't actually making Annabelle off of the true story) is barbaric and uncalled for. I am disturbed with the outcome of this movie and, quite frankly, I didn't even want to award it one star, but there was no option lower, so I will state it here.0/10 stars",Annabelle

Instead this movie gave me what other horror movies don't....the actual demon! Finally a movie went balls out and showed us what was lurking and stalking the characters. The design and costume of the demon was good too, sometimes you see its arm and other parts, but you also get to look it straight in the eyes face to face, and no its not just a creepy nun or some weird human its actually a demonic entity.

The movie takes it's time with getting you attached to the characters and you want them to survive. The scares in this movie were much better than i expected but unfortunately the trailer spoiled a few of them. Returning to my summary: the overall ratings and critics reviews are severely under rated. I believe this happened because people saw Annabelle and thought ""Oooh The Conjuring 2"".

323,Lievalle,Nice horror movies,7,29 September 2018,"The avarage rating and the metacritic score for this movie is an example of how much horror is still the most underestimated genre in cinema( and beyond). This movie is an averegly good horror, that rely a bit too much on cliches and ghost movements to build the mood, but that is enough well shot, well acted and well written to be enjoyable and fun. In ten years we won't look back at this movie as a game changer, but I will remember it like a fun movie. Isn't it enough to reach at least a 6.0 average or a 50 in metacritic score? I think yes, specially after i see on this website that horror masterpiece hardly reach 6.0 and that being part of marvel cinematic universe give a movie the right to at least a 7.0.
Do me a favor, before you give a vote to an horror movie stopfor a second, thuink to your previous votes and ask yourself if you are being fair to the movie or just misjudging a gente.To comment the movie i think is a nice add to the conjuring universe...if this is the lowest entry( as a lot of people say) is the signal of how much quality, despite the clear commercial intentions, this movies are bringing on screen. The movie look good and the plot, even if not really original, is a good mix of ""influences"" and is not boring or cringy. Some scenes are really creepy and some jump scares are really good( yes jumpscares are not necessary a sin), but the general atmosphere of the movie is not too much haunting so you will walk out of the cinema without paranoia and nigthmares( if you don't sleep with dools in the room).",Annabelle

326,boycalledmullins,Inspired Horror in an Uninspired Package,7,10 June 2021,"Annabelle had a lot to live up to after The Conjuring - a film that breathed new life into a thoroughly played out genre. Unfortunately, it did not do so, and has endured an inflated amount of bad press as a result. The key to The Conjuring's success was a combination of truly well-crafted scare sequences, together with an engaging narrative and cast of characters. Director John R. Leonetti recaptures the first of these two components very well in Annabelle, but unfortunately falters with the latter.Both movies follow a formula that involves long periods of potentially terrifying situations turning out to be completely mundane, before then following through with the terror when sufficient tension has been built up. Annabelle uses the same fantastically executed visual and audial techniques to attempt to build this tension, but an audience will only feel a sense of dread if they actually care what happens to the characters on screen.In a word, the characters in Annabelle are bland. As a result, the long periods in between jump scares tend to end up feeling similarly bland - which is never a thing you want 50% of your runtime to be described as.The blandness is far from unbearable, however, and encased within it are some incredibly well crafted scenes. The home invasion near the start of the film is scary as hell. The elevator sequence is unforgettable. The eponymous doll herself is perpetually creepy, and the moment we finally catch her in motion is perfectly harrowing. Speaking of dear old Annabelle, she is featured sparingly but just enough to retain her fear factor, and I cannot stress how good a choice it was to avoid turning her into a Chucky-esque creature that walks, talks and murders on-screen.Throughout all of these shiny and not so shiny moments, our peripheral vision is bombarded with endless potential hazards - teasing us with the anticipation of a scare at all times, with a successful pay-off pretty much every time it actually follows through. The film is undoubtedly scary. Many people will argue against this point, but these same people tend not to be phased by any Horror media and thus set unachievable standards for 'scariness' (which is entirely subjective regardless).Overall, the two sides of the Annabelle coin come together to make a somewhat average film, but a must-see experience if you are a horror enthusiast!",Annabelle
327,robertjd-1,Guaranteed to make you jump and your skin crawl,7,30 October 2014,"It seems like a while since I watched a horror movie with religious themes. The movie starts with a cult attack on a beautiful young couple and later gets the Catholic Church involved. Nothing gets the imagination going than the all powerful good vs evil. Add to this the creepy look of the doll and settings and you've got an entertaining horror.That being said, the movie is full of clichés and stereotypes. That's fine because the depth of their character is not the main attraction. The movie sucks you in slowly with the creepiness that by the end you're willing to just go along for the ride.",Annabelle
328,andrewberry73,entertaining and fun,8,1 August 2015,"Upon watching this film for the first time I thought that this film was going to be a female version of Childs Play(1988).Although the storyline and plot is very much different I find that there are similarities to Childs Play such as defeating the doll in an apartment flat.Putting those aside, it is an entertaining film to sit and watch. There is always something just around the corner to make you sit up and take notice and that is important in a horror film of this type as I have come across other films in this genre that I felt didn't live up to their name and expectations. After a man gives a doll to his wife as a gift to add to her collection, the neighbours get killed by a ""Manson"" cult, the doll ends up becoming possessed by one of the members of the cult. Strange unexplainable things then begin to happen but when the couple moves the entities follow them to their new home. Some of the film appears to parody ""Rosemary's baby(1968)"" once the film settles into the flat. But that's my opinion. The last overall scene's were very good and well written, but the open ending was a bit disappointing.",Annabelle
329,mailboxvivek,Horrible Acting ! Poor screenplay !,1,5 September 2016,"One of the least interesting horror movies I've watched! I'm not even comparing this to ""The Conjuring""!Weak story line, pathetic acting combined with inexperience of the filmmaker make this a complete time-waste !Where do you even find such actors ! It's a shame to call the actors ! The female lead is horrible when it comes to performance! She is just a good looking model ! Nothing more ! I'm surprised, how did she even land up with this role! Maybe through a godfather in industry !Such an important and impressive theme, and she makes a mockery of all of it! They have better actors and and a better story in porn movies !",Annabelle
330,a_grau,Great lullaby,1,11 January 2015,"This movie is just as scary as a Barbie movie and just as interesting as Teletubbies. If you're looking for a movie to fall asleep with, this is the perfect choice, but if you're looking for a scary movie choose anything else than this. The 60'ies setting doesn't interest me at all, the ugly doll is only begging the question ""who in their right mind would ever want to own such ugly doll, let alone put in own display"". The movie is also extremely predictable. Here I was watching the movie half asleep (maybe 30 minutes into the movie), pretty sure I actually did fall asleep a few times, when my wife asked me what I think will happen, unfortunately my predictions were correct",Annabelle

This film has got a lot of jumps and scares which keeps you scared till the end. Not much story, but sound effects certainly did a good job with fine camera positions. This is not a conjuring kind of film. so, not to compare both. There are certain scenes which takes us to the edge of the seat. And thats what we expect...Don't we?? But why do Annabelle need a soul??? Thatz sound amusing. Isn't it?? As a whole, this film is worth watch twice in theatres. If Horror is your Genre, then this is the film!!!",Annabelle
332,horrormoviegrl,Annabelle: The Indecisive Demon,6,10 October 2014,"I had been anxiously awaiting this movie for nearly three months. Being a James Wan junkie, I could barely sit on my hands until Annabelle hit theaters... I mean, come on! Demonic Doll tries to slaughter beautiful young family? Where could it go wrong? And yet, somehow it managed to go wrong in every possible way I hadn't thought, and even created a few more ways to go wrong along the way.If I could describe the movie -- It would be 'Indecisive demon terrorizes family for sacrifice only to turn out to be perfectly comfortable accepting just about anybody.' The movie's core 'meat and potatoes' nearly had to take a backseat to the unnecessarily extended amount of footage allotted to absolutely nothing. Literally. Nothing. Family washing dishes. Family changing baby. Family goes shopping. Husband and Wife talking about how much they love each other.Don't get me wrong, the most effective horror movies invite the audience into a sense of normality before striking hard and heavy -- But the scares in Annabelle could have happened regardless of those scenes, or at least with less than half of the ones that there were.You should leave a horror movie feeling the resonating chills still tickling your neck. Annabelle just left me frustrated and more focused on my leftover popcorn then what I had just watched.All that being said, there were some clever scenes that were pleasing cinematographically, and were really the only reasons I didn't rate it even lower. The chase up the staircase mid-movie, for instance, or the basement storage room/elevator scene, I had thought was 'Japanese horror movie' good.Ultimately, what scared me the most about the movie was that it had amazing potential, and wasted the vast majority of it.And that pi**es me off.",Annabelle

A cash grab spin off from the Conjuring series that completely departs from what made those films successful.Skip at all costs.",Annabelle
334,hipsterheroine,Pushed The Limits,8,29 March 2015,at first i thought Annabelle would not be that scary of a movie. haunted scary doll? completely over done. but boy was i wrong. this movie definitely made me lose sleep for nights. there were moments in this movie that definitely left me wide eyed. one part in particular was (spoiler alert) when the main character could not find her baby and when she went to look in the babies crib all she saw was Annabelle. then she proceeded to slam the doll multiple times on the crib and throw it across the room and then it made her believe it was actually her baby and not the doll. this movie definitely left me scared. i've seen a lot of scary movies in my life but this one was definitely one of the best.,Annabelle
335,lilliehardwick,Not as bad as I thought,7,27 December 2016,"I think that due to the sheer exhilaration that the conjuring brought forward it was going to be hard to make a sequel/spin-off, but Annabelle was surprisingly okay. The action started pretty quickly which is always good to keep a horror going, the plot line was also very fluid and flowed nicely with the horror which made it feel more realistic as we get to see the characters. Annabelle Wallis plays very well as the distressed mother as she can easily show her emotions from terror to surprised she gives it her all. Ward Horton also portrays his character very well as I truly hate him for dismissing everything his wife says which I'm sure was very precalculated. I also think that the film becomes more of a thriller near the end as the victim is the baby, Leah. It truly makes my skin crawl to hear the screams of the baby and the scared shouts of the mother as a demon tries desperately to separate them. The best scene in the whole film has to be when Mia believes that she is attacking and hurting Annabelle but it is actually another doll but for that split second we are lead to believe that it was Leah she was throwing about. On the whole it wasn't as disappointing as I thought it would be.",Annabelle
336,kimberlymendez,Classic Horror,5,30 September 2015,"Annabelle is a movie that does exactly what it is supposed, horrify you, but it's downfall is that it has a poor story line. The story revolves around a family that is expecting a child. John, the husband, gets a vintage doll, Annabelle, for his wife, Mia, as he believes it is the perfect gift for her. But strange things start to happen to them, for Annabelle is haunted. The movie's success is in how it creates suspense and fear. For instance, the scene that leads up to their house burning creates suspense in two ways. As Annabelle, turns on the stove to burn the house down, Mia is in her room sewing. The camera slowly zooms in on Mia's finger that she is using to sew, which alludes to her soon cutting her finger. To add on to the suspense, non-diagetic suspenseful music that slowly gets louder is used to create a build up to her cutting her finger on the sewing machine and the house burning. The movie's downfall though, is the fact that it mainly focuses on horror, not the story line. Mia leaving her baby unattended several times throughout the movie does not add up to the plot because she knew strange things were happening and eventually finds out Annabelle wants her daughters innocent soul. To conclude, Annabelle could be better if it was made to be a bit more realistic by simply changing some of the characters actions.",Annabelle
337,lagcatswins,Crappy movie by lagcats,2,27 February 2016,"OK.This movie was so god damn hyped its ridiculous. Everyone was so hyped because its a ""doll-killer"" movie. They also stole a lot from other movies to make this one which is pathetic. The Annabelle doll exists in other movies just so people know. I wont spoil because its some scenes in this movie that shows it.Well if you want to watch a crappy movie about some doll that kills, then watch it i guess. There are way better ""doll-killer"" movies out there like Childs play and all those classics.This was hyped for nothing and i was extremely disappointing. I hope the people that made this movie watches this review and realize how bad it was. I'm sorry I've seen pretty much every Horror movie out there and this is just beyond bad.Don't waste your time.

So predictable movie, we didn't even got scared, maybe once or twice, just one of us was scared at all time. He liked it... but it was just him.

I went to this movie with high expectation expecting it will do justice as a prequel to one of my favorite horror movie ""The Conjuring"". But I was really disappointed after seeing this movie. It lacks that story line, effective narration and of course the horror element. Except for the couple of scenes there is nothing in the movie. First 30 minutes is really boring. I felt this film has borrowed scenes from famous horror (don't wanna mention names) and just added bit of its own story line to it. There is nothing in the movie which keeps you to glued to your seat or keep on your toes. For a horror movie I personally feel background score plays a crucial role which is lacking in this movie. Over all fun to watch provided if you expect least from the movie.Pros: Couple of scenes. lead actress performance (she is not great but of all she is good) Ghost animation (Which I feel similar to the one in Drag me to Hell)Cons: Not scary No interesting story line Expected narration Loud background score",Annabelle
341,SugarDougy,"AMAZINGLY creepy - maintains all the quality of ""The Conjuring""",9,10 October 2014,"When James Wan came out with ""The Conjuring"" and then ""Insidious"" i thought a new sub-genre of horror has been created. That of substance over ""cut-screen"" scare shots or the Splatterfest, ""Gore- or"" movies that were so popular in the last few years. WHen i read, James Wan was NOT directing i got admittedly nervous, but John Leonetti not only maintains Wan's level of excellence, imo he surpasses it in many respects. Approaching the tension with a slow build rather than a ""haunted house"" jump scene, was so effective, that during one of the many ""Collective Scream scenes"" where the entire theater jump- started, yelled or both, one girl sitting 3 rows in front of me, just got up out of her chair and sprinted out the exit door (not sure what she was running to, but i'm almost positive what she was running from).Anyway, i fully expect there to be reviews from the ""too cool"", arm chair adrenaline junkies who claim to be ""unshakable"" in their choice of horror viewing and would probable claim no movie will EVER scare them, but for my $13.00 (not counting popcorn and Twizzlers), this movie delivered on average more scary images per minute than any film i have EVER seen in my entire life!!",Annabelle

I liked getting that tense feeling in my stomach, the tension building, than just when you think it's all quiet, BAM, they get you with some surprise you weren't ready for. Now I watch a horror movie and I all I end up doing is seeing how many times an can guess what's about to happen based on the scene. That is basically what this movie was to me. A very big, and very long guessing game. The whole time I was watching I just kept trying to figure out what would jump out. It's not a bad movie but it was nothing new. I do like the premise of it. As its a prequel to The Conjuring it was very good, but as a horror movie it was not. While I enjoy a little back story now and than, I prefer it to be interesting.

345,melissa-hanung,Jump Scares Galore,5,24 October 2014,"First, I'm glad I didn't watch the trailer... because it's not a trailer, it's a spoiler. They put the best scares on the trailer so it might have ruined my viewing experience, had I watched the trailer first (luckily I didn't).I got mixed feeling about this movie. The good points first then. The atmosphere is creepy, the acting is nice (especially the lady/mom, she's excellent). They build suspense from trivial things (like the sewing machine), and the simple ""unknown"" factor. The elevator scene is genius!The bad points, in my opinion, is the overused of blasting sound effect that denotes horror/ shock. It's cheap, and unfair. And it happens ALL THE TIME. Some things can't be explained at all... it's just seem like made up things to add to the creepiness but once you think about it, it doesn't make any sense (I'm talking about the drawings here. Come on now, the doll spent some time to draw those prophetic drawings? Where's the logic to that?? And I'm not talking about normal logic, I'm talking WITHIN the movie logic). Also it has really bad moral message in the end that makes something seems to be a good thing where such thing NEVER is a good thing. There are other ways to get rid of that doll, one of the possible solutions was to call a SWAT TEAM or whatever and escort that doll to another country... for example. The ending is the worst part in my opinion.",Annabelle
346,goodeygirl99,Annabelle,8,11 October 2014,I really loved Annabelle because I loved the conjuring and I like the way horror movies have been coming up with wonderful ways to scare us lol. I gave this movie a 8 out of 10 because I think that they could've gotten some bigger screen actors or actresses to play in the movie. I did jump like once which is extremely hard to get me to do so I'm happy a scary movie could do that for me. the story line was great I will say I didn't really see anything bad about this movie. I guess I just hoped to see some of the actors from the conjuring lol I know it's a different movie and all. Plus I found out that Annabelle was a raggedy Ann doll not a porcline doll which is even creepier lol,Annabelle

The acting wasn't great, but I did like the story. It had better cinematography that most horror films. There were a lot of shots that were pleasing to the eye. It is not nearly as good as The Conjuring, but its worth watching. The doll is pretty creepy throughout the film. The one thing that killed it for me is that you did not really feel attached to the characters. I think they could have done way better with the casting. In the end, you didn't really care what happened to them. Overall, Annabelle is not as good as The Conjuring. Wait till you can red box this one.",Annabelle
348,alan-micron,"Outrageous this only has 5.7 rating, brilliant horror.",9,10 November 2014,"I have recently gone through a phase of watching a few horror movies that I never got around to watching, which includes Insidious 1 and the Conjuring.I am lost for words how anyone can rate Insidious as a brilliant horror movie, I guess it is a sign of the times that putting excruciatingly loud noises when something supposedly scary is on the screen into a film means it is terrifying. That is Insidious all the way through, it is not scary at all, it is a cheap and pathetic trick to scare the audience, you watch those scenes without the sound and they are laughable, Insidious is a joke film yet scores so highly on here because loud noises scare people.I thought the Conjuring was much better than Insidious but still both do not come close to Annabelle. John Leonetti did a better job with this film than James Wan could ever have dreamed of doing.The tension created without the need for outrageously loud bangs sets this film apart from all the tiresome and clichéd films that have come out recently. The sewing machine scenes, the oven scene and the lift scene alone created more tension and horror than any loud noise can create, it was executed perfectly. Even the scenes where nothing happened but you were expecting them to were done perfectly. Sure the film isn't perfect, but as a horror it is beautifully paced and the tension is built up brilliantly. It is easily one of the better horror movies I have seen in the last 5 years. I do not usually watch lots of American horror films because I find them all very similar, similar stories, similar scare tactics so I tend to watch more Korean, Japanese and French horrors but I was pleasantly and massively surprised with how well this movie was done.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and I put it way above the horror movie comparisons on here such as Insidious and Conjuring, its not even close, this is way better. The fact this film has such a low score really says to me either there is something really dodgy going on with IMDb film ratings or people really do have no taste in real horror movies only the cheesy and ridiculous loud noise/cheap scare ones that are in abundance these days.",Annabelle

The scares are unrealistic and the movie has hardly anything to do with 'Annebelle', it actually sort of ruins Annabelle herself, who was actually cool in The Conjuring. The story makes just about no sense at all and is just plain stupid. There are much better movies out there, try The Babadook, Sinister, The Conjuring, Insidious, Ouija, Housebound...hell, just about anything.It seems like they were just trying to ride the train of The Conjuring and had no original ideas of their own.",Annabelle

351,gagjeffro,Average,6,22 February 2017,"Annabella I decided to watch this tonight because I watched on live cam them moving the original Annabella from its original case to another case . Not 100% sure why I think it was more of a portable case so they can carry around to take on lectures . and feed naughty kids to . They wore protected gloves and said a prayer then lifted her from its place and placed into the other case then said another prayer. It was a interesting watch but not much to it and only lasted around 8mins, I was expecting a bit more, example a bit of history and background of the doll & story, and maybe a closer look of the doll before putting it into its case ..Now let's be fair we all have some interest in supposedly true stories like these . I say supposedly because I'm referring to ghost \ possession \ haunted etc stories like Amityville horror etc where stories of serial killers we know are true and did happen . Now to me I honestly don't believe the whole Annabella story and there no real proof to back it up except the owners story ...and what they say Now if you don't know anything about the story films like these slightly irritate me because it had no real connection at all about the doll except the film was based on a doll and really used Annabella name to cash in and get a wider and bigger audience. And if you don't know that then you would walk away from the cinema thinking this was the story... After all i had to once explain to someone paranormal activity wasn't true .. But she wouldn't have it because at the end before titles it gave a brief outline of the story as if it was true and because of that she believed it was true otherwise why write that at the end ..face palmThe film itself was half decent and watchable but several element's of the film annoyed me , like for starters scare tactics .. Was there any ? Where the music suddenly BOOMs making you reach for the remote control ready to turn it down..and making you jump in same way as if you walking along street and a friend jumped out from nowhere and loudly shouted boo, NO need that's not scare tactics more of giving you a bloody heart attack tactics, a horror will scare you and keep you edge of your seat on what's happening with atmospheric music in the background. Several scenes reminded me of other horrors like Exorcist and omen where she was pushing the pram with the child in, she had both hands on the pram, then suddenly bent down to pick her keys up that she dropped, while doing so the pram rolled into the road and got hit by a truck.. But that's OK the child was safe because she had hold of it in her arms close to her chest. was this some sort of magic trick to impress pen & teller I like to know if it fooled them in how she did it. Personally if I was to watch a story based on something true like a doll , I would watch a independent film of it than a Hollywood film for several reason, but main reason being is the makers of the indie film would research the story and try to stick as closely as they could to supposedly the real facts, where the Hollywood film would put there own spin on it and exaggerate to suit themselves .",Annabelle

The doll is lifeless, and about as wooden as the acting. I thought at least we would of got eye movement but no. It stayed slumped on a chair. As for the people saying its creepy, and on a par to Childs plays chucky. Lies its nothing alike. I would say avoid it and go see ouija instead far more creepier.

356,mcgin123,Just as Bland as Expected...,4,29 October 2014,"Annabelle was a nice plot device to establish the kind of work the paranormal investigators, the Warrens, did in the before the main plot of The Conjuring started and it probably should have stayed that way. Annabelle is one of those films that are so okay that it's a problem. The film is a prequel/spin-off to 2013's The Conjuring and serves to tell the back story of the possessed doll (Annabelle) that is showing in the beginning of that film. In this film we see that it began as a doll eventually possessed by the spirit of a criminal and that instantly brings Child's Play comparisons to mind but at least Annabelle doesn't use unexplained magical words to make it happen. Throughout the film we see the spirit possessing the doll doesn't do anything physically but manipulates objects in the environment and causes mental delusions. The film decides that it needs more clichés and adds in the fact that everything that has happened is part of some mysterious demon worshiping cult, shadowy monsters to attack in the dark basement, A priest being shown that ""The Light of God"" is easily overpowered by any demon and a character to make a seemingly random ""heroic sacrifice"" that in the end serves to accomplish little to nothing. The film isn't anything special and is made up of elements we've seen a thousand times. Overall, I don't feel like there is any real incentive to go see this movie it doesn't add anything to the genre as a whole and doesn't really feel like we are learning anything worth our attention about Annabelle past the first ten minutes. The film is a little less than okay because it just uses tired film ideas and feels like it is playing it too safe because of it.",Annabelle
357,aefertino,"Creepy but not frightening, disappointing but average",7,20 October 2014,"In my personal opinion, I didn't find the movie nearly as atrocious as many others have. I think perhaps it was more disappointing than anything since The Conjuring managed such an effective opening with our star doll. It also set what I consider a high bar for modern horror. I think a story centered on the actual Annabelle would have been more interesting and in tune with Conjuring's 'true story' presentation.I didn't find the dialogue so unbearable as some consider, and while it wasn't a scary film to me, I found it creepy. And I found the inhuman antagonist far more unsettling in design than the one in Insidious.Ultimately, as opposed to tension or fright, what I thought an eerie atmosphere is what kept me following. Of particular note, I enjoyed the sequence in the middle of the film most, when ***SPOILER*** books threaten the child, and Annabelle is lifted by the Demon***END SPOILER***I'm sure many will disagree, but I found this movie perfectly average. Either way, I enjoy it. Everyone has guilty pleasures, but I don't feel entirely guilty with this one. Here's eager waiting for The Conjuring 2!",Annabelle
358,TheDiggingestDog,A well made and worth watching prequel.,7,9 November 2014,"Thoroughly enjoyed the film. It entertained and kept me watching. The late sixties setting and Manson occult throwback is a breath of fresh air and helps show the different faces of horror as not all neatly fitting into the hater's box of gore porn. The suspenseful build ups and scares are often nothing new but the film successfully keeps its atmosphere throughout. Though not being blown away, it is a very well made movie and a fine prequel to The Conjuring. Too much of The Conjuring was given away in the trailers. The trailers for Annabelle I ignored intentionally and because of this, a few of the scares jolted me here and there. The film also isn't what many expected or wanted it to be for other reasons, 'Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?'",Annabelle

The doll wasn't as central to the story as one would expect, rather it was more of a symbol of evil in the film. There was some nice character development, an interesting plot, and plenty of moments where I had my mouth wide open because I was terrified! This movie is a lot of fun, and (to my surprise) I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a movie with fun scares and ACTUAL substance to the storyline (radical concept for a horror film).

There were only 4 shock scares throughout the whole movie.It seemed to me the doll was not even possessed, just a demon who enjoyed playing with it. I actually noticed more bloopers then scares. I found the characters where just thrown together with no development and outside characters made no sense as to why they were even in the movie since they added nothing. I believe that this movie would have been best served going strait to DVD instead of being offered in movie theaters. For the lack of any attempt to develop the characters or even attempt to make the doll demon possessed(IE moving around on its own, glowing eyes) The one time they actually showed the doll moving by it's self was portrayed as a demon holding it.

Essentially Rosemary's Baby meets Child's Play for the Paranormal Activity generation, this sees a young Californian couple firstly caught up in a ""Helter Skelter"" spree by their next door neighbour's cultified estranged daughter and then ""menaced"" by a demonic doll she may have invoked before her passing.

The actors are good but the lack of story line makes it boring.Altogether the movie has ONLY 2 terrifying scenes.And yes-THE DOLL-which only flies once in air. Well..You can skip this movie and watch others like The Conjuring,MAMA,The Cabin in the woods,etc. So from me a 2 out of 10.",Annabelle
362,aguchi69,Dolly,7,5 October 2014,"I was pretty much sold on this movie when part of the description, mentioned Satanic Cult included. I missed the opening first few minutes, but that was OK, I guess, anyway, my only problem was that I didn't know who theses actors were? But once I got passed that, I sat along for the ride. I really enjoyed the crowd response in the theater, some were screaming with fear at particular scenes. This movie had some elements that were related to Rosemary's Baby, which was kind of a downer because it lacked some originality, but all in all it was a good average experience. You'll be in for a surprise when it comes to seeing the dark shadow revealed, at least I was.",Annabelle
363,beckych91,Such a let down.,2,10 October 2014,"I have been waiting for this film to come out for a while and I was hoping it would be a good horror. It came out today in the UK so me and my boyfriend went to see it in cinemas. We were so disappointed. I am the type that could jump at a door slamming unexpectedly but sadly this film didn't cause me to jump in the slightest, in fact I cannot see how this film can be labelled as a horror. Admittedly the doll was freaky and would scare me if I came across it but the film kept trying to provide cheap thrills.They could have made this film so scary if they wanted to. The storyline slightly reminded me of the film chucky, the only difference is, is that chucky is actually good.",Annabelle
364,jpcabas813,Extremely mediocre and boring,6,3 October 2014,OK... Going into this movie I knew that it was very likely for this movie to be a failure and guess what.... It was. An extremely boring movie that barely made me jump and lost a lot of the creepiness from The Conjuring. The acting is just so plain and bland just like the scares. The movie doesn't even actually explain everything that is going on in a manner that makes sense. There's demons and then a grayish looking creature and a lot of it isn't explained. It's like the director just said put this in there and this... and this. The ending isn't satisfying either. There is no reason to go pay for this movie. Seriously. Don't waste your money. Wait until it comes out on blu-ray or something. The writing was also very odd at times... With Anabelle you're left with a bad taste in your mouth...,Annabelle
365,jackshapiro55,Great Movie,9,4 October 2014,"I rate it a 9/10 because it had/was a: Great movie. Good plot. Great jump scares and Great acting. Other people writing reviews about this movie are telling you it's not good because it doesn't connect as much as they want it to, to The Conjuring. Sorry, but this movie is called Annabelle, not The Conjuring 2. The people who gave it less than 6/10 probably got so scared that they hated the movie. Overall, this is a great movie leading up to Halloween and I would definitely recommend everyone who loves horror movies to see this soon or on Halloween as it will leave you never wanting to buy a doll for yourself. Also it's well worth your money to see it in theatres.",Annabelle
366,thulsadoom1981,Don't bother.,1,11 February 2015,"If you're like me and you enjoyed ""Insidious"" 1 & 2 and ""The Conjuring"", then you were probably thrilled at the thought of a movie about Annabelle, that evil doll alluded to in the Conjuring and part of the Warrens' legendary case files. Having read up on the famous demonologists, and knowing the ""true"" story of Annabelle, I was excited to see the idea continued from that brief tease of them interviewing the hapless nurses at the beginning of ""The Conjuring"". Well, I was wrong. Instead, I got yet another even briefer tease that launched into one of the lamest most boring horror films since ""The Apparition"". If the writer(s) had just stuck with the Warren's story, they would have had ample material for a good horror flick. Instead, they cooked up some prequel crap following a boring couple in the 1960s. In many scenes it's as if they forgot the doll was a key component of the movie and would cut the camera over to her face as if to say, ""Oh yeah, the doll...she's evil and stuff...right?"" The actors seemed like cardboard cut-outs with no dimension or points of interest. It's not all there fault as the script seemed like a first draft from a middle school creative writing class. Even the great Alfre Woodard was wasted, given a cliché role (the spiritualist occult bookstore owner with a past that knows more than meets the eye), and no good dialogue. There was very little conflict save the female protagonists supposed decent into madness which came off like she was just a little agitated and would benefit from a Valium and a nap more than being bogged down by the forces of evil. There was literally nothing scary about this film...nothing! I recall only one uncomfortable moment toward the end involving the couple's baby which was more disturbing and turned out to be a red herring anyway. The rest is pretty tame. The entity which ""appears"" for a split second in the film (À la Captain Howdy) isn't A fraction as terrifying as the lipstick demon in Insidious. Frankly, Ned Flanders playing the Devil in one of the Simpsons Tree House of Horror segments was scarier. As a viewer, I could tell the filmmakers were going for a ""Rosemary's Baby"" meets ""The Exorcist"" vibe, but they failed miserably. Don't waste your time with this, just read the account of the Warrens and Annabelle at night alone and use your imagination. Whatever you come up with will be 100 times better than this steaming turd of a movie.",Annabelle
367,lucious-101-135643,At least one wannabe jump scare,2,11 October 2014,"This is only a small review about ""Annabelle"", but the movie will never deserve more than that. Overall, this film is about satanic cultists that invaded the home of a family and the upcoming problems with a ""cursed"" doll. Now you'll maybe think, that this will only be the tip of the iceberg, but no... you could easily sum up everything in another sentence. This movie contains only two sense that fit into the horror genre, all the remaining 90 min you will only sit there in the hope that there will be more than that.... but no there isn't anything. I couldn't even say what the rest of the film is about, beside boring unnecessary talks between the characters.The acting is quiet okay, specially the role of the mother was believable. All the other things like the pacing or close-ups on the doll are more than bad and destroying every horror aspect the movie could build up.I could write more, but I don't want to. I just want to forget this waste of time and move on with Gone Girl. PS: Sorry for my writing skill, its not my native language, but i will try to improve this.

I don't get scared easily , I had seen hundreds of horror movies but this one really scared me , the basement elevator scene is the scariest movie scene of all time ( I'm still shaken up by it ) If you want to get scared than go see this movie . Don't listen to people who haven't even seen this movie . Its genuinely scary and I can handle a lot . its about a doll that is possessed and wants to take the main characters child ( her ""soul "") , it has some very intense scare scenes , I would say the best scare scenes ever filmed but the doll itself isn't scary at all .",Annabelle
369,devincrim25,Forgettable,4,4 October 2014,"The story follows a man and his pregnant wife (?). The man (don't remember either of their names and I saw it 15 hours ago) gets the girl a hideous looking doll as a gift ,I guess. Later on they are attacked by two lunatics in a Satanic cult. One of the lunatics stabs the pregnant woman in an attempt, we guess, to kill the baby (Keep this in mind). The couple survives, but the doll is now cursed and is determined to haunt the family and take the soul of the baby. The couple moves, and all of the typical ghost-movie things happens. After the first 30 minutes it takes literally an hour before something else noteworthy happens, which seems like longer in a theater. Enter random old black lady. She adds nothing to the story, and her story is completely irrelevant to the main story. In fact, we aren't even told how SHE got involved with the paranormal, or why she would involve herself in the troubles of this family.Another 30 minutes goes by. At this point I'm just ready to get home and watch Sportscenter. The movie ends with the black woman sacrificing herself in order to save the baby and the woman. So thats that I guess. The only purpose the black woman served was to save a white family being haunted by satanic spirits. I'm not offended, really I'm not. But her character wasn't even warranted in the first place, and why would the demonic spirits want her when its invested so much energy taking the soul's of the baby or the woman? And since when does soul taking involve dying? Isn't the point of possessing a soul, possession? Why then was the man in the beginning of the movie trying to kill the baby? lol just stupid.I tried to like this movie, and there are parts that are redeemable. It is not scary however (assuming you are over the age of 6) and there are plot holes littered all throughout the film. The ending was god awful, and I wouldn't doubt if they came up with it on the fly. I swear everything about this movie got worse as it went on, which was far too long. Don't spend 10 dollars, and 2 hours of your life on this movie. Go watch Denzel's new movie, or Space Jam reruns. Both are more compelling and scary.",Annabelle

Annabelle when first seen the trailers wasn't sure if was going to a good movie on its own. But I was wrong.Don't know how many times I jumped in my seat watching this movie and some of the reactions it was getting from other people in the crowd. It really keeps up the scares and frights and tries to keep them at a good pace throughout the movie. Now this is by no means better than The Conjuring but it is pretty close. The doll is terrifying and I imagine a lot of people won't be looking at their dolls the same again after watching this.,Annabelle
372,joe1597,Great film for Halloween,8,12 October 2014,"I don't really understand some of the negative reviews, its one of the best horror films that I've seen for a while, some bits will terrify you and leave you frightened even after you have left the cinema. From the moment you see the doll you can tell it is evil and to be feared. However the story and story development are not as good as ""The Conjuring"" but it contains much more jump scares and scary moments. Unfortunately though you are left with a few unanswered questions after watching. Definitely worth a watch though, even if you haven't seen ""The Conjuring"" yet but be warned,there were lots of people screaming in the cinema when I watched. 8/10 a great horror film, just in time for Halloween.",Annabelle
373,dariusz-pytiak,Not what I expected.,6,16 October 2014,"Right, when I saw the trailer of Annabelle I reminded myself of how much I enjoyed 'The Conjuring', but when I realised the film wasn't directed by James Wan, I had a bad feeling. I mean, the idea for the prequel had a lot of potential. Knowing where Annabelle came from was pretty interesting and could of been presented much better than it actually was in the film.The start of the film is okay. The scene of murder was pretty good, intense, but then it just got worse and worse. It was slow-paced and just a bit boring (ignoring the fact that someone actually fell asleep in the cinema and started snoring). There was definitely not enough of the 'jumpy moments'. Finally, after we see first few paranormal occurrences, which still were not great the film catches a bit of tempo.Then the film goes on, the main protagonist (Mia) researches about the cult etc, what they always do, the actual demon itself looks creepy so fair play to the directors for that, but overall the film finished rather abruptly.I was expecting a lot more of Annabelle after seeing Conjuring or Insidious, but for me it was just a bit too boring and too 'normal'.6/10.",Annabelle

I understand this is part of the Horror genre that i so love, but.. this is ridiculous to the point to making fun of you.

Waited til the movie was on DVD and got it from netflix. I was expecting at least a 2 hour movie when i read it was only 99 minutes i thought it was strange but still was expecting a very scary movie. The movie was slow, boring and not scary at all. Reading about the real doll is scarier then this movie. The only people this movie might scare are children. Not even worth watching on Halloween not even in a dark room all alone. you won't be scared one bit. Best to watch a scary movie made a long time ago when scary movies were actually scary.

At one point is Mia talking to ""girl Anabelle"" through another room and as the door starts to close the girl runs towards her and enters her room as the dead adult Annabelle.

""The Conjuring"" was a fantastic movie—typical ""Modern Horror Film"" but with a touch of original SWAGGER. And then there was ""Anabelle"". Do not get me wrong—the way the film is suspected to be, is exactly how it is. A creepy raggedy doll, a half possessed paranoid wife, and a loving husband. Barbie and Ken go horror. A woman who befriends the wife, and does not find her demonic beliefs too far-fetched. A priest who actually ""BELIEVES"" the evil is present—and knows the SOURCE. Like it is in a Priest handbook? Scenes where the camera is focused on a window and the curtain blows in the windand you jump up SCREAMING! Of course, I do not underestimate the writers and directors—there is a lot of good horror in this film. My verbal rating?

It's awful. And I'm not saying this because they were like only 2 moments in the movie when I feel some kind of fear ( One of the moments was in the trailer so... ) It's just that the characters were boring and everything was so forced..

As it is the film that got me into the genre i will try to provide a non-bias review.The film opens with the opening of the conjuring that being of the Annabelle case and it does it's job it sets the tone of the movie going in. After it we are introduced to our main characters Mia (played by Annabelle Wallis) and john (played by Ward Horton) after a cult breaks into there home they start to experience strange happenings.now i won't spoil the plot anymore but i will say one thing more about this film.

The only part that made me scream was when the devilish finger popped out at us. I screamed and flung popcorn every where and throw my feet um on my seat. My brother started to cry so he berried his face in the bucket of popcorn. That was the best night ever. I have never watched a movie with so much going on and all had to do with a doll with rosy pink cheeks. After that I had dreams about having a doll like her and it was amazing but frighting at the same time. After I watched the movie I wanted a doll like Annabelle for the longest time ever. My mother told me I was crazy.,Annabelle

It doesn't add anything new! Instead of actually showing the doll do scary things, they show demons and ghosts. I wanna see Annabelle! The exposition is interesting but it takes to long. Things started happening 1 hour into the movie! Even then, there's like a 10 minute boring scene after each 3 minute scary scene. The ending scene is the worst though. It doesn't even make any sense!",Annabelle

The weaving in of socal 60s and manson murders and ""cults"" could have been more thoroughly explored, it was not made into major enough scenery. It's kind of tedious to have every one of these movies have to prove over and over that if you move out of the first house, the demon will follow you to the next house. Can we do something else? How about ""stay in the first house"", see where that goes?The ending is just inexplicably rushed or anti-climactic, like they were running out of film and had to cut it short.

386,steven-735,Good October Fun,8,1 October 2014,"Okay folks. This not an Oscar film for sure. It is also not ground breaking by any means. Hell the only thing even remotely true about the film is the first maybe three minutes. This is every horror movie you have ever seen rolled into one. One minute you feel like your watching Rosemary's Baby. Then Rosemary is in the Amityville house. The next moment here comes Chucky with even a little Helter Skelter thrown into the mix. But everything I could say that is wrong with this film is exactly why it works. it embraces its cheese factor. Even revels in it at times. The film has some great scares and in a few cases some real interesting ones. It is just simply a lot of fun to watch with a lot of people. So much so, when Annabelle reveals herself fully you find yourself really into it. I thought the ending was weak but by the time you get to the end it would be very hard to raise the level suspense any higher. There is a scene with a sewing machine and Jiffy Pop which I think should go down in horror movie history for the right way to build suspense. It was funny listening to the audiences nervous giggles as something was about to happen. Go to this as entertainment and nothing more. Nothing deep here. Very little real here. It is based on a true story. However, based is a very loose word here. Three minutes is based upon a true story. Just good October fun.",Annabelle

How about with the most obvious fact that the movie strayed so far from the original story. If you have to use an overly creepy doll to up the scare factor, then right off the bat you're a sub-par horror movie director. Secondly, the original story takes place in the 70s, not modern day.The movie was a massive cliché. They took a legitimately scary premise in the wake of the high success of The Conjuring and released.... this.I really feel this should have been The Conjuring 2.

Nope! I think the idea has some premise but a plot that moved at a snail's pace and the lack of truly 'jump out of your skin' scares made it a total bomb. If the characters had realised that their doll was the reason for the bizarre happenings earlier then the film may have been rescued by a supernatural v. human battle with flying objects, invisible pulling hands (a la 'Paranormal Activity) and scary voices that sounded like they were pulled from the depths of hell.

389,Brohansen1,"Overall disappointing, but with glimmers of promise",5,17 April 2015,"For a movie that aims to scare you, I left the theatre very much unperturbed. While this is John Leonetti's most competent film, it pails in comparison to its much better prequel ""The Conjuring""; the scares and story (save for elements of the ending & a somewhat creepy basement scene) left me wanting. The acting is serviceable, but most of us never really go into horror movies for anything other than the scares. While this is the director's best film, it is in no way a great film; I do however have hopes for Leonetti's future films, coming from a career as a cinematographer his films will be visually pleasing. Unfortunately as of now that's where most of the pros tend to end. But it seems that he may be on the right track, although it may be a long journey",Annabelle
390,allison_smith13,Very disappointing!,3,5 October 2014,"I love a good horror movie, even some of the older cheesy ones, but I actually hated Annabelle. The beginning had potential with the cult thing but then it just turned into the same horror movie that has been released over and over again in the last 5 years. The story lines are always the exact same thing now - an object or person becomes possessed by a demon that wants to take a soul. Then you have the random noises in the house, the opening and closing of doors, the wife who gets tormented and the absent husband who isn't around that much...I could go on and on. Just the same old movie with another name. This was clearly just a money grab based on the fact that The Conjuring did so well - there was very little time or effort put into making this movie scary.

The last time we hung out was when the movie had released (July, 2013) so, we don't really hangout much. But he called after all these months just because Annabelle was about to release and we were just that excited. That was our first mistake.The horror in Annabelle is just good as compared to The Conjuring which was quite scary. There will be a lot of jerk and scare time and again, people in the back will be mumbling after a good scare during scenes - just normal - no problem with that. The problem although is in the story. Its confusing, at times does not make sense and you would think your nephew could write a better story.Acting: The Conjuring > Annabelle; Direction: The Conjuring > Annabelle; Story: The Conjuring > Annabelle; Horror: The Conjuring = AnnabelleWhy the comparison?

Every scene with that dark demon crept me out (mostly because I watched it with headphones on in a dark room) even to the point were I accidentally knocked my phone to the ground. It was quite refreshing to watch because of it's effectiveness in some of it's scares, yes even the most cheesy ones.However, it was still one of the most cliché modern horror films I have seen, the random door shuts, the loud noises, the house wife and her hard working husband who at some point will work late...case in point Insidious and The conjuring. It did also have a slow start which made me think it wasn't going to be a good film. Despite all it's cheesiness and lack of character development, I still enjoyed watching it.

393,mickigoles-235-457449,Fun and effective,9,21 October 2014,"I am an IMDb junkie who's never written a review, despite having strong opinions about many movies. I am compelled to put in my two cents on Annabelle as the numerical rating seems surprisingly low. My guess is that the critics are the reason for this. It's rare to find a scary movie these days that is actually scary. The movie isn't ground breaking but it is extremely creepy and had everyone in the theater jumping out of their chairs. It was also effective in building suspense and there were a couple of scenes that were so creepy that you could actually feel the terror that the character was feeling. I left the theater feeling like had just live through the experience myself. The cinematography and a surprisingly good performance from the female lead really draws you into the terrifying situation. Personally, I don't care how the movie provided the numerous jolting scenes, the fact is that the entire audience was jumping and screaming the whole time. We were all laughing at ourselves as you know that it's coming, yet you can't help but be jolted. I recommend seeing it in the theater so that you can enjoy the ride with others. It's similar to riding a daunting roller- coaster multiple times, you know what to expect but you still scream every time . It's not The Conjuring but it still works. Annabelle made my heart race in anticipation consistently throughout the movie which is highly unusual in today's horror genre. It's a solid, absorbing 90 minutes of entertainment that doesn't rely on gore tactics. I highly recommend it.",Annabelle
394,dave-237-640569,"Bad acting by the lead female, It must be why the low review score",6,4 November 2014,"The movie actually is entertaining and worth watching. How ever the lead female actor playing Mia almost ruins it. Her acting is not convincing, she shows very little emotion and is not convincing. She seems to mellow like she's on xanax in every scene to me. Everyone else seems like they are more convincing as an actor/character except for her. She isn't ""bad"" but she wasn't good enough in most scenes.As a director I would have said ""CUT"" and re-took just about every scene asking for more emotion out of her.It's still worth a watch. I believe from the plot, setting, decor, technology it's supposed to take place in the late 80s. She also feels way to modern as a character and doesn't have the look from that period in my opinion.",Annabelle
395,kartikkejariwal,Annabelle is not worth watching,3,25 October 2014,Annabelle takes the name of The Conjuring down.. not at all comparable to any horror movie.. horror element in Annabelle is tending to zero and the first half of the movie is like a family movie.. just a time pass if you have nothing to do.. seriously if you have nothing to do.. story contains no strength. Work of actors can be appreciated but the script fails the whole plot. Just a waste of money. It is a boring movie and no one knows why in many countries it has been given adult rating..I personally felt very dissatisfied after seeing this movie.. I was expecting more. The ghosts are not scary.. this movie is a very strange sort of movie..it has been stretched to this length..actually the story is only of ten minutes!...,Annabelle
396,franknaves,The fact that this movie is based on true events adds to the scare factor,10,25 November 2014,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It provided ample amount of scares causing me to jump out of my skin several times which is very hard for a horror film to bring out of me. The fact that I had watched a documentary about the real doll before watching the movie helped make it that much scarier. If you didn't like this movie it's probably because it scared you a little too much. If you found it slow perhaps you have a form of ADHD (no offense intended). I also loved the fact that they stepped away from the normal format of most movies about demons keeping them invisible and for short brief moments letting us see the terrifying creature.,Annabelle
397,AlexC_14,A good horror film with some original ideas,6,18 October 2014,"If you have seen The Conjuring and enjoyed it, then you will most likely enjoy Annabelle. In fact, I preferred Annabelle to The Conjuring because it wasn't overrated, which I felt The Conjuring was. Most of the reviews for this film were negative, so I went into it expecting it to be another clichéd, occasional-jump-scare type film that seems to be just like most modern horror films at the moment. Luckily, it turns out these reviews were wrong, and it turned out to be quite a good horror flick with some effective scare scenes. There aren't any well known actors in it but they actually do a decent job. Annabelle Wallis was the best actor for me, playing the lead role of Mia.There are some really cool original ideas to build the tension in this film, my favourite being the elevator scene, which really made you feel on edge. OK, there are some moments in the film that are a bit slow and sometimes they resort to a cheap jump scare if something hasn't happened in a while, but overall Annabelle delivers exactly what you'd want from a pre-Halloween horror film. Don't watch this film expecting to see a perfect story line and amazing acting, but do expect to see some pretty cool tense scenes and a decent scare now and then.",Annabelle
398,bandsquirt05,Amazing! Scary! Thrilling! Keeps you on the edge of your seat!,10,11 November 2014,"I loved this movie! I dragged my best friend with me (who is terrified by scary movies) and I jumped more than she did--but thats probably because she kept her head hidden most of the movie. Annabelle is the perfect creepy doll. She doesn't even say anything, yet she's still creepy as hell! It was a slow moving scary movie -- which makes this movie all the more scary. I don't like movies where they throw blood and gore in your face; thats too predictable. This movie had all the pieces of the puzzle to connect both movies (The Conjuring and Annabelle) together. I thought the part where the mother saw a little girl in the nursery, and just as the door was closing the girl came running and flipped to a crazy girl in a bloody nightgown",Annabelle

Not only is it boring, the protagonist acting is sooo 'wooden' more wooden than the ugly hideous Annabelle doll. There are sooo many loopholes, and i am wondering why the couple just don't burn the doll and dance around the bonfire. There were too many occasions in which Mia failed to look after Leah as one would expect a terrified mother to do. The main character has no expressions of fear and why did she decide to keep the doll after it was found at the bottom of the box in her new place? overall silly and lousy show.

402,sabine1215,So disappointed! (no spoilers),3,20 March 2016,"I really loved the Conjuring- the long, slow build up, the intelligent dialogue, and also the believability of the characters' actions. Annabelle, unfortunately , just didn't deliver. I had the biggest problem with the script and acting; the mother (really the major character of the movie) was an unlikeable, whiny, icy blonde who somehow came across as both passive and spoiled, with a pinch of arrogance and entitlement thrown in. Her face was a blank mask no matter what emotion she was supposed to be portraying. I just didn't care what happened to her at all. Not to single her out though- the acting was atrocious across the board, especially the priest who gets called by the couple. The only exception was Alfre Woodard, who played a book shop owner (AND who also very wisely chose not to be listed in the cast credits!!) I really love slowly building , intelligent horror like the Conjuring or the Others- if you do too this move will disappoint.",Annabelle
403,brandonahendricks1993,Ignore The Ignorance,7,22 October 2014,"When a movie like this is rated lower than the Carrie remake, you can be reassured that the people rating horror movies can no longer be taken as a credible source. Undoubtedly, this movie possesses some fundamental issues. With an average script and mediocre acting, Annabelle is by no means the best horror flick, technically speaking (does not measure up to the likes of The Conjuring). Nonetheless, the cinematography and direction are brilliant (very much a Wan-esque style since the director of Annabelle was the cinematographer for James Wan). Additionally, this has an elevator scene that is among the scariest of any of its contemporaries in the genre. The film is truly terrifying, at points. If I could give it a 7.5 out of 10, I would. It continues the recent upward trend in the 2010's revival of the horror genre. Definitely worth the watch!

I'm a horror fan that's why even if I really don't know much about making a movie but still I trust my own point of view if the horror movie that I'm watching is good or awful. Well, let me talk about the movie first, the effects was really great and very much appreciated the scene where the main character was looking at the little girl in the next room then suddenly run to her and show that creepy woman. It was really great. But the main character, the mother. .I don't know but her acting wasn't good at all! Maybe acting skill like Vera Farmiga and the one who acts as mother in the Insidious 1 and 2 (sorry I forgot the name) would really give justice to the movie. Just imagine, there are times in the movie where i really don't see or feel any frightening emotions on the mother's face - I just don't like her acting that truly ruins the movie (in my own point of view) because in all scenes, she has the scene were ""supposedly"" take the movie into a more scary one but she always fails to do so.However, the movie was good but I will never want to see that actress again in a horror movie because if she does, i will never have a chance even glimpse at it.",Annabelle

When did horror movies get so bad, there is nothing scary about them these days. All the best bitsof this film are shown in the trailers. Obviously this was just amoney spinner, thrown together to make a quick dollar. Don't be duped into seeing this on the back of how much you enjoyed The Conjuring, it is not a patch on it. Save your money & get a rental copy if you're that intent on seeing it, but don't waste your money on a cinema ticket. The acting itself was not too bad, i've seen worse, hence the 2 score.

The people whom own the doll in movie, don't exist in any way. The real owners were 2 young women. Also the people who investigated (the Warrens) weren't even mentioned in movie. Whats-more, the movie doll is completely wrong from the doll, the real one is a ""raggedy-ann"" stuffed doll.In 1970 a mother purchased a antique Raggedy Ann Doll from a hobby store.

As a prequel to The Conjuring I had great expectations and was highly disappointed. And now to spoilers. The ""ram"" guy was unnecessary and far too similar to the demon in insidious (a great scary movie BTW). It would have been enough with the couples daughter holding and controlling the doll. I understand that they wanted to have the ram there because he is a scary creature and makes for some scary moments and jump-scares in the movie, but sometimes less is more.

411,Ebonyxo,All I got was failed jump scares.,3,5 October 2014,"I honestly don't know where to begin. I went into this movie with low expectations that were met, now I figured this movie was likely going to be dodgy in terms of plot and I was correct. The first thing to consider if you plan on seeing this movie is, have you seen The Conjuring? If not, watch it first because there a couple of significant references that you probably won't completely understand without the back knowledge. Personally I think for a 'scary' movie to be considered scary it has to make me think or at the very least stick to my mind after I leave the cinema and Annabelle did neither. One of the many issues I had with this movie was the beginning and end of the movie as there was room for a nice link and the director/writer failed to create an in depth connection between the two. I believe if they had would have boosted the story significantly, I'm not sure if they are planning on making another movie to explain all of the stuff they missed in that sub-story but even if they do this movie was proof enough that it probably wouldn't be worth mine or anyone else's money. My problem with this movie may just be because I'm a stickler for detail, like I love it and that could be why I am so frustrated and annoyed, I mean there was SO MUCH POTENTIAL! I have so many questions that have been left unanswered, like please give me more information (I won't say what kind of information because no spoilers). Side note (before I forget) : It's 2014 why does the 'scariest' part of the movie look like they have had paint dumped on them? (You'll understand me if you watch this film.) Now to reference the summary of this review I need to point out the jump scares. The jump scares were the best part of this movie (even though most of them only appeared when the movie hit its half way point) as they gave me a good laugh as the people around me in the cinema squealed or jumped in fear, personally there was one in particular that the director did a very good job with and it was one of the highlights of the movie for me (maybe it's because little kids are creepy as hell...hint hint). One thing I really enjoyed in this movie was a scene that is within an elevator, this was a great part of the film as it had most of the people within the cinema laughing, me included, so if you decide to watch this movie that is the scene to look out for. In this movie there are multiple scenes that seem significant but really aren't, the was two characters in particular that I thought were for sure going to play a bigger role than what they did but they were shown only once and were never really referenced again, there characters were pair of children that had potential, much like this movie, that was never met. Now if you are just looking for cheap scares then I recommend you watch this but for people who want to be really scared, or enjoy their horror/thriller movies to be summed up nicely with little to no holes in the plot then I would not recommend.",Annabelle
412,scotta9503,Horror ? Not in this film. Not even thrills and chills,1,20 October 2014,"I have watched many many scary movies, some good some bad, none truly scary. Anyone who reviewed this film as scary or awesome obviously has not seen the film. This is a complete snore-fest, from start to finish. I saw perhaps 3 ""jump out of seat"" scenes where it was totally predictable on it and was yawning each time. The conjuring was a terrific film, and this one is just trying to score big bucks off that name with 1/4 the budget. I was left feeling angry and cheated. There was no depth, no character relation, no story-line, nothing to get you even remotely into the film, except ""saw the previews, this is gonna be so good !"" feeling you saw when you watched the previews and couldn't wait for this to come out.

It was so unique and that alone made this movie so much more enjoyable.There were also some other amazing jump scares that were unfortunately ruined by the trailer. The actors performances however were mixed but I think that was just the script's fault which was the worst part of this film since it was pretty cheesy. But everything else was surprisingly decent. Overall, it's a very fun movie that you can enjoy especially this month (cough...Halloween) but it's not really a masterpiece like 'The Conjuring'.",Annabelle

415,michael_verhoeven,Very disappointing slow moving movie,4,10 October 2014,"I really wanted to go see Annabelle after seeing the trailer, which made it seem like a good horror movie... But it wasn't.The movie tells too much in the first couple of minutes and then starts off at a really slow pace. Nothing much happened for the first hour or so. There were a lot of missed opportunities where genuinely scary things could be done. Unfortunately the director choose not to do that, instead he tries build tension and create a mood by having Mia move around really slow... which started to get annoying really fast.There were plot holes, strange reactions from the characters in order to make the story work and so on... In the theater I was watching, there actually were a couple of times the audience spontaneously burst into laughter at how stupid what was happening on the screen was. For me there were two scary scenes in the movie, those who saw the movie probably know the ones I'm talking about. And unfortunately even these scenes could have been made even more scary then they were.This was a story and a movie with a lot of potential, unfortunately it wasn't as good as it could have been.Annabelle isn't a complete waste of time, but if you're looking for a really good, scary horror movie, it's not for you.",Annabelle

It had the same jump factor as paranormal activity, and I was on the edge of my seat for the most part of the film! Unlike a lot of horror movies it stayed reasonably believable throughout the entire film and didn't not end with some insane half wit ending. This is not the conjuring, I'm not sure why people are comparing the two? But I think the comparisons are reflecting the poor reviews which would explain the lower scores!

It's like reading an open book, no suspense, no mystery.You can easily predict what is about to happen in the next scene. Such a disappointment.

418,desireelecluse,Just Bad......I was so disappointed.,1,3 October 2014,"This movie was just, ugh, AWFUL!!!!!!!!! I expected this movie to have the same formula as The Conjuring had. Scare people with suspense not with some cheesy CGI cast off from Insidious. If you took the demon from Insidious, cut off its tail, then you would have the demon in Annabelle. The story is supposed to be about ANNABELLE!!!!!!! not some stupid stereotype American family. The story SHOULD of been about the little girl Annabelle that was in the first 5 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE!!!!! If you watch the first 5 minutes then leave, you have the story of ANNABELLE!!!! If you want to watch the rest of it, be prepared, you barely seen Annabelle do anything. All she does is sit there and do nothing.Everyone scene is predictable, and when you think you will see something, you do, so it takes away all suspense of the film. The Conjuring knew that to scare people you have to make them think they will see something and then DON'T SHOW THEM SOMETHING!!!!!! That is the key, if we anticipate seeing something we will scare ourselves more. Blair Witch Project, Halloween, Jason, Nightmare on Elm Street, The Conjuring all knew this. Scaring people isn't hard to do with a horror movie, but when you feed it to us like were 2 years old, it isn't scary, it is repetitive and boring.A sad example of a sequel. Directors and Producers, you disappoint me. Only cool thing I found in the movie was the fact Mia's real name is Annabelle, which I think was a fun twist to the story haha! Other then that, it was a waste of $10 dollars.",Annabelle
419,mrfixit-crea,True to the conjuring legacy,8,5 October 2014,"I've been expecting a follow-up to the conjuring since the movie came out last year. To be fair I was kinda feeling funny when they announced the release of a prequel only a year after the first was issued, but still.We all know the downhill of saw movies that keeps repeatedly piling out of the Volkswagen in a call of duty or fifa fashion every year and I thought this prequel would have been sort of a bad movie. Since the conjuring have raised the bar quite high.But holy-cow does it live up, in fact you can say it's a stand alone movie that can easily redeem it's title. The amount of either jump scare and suggested are well balanced making it enjoyable to watch, in a nutshell the ambiance that is settled is disturbing and is supposed to be.Only blind spot the actor play that can be qualified as not as good as the overall execution, briefly said if you're looking for a good scare and potentially the better horror movie of 2014 this is a serious contender.Make your impression as well and go see it, definitely worth it",Annabelle

First thing I noticed though is it takes a good 30min before anything really happens at all. The director has no problem building his characters lol. It has a Conjuring/Insidious feel to it but definitely not as scary. Go into the mind set that this movie will be good, but nothing more. I did not lose sleep over this like I did with Insidious. Overall good scary moments and a decent plot line with some good acting. Go see it if your into scary movies. If not..... definitely hold out for DVD. My overall score is a 7/10.

421,lindseyluu-128-33265,Do not see this movie (spoiler alert),1,9 October 2014,"If you haven't already seen the movie ""Annabelle"" please do not go! I knew better than to open my mind to such a movie, but for the thrill of a scare I went last night. This movie is extremely sacrilegious. It saddens me to know that millions of people who may not realize it are being deceived. God warns us of false prophets be careful the media has a lot of subliminal messages out there. For instance in the movie...Evil triumphs over good...a priest claims he does not know what to do to help a family (this insults the power of God)...but the problem ends up being solved by a woman who sacrifices her soul to the devil...after doing so the movie starts quoting scripture from the bible to say that this is the ultimate sacrifice and that Jesus demonstrates this by sacrificing his life on the cross....I'm sorry but that is trickery, you do not win by sacrificing your soul to devil...he wins and that's what he wants. and Jesus did not sacrifice his soul to the devil either.. DUH! and yes I probably just spoiled the movie for some out there but to me I could not just sit here and be quiet about this. This is disturbing how scripture was twisted to make people think that losing your soul to the devil is a way to win over evil...I'm sickened. ALSO If you have not paid attention to several movies that have released in the past couple of years, the time is now to start looking into it deeper. Movies such as the hunger games, the purge, the purge 2, Annabelle, the conjuring, and a new one about the Quija board coming out...These movies are the devils way of desensitizing the population to pure evil. It's normal and entertaining now to see murder, demons..just evil. To me hunger games (yes it's a fantastic movie) but it's a clear warning of what is to come...(The chip implanted in their arms, a rich wealthy controlling govt., with people who have nothing, made to fight and to sacrifice innocent lives of children). The Purge, pay ATTENTION...the flowers they put in their yards that they support the purge but do not wish to participate..sound familiar (the passover, blood over the doorways) Also a higher twisted Govt. in behind all of the evil doings, the poor people being killed off first. Not only that this movie subliminally plants the seed that people may not realize...Most of the people in the Purge 2 that suffer are African American, Most of the people purging(killing) are white...This instills racism in people. Fighting amongst races is not what God intends for us. But seeing enough of this subliminally will corrupt the mind whether you want it to or not. And for that reason it is important to know what not to subject yourself to. If people are too caught up on fighting amongst each other and not coming together then we become blinded and miss the bigger picture...and lets face it we can't afford to do that. As far as the conjuring, Annabelle, Ouija...these movies promote exactly what they are about...Summoning spirits, demons etc. It frightens me that this has become entertainment. It's dangerous, it's not fun and games...It is real, God is real, the devil/demons are real. If you entertain it, act upon it, you will get what you are looking for and that just might be the lose of an eternal life that God promises us. I'm sorry this is so long but I had to take a minute to rant a little. People wake up!",Annabelle
422,moo_ser,Had the Horror but Dropped the ball,6,9 October 2014,"Who doesn't get weirded out by the slightly human looking Annabelle? Many people who lay eyes on her are immediately unsettled, and that makes for a perfect horror movie villain. The movie itself was good, it contained great jump scares, areas where the tension was palpable, and as we all know the ever present every creepy Annabelle doll. However, the movie sadly made some key errors that took away from some of the extra potential fear. If you want a decent horror movie to get the adrenaline pumping this might be your cup of tea, but it wasn't as panic inducing as I had hoped. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED STOP READING: The biggest issue with the movie was the fact that the demons face was shown. This should be a no-no for all horror movie makers, and here is why. In this movie it is made abundantly clear that this is the cause of a demon. The movie beats that fact like a dead horse, yet they still insist on showing the audience the demons face. Not a good move. As an 'inhuman spirit' we would assume that it shouldn't look human, and yet they always do. This immediately takes away some of the fear factor from the entity's appearance. I wont lie the movie had it going great with the chase scene where all you can see is the shadowy outline of the demon on the stairs, that was perfect, it kept the audience on the edge of their seats, and it was just far enough into the Uncanny valley' to make your skin crawl. But, alas they showed its face illuminated in a few scenes that followed and that, for me, took away from the fear aspect, because it looked like a human face, not as scary as a supposed 'inhuman spirits face'.Overall the movie was good but not great, if you are scared by jump scares and the classic loud noises in horror movies, then I would recommend that you go and see it. For you steeled veterans while there are some scenes of great misdirection and excellent use of the uncanny valley, it might leave you wanting a little bit more.~O'Halloran",Annabelle

They live in a house with friendly neighbors.In preparation for the birth of his son, John gave a doll to Mia, which he had sought all along. True, it is the Annabelle doll when it was new had already looks terrible. Surprisingly, Mia like the dolls and put it together with the other doll collection.The situation changed when the neighbor who is also a husband and wife killed their children, Annabelle Higgins told the missing and apparently chose to worship the devil with his boyfriend. Annabelle Higgins and his boyfriend then attacked John and Mia ""I like your dolls"", the words were spoken after Annabelle injuring Mia . However, police immediately shot dead Annabelle's boyfriend, Annabelle die while suicide and dripping blood into these dolls. ( I Like This Scene Then I Decide To Write It )PROS : - Scary Jumpscare - Storyline Is Simple And Easy To Understand - Basement Scene And When there are small children ghost suddenly turned into an adult, I swear I was surprised really - Sound Effect is Pretty Damn HorrorCONS : - The films is too short I Think , only 98 min - Ending Is Horrible - The Ghost In Not Even Scary ( Except The Black Devil With Horn )",Annabelle
425,ptluvwilfindaway,Pathetic,2,15 October 2014,"The first half contains absolutely nothing scary other than a short 30 second scene in the first 10 minutes of the film, where the main characters get attacked by the neighbours as part of an attempt to completing some demon ritual.There are a few split second shots of the devil, the ghost of Annabelle Higgins(the spirit trapped in the doll) in the last quarter of the movie. Thats it. Pathetic story. Presentation. Everything. They have cleverly used the name of ""The Conjuring"" movie to lure audiences into the theatre and try to kill them out of sheer boredom.",Annabelle
426,IAmTheDevil_Lucifer,Fear was not missing;but James Wan did..,6,19 October 2014,"I do remember a scene from The Ninth Gate of Roman Polanski where a man unlocked his elevator as well as library by pressing '6' button 3 times.Which means 666;Or 'Devils Number'.The camera did follow him quietly.However,In Annabelle,if i am not wrong,Mia did the same thing on elevator.I think,the scene requires a little attention to notice about.Especially,it would have better to give a brief idea about ""Sigil of Lucifer"" or ""Lucifer's curse"",Which we have noticed on left hand of Mia,done by ""Devil""...Although,the works of camera,sounds & make up was quite good.I watched the movie;& i am not disappointed.",Annabelle
427,maesglasfc,walk away,4,17 October 2014,"sorry seen this and I personally thought it was terrible, the husband is a doctor with no brains, the wife of the doctor again has no brains, you will know what I mean once you have seen the film, and lets be honest if you were up all night pursued by some weird creep you would leave the building, by the way if lifts do have alarms. The film is flawed with a poor story line. Why would the husband leave for a few days when his wife is close to delivering the baby and then the house catches fire and they still return to the house.The priest is really not with it and the lady from the book store decides she needs to get out. Sorry it really is a poor movie. Those of you who say its good really need to be tested or resign from the company who pay you for giving good reviews. No kidding this really is a pants movie seriously don't bother. Don't say I didn't warn you x",Annabelle
428,teresamullersousa,Disappointing...,1,18 October 2014,"It was a very disappointing experience.. I went to the cinema (haven't gone there for a long time) and I was very excited to see Annabelle after seeing The Conjuring. The movie lacks a consistent story or script. The only thing that could scare you are the sounds, nothing more. I like to watch a good scary movie with a nice, or at least plausible or appealing story. The story behind this doll and all that demons' stuff does not make sense even for a terror movie.Fell really short of expectations.. I am still thinking about the time and money spent on this whole movie experience",Annabelle
429,lockealh,"okay horror movie, contains the best husband ever",6,19 October 2014,"As a horror movie, Annebelle is pretty average. It doesn't build up very much atmosphere, and about 90% of the scares are jump scares.As a movie about a struggling family in the mid-20th century, I'd give it a 8 or 9 out of ten. They could have taken the horror elements out of the movie, and made it about a young aspiring doctor trying to navigate his way successfully through the world while taking care of his pregnant wife and soon to be young child while the world is changing into a new a frightening place around them.In other words, as a story about Annabelle, it's decent, but as a saga about John, it could have been one of the greatest stories ever told. He is a young man, fresh out of medical school, struggling to find a residency in 60's/70's California. A time and place of radical transformation for America. Not only does he have this pressure bearing down upon him, of trying to find a secure career while the world around him is changing, but he also has to be mindful of his soon to be baby and wife, who from the outside, probably appears to be going insane.He is a great man, always putting others first, and always committed to his relationships. His wife has a hobby of collecting dolls, and wants a super rare one? Fine, he blows the money he's scrapped together for rent for the next few months on it. Less than a week later she wants it thrown out? Fine, into the trash it goes. She sets the house on fire? Who cares, there has been a baby born, and we never need to go back to that place again. Wife is being attacked by two drugged out cultists armed with knives? Time to go in unarmed and beat them into submission. Wife is generally freaking out, the baby is in danger, everything is going to heck, time to get angry? Yell? Say this is too much, I'm out? No. Let's go to our church for marriage counseling because whatever is wrong can be set right with proper communication and compromise.John is a great, kind, loving man. The kind that I would like to one day emulate. I wish him the best in life, he deserves it.So if you're looking for a movie because you have a couple hours to kill, I'd take it or leave it as a horror movie. If you'd like to admire one of the best men who's ever lived, then I definitely recommend seeing the Saga of John.",Annabelle
430,aronaheb,OMFG! please I beg do not waste your time or life watching this!,1,21 October 2014,"OK, first of all I decided to make an IMDb account just to write a review about how crap this movie was. I cannot believe how poor this movie was it made me so angry and irritated me, the acting was horrible.the characters were just not very convincing I was not scared through this movie, I kept watching it hoping that it's going to get better but it didn't. The conjuring was so much better the acting the plot was so much better. Do not even waste your time watching this movie Annabelle because you will only be disappointed overall I'm giving this movie a 0 out of 10.",Annabelle
431,aleksandar_nicev,Awful,1,21 October 2014,"Just came back from the cinema AND this is so far the worst horror movie i'v seen i mean it started all good a nice story developed BUT as it was going on it was getting worse and worse it was getting such amateur low budget movie the story got all ruined and all the sound effects were trying to ""scare"" us but nothing special happened........very disappointed such a good story just done wrong.It is a perfect horror story but it was just so bad that i just wanted to leave the cinema early. i am not recommending this movie.all of you horror junkies will be disappointed after watching this one it's a new 2014 movie but done very very bad.",Annabelle
432,arial-deserae,Worst horror movie ever,1,22 October 2014,"I just wasted like a hour and half of my life watching this movie. Through the whole movie Annabel doesn't even seem to move at least in the chuckie movies you saw chuckie walking, talking etc. and then what tripped me out is why the hell would the lady mia go down to put something in storage and leave her baby in the apartment upstairs alone knowing that theirs an evil presence all around the house that is after her and the baby. ALSO! the scene were she drops her keys and the stroller goes rolling in the street and once the stroller gets hit she all of a sudden has her baby in her hand.... so many scenes were this movie just did not have any common sense. They could of had a better director do this movie because this movie was a waste of time I'm glad I watched it online through a website that was free rather then going to go spend my money this weekend to watch the film in theaters. this movie was awful and that's just my honest opinion.",Annabelle
433,nik_prime,Awful movie..,1,5 November 2014,DO NOT EVER WATCH IT !!! The worst movie I have ever seen. a waste of time and money and a total bore for anyone of any age. People of the world do not even go close to a cinema while anabelle is on and don't wait for a torrent to downloaded because it is not worth it.Excruciatingly slow moving and predictable with bad acting. There is no plot. Worst story you can imagine for a movie. Did not sympathise with the protagonist. I can not understand who vote for this movie more than one star.Even if you paid me a million bucks i wouldn't watch that movie again. I hope that my comment will save some people from wasting their time and their money for this trash.,Annabelle
434,chap_wjfc,The WORST film I've seen in a while. Just awful.,1,5 November 2014,"Terrible acting, boring storyline, not even remotely scary.I went with a group of friends to watch and was pessimistic before it even started, as most horror films are terrible anyway... and I wasn't wrong. This film is sooo bad that it's funny at times. Every time they build up suspense you know what's coming - it's so predictable.The lack of a decent story line could have been forgiven had the film been scary, but it wasn't in the slightest. Even the bits that are supposed to make you jump don't because you can see it coming. I was bored to tears and wasted 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.Don't waste your time folks.",Annabelle
435,xxxloveydoveyxxx,"Oh my god, make it stop, so boring",1,1 November 2014,"This movie is absolutely atrocious. I say this from the bottom of my heart, this movie will make a true horror movie fan feel nauseous. There are empty and ineffective jump-scares all about. The plot is hollow and pointless. The ""horror"" factor isn't there, what's so scary about an ugly doll? This abomination of a film is NOTHING like the chucky movies.Don't waste your time. The acting makes me want to cry, Same for the script. The plot is unconvincing and boring. Why was this made? Were the actors involved low on money? It seems like it. I was waiting and waiting for it to get interesting, and every few minutes I keep getting more and more annoyed. Again I say, avoid this movie, it might give you health problems, that's how bad it is.",Annabelle
436,kevinskw8,It Isn't Great,7,5 November 2014,"It isn't as exciting and scary as I expected. It's predictable and there are common special effects. I can rate 7/10, because it has interesting plot. There are playing great actors too. I think the most interesting is older woman from book store. In my opinion, the most boring character is the priest. There is one thing, which I don't understand, why the beginning is so long and boring. Annabelle looks very scary and angry. If I had it, I would burn it or something like this instead of throwing it away. It's classical movie cliché behavior. There are a few scary scenes like this one with a kid who transform into woman. I hope there will be a sequel, because the ending was like ""To Be Continued"". I hope the sequel will be more scary and there will be more great special effects, characters and better soundtrack and audio effects. I have one more question, where the Warrens are. Why didn't they help this poor family? Why does the priest look clever, but he isn't?",Annabelle
437,jlsurvey,Why the high ratings?,4,5 November 2014,"I read the user reviews and I just can't understand how people rate this movie so high. It contains nothing new to the horror genre and it uses almost every cliché there is, like a chair that starts moving or a LP player that starts playing music even though it was tuned off. I'm aware that using clichés can sometimes be a fun and smart way to homage the genre or even other movies but when they do it in this movie it just feels old and unimaginative, we have seen that in soooo many movies before. Sure, i can take that some of these clichés are being used to set a scary tone but when they stack them in every other scene I just get disappointed and annoyed instead of getting thrills. The characters has also been seen in a lot of movies before. Paranormal things happens to a woman, husband don't believe her, paranormal things happens again, husband believe her. It gets so annoying seeing this all the time. A lot of the jump scares were to predictable all though I have to admit that there was a few scenes that got me scared, like when child-Annabelle ran towards Mia and then turned into adult- Annabelle.I'll give this movie 4/10 and that is still being nice.",Annabelle
438,wasdd2,Puke thats what i want to do after i watched this movie,2,8 November 2014,"This is REALLY embarrassing of a horror the storyline is a bloody joke Half of the movie makes kinda sense but when the other half kicks in,ooh the poo is about to begin.The movie is pretending that the audience does not know whats going but is so god damn OBVIOUS,We could had a cool origin of the doll annabelle but NOOOO... we have to see how the couple is dealing with this doll it make me really sad that they had so much to work with but didn't deliver at all.Environment of the movie is always sunny and bright besides the ending and the basement",Annabelle
439,paulbills,As scary as my grandma,1,10 November 2014,"Well, the biggest pile of poo since an elephant dropped its load in my street. Not a single scare throughout the film, other than being charged £8 by the cinema to sit through the biggest pile of dross I've ever had the misfortune to waste my life on. Don't pay to see this, just, don't. You'll thank me for saving you the money, truly.In fact, the best bit of the cinema experience of this film were the trailers for other, scarier films - it's not good when the 1 minute trailer for another film contains more frights than the whole of the feature.I can only assume that the people who have written 10 star reviews for this are either the cast, or other people who work for the distribution company, because they must have been either paid to review it, or watched a different film.",Annabelle
440,samsungbilpro,Disappointing.,4,14 November 2014,"This was... Not terrible, not good, not remarkable. Annabelle isn't really much of anything, in my opinion. During and after viewing, I was left with the feeling of cliché, cheap scares and no real entertainment. The film's plot is that of an unexceptional horror flick. It's scares, far too few (Almost all of them are showcased in the trailers), feel predictable. Like many others in the same genre lately, I got the impression of the whole picture building suspense on which it does not deliver. Some more positive reviews talk of Annabelle ""reveling in it's cheesiness"", but I would disagree. It rather uses it as it's very foundation, which just won't do for a horror. So, to summarize: This is a mediocre experience, over-hyped, and not worth paying any money for.",Annabelle

Big mistake.This movie is a lazy, badly written horror movie. Irrational behavior throughout the movie - a mother thinks her house is haunted, but leaves her child alone every chance she gets! She even goes shopping and looking for books and have chats outside, with her child nowhere to be seen! People seem to wonder inside the house and first thing she does is leave the room and her child alone. Makes sense...She even gets to the trouble of buying a satanic book (a horror movie cliché) but never, ever, occurs to get rid of the doll. Oh, wait, she did, in the first 20 minutes of the movie. But then decides to have it back again!The actress is very good looking, but fails to deliver - her screams are blatantly faked. Poor editing.Movie is predictable and not scary at all. You will waste your time if you watch this one.",Annabelle

No goose bumps or chills guys just a scene or too.I am disappointed they have mislead the audience and were feeding only on the Conjuring.As a horror genre fan, Annabelle is a disgrace to the genre itself. No story connection, low-budget , awfully long filled with boredom. Script was definitely poor. No fault of the director he did a good job but the actors should have applied for a better institution for training.FYI Conjuring was one of my favourite horror film of all time. Disappointed!!

There is only 99 minutes in the movie 10 of that will be closing credits so really your getting 40 minutes of mediocre movie. 49 minutes of needing tooth picks to keep you eyes open and 10 minutes regretting every minute you wasted watching it. I'm being forced to write 10 lines which will be more entertaining than the actual movie. If its not a innocent baby in danger its the virgin. I really don't like clichés. They haven't even tied together the story. who, what, when, where and how. We learned that in elementary. PS the whole time the doll wasn't doing anything in this movie other than being a doll. STOP THE MADNESS!",Annabelle
444,chrisrees009,Failed to show movement of doll annabelle ain't no chucky,2,8 February 2015,"Very bad film, lacked in storyline and only consisted of occasional jump scares with loud high pitched sounds. The Annabelle doll was basically irrelevant as it didn't move or show any potential of life with just camera close up shots of the doll in different positions to state its moved on its own. This film tried to follow the film chucky but failed miserably as the chucky doll is more threatening and the audience know that the doll is a true killer who will have an impact to the storyline. This film should have brought the Annabelle doll to life as it was only scary only down to its personal appearance which lost its impact.",Annabelle
445,macdonncha,spoiler's people spoiler's - such potential but never got their,2,21 February 2015,the film is badly acted by a cold unemotional wife who never really expresses any real fear or happiness. an example was when she first got the doll took about 2 minutes to acknowledge it or when she is attached before entering into the elevator or when it chases her up the stairs. dis-jointed film where sewing machine gets more attention. i mean whats with the constant sewing. theirs also the fact that she never seems to get thats its evil rather she calls the police i mean seriously.film had such potential but only really gets good towards the end. could have been done sooo much better.,Annabelle
446,foryourentertainment12,Awful.,1,22 February 2015,"Well, those are 99 minutes I'm never getting back. I was warned about this movie but I didn't listen. The acting was so horrible it was laughable, the plot was cliché and predictable, and the jump scares were really stupid. The movie is called Annabelle, who is a haunted doll that taunted and tortured people, therefore the doll should have more screen time, but she hardly shows up or does anything. Chucky from Child's Play was way scarier, Annabelle is nothing compared to him. This movie was so unoriginal, I had to force myself to keep looking at the screen. It literally made me want to pull an Evelyn and jump out of a building. I have never been more disappointed by a movie, ever. Everyday, I keep losing faith in Hollywood and the movie industry. I think next time I'll listen when someone tells me about a crappy movie. Total waste of time and money.",Annabelle
447,ezc4371,Great premise.... Just not that scary.,5,11 October 2014,"""Annabelle"" is the prequel (of sorts) to the 2013 horror hit ""The Conjuring"". It revolves around John and Mia, a young married couple who are expecting their first child. John purchases the disturbing doll which apparently was missing from Mia's extensive doll collection. Things start to go awry and terrifying events start to happen at the purchase of this doll. Mia and John seek the help of a friendly book-store owner and a priest (two horror clichés in one movie!!!) and the twists and turns ensue. This movie had one great thing going for it its premise. Many fans of ""The Conjuring"" (myself included) have been looking forward to this since hearing of its announcement and release date. Unfortunately, it did not deliver the scares that its predecessor did. The scares in ""Annabelle"" were few and predictable as they were shown in the over-played preview. The characters were not developed enough for me to care THAT much for them and the overall plot was generic and forgettable. Going in I though this movie was going to be good or maybe very good but certainly not great. I left thinking it was sub-par to average. I wouldn't say don't see ""Annabelle"" because the curiosity is definitely there (especially for fans of ""The Conjuring""). I will say.. Don't expect much.",Annabelle
448,pelzervera,it kind of lacked... creativity,3,27 February 2016,"The movie started out well. Not outstanding but it caught our attention. Further in the movie it kind of lacked... creativity. The scenes were somewhat cliché. We missed personality even though the story has a history to it. The characters were behaving predictable and there is not much space left over for your imagination. ""A few shocking moments doesn't make a good film."" Overall a good story if new to the genre but an almost amateuristic production. The casting is one of the few things we liked about it. The actors are giving their characters a personality but sadly those personalities are a bit like any other ""paranormal"" horror-story.",Annabelle

It was really boring and we didn't see most of the movie.If you want to see a real horror movie that is interesting, you should watch ""The Conjuring"". It is nothing like this movie.-BAR",Annabelle
450,bentleyjdaniels,How anyone could rate this highly is beyond me.,1,14 September 2016,"There was such huge potential for this movie to be scary. Extremely creepy looking doll, backstory from The Conjuring , an old house and a baby. But instead of a genuinely haunting movie, we were subjected to an insulting plot with ZERO scares. I am not exaggerating. There were zero scary parts in this. Lots of zooming in on the creepy doll's face. You expect something to happen at this point. The head to move, the mouth to open, the eyes to blink. But no, there was nothing. Just a slow zooming in shot of a stationary inanimate doll.Look at the movie's budget vs. profit and you'll see why the producers wanted to make this movie. It was simply a cash making exercise with no thought given to the plot.This should not be classed as a horror movie. I've seen Scooby Doo cartoons which were scarier than this.",Annabelle
