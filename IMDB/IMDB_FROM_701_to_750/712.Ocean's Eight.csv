0,MartinHafer,Yet another enjoyable heist film.,8,12 August 2019,"Heist films are a pretty sure bet if you are looking for entertaining pictures. I could name many, many excellent heist films...and would have a hard time coming up with a bad one. In this tradition, ""Ocean's Eight"" is yet another really enjoyable film.Unlike the recent ""Ocean's 11"" and ""Ocean's 12"", this film in the franchise has a cast of all female thieves. I know some really hated this movie but I do seriously wonder if this was because of the female cast...not for any other reason. Why? Because the movie is very well written, tense, intelligent and well acted....and yet in reading through reviews I saw a lot of intensely negative comments. I saw a lot of 1s...and I seriously wonder HOW and WHY they would give such a score.The bottom line is that this movie IS entertaining and fun. Ignore the trolls out there and give this one a try.",Ocean's Eight
1,TheLittleSongbird,More cons than it has pros,4,24 July 2018,"Really liked the 1960 'Ocean's 11' film and the first film in the original 'Ocean's' trilogy just as much, could find little fault with either. Was not crazy about 'Ocean's 12' while not hating it and cared even less for 'Ocean's 13', my opinion of course and one not many probably will share.Will admit to be both intrigued and nervous hearing that there would be an 'Ocean's' film featuring an all-female lead cast. Thought to myself, why not have more emphasis on women, when it gives more of a focus on female characters and with potential to make them more interesting than they were in the trilogy (hope that has not come out the wrong way)? What made me nervous was whether doing this would turn out to fare the same as the awful 'Ghostbusters' reboot/remake, a failure of a film on its own terms that did nothing with what it tried to do, absolutely nothing to do with not accepting change or not wanting women in lead roles when there are so many strong and iconic female lead characters (speaking as a woman myself). Actually saw 'Ocean's Eight' a few weeks ago but it took a while for me to get round to reviewing it with so many commitments and being behind on watching and reviewing films/television. It also took me a while trying to figure out what my thoughts were, having been conflicted and mixed leaving the cinema, and how to sum up my critiques. While still finding things to like, a large part of me was disappointed and found a lot wrong with it. 'Ocean's Eight' is not an awful film but it is not a good one either and should have been a good one considering what it had going for it.Let's start with the good things. 'Ocean's Eight' does look great, it has a very sleek, glitzy and expensive look. Showing in the photography and especially the gorgeous costumes and gala setting. Some of the music is pleasant to listen to and there are small fleeting moments of wit and unforced charm. The heist climax is where the film most comes to life narratively, it is suspenseful, slickly executed and fun to watch. The cast, or at least most of them, also fare well. The standout was Anne Hathaway who had charm and hilarious comic timing and the super-cool Cate Blanchett. Awkwarfina was also a delight and it was refreshing to see Helena Bonham Carter bringing a sweeter side to her usual ditzy oddball persona. Sandra Bullock has an admirable steely edge and James Corden does shine in his relatively limited screen time. However, not all the cast fare well. Particularly the hopelessly out of her depth Rihanna and a bland Richard Armitage in a role that was a plot device. Mindy Kaling and Sarah Paulson don't make much impression in underwritten roles. It was the way the characters were written that was one of the big problems, liked the diversity but none of the characters are developed fully to make them properly likeable or interesting, generally coming over as shallow. There are moments of charm in the chemistry but that was bland too generally. Much of 'Ocean's Eight' is dull in pace, taking too long to get started and with too little story to sustain the length, only in the climax and the lead up to it (so three quarters of the way through) does it start coming to life. The film attempted, or at least it came over this way to me, to disguise this problem by padding it out with scenes going on for too long and a lot of talk that sometimes feels verbose and going round in circles. There is not enough suspense or surprises to thrill and there is not enough sass, spark, wit or snap to be properly funny. The direction is never more than workmanlike and fails to have much distinction. The references and connections to the previous films felt thrown in and are nowhere near explored enough and the ending is far too abrupt and petering out too early-like.In conclusion, looks expensive with a great climax and the cast generally do impress but very lacking in soul, energy, thrills, surprises and distinction. It all felt too safe and that the execution was side-lined in favour of the all female lead concept. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Ocean's Eight
2,bkoganbing,The women take over,6,18 October 2018,"With George Clooney officially killed off there will be no more Ocean movies for
him, but the franchise is keeping going with Sandra Bullock as Clooney's sister
newly released from prison. Apparently there was a competitive edge with the
siblings and Bullock vows to pull off a heist to equal or better anything Clooney
ever did.Only she has assembled an all female team to prove that anything the men can
do the women can do better and with style in every sense of the word. The
target is the annual gala of the Metropolitan Museum of Art where they plan
to heist a necklace belonging to society princess Anne Hathaway.The team encompasses every strata of society. My favorite in the film is Awkwafina who is a street hustler who Bullock says has the fastest hands she's
every seen. Awkwafina proves it too.In the end Hathaway catches on, but that is by no means the end of the film. In fact Hathaway finds out the Ocean team has been very ambitious.This is not a bad film, it could even be a stand alone film away from all the
films Clooney did as Danny Ocean. Whether it catches on remains to be
seen.",Ocean's Eight
3,Leofwine_draca,Dire spin-off,3,16 January 2020,"I had a feeling that this spin-off from the original trilogy would turn out to be rubbish and so it proves; another female-lead remake of a famous original that turns out to be a dud, as with the recent GHOSTBUSTERS. This one's failure is purely down to the script, which tries to be sassy and smart and clever throughout but just feels juvenile and rather superficial. The fashion industry is something I have no interest in, just like the sports industry, and all of the constant cameos and the like smacks of self-indulgence. The plot turns out to be thoroughly laboured and only picks up in the last twenty minutes for a string of ridiculous twists. As for the cast, too many of the main players are distracting thanks to heavy doses of plastic surgery, and the others never really get a chance to shine. And who thought it would be amusing to add James Corden to the mix?",Ocean's Eight
4,SnoopyStyle,not Rat Pack material,6,31 August 2018,"Danny Ocean's sister Debbie (Sandra Bullock) is released after five years in prison. She promises to avoid her criminal family and not associate with any other cons for her parole. Of course, she's lying. It's in her blood. She tells her criminal partner Lou (Cate Blanchett) the perfect target after 5 years of consideration. She proposes a jewel heist during the Met Gala. They recruit floundering fashion designer Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter), jewel expert Amita (Mindy Kaling), hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna), pickpocket Constance (Awkwafina), and suburban mom retired fence Tammy (Sarah Paulson). Their target is diva actress Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) and a $150 million necklace.It's missing fun. Bullock is kinda fun but even the Wildcat was the reasonable one on the bus. Everybody is capable but they're not Rat Pack material. Awkwafina is the only who is truly funny. I do like the caper very much but after that big fun, the movie stalls. All the reveals after that have diminishing returns and I don't care about the ex-boyfriend. I'm doubtful that this could ever be Rat Pack but maybe it could have been something much darker. Quite frankly, this is inferior by the comparison.",Ocean's Eight
5,boblipton,Lots Of Fun,7,13 December 2020,"Sandra Bullock is paroled from prison. She invites six other woman to assist her on a caper to steal a necklace worth $150,000,000 from the neck of Anne Hathaway at the Metropolitan Museum's annual gala.I love caper films, and this gender-bending sequel to Soderbergh's Ocean's 11 trilogy. It starts off with Miss Bullock recruiting her crew, all of whom have their own idiosyncratic quirks. It has a precisely executed robbery sequence, and a well-tangled aftermath.Director/screenwriter Gary Ross has had a varied career since his first screenplay for BIG. His work as a director is idiosyncratic and varied through a variety of film genres, all of his movies distinctive, the equivalent of strong A directors during the Studio era. Working with a top cast who have accumulated four Oscars, two Emmys, nine Grammys, six Golden Globes, five BAFTAs, and 10 SAGs and counting, it's light-hearted, fun, and constantly interesting.",Ocean's Eight
6,Horst_In_Translation,"Simple, but entertaining for the most part",6,25 June 2018,"""Ocean's Eight"", written and directed by 4-time Oscar nominee Gary Ross, is a new American movie that adds the next chapter to the popular Ocean's franchise and Sandra Bullock takes over from George Clooney here. I was waiting for the Gravity reunion moment until the very end, but I won't tell you if it happened, even if the ending probably gave away what Bullock's character really thought about the question if Danny Ocean is dead or not. But yeah, for this 2018 release here, it runs for a bit over 1.5 hours, not too long I guess and the cast is spectacular at times. Three Oscar winners plus Helena Bonham Carter. Well there's also the likes of Rihanna, Awkwafina, Kaling and Corden who add nothing pretty much, but it's okay. They are somewhat memorable for mannerisms, tattoos etc. and not for their performances.As for lead actress Bullock, I am just not convincined and it was a bit cringeworthy how we see her at times as a more professional criminal than Blanchett, one of the best (if not the best) actresses from her generation. The moments when Awkwafina steals their stuff is maybe the most cringeworthy. But aside from that and from the ending, I will get to that later, it is a solid film that lives much more through individually spectacular scenes and plot twists than really through the whole story. At the end, they messed things up big style though that I almost have to give a lower rating. What happens with Hathaway's character is really all about who the actress is and not about her character (and I am writing this as a big fan of the actress), the stuff about Corden and Armitage is cringeworthy and here we have a prime example of a film that struggles with very bad writing for the male supporting characters for once. Like Bullock's character says on one occasion: She doesn't want men to be in, not just that this is forgotten, but that she confesses to a cop eventually and shares the money. And then of course makes up for it all with another plot twist how they stole a great deal more which nobody recognized at the end or paid attention to. But of course they are such sharing personalities that they don't keep it to themselves, Bullock and Blanchett's characters. So it's not a film to be taken particularly seriously, or anywhere near the best of the year in any of its many genres, but pointless fun occasionally and that's how you should approach it from start to finish.Each character has their moments, so Rihanna fans will also enjoy it and even I did surprisingly as I don't have any connection with the singer or her art. Blanchett fans probably will not love it that much looking at how her character is written that she plays second fiddle so much and has virtually no chance to shine. They made sure she won't take any attention away from Bullock, even if she has three times Bullock's talent, probably more. Yeah well, overall a cautious thumbs-up and positive recommendation, but I must say I really wish they would not have messed up the ending that heavily because then it could have been a much better watch. This way, it makes little sense, especially with that flexible Asian thief showing his gymnastics skills around the alarm lasers. What the heck? Yeah watch the film, but really keep your expectations low. Nothing more than guilty pleasure territory we got here. A prime example that regardless of how solid or even great any other area may be and how star-studded the cast: If you don't have the writing talent (too many cooks spoiling the broth here perhaps), then it just cannot become an extraordinary movie.",Ocean's Eight
7,Prismark10,The con is on,6,20 June 2018,"Ocean's Eleven was an entertaining, slick, star powered heist film. Ocean's Twelve was a mediocre mess where the best thing about the film were the end credits by which time you knew the torture was over.Ocean's Eight has been rebooted with a female team. Debbie Ocean ( Sandra Bullock) is the sister of Danny Ocean who is supposedly dead in this film.Like Danny she is a crook. Debbie has just got paroled from prison when she was caught up in a scam with an English artist. In prison Debbie has been plotting the perfect heist and revenge. Together with her partner in crime, Lou (Cate Blanchett) who so far is making money by diluting vodka with water that her bar sells. Both hatch a plan to steal a valuable diamond necklace worn by host Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) at the celebrity Met Gala dinner in New York.They do not have much time, nor a lot of money to spend and they need to get a team together quickly.Gary Ross as writer and director has fashioned a slick thriller with a preposterous plot. The plan is full of holes and plot contrivances such as all male security guards who will be shadowing a woman at all times. It is undemanding fun, the film moves along nicely, the stars do just about enough, there is no deep characterisation to bother about here. Although I did notice that in its multiracial casting and setting in some of the scenes; Gary Ross might be giving a middle finger to Trump's America.",Ocean's Eight
8,claudio_carvalho,Exhausted Franchise,6,16 September 2018,"During more than five years imprisoned framed by her boyfriend, the con woman Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) plots a scheme to heist the US$150 million Cartier necklace Toussaint from the Met Gala. She is released on probation and meets her former partner Lou (Cate Blanchett) and together they recruit a team of hacker, thieves, forger and swindlers to steal the necklace. ""Ocean´s Eight"" is another film of the exhausted franchise ""Ocean´s Something"" with famous cast and cameos. The predictable brainless story has plot holes and is reasonably entertaining. Further, it helps to sleep. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Oito Mulheres e um Segredo"" (""Eight Women and a Secret"")",Ocean's Eight
9,nogodnomasters,It's not that hard,8,30 June 2018,"Danny had a sister Debra (Sandra Bullock) who is also a scam artist. She gets out of jail and proceeds to implement a plan she conceived while in prison for five year 8 months and change. They plan on stealing a valuable necklace during the Met Gala and replace it with a fake made from a 3D printer. And the asterisk is she gets to frame the guy who framed her. This is a fairly good film. Predictable, but fun. Debra doesn't want any men a they attract attention where women such as Sandra Bullock blend in and can hide in plain sight. There is a 10 year ago flashback to where she went to prison for nearly six years. The math doesn't work out. The film includes stars as themselves. In this film Anne Hathaway, who was the White Queen in Alice wears a red dress. Helena Bonham Carter who was the Red Queen wear a white dress with roses. Enjoy it for what it is. Guide:One F-words. Some intimate scenes. No nudity.",Ocean's Eight
10,kosmasp,Don't cross the Ocean,6,18 October 2018,"No matter which one that is. Family holds together or at least carries on the family business. You know what Sandra Bullocks character is about and what the movie is about. So yeah, this is nothing new in the story category and you also can bet anything that there will be twists. They make sense or may seem crazy to say the least, but it's all about having fun.And while I would agree that the Original Oceans is still the best, that doesn't take anything away from the sequels and this one, if you don't consider it a sequel. Good cast, fun script (even if it's a bit ... uneven) and a generally fun time for everyone involved and hopefully the people watching this too.",Ocean's Eight
11,classicsoncall,"""If you're going to have a problem with stealing, then you're not going to like the rest of this conversation.""",6,15 December 2018,"Sorry to say, but you can't invigorate the 'Ocean's' franchise by replacing all the men with women, it just doesn't work. The movie is stylishly filmed of course but it's not enough. The story gets into the weeds with the intricacy of the plot and as it unfolds it seems to flounder. The biggest hole in the script is when Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) loses the hundred fifty million dollar necklace and she's barely put on the carpet for it, not to mention the two clueless bodyguards. None of it is credible, nor is the 'discovery' of the replacement necklace in the fountain. The ancillary thefts of the additional jewelry and the set-up of Claude Becker (Richard Armitage) to take the fall would have made for an interesting exclamation point on the picture if some of the stuff that went before could have passed the smell test, but it didn't. The only thing I was sure of coming out of the movie was that Danny Ocean isn't dead. Who'd believe that anyway?",Ocean's Eight
12,lee_eisenberg,that takes the cake,6,14 January 2019,"It was understood that there couldn't be another addition to the original trilogy due to Bernie Mac's death, so they made a spinoff with a group of women as the heist-plotters. I expected something silly and got that. Enjoyable enough. One of the main things that I derived from ""Ocean's 8"" is that it must be weird to attend the Met Gala, noble though the cause may be.So, this is a respectable end to the franchise. There shouldn't be any need to make another.",Ocean's Eight
13,Tweekums,A distaff heist movie,7,4 July 2019,"Debbie Ocean, the estranged sister of Dannie, is released after five years in prison and her promise to the parole board to avoid crime and criminals doesn't last a day. During her time in prison she has been planning a major heist... she plans to steal a neckless worth a hundred and fifty million dollars during a gala event at New York's Metropolitan Museum. To do this she will have to assemble a team and, with the help of former partner Lou Miller, sets about recruiting people with the required skills... this includes an unwitting actress who is to wear the jewels. As the day of the job approaches it becomes clear that Debbie plans to use the job to get her revenge on the man who put her behind bars.In some ways the idea of having an all-female heist crew might be seen as a gimmick; perhaps it is but I found the story to be a lot of fun and the characters were likeable. As one would expect from an Ocean's film the plot provides few real surprises; there are some twists but it would be more of a surprise if there weren't. What matters is that the story kept me interested, it also provided plenty of laughs. The cast includes plenty of well-known actresses; notably Sandra Bullock, as Debbie; Cate Blanchett, as Lou; Anne Hathaway, as actress Daphne Kluger; and Helena Bonham Carter as fashion designer Rose Weil. The supporting cast is solid too. There are plenty of cameos from famous people playing themselves which may please some people; to be honest I only knew most of them were there because of the cast list. Overall I'd say this might not be a must see but it is well worth a watch if you enjoy slick heist movies.",Ocean's Eight
14,sunwarrior13,The All-Female Version Of Ocean's Group Of Thieves,4,5 December 2019,"The movie ""Ocean's Eight"" is a movie that is typical of Hollywood these days. It is basically an all-female spin-off remake of the previous films such as Ocean's '11. Ocean's 12, Ocean's 13, and Ocean 11 in the 1960. The movie stars Sandra Bullock. Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling,Sarah Paulson,Awkwafina Rihanna and Helena Bonham Carter. It was directed by Gary Ross.The story of the movie centers of Debbie Ocean,who is a female cousin of Danny Ocean. After she was released from prison, she makes a group of her fellow thieves to steal a jewel at New York that is worth $150 million during a gala.The movie is definitely a spin-off of the original Ocean Eleven and other Ocean movies. The difference her is having an all-female cast led by Debbie Ocean. Obviously, it is following the trend of having all-female especially with the type of movies that Hollywood is up to these days.Overall, we get to see a film that also lack originality aside from a female cast. We also see the characters closely related to the original all-male Ocean's 11 as I have mentioned above. Aside from that, we also get to see the glamour of the new all-female group. But overall, the men's group remains a lot better than this version.",Ocean's Eight
15,studioAT,And then there were 8,4,26 September 2019,"While in my opinion the George Clooney headed 'Ocean's trilogy' weren't masterpieces they did well enough at the box office for there to be a desire to see what an all female line up would do with the formula.And there's a lot good about this film, people trashed it, but there is. They're even clever and have links to the original trilogy, which is a nice touch.Unfortunately the characters aren't that likeable, and there a few too many pointless scenes, which is a shame because there's a great cast here.The film just doesn't match up to the potential. I wouldn't mind an 'Ocean's 9', but perhaps they could get some of the original cast involved too.Danny (surely he's not really dead) and Debbie teaming up, now there's a film.",Ocean's Eight
16,CinemaSerf,Glamorous but a bit flat...,6,30 June 2020,"After the first ten minutes I was beginning to wonder why the critics had panned this so heavily. Sandra Bullock (""Debbie Ocean"" - younger sister of ""Danny"") gets out of jail and within two shakes of a lamb's tail has managed to pinch a whole load of make up and crash someone's (already completed) hotel booking... Regrettably, it doesn't really go anywhere now. She hooks up with Cate Blanchett (""Lou"") and together they plan a cunning heist to steal a $150m diamond necklace from the annual ""Met Gala"" despite state of the art security - and the supervisory gazing eyes of Dame Anna Wintour! They manage to get Cartier to let super-model Anne Hathaway wear the jewels at the ball and so together with Helena Bonham-Carter, Rihanna and Awkwafina, they all get down to work planning the perfect robbery. The enterprise also gives her the chance to suitably stitch up debonaire ex-boyfriend Richard Armitage - also a bit of a crook - and get some good old fashioned revenge at the same time! Any fun to be had here, as with their male counterpart films, is had during their planning shenanigans. Once they begin to implement their plan and during the aftermath, which sees a really quite irritating James Corden as the insurance investigator appear, it is all a bid too mundane; the humour and cleverness has long left it and now and I found myself wanting to watch ""Topkapi"" (1964). As you'd expect from a film with just about the entire American fashion industry (and John McEnroe) doing cameos; it looks stylish and classy but the story just wore too thin, too quickly.",Ocean's Eight
17,zardoz-13,Dames Night Out!!!,8,26 June 2018,"A glossy, polished, female revenge fantasy, crime caper, Gary Ross's ""Ocean's Eight,"" starring Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, and Rihanna, amounts to the gender flip-side of Steven Soderbergh's male-oriented heist trilogy ""Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen."" Comparably, ""Ocean's Eight"" follows on the high heels of 2016's ""Ghostbusters,"" with Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Leslie Jones, that gave gals the starring roles in the remake of the 1984 Bill Murray classic. Predictably, ""Ocean's Eight"" shares some similarities with Soderbergh's extravagant, predictable, and often madcap epics. ""Ocean's Eight,"" however, isn't as hopelessly fanciful as Soderbergh's ""Oceans,"" but it unfolds in the same land of imaginary Hollywood realism. As Danny Ocean's younger sister Debbie, Sandra Bullock is fashionably appareled throughout this sumptuous PG-13 saga as are her comely conspirators. Like brother Danny, Debbie recruits top-flight talent. If you're afraid the authorities may nab and pack them off to prison, banish that thought. The police are virtually invisible in this elaborate 'mission impossible' theft. Indeed, our heroine flies so low beneath her parole officer's radar that we never see either him or her surprise our heroine with an unscheduled inspection. Make no mistake, ""Hunger Games"" helmer Gary Ross has made a palatable, attractive, and mildly suspenseful thriller that will probably hold your attention throughout its 11o-minute running time. The flaw in this sophisticated heist caper is our dames walk away without a hair out of place. Inevitably, they encounter some complications in ""Ocean's Eight,"" but they never resort to physical violence. Furthermore, nobody either catches a bullet or dies.  Like the ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) remake, ""Ocean's Eight"" opens with a contrite Debbie reassuring the authorities at Nichols Women's Prison in New Jersey that she will avoid contact with all former criminal accomplices and family if she gets paroled. ""If I were to be released,"" she sighs, ""I would just want the simple life. I just want to hold down a job, make some friends, you know, pay my bills."" No sooner has Debbie stepped out of stir than she steals everything in sight that she needs to wallow in the lap of luxury at a swanky motel during her first night out of prison. If you remember ""Ocean's Eleven,"" Danny told his jailors the exact same lies. Debbie's brazen scam at the perfume counter later seems amateurish, but the movie makes it appear smoothly plausible. Meanwhile, she learns that her estranged brother, Danny Ocean, has died. For the record, George Clooney played Danny Ocean in Soderbergh's ""Oceans"" trilogy. Specifics are never revealed about Danny's demise. Nevertheless, Debbie visits the mausoleum where her older brother has been buried to pay her respects. She toasts Danny's passage with a martini but doesn't shed a tear. Conveniently, one of Danny's closest associates, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould of ""MASH""), shows up on behalf of the fellows but fails to persuade Debbie to cease and desist. Is Danny really dead or is he in hiding? Knowing Danny, Danny is probably holed up someplace. More importantly, this bombshell revelation means no ""Oceans 14!"" Reportedly, Soderbergh has said in public that he has no plans for another ""Ocean's"" escapade. In ""Ocean's Eight,"" Debbie has engineered the whole shebang down to the smallest detail. All of her accomplices will walk away with cool double-digit millions and never have to ever commit another crime. Debbie has no problem recruiting her former partner-in-crime, Lou (Cate Blanchett of ""Thor: Ragnarok""), to join her and outlines her audacious plan to rob 'the most exclusive party in America,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual Gala, in New York City. Like Danny, Debbie assembles an A-Team of experts from every field to execute her fool-proof plan. Reluctantly, Lou accommodates Debbie. Together, they enlist an out-of-fashion, fashion designer, Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter of ""); an Indian jewelry-maker Amita (Mindy Kaling of ""A Wrinkle in Time""), an African-American computer hacker, Nine Ball (Rihanna of ""Battleship""); a white suburban housewife fence, Tammy (Sarah Paulson of ""Serenity""); and an Asian-American pickpocket, Constance (Awkwafina of ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising""), to pull off this crime of the century. When Amita asks Debbie how long the latter took to concoct her bold scheme, Debbie replies specifically ""five years, eight months, and twelve days."" As it turns out, this is the length of time that Debbie spent in prison for a crime she didn't commit, all owing to a treacherous art dealer, Claude Becker (Richard Armitage of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey""), who double-crossed and framed her. Not only does Debbie savor the prospect of exacting vengeance on Becker, but she also tells her cohorts they are committing this grand crime for all those little girls aspiring to be career criminals. Principally, Debbie and her partners dupe an arrogant but glamorous movie starlet, Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway of ""Love & Other Drugs""), into serving as their innocent accomplice. They hoodwink Kluger into hiring Rose Weil to dress her for the gala. Rose insists Daphne wear the legendary Toussaint, a world-renowned, six-pound, Cartier diamond necklace that has been locked up in an underground vault for the last fifty years. Initially, the Cartier people refuse to let the Toussaint, a bauble valued at $150 million, see the light of day. Reluctantly, they agree, and two seasoned security experts safeguard the necklace. Meanwhile, Tammy infiltrates the company coordinating the gala and works from within, acquiring all kinds of invaluable information. Nine Ball hacks into the security system to pinpoint the arrangement of all surveillance cameras. Inevitably, Debbie and company must separate Daphne from the Toussaint. This sequence with poor Daphne crouched over a toilet hurling her guts out is simply sidesplitting. Although he doesn't drum up white-knuckled, nail-biting suspense designed to keep you teetering on the edge of your seat, director Gary Ross never lets the momentum lag for a moment with a charismatic cast and splendid cinematography. An ideal gals' night out opus, ""Ocean's Eight"" qualifies as above-average with its cornucopia of humor compensating for its conspicuous scarcity of suspense.",Ocean's Eight
18,neil-476,OK caper,7,25 June 2018,"Debbie Ocean, newly released from prison, has come up with a caper during the 8-odd years she spent inside. Recruiting various female confederates, she puts the caper into preparation.More a sister to Clooney's Ocean films than a sequel, this film features an entertaining caper which doesn't bear a great deal of close examination - there seem to be many elements of the plan which could easily go wrong and which you couldn't really plan for. However, superficially the plan is fun.Most of the cast are fine too. Sandra Bullock seems to be facially immobile all the way through and shows no animation whatsoever, but perhaps that's the way the character is written. Cate Blanchett is excellent.This is a moderately entertaining time-passer.",Ocean's Eight
19,morrison-dylan-fan,Ocean's meh.,4,16 December 2018,"Getting set to meet up with a friend in the run-up to X-Mas,I got asked if I could pick an easy-going flick we could both watching. Remembering how breezy Ocean's 11 (2001) was,it felt like the best time to give this new entry a spin.View on the film:Continuing a collaboration with Steven Soderbergh which started when Soderbergh produced his directing debut Pleasantville (1998), co-writer/(with Olivia Milch) director Gary Ross & cinematographer Eigil Bryld keep the flow of the 2001 Ocean's smoothly continuing with sleek panning shots along the floors following the long con, and Pop-Art editing shaking up a bubbly atmosphere.Laying out the cards in the first half, Ross takes some of the shine off the franchise with a surprisingly blatant amount of product placements,which hurts all the set-up in the due to scenes being left needlessly hanging by the focus being not put on the characters, but flogging products.Merrily going full circle with the opening, the screenplay by Ross and Olivia Milch attempts to introduce each gang member with a thumb sketch, but leaves them all smudged by not offering sequences where a spark develops between them all. Massively helped by the glamour from the cast, the film rolls some winning numbers in the extended robbery where the charisma and sign of friendship between each member of the group is at last allowed to sparkle as Debbie Ocean rolls a hard eight.",Ocean's Eight

Her first stop is to assemble the perfect crew: Lou (Cate Blanchett), Rose (Helena Bonham Carter), Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway), Nine Ball (Rihanna), Tammy (Sarah Paulson), Amita (Mindy Kaling), and Constance (Awkwafina). Each of the Ocean's 8 has a special skill and the skills are coordinated to pull off the heist of multi-million dollar diamond necklace - and a few more things... The men in the cast are minor except for the love interest Claude Becker (Richard Armitage) with bit parts doled out to Elliott Gould, Conor Donavan, ad James Corden. Gust moments by Marlo Thomas, Dana Ivey, Mary Louise Wilson, and Elizabeth Ashley.Well captured on film by Eigil Bryid and with excellent 'costumes' by Sarah Edwards, this is a colorful, clever, witty and hilarious story beautifully presented on every front.",Ocean's Eight

The first half hour was pure boredom. I never really got into the characters and the jokes used were as childish as it could be. Even once they are out for the diamants I never got into it. It was until the last half hour that I started to enjoy it but agree with me, by then it's way too late to give this fail a good rating.The acting was okay and editing and all of that was great but just a weak story and please, Hollywood, why does flicks have to clock in over 9à minutes nowadays??Gore 0/5

22,DKosty123,Spoiled Eye Candy,1,27 December 2018,"I don't think a woman cast for this series is a bad idea. The bad idea is not giving them any script to work with. Compared to other Oceans films, this plot is sort of dumbed down. I am not sure where the writers or director of this film thought this worked, it just doesn't.Realism is the thing left behind here. Even when the film tries to do something, it falls short of the goal. There's a lot of glass, and an investigator that is still trying to find an emoji movie script. There's lots of talented women who characters are written shallower than a kids wading pool.I am not even going to write a spoiled for this one, the entire script is a spoiler. I think a script sending this cast on a religious retreat would generate more excitement than this film, whose only hot scenes seem to be between 2 people who just happen to meet without any real emotional spark, just physical stuff. Their encounters do resemble 2 emoji's meeting I suppose.",Ocean's Eight
23,lasttimeisaw,A diverting fluff whose feel-good afterglow quickly wanes when you think it back,6,10 July 2018,"Under the good name of righting the wrong of Hollywood commodity's sexism predilection, this Ocean's heist female spin-off has a glamorous appeal that stems from its exuberant comedic pizzazz and a jaunty pace bringing glitterati and posh pageantry to the fore, but that uplifting feeling doesn't last too long once the movie wraps up, for this reviewer's two cents, its rinky-dink plot and uninspiring characterization of its dramatis personae are the culprits.Formally divvied up into the genre's standard third-act mode, recruitment and preparation, the action, and its aftermath, directer Gary Ross builds a conflict-free sororal bond among his stellar cast,even to a point of antiseptic, lead by Sandra Bullock's Debbie Ocean, a role right up her alley, bristle with a bland-ish charm and self-knowledge. A second-billed Cate Blanchett earns her fat check as Lou, Debbie's partner-in-crime, but her butch élan is only swung by a very superficial touch, one might presume that Ross balks at the proposition of making a prominent lesbian character in a mainstream production with a high price tag, a shameful cop-out not only because it flags up the studio's craven conservatism and deep-fish avarice, but when you have Blanchett at your disposal, you don't waste her talent like that, not when she is so game and telegenic in form to sweep any preys off their feet.In the third tier, we have a jittery Helena Bonham Carter doing her best ""bad acting"" as the fashion designer Rose Weil, Sarah Paulson pulls off her deceitful innocuousness as fellow con artist Tammy, then the racial card should be routinely designated, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna and Awkwafina duly line up for their sleight-of-hand (either literally or figuratively), but 17 years after Steven Soderbergh's OCEAN'S ELEVEN (2011), an Asian, still takes the short end as a petty filcher, retrogression is the operative word here. The only major twist (there is a minor one bringing back one old friend in a blisteringly edited flashback that should make their escapade more plausible, but few would care) lands on the shoulder of Anne Hathaway's Daphne Kluger, a red-hot celebrity who becomes the ""seemingly"" unwitting mule to wear Cartier's $150 million necklace ""The Toussaint"" in the annual Met Gala, which Debbie and co. intends to steal. But, if you notice the movie's title and your math is passable, the surprise is not that surprising when she tips her hand in the fallout, a radiant Hathaway runs away with the film in sheer self-mocking ease.Yet, out of all its run-of-the-mill wheezes in the cohort's daring (if over-simplified) shenanigans, there is a glaring plot-hole that sticks in this reviewer's throat, a priori, the Toussaint can only be unclasped using a special magnet by the jewel's bodyguard, so why on earth no one makes a fuss about it being mysteriously lost during the gala dinner, allegedly without the aid of that exclusive magnet? Or, at the very least, any investigator would surmise the bodyguard could be a accomplice in the subterfuge. That is the dead proof of crummy work in the script department, a kick in the teeth of an otherwise ephemerally diverting fluff.",Ocean's Eight
24,Hellmant,Almost matched the debut weekend of the all female 'GHOST BUSTERS' reboot!,8,15 June 2018,"'OCEAN'S 8': Four Stars (Out of Five)A spin-off of the popular 'OCEAN'S' heist comedy trilogy, revolving around the sister of Danny Ocean, Debbie Ocean, leading an all women crew in the robbery of the Met Gala. It stars Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter and Sarah Paulson. The film was directed by Gary Ross, and written by Ross and Olivia Milch. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a hit at the Box Office as well (almost matching the debut weekend of the all female 'GHOST BUSTERS' reboot). I found it to be about as good as the other 'OCEAN'S' sequels, even a little better.Debbie Ocean (Bullock) is a professional robber recently released from prison. She's also the estranged sister of veteran thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney in the other films), who recently passed away. Debbie has been plotting to rob the Met Gala, in New York City, and she'll need a team of thieves to help her do it. Her long time friend, and partner in crime, Lou (Blanchett), helps her find a crew.The movie is well written and stylishly directed (I'm a fan of Gary Ross mostly). It's also well acted and quite funny at times. Like the other 'OCEAN'S' movies, it's a little slow-paced and light on character development though (except for the leads). Compared to the trilogy that inspired it though, the film does a more than adequate job of living up to them. I don't think it's quite as good as the original, but I'd say it's better than the first two sequels.",Ocean's Eight
25,thesar-2,(13 > 8 > 12) < 11,7,1 September 2018,"OH! And it's 100x better than the Ghostbusters gag of girls.When I heard of this, I thought: Here we go again. Remaking classics, or in this case, a classic remake, but...with...WOMEN! Like the not-at-all good Ghostbusters remake. But, the good reviews came out and I decided to give it a shot.Well, one thing's clear: this isn't a Girl-Power! film. They totally needed the help of men or they couldn't pull it all off. And while highly entertaining and nice to see the Ocean's brand resurrected again, it wasn't anywhere close to as good...or COOL...as the original (remake) Ocean's Eleven with George Clooney.In FAR-TOO-MANY references to Danny being our lead here's sister, Debbie, she's trying to honor his death - yeah, supposedly he died after getting many felonies since #13 - by stealing immediately after leaving prison like her brother did in #11. Also, like her brother, she recruits others to be part of her plot to steal diamonds. If you've seen 11, 12 or 13, then you know exactly what to expect here and still love what you see.Problem, though. No clear or cool villain. There is one, but he's so incredibly weak and boring and too much a callback/stolen item from #11, it's almost embarrassing for these writers.That said, Sandra is marvelous and I love a good half or less of her gang of thieves. Granted, Sandra is NO George and her second in command, Cate Blanchett - as cool as she is on her own - is NO Brad. But, alone, they're fun to watch.My hope at least, there might be a #21 or so crossover if interest is enough with this revival. ***Final thoughts: I'm an apologist for Ocean's Twelve, even though that was my least favorite of the Clooney trilogy. And now, it's the least of the four. Definitely like #11 and #13 best, followed by (now) #8 and finally #12. So, if you liked #11 and #13, you will probably most likely like #8 as it's fairly the same movie as the bookends of the Clooney trilogy.",Ocean's Eight

27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Plays it incredibly safe, to both beneficial and detrimental effect.",6,25 June 2018,"'Ocean's Eight (2018)' is directed with a similarly energetic but ultimately 'copy-cat' kind of style as Soderbergh's trilogy, one that comes across more as an attempt to ape the distinct editing and other aesthetics of the series as opposed to craft a unique look and feel for itself. Yet, this vibe is strangely appreciated, however 'unoriginal' and essentially 'sub-par' it may be. Gary Ross uses it to as a safe and predictable way to assure us we are in for a safe and predictable ride, a way to let us know that he and the other members of the cast and crew understand, respect and want to continue the franchise as opposed to reboot it in a totally irreverent, or even incompetent, way. This also extends to the narrative structure - down to the broad movements of the plot, even - and permeates pretty much every aspect of the piece, making sure we are almost instantly on familiar ground while giving us just enough 'spice' to remind us why we liked 'Ocean's Eleven (2001)' in the first place. Make no mistake, it is certainly a sequel to that film (and its follow-ups), however 'loose' it may be. The problem comes when you realise it doesn't really have an identity of its own, being a safe and predictable picture in the poorer ways that come along with such an endeavour, too. Obviously, these problems come with the territory of giving people exactly what they expect to crowd-pleasing but almost intellect-dampening result. The fact that there are no real surprises, even the big 'reveals' (which are retroactively obvious), is a clear side-effect of this imbalance. The sillier moments being punctuated by utter seriousness perhaps isn't, however, and neither is the sour-taste left by the appearance of a certain someone late on (I'll not name names). Still, even its problems are pretty safe, including its odd and frustrating mix of celebrity cameos that don't diegetically mix with the all-star cast (though it isn't quite Julia Roberts as Tess Ocean as Julia Roberts). The almost paradoxical aspect of the flick appears when you remember it could have gone too far the other way, being too different to recognise and feeling like a cash-grab for the franchise moniker only. Therefore it might be slightly hypocritical to complain about it feeling too similar to its predecessors, but I feel a better balance wasn't too far out of reach. I don't think we should settle for a film that is 'good enough' just because it feels like a slightly less enthusiastic version of what we've seen before within the same series. Don't get me wrong, though, it is better than it could have been and is an enjoyable experience throughout. It cuts to the heart of the prior movies and sits comfortably amongst them, providing consistent entertainment even without the 'magic' of the 2001 'original'. 6/10",Ocean's Eight
28,dromasca,a rather boring night at the museum,5,2 August 2018,"I believe that I'm done with the summer movies for 2018. What a dry season! After having barely survived the 2h30min of the most recent 'M:I6' I was hoping to spend a more pleasant time watching the constellation of talented actresses which show up in the cast of Ocean's Eight. Each of Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, or Helena Bonham Carter on the poster would be a good reason for me to buy my cinema ticket and popcorn and watch any movie they star in. How does it happen that the gathering of them all in 'Ocean's Eight' resulted in a rather mediocre production, which barely extracts a smile and does not thrill (action-wise) at any point in time?I am afraid that I need to blame director and script co-author Gary Ross for this failure. Ross succeeded quite well when he wrote and directed films that were at the fringe of mainstream, and I include here The Hunger Games. With Ocean's Eight he is riding the waves of mainstream Hollywood blockbusters, not only continuing a series with a well established formula but also a tradition of big studios hits based on the combination of very popular actors bringing to screen stories of elaborated burglaries in famous museums or postcard touristic destinations. The problem is that this version of the old story no passion, no thrill, no original ideas. Yes, the burglars team is all-women but this direction was not enough put in works either, and the result is much lesser than the amount of talent that is invested and the potential promised by the cast.The girls try to do their best. Sandra Bullock leads the team and devices a plan that is unfortunately never clear or too interesting to viewers, Cate Blanchett brings to screen her usual 'I am much more than I look about' feeling but we never get what this 'much more' is about, Anne Hathaway is perfect in her beautiful-but-not-too-smart role, and Helena Bonham Carter has the chance of the only role with more comic potential and a better background story. The action trails, we have seen the laser beams dances too many times to enjoy it, The Metropolitan Museum is under-used as a location, and while shorter by almost one hour Ocean's Eight eventually seems to last as long as 'M:I6. The bad news are that this film may be the best entertainment that we get this this summer.",Ocean's Eight
29,ThomasDrufke,"Far From Original, but Just the Summer Fun We Need",8,10 June 2018,"A few years ago when the very mention of an all female Ghostbusters movie sent some (idiotic) fans into a rage, it was an undeniable risk to announce an all female remake/reboot/sequel of the Ocean's franchise. Not because a heist film with all women would fail in quality, but because there's a certain section of people who just set out to automatically hate change in franchises they love. Luckily, Ocean's 8 doesn't just trample on any of those questions, it destroys them. It's silly that the first few sentences of a review even have to address that, but luckily, the film makes you forget that such a point of view even exists. With an all-star cast of female powerhouses, and a few interesting casting choices, Ocean's 8 succeeds in reinvigorating a franchise that we didn't know we needed to be invigorated. The beginning-middle act does drag a little bit, but once the ladies begin the mission, the film takes off to deliver some of the most fun this summer can probably offer. As per usual, there's things you don't expect and twists that pay off at just the right time. Admittedly, this film follows Ocean's 11 almost note for note, but if it succeeds on entertainment, a remake/reboot/re-quel/sequel doesn't necessarily need to reinvent the wheel. In short, I sure hope the movie does well enough to warrant an Ocean's 9.8.6/10",Ocean's Eight
30,MLDinTN,not enough originality,5,13 January 2019,"This film really lacked originality and that's its biggest downfall. And it is just not as good as Clooney's Ocean films. First, Debbie Ocean is just not that likable. She does nothing that makes you root for her to pull the con off. And why would housewife, Tammy, with kids want to get involved with this. There needed to be more back story. And why would the MET hire new employees to be in charge of things right before the gala. It was fun to see the gals pull if off, but it provided nothing new.FINAL VERDICT: OK, perhaps a fun watch while you have something else to work on,",Ocean's Eight
31,Cineanalyst,Knockoffs,6,14 November 2018,"Of course, ""Ocean's Eight"" is a retread, so were the last three Ocean's movies--all being inspired by the 1960 Rat Pack film, which itself, another heist or con-artist picture, wasn't exactly the most novel notion ever filmed, either. At least, this entry is honest about it, and as Sandra Bullock's Debbie Ocean suggests, the only way to con a con is to tell the truth. Not only is the entire formula a knockoff, but the heist itself is pulled off by passing off knockoffs as the genuine articles. There's the retro stewardess uniforms at a fashion show, the all-female imitation of the painting ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"" hung in the gallery next to the original, which aptly is akin to this female-realigned spin-off standing beside its male-oriented predecessors, and there's the 3D printer producing knockoffs of the jewels they plan to steal. Even this idea may've been stolen from ""The Good Thief"" (2002), which itself was a remake.I'm not so sure that a crime picture that revels in women's love for outlandish dresses and diamonds empowers the gender as much as some critics might fancy, and, indeed, Bullock's Ocean partly makes a joke of that in her scene talking in front of a mirror; moreover, these Ocean's pictures always seemed to rely for their appeal upon glitz and glamour, from the con, its place (originally, casinos), the style of the movies, to the assembling of a team of stars, and this one delivers on all that just as well--except for, perhaps, that the heist isn't convoluted enough. Sure, it's improbable, if not ridiculous, but all of it's rather simple and explained. Even the inevitable final, or twist, con is ho-hum. Yet, at least, unlike the 2016 ""Ghostbusters,"" this one doesn't have pretensions of being anything more than what it is.",Ocean's Eight

35,atlasmb,Needs More Fun,6,31 July 2018,"This film assembles a strong stable of talent, then wastes much of it. Sandra Bullock, who can play comedy or romance as well as anyone, is Debbie Ocean, sister of the deceased Danny O. Just released from a 5-year stint in prison, she is a too-cool character intent on getting back in the game. With Bond-like dispassion, she assembles her appropriately diverse female crew to execute her master heist, and to seek a measure of revenge.Cate Blanchett is also largely wasted with an emotionless portrayal. Only Anne Hathaway is given the lines and the latitude to allow her to charm us, playing the ""outsider"" actress Daphne Kluger.The scene of the crime is New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Fortunately, the crew was given ample access to the grand structure, showcasing some of the art within. Keys scenes play out in the Temple of Dendur reconstruction, which does not replace seeing it in person, but gives a hint of its majesty. The Met Gala serves as the backdrop for the heist, and the viewer is treated to glimpses of the real celebs at the real event, including Katie Holmes, Heidi Klum, and Serena Williams. I found myself wishing that the rest of the film might be the continuation of these spectacular scenes of ""red carpet"" splendor, including some very classic and original fashion art.The mission never seemed impossible, so the ending lacks surprise. The final snippet of revenge feels as emotionless as the preceding 100 minutes. What is the film lacking? The humor of Bullock. The dangerous stunts of a Tom Cruise. The feelings of jeopardy that involve the viewer emotionally. Instead, this film is the equivalent of Mike Myers playing Goldmember as a straight-up, unruffled villain.

38,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,5,27 October 2018,"""Ocean's Eight"" is an Action - Crime movie in which we watch Danny Ocean's sister Debbie Ocean trying to gather an all-female crew to attempt an impossible heist at New York City's annually Met Gala. Their goal is to steal the Jeanne Toussaint necklace created by Cartier. Debbie Ocean is the creator of the plan like her brother and she tries to recruit some other women in order to achieve her goal.I had high hopes for this movie but I was really disappointed by it. The plot was very boring with no plot twists and not interesting scenes except very few. In my opinion, the worst was that the actors made me feel that everything was to easy to do, they didn't challenge the audience or make them feel that they are trying very hard to achieve their goal. To be honest, there is no comparison with ""Ocean's Eleven"" etc, not mentioning their tremendous quality differences such as problems during their mission, in ""Ocean's Eleven"" trying very hard to surpass them, in ""Ocean's Eight"" everything is too easy for them, and many more. Another thing that I didn't like was the bad connection which was made with ""Ocean's Eleven"", you cannot just present an actor who played in ""Ocean's Eleven"", let him play for not even a minute and expect that this movie can cover every plot hole you created. It's not that easy and you have to try more for it.Finally, I believe that ""Ocean's Eight"" is not worth seeing so, just don't lose your time on it. It's a bad copy of ""Ocean's Eleven"". This movie reminded me of some other movies which gathered too many famous people to act in a very bad plot and I believe that this movie is in the first places in this list.",Ocean's Eight
39,cruise01,A slow build up that does not get any exciting with its surprises and twist.,6,10 June 2018,"Ocean's 8 (3 out of 5 stars).Ocean's 8 is a spin off from the reboot Ocean's trilogy starring George Clooney. And an all female cast of a spin off. I was not a huge fan of the Ocean's trilogy. The first one was eh. The second was okay. And the third one was a lot of fun. Now, this spin off does not improve over the original trilogy. It was decent. The cast ensemble was good. The plot brings in Danny (George Clooney) sister who is played by Sandra Bullock. She gets out of prison and plans her next heist of stealing diamond necklace that is worth 150 million dollars. I did feel like this film was lacking in fun and stand out characters. The plot follows Debbie (Sandra Bullock) who is out of prison. She plans her next heist of stealing a diamond necklace that has not been seen by the public's eye. She needs the help from Lou (Cate Blanchett), Amita (Mindy Kaling), Tammy (Sarah Paulson), Constance (Awkwafina), Nine Ball (Rihanna), and Rose (Helena Bonham Carter). The team will try to use a fashion model Daphne (Anne Hathaway) to sponsor in wearing the diamond necklace at a fashion event. The original trilogy at least stood out for its quirky fun humor and interesting characters. Ocean's 8 is missing out on that opportunity. We get Debbie Ocean, who cons her way to get what she wants. She cons the hotel receptionist to getting a free room, a fragrance store customer service, ect. Lou is Debbie's partner in crime that will always be by her side and helps to organize this team. Amita is a jeweler expert. Tammy is a suburban mom, who has lots of over stock supplies of home appliances in her garage. Constance is a pick-pocking thief. Nine Ball is a hacker. And Rose is the fashion designer and awkward in person. The cast that plays these characters are great choices. But the script does miss the opportunity in making these characters interesting and lacking in fun humor. We get more fun humor from James Corden's character that shows up in the dead end of the second act playing an insurance investigator. The concept and plot was okay. It adds nothing new to the serious. Besides Debbie's desire to challenge herself into stealing a high price jewelry that has private security guards a few feet away. And there are a couple of twists, which does not give the surprise factor at all. Plus there are a couple of cameos from the original trilogy. I was really hoping for more that could have made it fun at least. Gary Ross direction with the film is slightly dull. It does not have the fun energy like the previous films. It is a heist movie that seems like it is bored with its script. Overall, Ocean's 8 is a fair heist film. The cast ensemble was great and the plot was decent and entertaining. It just was lacking the energetic direction and has uninteresting characters which can be a little boring at times.",Ocean's Eight
40,eddie_baggins,A lifeless and charmless attempt to reimagine the Ocean's series,2,8 June 2018,"To be fair, I don't exactly think I'm the target audience for Ocean's 8, an all-female update on the successful Ocean's franchise that was headlined by the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon and Brad Pitt, but I like to think I'm a cinemagoer that's always up for a good fun time at the movies but that's something that is inexcusably and notably absent from this charmless, lifeless and DOA female-centric heist caper.Born out of Hollywood's recent spate of female driven updates and redo's that have been born out of the industry trying to make up for past mistakes and inequalities perceived or otherwise, Ocean's 8 should be a silly yet entertaining ride (who doesn't love a cheeky heist flick?) but as directed by The Hunger Games Gary Ross, this mundane exercise in wannabe hipness and sassy smarts is the type of film that exudes self-worth and believes itself to be something that unfortunately it is not.Ocean's 11 from 2001 coasted by on its assured and energetic direction from Steven Soderbergh, its endless supply of entertaining characters joined with on-point acting turns and thrilling set-up yet while Ocean's 8 has the named brand director, a cast of A-listers and up and comers and a supposedly daring jewellery heist at its disposal, it never gets close to capturing the mix of thrills and laughs that you'd expect from a film that's guised in the Ocean's name.A major and glaring issue with Ocean's 8 is that every single character in this film is either unlikeable or just not built up enough and when your whole narrative revolves around a heist that is not once even slightly believable, the characters in Ross's film needed to be the key ingredient to make things tick along.Led by a wooden central turn from Sandra Bullock as Danny Ocean's recently released from prison sister Debbie, the likes of Cate Blanchett as the stoic biker chick Lou, Helena Bonham Carter as the off-kilter Irish designer Rose and Anne Hathaway as the Hollywood starlet Daphne Kluger all cast members fail to make a mark in their roles and while the marketing for this film would make us all believe we have a sisterhood of sorts going on here both on and off-screen, there's no real charm or chemistry shared between this cast and when compared with their all-male lead counterparts from 2001, this cast pales in comparison.We never get the witty interplay between the rag-tag crew Debbie assembles to pull off a necklace heist at the famed Met Gala and we never get any real sense that these underdeveloped members of the gang really share any type of real friendship, making it extremely hard to care about their successes robbing the rich and wearing nice clothes whilst doing so.The other detrimental issue to Ocean's 8 outside of the far too convenient heist and its various eyebrow raising conveniences (gang members getting jobs at Vogue magazine, random catering contracts) and its charmless cast interactions is that Ross's film is criminally unfunny.For a film about a bunch of crooks and con artists it's a shame the most obvious crime here is just how lame Gary Ross's and Olivia Milch's script is and it's been sometime since I've been privy to a film of this ilk that just failed to completely in creating any memorable zingers or sequences that would make it appear to be a better film than it in fact is.Final Say - I've been told the fashion in Ocean's 8 is something to keep you interested (at least my wife thinks so)so at least there's that but outside of some pretty dresses and some Hollywood glitz and glamour, Ocean's 8 is a sad attempt to showcase the girls can do crime capers as good as the guys can and it's a shame such a talented cast should be wasted on such a poorly executed attempt at popcorn entertainment.1 jar of Nutella out of 5",Ocean's Eight
41,leonblackwood,Watchable but the original is much better! 4/10,4,5 January 2019,"Review:
Although this movie is watchable, it's not in the same class as the original, and the crew seem to get away with the heist with ease. With today's technology, this remake was pretty unrealistic and the fact that there isn't an enemy made it all a bit pointless. I also wasn't that impressed with the cast, mainly because Sandra Bullock got most of the screen time, but I did like the chemistry between her and Blanchett. One of the great things about the original was the funky soundtrack, which this movie did attempt but it also wasn't in the same class. The comedic content isn't that great, and I personally think that the roles went to the wrong actors. Blanchett should have played Sandra Bullock's role and Hathaway should have been in the gang from the beginning. Rihana should have played Hathaway's role, as herself, and Bullock should have been in Blanchett's role. That's just my opinion! Anyway, following her release from prison, Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock), the younger sister of Danny Ocean, meets her former partner in crime Lou (Cate Blanchett), to convince her to join a heist that she planned whilst serving her sentence. Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter), whose a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS, Amita (Mindy Kaling) whose jewellery maker and friend of Debbies who is eager to move out of her mother's house, Nine Ball (Rihanna) whose a computer hacker, Tammy who fences stolen goods out of her family suburban home and Constance (Awkwafina), whose a street hustler and pickpocket. Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, from the Met Gala in 3 weeks time. They decide to use the Met Gala co-host, Daphne Kluger, a famous actress known for her long neck, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace in the gala. The team manipulates Daphne into choosing Weil as her stylist, and Weil and Amita go to Cartier to convince them to let Daphne wear the Toussaint. They also digitally scan the necklace in order to manufacture a cubic zirconia duplicate. As the gala begins, Daphne consumes soup that Lou spiked, causing her to vomit in the restroom, where Constance takes the necklace. Amita retools the Toussaint into several pieces of jewellery and gives them to Constance to slip to the members of the team. After a few twists and turns towards the end, each member of the team goes there separate ways with there money: Amita goes to Paris with a man she met on Tinder, Weil pays off her debts and opens her own store, Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a YouTuber, Tammy expands her business in selling stolen goods, Nine Ball opens a pool bar, Daphne becomes a director, Lou goes on a cross-country road trip and Debbie returns to her brother, Danny's grave to raise a toast to him with a Martini in his honour. It's kind of sad to see that they definitely won't be another Ocean's movie, now that Danny is dead because it would have been good to see Clooney, Pitt, Damon etc, as old men, planning and executing the perfect heist. Anyway, I was kind of left thinking ""was that it"" when it came to the end of this movie because I was expecting some sort of a clever twist. Don't get me wrong, I was surprised to see that Hathaway had joined the crew and that they had stolen much more than we thought but from an entertainment point of view, I would have liked to have seen the heist have more downfalls, which would have made it more realistic. Although the plot and the cast must have looked good on paper, the director failed to make a unique movie, which had the flamboyance and wit of the original but it's still worth a one-watch, just to see these actresses, from completely different worlds, on the big screen together. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Gary Ross, who also brought you Pleasantville, Seabiscuit, The Hunger Games and Free State of Jones starring Matthew McConaughey. He also produced Big starring Tom Hanks in 1988, Trial and Error and the Tale of Despereaux in 2008. He's certainly had a versatile career to date, which has included some big blockbusters, and with this movie being a success at the box office it did do his filmography any damage. Personally, I think that he should have done much better with this concept, and he seemed to have spent to much time on making the Met Gala look spectacular. Most people praised the performances but didn't like the storyline, which I totally agree with, so it might need some fresh eyes if there is going to be a sequel.Budget: $30million

42,TheMovieDiorama,"Ocean's 8 has all the glitz and glamour that the female reboot required, but feels far too familiar.",6,21 June 2018,"I'm all for female casts, in fact I think it's very important and believe gender equality should be at the forefront of the archaic Hollywood industry. However, a film should justify the need for a complete gender opposite reboot, otherwise it just feels like a gimmick and negates its very purpose. The Ocean's trilogy reboot just does enough to warrant its existence, albeit being a rather routinely affair. The estranged sister of Danny Ocean is released from prison and has spent years planning the perfect heist, by stealing a $150 million diamond necklace at the Met Gala. Immediately, the snappy flair that encapsulated the original trilogy was neatly replicated here, with director Gary Ross imitating Soderbergh's perceptible style. Pemberton's score felt reminiscent to classic heist comedies of old, being punchy and sparky with his instrumental pieces. The cast, automatically assigning itself as the primary appeal, work well together with naturally terrific chemistry and equal screen time. Heavyweights Bullock, Blanchett and Hathaway complemented the performances from the inexperienced Rihanna, Kaling and Awkwafina. Bonham Carter, with the voice of a leprechaun, stood out above the rest and provided succinct comedy. Corden however was grossly miscast and detracted from the high quality cast. The progressive problem, and one that was immediately foreseeable, was rebooting a trilogy. Already there are three modern films that are similar to each other whilst being in the same series, to then mimic that structure without any reinterpretation, well the plot becomes predictably unoriginal. It's routinely. Heist is planned, heist is performed, criminals must lay low and ""wait for all this to blow over"" (winning with a 'Shaun of the Dead' quote). No thrills, minimal twists and predictably safe. Though in saying that, it is undeniably fun with enough buoyancy to keep the comedic heist afloat. Do I want an 'Ocean's 9'? No. Next time, rob the Met Gala in a more unpredictably creative way.",Ocean's Eight

Even the numbers of heroines is lower than the male counterparts. So is my rate. Imho the Ocean's franchise is long dead and this one was just a try to revive it with some shoot of p.c., ""invented"" by the marketing guys and gals of the production company.

44,pmtelefon,Instantly forgettable,5,9 August 2020,"Although ""Ocean's 8"" isn't a very good movie, I wouldn't say that it's a bad one. It's just a bland movie. It has a pretty good (for the most part) cast but none of them bring anything special to the movie. Even though we're supposed to be having a great time watching ""Ocean's 8"", the movie just lays there. It feeds off our goodwill for the cast and gives us nothing in return. ""Ocean's 8"" falls into the one-and-done category for me.",Ocean's Eight
45,matthewssilverhammer,Drowns in Lazy Mediocrity,4,16 June 2018,"My first mistake was revisiting the ineffably great original trilogy so recently. Because of that, Ocean's 8 comes across like a frozen food dinner version of a lovingly-created, homecooked meal. Sure, all the ingredients are there, but any needed salt (cool jazz score, sporadic cleverness, dry humor, hip performances by a stacked cast) seems to be there more for preservation than for flavor. Where the original films effortlessly float on their Rat-Pack-esque coolness, Eight forces it, dropping the hilarious subtlety and riding on lame laziness.
Sandra Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, sister to master criminal Danny Ocean. After getting out of prison, she calls together a hodge-podge group of differently-skilled women to aid her in stealing a priceless necklace that adorns the neck of an A-list Met-Gala-attendee. As expected, we spend the majority of the film meeting the crew. Other than some colorful performances from the cast, it's all largely unremarkable until the heist itself, which is a welcome bit of throwback-fun. Unfortunately, unlike the best of the series before it (11 and 13), there's little-to-no emotional heft to their plight. I spent most the 2 hours waiting for another cameo, and asking, ""Why exactly are we rooting for these people again?""
Honestly, the conception of an ""all-girl Ocean's movie"" is just such a lackluster and unnecessary jumping-off point for a movie. Not that women can't or shouldn't star in an action-comedy-heist, or that the movie doesn't address the obvious question (""Why only women?"") to decent affect. I just wish Hollywood would trust more women filmmakers to start their own unique projects instead of simply forcing them into mediocre, half-baked remakes / spin-offs of proven moneymakers.",Ocean's Eight
46,southdavid,Ocean's Six .... out of Ocean's Ten.,6,11 July 2018,"This all female reboot generally managed to avoid the vitriol fired at the ""Ghostbusters"" remake, mostly I'd have thought because nobody really loves the turn-of-the-century amiable heist flicks, or Sinatra's 60's rat pack version with the same passion that ""Ghostbusters"" inspired. Ironically, like the ""Ghostbusters"" remake - any failings that the film has - and there are a few - stem from the writing and production and not from the great work the cast does. Sandra Bullock is Debbie Ocean, an as before unheard sister of Clooney's Danny. Upon her release from a prison sentence she sets about putting together a crew (guess how many!) to undertake a daring robbery of a near priceless necklace from the Met Gala in New York. The cast are great, Bullock and Cate Blanchett are a fun duo at the head of the picture. Anne Hathaway is having a lot of fun, as is Mindy Kaling and Sarah Paulson really should be a much bigger star than she is. The cast interactions look like they were fun, and I'd really like to see them all again. . . just in a better film than this one. The trouble is that none of the fun that the cast are having makes its way to the audience. It doesn't have that many funny lines, or scenes; the crime at the heart of the picture isn't particularly clever or memorable - but the worst problem is that the film has no antagonist. No villain to outwit, no cop on their trail thwarting them at the last minute, nothing. The nearest we get is a hapless conman played by Richard Armitage who Debbie wants her revenge on and (worst of all) James Cordon (sigh) as an insurance agent who, for some reason, probably because the film would have run longer if he had, doesn't really care about catching them, or getting much of the diamonds back. It's just about a passable way to spend a couple of hours, but for Ocean's Nine, let's look for a sharper writer.",Ocean's Eight

Really, none good jokes whatsoever and I am not being too critical, honestly.

Really, these are all great actresses who I really appreciate in lots of other movies, but the juice just isnt flowing in ""Ocean's Eight"". These actresses suddenly do try to look young and hip, while they are NOT.

48,Vartiainen,Fun little heist with a lot of style,7,10 April 2020,"Ocean's 8 works both as a sequel to the original trilogy starring George Clooney and as a soft reboot. This time it's Danny Ocean's sister Debbie (Sandra Bullock), who gets released from prison and immediately starts gathering people together for the heist of the century.And like the original Ocean's Eleven, this film managed to pull in some extremely talented people. Even more so than Eleven, in fact. We of course have Bullock, but we also have Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter and so many others. Each is given an interesting character to play and they certainly play well together.The film also knows to keep its plot lighthearted. This is a film with a lot of style. Lot of razzle dazzle, flash, smoke and mirrors. Lot of glamour, high society and elegance. And it certainly works. It's an enjoyable film to watch on many levels and the plot has enough twists to tie you into knots.That being said, the film is eerily similar to Ocean's Eleven. From story points to whole scenes to even the way it's filmed. Now, this is obviously a conscious choice, but I do wish they'd had the courage to try something of their own instead of just imitating the original classic.As thus, Ocean's 8 is not a great watch if you've just seen Eleven.

The film is about Debbie Ocean(Sandra Bullock in her first film after a 3 year hiatus) who's the sister of Danny Ocean(George Clooney) who was killed off in the original film and was released from prison. She later meets an old friend of her's played by Cate Blanchett and Debbie decides to steal a valuable necklace from the met gala which will be worn by Daphne Zulger(Anne Hathaway). So she organises a heist along with Rhianna, Mindy Kahling and Helena Bonham Carter(sporting an Irish accent) who helps her steal from the met gala
 Will they get away from it. Bottom line both me and my mom enjoyed this film as we are both huge fans of Sandra Bullock and it was nice to see her back on the big screen again. Anne Hathaway is another actress I love along with Cate Blanchett(who looked rather young in this film, did she get surgery done who knows).

As the movie opens, Debbie is up for parole after a 5 year prison stint (we later learn how that came about), and she smooth-talks her way into liberty. Before we know it, she has conned her way into a fancy hotel, and she contacts her partner Lou with a grand idea: rob a 6 lbs. Cartier diamond necklace worth $150 mill from one of the guests attending the Met Annual Gala Dinner... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the much talked about female reboot of the prior Ocean's 11 (and 12 and 13) heist caper trilogy. Writer-director Gary Ross (who brought us the first ""Hunger Games"" movie) takes over from Steve Soderbergh. An all;star ensemble cast is fronted by Sandra Bullock (playing the sister of the prior George Clooney character) and Cate Blanchett. From the get-go, we understand it: the con is on!! The first hour of the movie Debbie and Lou assemble their crew, and the second hour we see how the heist plays out. It's all super-smooth and cool for sure, yet it's also remarkably predictable, and where is the fun in all this? James Corden (as the insurance investigator) makes a late appearance and injects a much needed bolt of energy, but by then it's really too late. Kudos for the movie's photography, which is eye-candy from start to finish. There is a nice jazz lounge-reminding score, courtesy of composer Daniel Pemberton, which plays quasi non-stop.The movie opened wide a couple of weekends ago, and has done okay (not great, not bad) at the box office. I can only hope that for the inevitable ""Ocean's 9"" the movie makers think long and hard on how to improve the fun factor abut a notch or three or five... The Monday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 15 people). It seems to be a pattern for this movie: just okay.

51,subxerogravity,It's ok.,6,13 June 2018,"So as I was watching the film I did realize, I did not really like the remake of Ocean's 11. It was a good movie, but I saw it after all the hype, and it did not live up to the hype that surrounded it because of the many movie stars in it, movie stars I did not care enough about to care that they were in one movie My hopes for Ocean's 8 was low to begin with and I did not want to dislike the movie, cause I knew everyone would assume that it's because Ocean's 8 is an all women cast. To be honesty, that is half the problem. (Let me explain (please!), Like Ocean's eleven, the selling point of Ocean's eight was the idea that most of the ladies starring in it are the coolest kids in Hollywood. I Definitely would put Sandra Bullock in that company, and I love the fact that Ocean's 8 is a direct Spin-off to in the Ocean's franchise with Bullock as Danny Ocean's sister, Debbie Ocean, who's coming out of a five year stretch in the pin where she has come up with the greatest heist of all time. So she comes up with her crew which includes her best friend, Lou (Cate Blanchett, who's really cool) and six other ladies.Like with Ocean's eleven at the time, none of the women in the film really made me want to jump up and go see them in a movie. I don't like Rihanna enough as a pop star to want to see her in this movie, in fact, Rihanna's run as an actress would tell you to stay clear of this movie. I want to like Mindy Kaling enough to run to the theater to see her, but I don't. I do like Anne Hathaway enough to want to see her in a flick as well as Helena Bonham Carter (but the movies I run to see her in are nothing like this). It's not the all star team I would want to see. No Michelle Rodriguez or Michelle Yeoh or Melissa McCarthy (I would be there with bells on if Melissa McCarthy was in it). After seeing the movie the only one of the 8 that fully did it for me was Awkwafina as Constance, the street though Three card Monty player with the Sticky fingers. Out of the whole cast I had no prior knowledge of who she was (I still don't really know, I think she's a singer), but when she came up on the screen I loved her personality the most. She really entertained me. The cast was suppose to get me into the seat, but the story was not cool enough to keep me wanting to be their. I came in not expecting much and I got what I was expecting. It's not the coolest heist movie I've seen (which is bad in a heist movie that's made to showcase each star and what their part in the heist is). The movie did start to pick up for me after the deed was done and they were trying not to get caught by the insurance investigator (Played by James Corden), but that wasn't enough.I'm not cool enough to care about the coolness of the flick, but it did seem to be trying to hard to be hip. The chemistry between Bullock and Blanchett was good enough to hold the movie. It's too bad they needed six other people to pull of the heist.",Ocean's Eight
52,jtindahouse,Lacks fun and conflict,6,23 April 2019,"There is actually a line in 'Ocean's Eight' that says ""A him gets noticed, and a her gets ignored"". Now to me, in a film that is predominantly female cast and is trying to compete with earlier entries in the series that were predominantly male cast that is a very strange line to include. It was in there though and sadly it rang quite true in terms of this film. I suspect that was more to do with the actual members of the female cast they included than anything. So many of them were bland, boring and completely uninteresting. I mean Rihanna as a computer hacker was about the worst thing this movie had going for it. I get that it was probably in order to sell tickets but the actual film suffers very heavily for her being there.The film starts out with some fun scenes showing Sandra Bullock's character and her con-artist skills. At that point I thought we could be in for a very fun ride that would live up to the high standards set in the series to this point. Sadly though that kind of fun was short lived. From that point on the movie takes itself very seriously. The unwitting and natural charm that the original three entries had was no longer there. The film was too busy explaining itself and getting information out.There is also a lack of conflict in the movie. Everything goes far too smoothly. There is one problem they run into, yet that problem is fixed literally within a couple of minutes with a simple phone call. If that isn't the laziest writing I've ever seen I don't know what is. Also there is no villain in the movie. Absolutely no one to root against. How this movie got approved without that I will never know.Having said all that I didn't actually have that bad of a time with 'Ocean's Eight'. It is a smart film and that is probably the part of it I enjoyed the most. Watching how they went about this plot to get the necklace was a lot of fun. If the film wasn't impossible not to compare to the originals I think it would have gone down as a much better film. But they chose to be a part of that series and so they have to live with those comparisons. 'Ocean's Eight' passes with a bare minimum standard.",Ocean's Eight

Watching the interviews, you got the feeling that, yeah, they knew it was boring.

57,st-shot,Ocean's as predictable as the tide.,5,8 June 2018,"In the early 30's actress Kay Francis, was the biggest female star on The Warner's lot. With not much range and hampered with a lisp I wondered where the popularity lay given she was being paid five times as much as other contract player Bette Davis. After some research it turns out it was Kay's perfect model figure that allowed her the ability to wear the right frocks and look great that spoke to her largely female draw. In Ocean's Eight we are presented with a ""Tiny Town' dynamic as a bunch of pretty and stylish ladies get all dressed up and spout cliche dialogue that features a lot of flash and bling but amounts to a rather abrasive chic flic/caper film hybrid that comes across as a Sorority House presentation of The Asphalt Jungle. It's a Kay Francis film but with half a dozen women providing the fashion show this time.Debbie Ocean, Danny's sis, finishes her prison bid and like the Beat Poet says ""let time do for you"" she has devised a plan for the diamond heist of, yes, the century at a Met Gala. Selecting a diverse crew of female stereotypes they go to work and put on a fashion show. Eight's script is strictly paint by the numbers so it does not over reach or for that matter offer up cutting edge suspense and surprise. The girls for the most part are sweet adorable and cool and that's where the caper part weakens, since there can be no room for an ugly loose cannon like James Whitmore (Jungle) and Tim Carey (The Killing) to offer edge and uncertainty. Bullock as the head of the operation just doesn't cut it especially when Cate Blanchette would be truer as ringleader in a caper film but with the emphasis on chic flick the films possibilities remain limited. Anne Hathaway as the target is wonderfully surly in moments and Helen Bonham Carter steals a scene or two but overall it is a split decision for the film; inoffensive fluff chick flick vs. abysmal flaccid caper. Ocean's Eight is strictly for Kay Francis fans.",Ocean's Eight
58,alindsay-al,An Average Heist Film,5,10 May 2020,"After watching the previous three Ocean's films and the newest film Ocean's Eight which is the first one I am reviewing from scratch as I have never seen this film before and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees the sister of Danny Ocean released from prison where she teams up with a group of criminals to attempt a large heist in New York.
Main Character
In this film they are clearly going for a George Clooney and Brad Pitt chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett and it sort of works. Bullock is the main character and she has the most time devoted to her and has a bit of a personal reason for the heist and I guess you kind of care about her character but there isn't that much to keep you invested. I felt like Blanchett was really wasted in the film and honestly it feels like she could have been played by anybody in the film. The chemistry just wasn't quite there for me and I didn't buy that these people had a meaningful relationship in the film.
Supporting Characters
Anne Hathaway plays the person they are robbing and I thought she was a real highlight of this film, she is meant to play an over the top actress and she does a great job. She is so over the top drama queen that she is meant to be and for me she is the funniest character in the film. Out of the crew Sarah Poulsen was the best one for me, she actually had a bit of a character to her and obviously she is a great actress which helps. The rest of the cast though were just pretty dull, Helena Bonham Carter, Awkwafina and Rihanna are just here and I didn't care about any of them and I felt like this was a pretty dull crew of people which doesn't help the film at all.
Story
As I said in my Ocean's Thirteen review it is really hard to make a heist plot boring and not exciting and this film does a bit to make this film exciting. It has some clever moments to it and a clever piece of writing at the end that actually was better then some of the other films plans. Though this story is pretty generic and dull during it, the planning for the heist just isn't very interesting and without the great characters from before it comes across as weak. And I also have to mention the terrible marketing for this film, the trailer and posters spoil the biggest twists in the movie and it really makes it feel predictable at times and like you are waiting for certain parts of the film to happen.
Script
As mentioned, when it comes to the actual heisting there is some pretty clever writing and the payoff is pretty unique and unexpected which was nice to see. But this is easily the least funny Ocean's film and the drama just isn't there to make you care at all.
Style
The style of the film like the story is hard to mess up with a heist and this film does an okay job in making it exciting and keeping you on your toes. It's just there aren't really many issues with the heist which makes it less interesting and the pacing of the film is poor, the last 20 minutes really feel messy and like there were parts of the film that shouldn't be there.
Overall
Overall, this film epitomises average, there are some good parts about it for sure, but I watched it only a few hours ago and I have already forgotten most of the film and that makes it not worth a watch at all.",Ocean's Eight
59,iquine,Let Down By Script,4,21 November 2018,"(Flash Review)Taking the recent approach of rebooting a classic movie with an all-female cast, Ocean's Eight had the star power for success. Yep, this is a heist movie and because they are all females, they plan a, you guessed it, jewelry caper. You ingenious writers you. There were even some disingenuous scenes of them looking through jewelry magazines. Just like in the original Ocean's 11, Danny Ocean's estranged sister Debbie plans this caper and goes out to assemble her crew. Some of the eight join the team for preposterous reasons. How will they plan and pull off the theft of a multi-million dollar diamond neckless? There were a few plot holes that really spoil this and the biggest one was at the key moment during the theft. Also, the hipster tech gal is able to hack, anything, in seconds with her trusty laptop. Some acting was ok and some of it was phoned in. This is no more than a glitzy and shallow caper that rings false; worse in ways than many TV detective shows. Light entertainment at best with a few moderate chuckles and action.",Ocean's Eight
60,henry8-3,Oceans 8,3,23 February 2019,"Bullock is released from prison whereupon she kicks of her plan to steal a $150m diamond necklace.I guess if you liked the Clooney efforts you might enjoy this detailed planning and robbery caper. It is though without much humour, has little or no tension, the few twists are of no consequence and the 2 principals (Bullock and Blancett) are a colossal bore with the support characters, particularly Bonham-Carter offering more fun.A missed opportunity.",Ocean's Eight
61,pixrox1,Some film buffs argue that any movie released by . . .,7,20 June 2018,". . . Warner Bros., such as the current film OCEAN'S EIGHT, must be warning America about something, whether by design or just by happenstance. IF this is so, what is the USA to make of OCEAN'S EIGHT? Is it really meant to tell the Filthy Rich NOT to parade their $150 million necklaces in front of a gaggle of wait people and table bussers, most of whom consider themselves lucky should they be paid minimum wage and have a legal right NOT to be deported by ICE agents. Who's to say that it's morally wrong to have Russian Faberge eggs floating around worth more than the value of Puerto Rico? After all, residents of that island can die by the thousands, and our government doesn't even feel it necessary to count. On the other hand, knowing the EXACT number of Faberge eggs in existence, as well as the approximate location of each, was the main prerequisite for obtaining a position in the current White House Cabinet. The message of OCEAN'S EIGHT seems to be that each American has choice: Become a Rich Crook, or fade away without a trace as a Unknown Soldier slaving for foks with the gumption to choose option #1. Such recent non-Warner Bros. fare as GOTTI and CHAPPAQUIDDICK suggest that the ability to become a Rich Crook depends a lot upon HEREDITARY. Maybe it's possible to contend that OCEAN'S EIGHT is carefully crafted to warn America's Silver Spoon Set that Little People with moxie and smarts can play that game, too.",Ocean's Eight

The wanted to steal from a gala with having a motive of revenge in the heart. Doesn't it looks like the mixing of Ocean's 12 and 13.The characters doesn't convince. Screenplay is good but the movie lacks the appeal and charm of the previous movies. It's also seems that the director was making the movie on his whims and fancies.Hope the director and the production unit will not continue this crap by making more movies.",Ocean's Eight
64,r96sk,I really enjoyed 'Ocean's Eight',8,31 December 2020,"Good stuff, this.I really enjoyed 'Ocean's Eight'. It's a sizeable drop off from the great 'Ocean's Eleven', but I actually - just narrowly - enjoyed it more than 'Ocean's Twelve' and 'Ocean's Thirteen'. With this 2018 film, they got a lot right. The pacing, but also the casting.It's nice to have Sandra Bullock (Debbie) return just to keep the continuity going, that as well as the fact that she's very good in this. I rate her as an actress, but sometimes I find her performances irritating - here, the complete opposite, I love how charismatic and confident she plays Debbie. Cate Blanchett (Lou) supports her well, too.The rest of the cast are strong choices. I enjoyed seeing Rihanna and Awkwafina, along with Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling and Anne Hathaway. James Cordon appears too, he seems to split opinion but I like him.The plot is good, very watchable. I found myself questioning one moment of the nitty-gritty event, but otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it unfold. I also liked the editing around it. The ending isn't the greatest, but still more than satisfactory.",Ocean's Eight
65,kirbylee70-599-526179,THE LADIE'S TURN,7,14 September 2018,"OCEAN'S 8 is now on disc and it's a cause to celebrate and to worry at the same time. Celebrate because it's great to see women in dynamic roles normally assigned to men and worry because Hollywood seems to think the best way to do that is to place them in roles men have already used up. We saw this with the release of the female version of GHOSTBUSTERS and now with the Ocean franchise. Sandra Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, sister of Danny Ocean (George Clooney) from the previous films. Just released from prison having spent five years there for after being framed for a theft her boyfriend did, she's had time to think up the greatest heist ever conceived. Now she just need to organize a team to help her pull off her plan.As Danny had right hand man Rusty so too has Debbie in the form of Lou (Cate Blanchett). Having worked together in the past Lou is on board with her plan. That plan is to steal one of the most valuable pieces of jewelry in the world, a necklace called the Toussaint from Cartier valued at $150 million. Her plan is to steal the necklace while it's being worn by socialite Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) at the exclusive Met Gala held by Vanity Fair at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Lou and Debbie begin assembling her team. Each one is necessary to perform different tasks at hand and each has their own reason for wanting in on the job, all involving money. First up is Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter), a fashion designer on the outs who they finagle into creating a gown for Daphne. Next up is Amita (Mindy Kaling), a jewelry expert and designer who wants out of her mother's house. In need of a hacker they settle on Nine Ball (Rhianna) whose skills are above their needs. For a pickpocket they choose Constance (Awkwafina) from the streets. The last member of the team is Tammy (Sarah Paulson), an acquaintance of Debbie who's a housewife who sells stolen goods on the side out of her garage. Once assembled they begin to explain the plan to those involved. The majority of the movie then sets in motion the various means necessary for the women to pull off the heist from one of the most well guarded buildings in the world. Each one uses their skills to achieve the endgame of the heist that takes place the night of the Met Gala. The plan can only work if everyone does their job with split timing precision. Just before the plan goes into effect Lou talks to Debbie and realizes there is more going on here than just the heist. The ex whose own theft put Debbie behind bars will also be at the Gala and escorting none other than Daphne. Could this be payback? As with the first film in the series, of course it is.The rest of the film shows the heist being pulled off and the girls escaping. It's not a spoiler to let you know that because hey, if they didn't then the movie would be nothing but set up and no payoff. Once they've achieved their goal comes the final portion of the film, perhaps the last 40 minutes. An insurance investigator with a history with the Ocean family, John Frazier (James Corden) is assigned by the insurance company to the case. Recognizing Debbie he's certain she's involved but has no way to prove it. But he's diligent. Will he find a way?You're probably asking yourself something else by now. The title is OCEAN'S 8 but there are only 7 members of the team listed. That eighth person, and yes it is another woman, is revealed in this last section as well. It makes sense as do the choices of all involved. So is the movie any good? Well yes and no. It is quite well made and looks incredible. Each and every one of the actresses involved her turns in a picture perfect performance. Without trying to sound sexist Bullock and Blanchett continue to look ravishing. And yes the movie is quite entertaining.My only problem with the film was that unlike the others in the franchise this one didn't have that sense of fun going for it. The others all felt like those involved were having a good time. I didn't get that sense here. In addition to that seeing this gathering of some of the best female actors on screen together I felt like they deserved something of their own to be in rather than a female version of a story dominated by males in the past. They're better than that. The end result is a movie that you'll have fun watching even if you're not a huge fan of the others. Fans of those involved will love seeing their favorites in roles otherwise not done in the past. It's a nice evening's film that is well worth watching.",Ocean's Eight
66,davispittman,Entertaining continuation,8,21 June 2018,"Oceans 8 had a lot of eyes on it when it was released earlier this month. Some people thought it would just be a ""feminist flop"", while others expected it to be a success both commercially and critically. I expected this film to be good when it went in to see it and I was satisfied by what I got. I was expecting a fun entertaining ride with good acting from the accomplished cast and well done comedy. I think this film delivers on all that. In my opinion it delivers well. I am big fans of pretty much all members of the cast. None of them disappointed, I think they all did well with their roles. Bullock and Hathaway both in particular shined, but I also really loved blanchett, Paulson and carter. The writing has many amusing comedic material which makes the film more fun and enjoyable. I feel like oceans 8 is a well done entertaining continuation, I'd say its definitely worth a watch and the price of admission. 8/10 for Oceans 8.

This movie was big back in the day, modernizing the crime film, and solidifying some of the mainstays of the decade's biggest stars. Many films have followed suit, but none quite establishing the legacy the Oceans series did, and this weekend, they will attempt to do it again, but establish a different group to lead instead. Hi, Robbie K here with another review, this time on:Movie: Ocean's 8Director:
 Gary Ross
Writers:
 Gary Ross (screenplay by), Olivia Milch (screenplay by)
Stars:
 Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway 
 LIKES: Fun: No doubt about it, I had fun in this film. Watching the new adventure unfold brought a renewed energy to this series that contained many elements and styles to have you chuckling or smiling in delight. The new 8 has captured a portion of the original trilogy's mood, but twists it into a more entertaining tale than you might expect. Balance: My pre-review stated concern that the movie's dynamic was going to be solely comedy and political power for women, but my concerns were wrong. The writers managed to interject key comedic moments that had wit and timing behind them to capitalize on the laughs. Even more impressive, is how they showed off how awesome these women were, but didn't quite rub it in our faces via preachy monologues and aggressive, anti-male lines. The result was a more respectable, and acceptable screenplay. Fast Pace: The movie didn't drag like I was concerned with, moving a fairly quick pace and utilizing the screen time to make it fun. My first-time check was almost 1-hour in and could not believe so much time had passed in such a little amount. Such a speed adds a little energy to it, keeping you entertained and further adding to the enjoyment of the movie. The costumes: My lord was wardrobe on point, crafting incredible outfits for our stylish sisters to wear (when they aren't dressing like bums). Ocean's 8 is a grown women's fantasy closet, with numerous designs to reel the targeted audience in and keep it lodged in for the full 2 hour run time. Throw in some very fancy, gorgeous accessories and jewelry, you might understand why many in my showing were oohing and aching for most of the movie. Such a suave style fits well with the characters of the movie and it adds personality to an already colorful cast. Acting: It's decent, what else can I say. Ocean's 8 is not going to have award winning nominations, but Sandy B and her team get props for not only bringing each character to life, but also creating a new family that show the makings for future development and tension in the future. Kudos also go out for utilizing each character fairly well, not necessarily perfect, but much better than most films, even integrating cameos to interweave with the leading ladies. James Corden: A final nod goes to Corden's appearance in the movie. His introduction brings with it a new sense of comedy that feels much like his talk show moments we've fallen in love with. New story elements are teased with him, but Corden somehow further amplifies the fun and had the audience laughing the most of the film. A well-timed and integrated move my friends, and one I hope will come in future installments, should they decide to go that direction. DISLIKES: Carbon Copy: The first movie was epic and really broke ground, but this movie... not so much. Ocean's 8 feels more like a big game of steeling dress up items than a true crime/drama, it lacks some of the unique elements and the energy isn't quite there to feel original. The result is a formulaic film that emphasizes new qualities in a criminal team, that is a major set up for future installments. Yes, it falls victim to franchise mode, which causes the movie to suffer elsewhere, like...Semi-Use of Nostalgia: Acknowledging that this is a movie meant to establish its own stride, Ocean's 8 tries to utilize nostalgia to help spice things up. I can say they hit some great moments to it, integrating it to help further the plan, but other times was just a nod that didn't have quite the same emphasis as the bigger moments. George Clooney's reference in particular felt very lazy to me, but potential sequels may correct this component or at least shed some light on things. Weak Character Development: Like the other Ocean's movies, the criminal team didn't quite get a hard self-reflection/revelation that other films in this genre has. Ocean's 8 tries to get things rolling, primarily in Bullock and Blanchett's character's guidance, but much of it is a generic, diluted mess that doesn't feel invested by the writers. As for the other characters, yeah they are rather superficial sub-plots, much of their desires not even remotely fleshed out contributing to an incomplete writing or foreshadowing for more franchise moments coming. This is franchise planning at its ""finest"" the plan for more movies to explain, instead of letting the first movie do some heavy lifting. Lack of Plausible Opposition/Tension: Ocean's 11 had plenty of parts that kept you on your toes and your interest engaged, perhaps even convincing your mind that the team won't make it. Ocean's 8 has severely diluted the tension, with very few obstacles to come close to standing in their way. Perhaps it's the fun nature, or a subtle nod that women are better planners, but I felt the ""exciting"" climax was not quite as suspenseful or engaging as the predecessors. This film needed a little direr strait to get you caring about them, perhaps again awaiting another film to bring more opposition to the mix. The Trailers Ruined Twists: Watch one trailer semi-closely, and you now have the surprises robbed from you, including the two bigger treasures hidden in this film. Ocean's 8 marketing was good, but perhaps it did a little too well to ruin some plot points. If you haven't watched it, you are in luck, otherwise get ready to be less surprised based on what you remember. 
The VERDICT:  Ocean's 8 isn't as horrible as may predicted it to be, and much of this comes from the fear of heavy bombardment in female comedy/principles. Yet, the group did a great job balancing those components in, striving to find balance between nostalgia and newness, comedy and seriousness, and women vs. men's parts in plans succeeding, seeing these women dressed up in fantastic features strengthened the fun this movie brought, helping to keep the energy flowing. Yes, it requires some more uniqueness to be put in, and the character development certainly needs an overhaul, especially if they add another woman to the brigade. Even more, this potential series need s to tighten its focus and bring some suspense to the movie to maximize its effect. Still, this movie is worth the theater visit, primarily with girls groups, mostly due to the bond the ladies bring... and it's the only crime film out right now. My scores are: Action/Comedy/Crime: 6.5-7.0
Movie Overall: 5.5 -6.6",Ocean's Eight

77,eric262003,Realism Isn't For the Better,5,1 April 2019,"Though it's made with the best of intentions to appease to the female fans who are into the spy and heist genres that made the ""Ocean's"" series and the remakes in the 2000's a hit for the guys, it still comes out very short in terms of delivering a solid story and creating scenes that you can keep in your memories for a long time to come. ""Ocean's 8"" stars Sandra Bullock as grief-stricken Debbie Ocean who has just recently gotten on parole leaves the premises sporting the maximum security in Nevada in a pair of stilettos and an evening gown. If you've seen the 2001 ""Ocean's Eleven"" you'll notice she's the same woman in the opening scene which you'll be bored by the results of the outcome that is yet to come. Once she's out she pulls off a few highly prolific heists but contemplates on setting up a group of top-notch female counterparts in attempt to steal a 6 lb. Toussaint Cartier diamond necklace that's owned by an actress located at the Met Gala.Unfortunately, the only things that hold my interest is the ultra expensive necklace that's worth up $150,000,000 and the Met Gala where the heist is supposed to set. Even that it still looks more like an overlong commercial pitch than the female empowerment spiel that this movie loosely chimes about. In the scenes at the Gala that caters to the wealthy we see eccentric but clueless fashion designer Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter) pandering over a group of jewelry dealers. As you would predict, the dealers offer the Toussaint necklace to Miss Weil so that she could place it around the neck of Hollywood actress Daphne Kluger (Anna Hathaway) to wear at the Gala.The crooks as a whole lack in very much character development let alone aren't given enough backstory as to why they are who they are. The eighth member's add in is just purely incoherent in its storytelling. In addition to that, the crooks do very little because it's the technological apparatuses they utilize do it for them. Nine Ball (Rihanna who was 2016's co-chairperson at the Gala) has managed to invent a special pair of glasses with the ability to hack into objects and get the information from a 3-D printer. Her specs can hack through the Met's security cameras and can find a blind spot that avoid the ultra cool but less dangerous dependency of using wires.So while the scenes just meanders as time passes with the ladies getting through security with their high-tech gadgets rather than the physical schemers like the Ocean's characters from the trilogy in the 2000's, it takes the last twenty minutes before everything falls into place. James Corden is insurance investigator John Frazier finally catches on what these lady hackers are up to. In these twenty minutes alone, he has more dialogue than the talented pickpocket Constance (Awkwafina) or jewel maker Amita (Mindy Kaling). The expertise of these ladies are so advanced, they don't necessarily need hold on as a cohesive unit except for the climactic heist. The heist pans off no differently to the modernized ways of co-working spaces and out of town contractors.Sure most of the shady characters from the previous Ocean's series were vague to one another, or esoteric like ""The Amazing Yen"" (Qin Shaobo) who gets a cameo. The crooks being distanced from each other most of the time gives this reboot a lack of chemistry plus the cool factor of getting in on the action was absent. The humour factor is way too clean and too safe as directors Gary Ross and his co-writer Olivia Milch made this film to be played out way too seriously and very politically correct so that they don't anger the female demographics who are watching this movie. The jokes seem to be bogged down by by petty stuff like green juice and Nutella to relief stress. Whereas Danny Ocean was boss when it came to rigging casinos and felt adjusted to the surroundings, the motives behind Debbie Ocean's target at the Met Gala was due to walking the red carpet and getting their hands on the Toussaint.

That's the theme I felt was going on in the film & with the way Ghostbusters went about it, I'd say petty vengeance in this film is mirrored to how films are now with female remakes now. Least the previous oceans films weren't like that! It's only with this political correctness kak that films like this get made in this cancer of a day & age we live in! Women bringing themselves to the so called level of empowerment like a childish act of tit for tat! Pathetic!The films story-line, although interesting & clever (in terms of the jewelry plot anyway) was pretty naff & not anything special. I feel the only reason this film was made was just for the sake of it being female based. Feminist should leave our films alone. I also found the whole my-boyfriend-put-me-in-prison-for-no-reason-so-I'm-going-to-be-a-real-women-&-stoop-to-his-level-&-frame-him-like-he-did-me-because-that's-so-mature-&-women-like! To be another sexist overtone in the film.I also found the film to be somewhat been there done that! It was samey & simply not unique! The films reception was luke warm, but hey feminists will try & twist it into believing it down to us men panning it down when it's not exactly, but hey take one of our films & change it to suit your women empowered me too regime & this is what happens! Get over it! The film wasn't anything special, it was pretty poor & not something I'd ever recommend to my mates!I overall found the film to be pretty poor, it has some interesting points but it fell big to have a sexist overtone too it.

If I had to single out anyone for praise I would probably say that Anne Hathaway was the standout; but I honestly don't think that I could say there was any weak link in the team. I think in general the third act was a little disappointing. The first two acts I thought were great fun. I enjoyed the way we were introduced to all the characters. I enjoyed the planning stage, where they worked out exactly how the heist was going to go down. Then the heist itself was cleverly done. I also wanted to say that I thought the costume department did a fantastic job. The clothes in this movie looked great. My problem with the film came after the heist. The writing in the third act I felt went from really good to just ok; and as a result the film as a whole suffered slightly. I should make clear that it wasn't a bad final act. It's just that I had a lot of fun with the first two acts; then felt like the third just kind of fizzled out.
On the whole I have to say that I did like Ocean's 8. I thought it was (mostly) well written, well directed and well performed. It does have some flaws and won't win any originality contests but it was enjoyable.",Ocean's Eight

Bullock's ringleader is joined by Cate Blanchett's grifter Lou, Helena Bonham Carter's fashionista Rose, Rihanna's hacker Nine Ball, Mindy Kaling's jeweller Amita, Sarah Paulson's fixer Tammy and Awkwafina's pickpocket Constance. The targets: Anne Hathaway's celebrity Daphne Kluger and Richard Armitage's playboy Claude Becker. Throw in a raft of cameos and it's a cast that well and truly rivals Clooney, Pitt, Damon and co. Yet it's another example of how star-power isn't everything, especially when the script is unambitious and the direction-here by Gary 'Hunger Games' Ross-is uninspired. Ross seems more concerned with mimicking what has come before rather than standing out. There's a likable 70s feel to Eigil Bryld's cinematography, all twisting scene connectors and amusing crash zooms, and Daniel Pemberton's score is a nice rift on vintage heist tunes, à la Scott Joplin's classic jazz-infused score for The Sting. Plot wise there's not much to write home about, the narrative structure sticking boringly close to genre convention: the team forms and specific skills are displayed, the plan is put in danger by unexpected hiccups, the plan is executed with a few surprises. The cast are all clearly having a blast and lightweight popcorn fare has its place in the cinema, but this could've gone up a few notches had it dared to be edgier, bolder and/or more innovative. A safe and comfortable romp, Ocean's 8 delivers the bare minimum required to enjoy your time at the cinema, but misses an opportunity to be so much more.",Ocean's Eight

The original movies (well 11 and 13 at least) did push suspension of disbelief but within reason; 8 just go way past the point of ridiculous at times.

There was no attempt to cultivate the Robin Hood element.
You know those Youtube videos where some scumbag lifts a tourists wallet? Well that is basically Sandra Bullock's character.As with a lot of modern heist movies the characters (with the exception of the IT specialist) are just platforms to give technology mobility.
I.E take this magic techno-widget to this place and wave it around.
The only meaningful contribution the Ocean's make is to stall some very stupid people by jabbering at them.Unfortunately the story is also exceptional weak.
The master-plan somehow manages to be both ludicrous and dull.
It has massive plot holes, is unrealistic, and is unnecessarily convoluted - like some kind of Wylie Coyote bird trap.
That would be fine if the heist was fun or exciting instead of a rather tedious dinner party.It also suffers from a short attention span.
Some issue surfaces that could cause some drama- but all the Ocean's do is out-source it to some expert and it is all solved within two brief scenes.This is not the poo-bomb a lot of people make out, it is just very, very dull.

88,educallejero,"The same, but with (mostly) women",5,17 January 2020,"And the start is good, with Sandra Bullock as Ocean's (George Clooney) sister, Debbie, out of prison after a scam that went wrong five years ago. It's very entertaining watching her character survive with little scams for while until she mets with Cate Blanchett's character (doing basically Brad Pitt in Ocean 11), her partner in crime.And that's where the problems arrive, once the heist start. First, Bullock (54) and Blanchett (49) were older than Clooney and Pitt in OCEAN 13! And it's important because their energy and sex appeal is just not as great, making in less belieavable that these old women would live in the underworld as scam criminals. At least that's how I felt. It seemed forced to me.But besides the esthetics, the movie fails at narrative storytelling. The team building is a bit boring. The plan is not as exciting and the tension is poorly executed, with the plan going pretty well for the most part, with few parts of struggle. And when something goes wrong, it gets resolved in literal seconds, taking away any tension they were building. Another problem is how some members of the group are pretty much pointless. Awkwafina and Mindy Kalling were there for diversity alone? Instead of these two funnier women, we had plenty of boring Sarah Paulson and dated weird Helena Bonham. Oh, and Rihanna as, kid you not, a hipster hacker. Stupid.But. Even with all these things, as a fan of the ""heist genre"", I have to say I was mostly entertained, Cate Blanchett does a passable Brad Pitt when all is said and done (maybe needed one more jolt of energy), and the main arc, Bullock's Ocean, is good and well done.It's fine, but clearly worse than it should've been.",Ocean's Eight
89,PartialMovieViewer,For All the Critics Who Paid to See This.,1,16 April 2019,"Why did you spend money on this? Never mind, I wasted money on this toilet-reject myself. As bad as this thing is, I found myself walking away with a surprisingly redeeming dividend. What is this surprising dividend you ask? Be patient Grasshopper. After I reflecting upon past cinematic experiences I began noticing commonalities among most of the recent plotless retreads I had to suffer through. Since none of these projects are really new or fresh, i guess they figure they can just attach some 'clever' twist so they can declare a sense of ownership to some tired, old story. Sometimes there is success with ripping off old tales...bah...no there isn't. For this flickeroo, here is the 'clever twist': Instead of using a bunch of fun guys, having a fun time pulling off a fun caper, let's get some big female names. We will have these women, who actually have histories of funny, unique personalities and also are very talented, and make them all act like tough guys (actually, make them all act like the same tough guy). Now you have 8 different sizes, shapes, hairstyle, hustling everywhere, and all acting like that same one tough guy. As disappointed as I was with this movie, this is not the only flick lacking story, script and plot. That dividend I spoke of earlier is more of an epiphany than anything else.

If you liked the other Ocean movies, then you will probably like this one. Just be aware it's an all-female cast. The entire cast did a good job and pretty much follows the MO of previous movies, in which they plan a heist, recruit the crew and then carry it out. After doing the heist, they go over what they did, with the extra stuff in flashbacks. It's a proven formula that works. The only thing I didn't like was to see what Bullock and Blanchett have done to their faces. All that plastic work was just horrible. It would be nice if great actresses can just grow old gracefully on screen. Really.",Ocean's Eight
91,rockman182,Ocean's 8 (2018),6,11 June 2018,"I'm a big fan of Steven Soderbergh. So when I first saw Ocean's Eleven, I loved it. It was a damn good heist film that was smart, suave, and comedic. Didn't care as much for either sequel unfortunately. I thought the trailer for Ocean's 8 looked good enough. It also billed a fairly good cast; I was very into a pairing involving Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett. The prognosis is this: Ocean's 8 is fun in parts and has wonderful costume design and an elegant feel but there is a lack of stakes and I don't think each character is fleshed out enough to make this a great film. The film follows Debbie Ocean (the younger sister of Danny Ocean, George Clooney's character in the original trilogy). Debbie has recently been released from prison and devises a plan to steal a $150 million dollar diamond necklace during the yearly met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She enlists the help of six other women and promises that each will get a large cut of the steal. Along with Bullock and Blanchett the film stars Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Rihanna, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, and Helena Bonham Carter. Let me run through the positives first. The film looks great. The theme at the Met Gala allows for the cast and cameos to shine and look elegant and fit for the role of being in such a lavish event. The films actual heist is also interesting no matter how non practical it would be. There are passages in the film which are good, but they don't always come often and are not memorable enough.The characters aren't all developed well. I think Rihanna was fine enough because she is a not so verbose hacker. I do think that Mindy Kaling and Awkwafina were very underutilized and faded away many times in this film. I also feel like Cate Blanchett is tremendous and needed a bigger role in the film. Its not all bad though, really though Anne Hathaway was fine in her role. I also felt like there was a lack of stakes during the steal. Its almost too easy with no real bump in the road. Overall, I'm mixed about Ocean's 8. There are things about this film that I like but I think it fails to be memorable. At times it feels like a real copy of Soderbergh's Oceans Eleven. The film lacks strong characterization, is oddly devoid of good humor, and could have been written better. It lacks what was so good about the first film in the Ocean's trilogy. Its a fair watch but a one time deal. 6/10",Ocean's Eight

Sandra plays Debbie Ocean, the younger sister of Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney in the previous ""Ocean's"" movies, who is released from prison after 5 years. Note that George only appears in photo. Sandra's Debbie rightfully served her time for robbery and fraud. She's not a really good person. Once freed with $45 to her name, unrepentant Debbie immediately returns to her life of crime. Debbie admits to her business and possibly past romantic partner Lou, elegantly cool Cate Blanchett, ""Because I'm good at it."" During her years in solitary confinement Debbie devised the proofed scheme to rob the Met Gala in New York City. Specifically, steal the $150 million dollar Trouisant necklace worn by ego manic actress Daphne Kluger, hysterically vapid Anne Hathaway. Lou and Debbie assemble their super team. Aside from pure larceny, Debbie's real motives seemingly reveal. Lou angrily confronts Debbie's con job to avenge her former lover's betrayal. Cate and Sandra's authentic no bull chemistry elevates and personalizes the often superfluous narrative by screenwriters Ross and Olivia Milch. ""Ocean's 8"" is still unexpected hilarious fun. Yet, it rings hollow at times. Is it only about stealing priceless jewels? Is it about Debbie exacting revenge upon ex-lover art dealer Claude, played by lizard-like charming Richard Armitage? Yeah, it's about the very talented women, who are way smarter, attempting the impossible heist. Still watching you wonder: Is there more? Not surprisingly, Sandra is beautiful and smart as Debbie. Her unique movie star gift whether romantic comedy or drama is her heart and authenticity. Here she is way too cool; her Debbie revels in being smarter than thou. Fortunately, Lou and Debbie's touching affection for one another, romantic or otherwise, balances the elitist narrative. Cate is ultra-cool repose sitting with her arms rested on each leg. She commands in her calm presence. The supporting cast is part of the arresting diversion of ""8"". Anne is brilliant comedic charm as the underestimated Daphne. Rihana is understated swag and smarts as expert street hacker Nine Ball. Awkwafina is mercurial bravado as street magician and master pickpocket Constance. Sarah Paulson is meticulously clumsy as expert fencer Tammy. Mindy Kaling is under leveraged as sweet shy jeweler Amita. Helena Bonham Carter is little too quirky in her version of Cindy Lauper as a vanguard designer Rose Weil. Gratefully, Sandra's Debbie delivers humanity in the final frames of ""Ocean's 8"". So there's more. ""Ocean's 8"" gamely amuses with its glamorous couture and glorious flourish of the Met Gala. Sandra steals hysterical moments in her mastery of German.

93,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"A sub-par ""Ocean's"" movie on almost every level.",5,8 March 2019,"As the gender-swapped spin-off of a remake, Ocean's Eight (2018) feels convoluted merely based on its heritage. While I love the Ocean's Eleven (2001) remake, I was curious to see what would make Ocean's Eight something that would distinctly empower women (which I'm assuming was the point). In the end, it seems like Ocean's Eight merely highlights the 72% wage disparity when compared to Ocean's Eleven since most of the tropes and clichés almost felt like they were pandering to the very audience they were trying to lift up.While I will praise Ocean's Eight for its ability to be a passable heist film, both with main and ""twist"" heists, that's mostly where my adoration ends. Sure, I get the need to move the setting to New York to better align with fashion and other women's interests, and part of Sandra Bullock's character introduction after being released from prison was fun, but there were so many problems with the plot and characters that I'm still scratching my head days later thinking, ""Wait, what?"" I mean, there was no way that these women would have gotten away with this heist, especially considering all the details they had to overcome. They might have stolen jewelry, but they'd certainly be caught afterward.I suppose when it comes right down to it, the ""Ocean's"" franchise doesn't work outside of Las Vegas. That's part of the appeal: the flashy razzle-dazzle of the casinos that entice us all to play games of chance to get rich quick. New York may be the city that never sleeps, but that's because they're working hard to earn their fortunes. This disconnect-along with the loose connection to the original reboot trilogy-is what disappointed me the most and made me want to go home and watch the 2001 Ocean's Eleven. It also probably didn't help that the music, while being great music, was more suited for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) than an Ocean's movie.

Let's start with Cate Blanchett as the right-hand ""man"" of Bullock's character. This character is a good microcosm of what is right - and what is wrong - with this sort of ""let's throw a ton of stars onto the screen"". Her mysterious character, Lou, and Blanchett's portrayal of this character, are fascinating and interesting to watch. I could have had a full movie just about Lou. But, of course, I don't get a full movie of Lou, I have to be satisfied with just snippets of Lou - but those snippets are very interesting, indeed.Same goes for Helena Bonham Carter's dress designer, Rose Weil. This is another interesting, quirky character (does Bonham Carter play anything but?) and, surprisingly, we spend much of the first 1/3 of the film following her, but then she disappears for long periods of time (so the film can give screen time to the others).And...each of the ""others"" - Mindy Kalling, Rihanna, Sarah Paulson and Awkwafina (not a misprint) - all have their ""moments"", but that's about it. They are there to fill things out in this film - and they all play their roles in this film with professionalism - but none of them are up to the level of Blanchett or Bonham Carter.Surprisingly, the two performers that do shine through in this film is Anne Hathaway as the ""ditzy"" actress that is the dupe of the plot and (really surprisingly) James Cordon as an Insurance Investigator who comes along about 3/4 of the way into this film. At some point, someone calls him ""Columbo"" and that is an apt description. Someone get this actor a weekly Detective show for this character! Both Hathaway and Cordon add a spark of brightness - and fun - to this film and when they are not on the screen that absence of ""fun"" is noticeable.I place the blame for the lack of ""fun"" in this film on the direction of Gary Ross (HUNGER GAMES) and, especially, in the portrayal of Debbie Ocean by Ms. Bullock. Her character is driven, calculating and S-E-R-I-O-U-S! She is on a mission and doesn't stray from it. The film references the George Clooney character multiple times. Unfortunately, all this does is remind us how different from DANNY Ocean that DEBBIE Ocean is. Where he is charming, she is calculating. Where he is fun, she is serious. Where he comes off as ""playing a game"", she comes off as ""doing a job"". I think Ross and Bullock missed the point of these films - have fun.Which is what Hathaway and Cordon do - they have fun. You can then juxtapose that fun with the quirky, interesting characters of Blanchett and Bonham Carter - and you have 3/4 of a good film.Letter Grade: B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Ocean's Eight

The answer of course.... is a major spoiler, so we won't go there.Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock, ""Gravity""), the previously unreferenced sister of arch-scoundrel Danny Ocean (George Clooney) from the reboot trilogy, is released from prison after a 5 year stretch. This has given her plenty of time to plan her next job - a jewellry heist from the New York Met - in intricate detail. She recruits biker-chick Lou (Cate Blanchett , ""Carol"") as her partner and they then proceed to recruit a team of expert crimimals: well... some are not criminals, but soon will be! Will they succeed, or will Debbie have an even longer time to plan her next heist?The movie unfortunately is rather like watching paint dry. It's very glossy and expensive paint, I grant you, but compared to certainly Ocean's 11 and even Ocean's 13 it's not in the premier league. There's virtually nothing about the plot that leaves you surprised. Even the twists are merely ""oh""s rather than ""OH!'s"". Stylistically the film attempts to model the Soderbergh split-screen visuals of his films, doing it quite well, and is accompanied by a similar jazz-style soundtrack which works effectively. Arguably, the well-chosen music by Daniel Pemberton (""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"") is the best thing in the film.Otherwise though, that's where most of the similarities end, with there being limited character development to make you really care all that much whether the team win or lose. The script, by director Gary Ross (""The Hunger Games"") and Olivia Milch had a few clever lines that made me smile: but it's not laugh-out-loud territory. So the story had better be good. Unfortunately, here Gary Ross's story has so many implausible coincidences and incredulous leaps of intuition - ""yeah, I'm from the hood innit but I have a grasp of magnetic resonance couplings learnt the hard way, from the street up!"" - that belief is less suspended and more hung, drawn and quartered. This is not saying that the Ocean's trilogy was without a few similar issues - reaching its nadir with Julia Roberts pretending to be Julia Roberts in ""Ocean's 12"" - but this film is more consistently bonkers.I have to admit that the build up to the heist through the first half of the film left me sufficiently entertained, but that momentum suddenly fizzles out and the final reel becomes quite tedious. I also expected something to happen at the end, cameo-wise, that never did! Acting wise, the best turn comes from Anne Hathaway (""Colossal"", ""Les Miserables"") as a vainglorious actress but Helena Bonham Carter (""Suffragette"", ""Harry Potter"") is also good value as the quirky fashion expert, coming across like some sort of ditzy Fatima Blush. I also liked Rihanna's 'Nine Ball' character. Less successful for me was Bullock, who I felt came across as very wooden, and Blanchett, slightly less so. There are also some 'B-list' celebrities attending the Met-gala that are fun to watch out for, as well as two members of the earlier films' cast.So, it's a disappointing effort from Gary Ross.

Most of the characters are so thinly written it is a waste of everyone's talent with only James Corden's insurance investigator as the only highlight in the film, even though he appears only about 20 minutes from the end.It's a film that attempts to demonstrate girl power, but sadly just projects a vacuous shallowness.

102,springfieldrental,Gary Ross Lays A Bomb,2,14 June 2018,"I've always wondered if a multi-nominated director/scriptwriter comes out with a rare clunker that Hollywood still green lights the project. Well, in ""Ocean's 8,"" now I know the studios will bless a script that is so abysmal it almost defies why anyone would even bother to make it--never mind for the paying public to spend money and its time to see this. Heralded Gary Ross, creator of ""Hunger Games,"" ""Big,"" and ""Seabiscuit"" among other classics, is the writer/director of Ocean's 8. With an all-star cast, one would think Ross's talents would produce one of the greatest heist comedies in cinematic history. Alas, this effort is anything but.From the beginning, when Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett get together to plan a multi-million dollar jewel theft, their wooden acting (and barely understandable dialogue) is a harbinger of things to come. The criminal characters' backgrounds are practically devoid of any deep motivations behind their devious actions. The great ensemble of actresses is completely wasted in Ocean's 8. And the plot is so implausible that one wonders if Ross' creative well has dried up. There are so many holes in this film it defies why somebody in the studio boardroom reviewing the script didn't make mention of them. I guess with Ross's reputation one doesn't dare question his ""genius."" I gave Ocean's 8 an extra star for the slick editing of Juliette Welfling. I loved her editing in ""The Diving Bell and The Butterfly,"" and her work, especially seen early on in the film with several invisible wipes, stands out. She is one of cinema's great talents in post-production. However, even she can't save this complete waste of time.",Ocean's Eight
103,kjproulx,Disappointing When Comparing The Previous Films,6,8 June 2018,"Regardless of the concept, I've always been intrigued every time a new heist movie makes it to the big screen. The sheer notion of watching a group of people flawlessly pull off something that most people would be crazy to attempt is quite entertaining for many reasons. Ocean's 8 is the latest film of its kind to hit theatres and with the weight of the previous trilogy on its shoulders, there was a high bar to meet. I'm a huge fan of the previous remake of Ocean's Eleven and while neither of the sequels quite match the quality of it, I was hoping Ocean's 8 would steer this franchise in a new direction. While I did enjoy watching this movie, for the most part, I did find myself pretty disappointed by it as a whole. I can't quite recommend this movie as a great film, but if you're a fan of the franchise, here's why you may find some enjoyment in its latest addition.Ocean's 8 follows the sister of Danny Ocean (George Clooney from the previous films) in Debbie Ocean, as she is released from prison and has plotted to rob the Met Gala in New York City. The plan is to steal a necklace that's worth over 150 million dollars, so naturally, she finds a group of women who are very interested in helping out. All having their quirks, they each become a necessity in accomplishing this task. Quite honestly, aside from the first film, this was probably my favorite heist sequence when looking back at the franchise, but if that's all the movie has to offer, then a lot will be left to be desired.A slow build up is fine if your climax pays off in a big way and for that alone, I found a lot of enjoyment from the movie as a whole. The very meticulous plan makes for an engaging climax and I was sucked into the movie until the very end. That being said, the first act of the movie nearly put me to sleep. This movie takes a very long time to peak your interest. Yes, there are a few interesting characters and some humorous moments will keep you interested, but I didn't find those elements to be enough. I found myself breathing a huge sigh of relief when the actual heist began because the movie didn't seem to have a pulse until that point. Luckily, the dull moments were held together by some likable actresses.From Sandra Bullock to Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway to Sarah Paulson, and even Rihanna to Mindy Kaling, everyone had their moment to shine here and I was having a blast watching these characters interact with one another. Sadly, those moments are few and far between. These actresses give their all with what they're given, but the script (aside from the plotting of the climax itself) just felt a little generic. A group of women gets together to do a heist and the circumstances are very much the same as the first film in the franchise. Nothing new was brought to the table, which was the one thing I was hoping for with this movie.Fans of the franchise may have some fun with the movie when it truly kicks into high gear, as I surely did, but the overall movie is frankly average. In particular, I found some of the unique editing choices to be slightly cheesy and I'm not sure if the movie's style worked all that much. The pacing is off in many places and it seems as though music is used throughout the first act to liven up a scene and prevent it from being boring. For all of these reasons and more, I can't quite recommend this movie to many viewers, but if you enjoy watching a good heist, that portion of this film is worth the price of admission in my opinion. While it's not something you have to rush out and see at the cinema, Ocean's 8 is worth renting.",Ocean's Eight
104,kuarinofu,Sloppy cash grab,4,27 October 2018,"This movie is like a bad copy you get from an old copy machine, the paper got jammed and you had to forcefully pull it out. It sort of wants to be a direct copy
of the Ocean's (character by character and scene by scene) but is all messed up and the only thing you can do with it is throw it away.
There's just nothing enjoyable about this. The script is stupid, the dialogue is painful and meaningless, none of the characters are interesting, they in no way relate to each other, there are no interesting ideas in this, the twist(s) are eye-rollingly lame. It feels like nothingness, a void of creativity.
What's even worse is that they marketed this as a movie with good female characters, yet Julia Roberts delivered more personality of a strong woman in what little time she was given in Oceans Eleven than 8 (EIGHT) characters did in this.

105,tm-sheehan,Lets Here It For The Girls-,7,31 August 2018,"Enjoyed this movie for what it is lighthearted fun and I bet all the actresses in it had fun making it.
To see at least 5 great actresses ( I like the gender difference in this vocation) in their prime playing characters so outside their normal range was very entertaining.
The great funky fashion and that New York skyline and street scape is always a plus too.
The script is good the plot is thin and you could pick holes in it but it's fun and entertaining.
It's not near a witty as the 1939 film The Women and could have been better perhaps if George Cukor had directed it but I think it was filmed in the same spirit as The Women .
Charlize Theron proved beyond doubt in the action thriller Atomic Blonde that roles that used to be only offered exclusively to male actors can be just as entertaining and prove to be box office winners when talented women get together, go see it.

The film starts well, but is a little boring towards the end. I was not convinced by the actual robbery as (unlike Ocean's 11) there was no sense of a possible failure and there was no villain character.There was a glamorous tone but lacking a really clever plot or character chemistry.

107,lojitsu,You can't pull a job within a job...,8,30 September 2018,"Ocean's 8Genre: Comedy/Heist
Or: ""How well the sister plans the perfect heist and how well Rihanna looked in that dress""
In the road of life, there are passengers and there are drivers...and I drove to the theater to watch ""Ocean's 8"" with a lot of anticipation. I have been cheering from the first trailer...and I kept cheering after it was over. It gave me exactly what I wanted, but unfortunately no fringe benefits. So let's break it down in true Ocean's 8 fashion...we'll get all the pieces together first and then execute The Lowedown.
Cast=10
Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchette, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, and of course James Cordon. The cast is what makes the movie for me...a tremendous cast of beautifully strong women coming together like George Clooney's group did in ""Ocean's 11"" (and you know...James Cordon). I felt like a kid in a candy store with this cast, so I can't help but give it ten points.
Acting=7
There was not a whole lot to do here...the stage is set early and the characters are established early. It was really kind of set in stone as to who they are and that was based on what they could do. So although it was a great cast, I cannot give full points for the acting ability. It's not their fault...there just was no room to move. I'll give it a seven.
Plot=9
Debbie Ocean gathers an all-female crew to attempt an impossible heist at New York City's yearly Met Gala. The plot was almost perfect...copying the engine from the other Oceans was a nice move. Why is it almost perfect you ask? Well, I'll tell you...I had a bit of an issue with that they were stealing a necklace. It wasn't a casino with a jerk for a boss...just a hundred million dollar necklace. Like I said, almost perfect
Ending=7
There was plus a cameo that was really fun. So yeah it was an American style ending, but I was expecting that. It was the surprise that gives it all the points...and the number of points is seven. See those points in the Twist score.
Story=7
With the ensemble in play here, you would think they had a problem with character development. I actually thought that went well...there were a few holes in the story but it was a pretty solid attempt. Helena Bonham Carter shines for me in the story and I would have liked more from Rihanna in her role. Nine ball corner pocket...but only seven points are awarded for the story.Favorite Quote: ""If you're going to have a problem with stealing, then you're not going to like the rest of this conversation.""
Genre: Comedy
Funny=6
I want to belly laugh when I watch a comedy...I mean like full on out of breath, checking my pants to make sure I didn't pee laugh. I didn't get there with this, Unfortunately. There were some funny parts that I liked, but not enough to turn my face red. These eight women only get six points.
Chemistry=7
The mark of a good comedy is in the chemistry between the cast members...if they can work well together you can see it. Unfortunately, you can also see when they don't work well together. There were a couple characters that didn't seem to play well with others. Otherwise a solid effort...I will give them seven points.
Script=7
Look at it this way...if the Plot is the seed and the Story is the forest...then the script is the sunlight. I just wanted more playroom with the script. I feel that hurt the story and the acting, but with the size of the cast, I can understand why. Throwing seven points their way.Sub-Genre: Heist
Heist=8
The key to a heist movie is that I want them to steal something major and screw over a bad guy in the process. I didn't quite get what I wanted, but it was close enough to give eight points. The killer part was in the planning...Debbie had over five years to plan the perfect theft. Let's see...five plus three equals eight, so I'll give them eight points (no I didn't really do it like that).
Twist=9
The twist is sometimes connected to the Ending. But with heist movies, I score the twist separate, as I feel that is an essential part of the movie. Could one of them have a separate agenda or there be a secret ninth Ocean? I won't tell you, but it was pretty cool. Nine points awards for the gem of a twist I did not expect.

109,Alexander_Blanchett,I prefer the other Gang,6,27 June 2018,"It was a tolerable reboot but not on par with any of the Clooney/Soderbergh Ocean movies. The film lacked the great dynamic of those films and tried too hard to capture the wit. It had its moments for sure but generally was rather mediocre. Also the problem was that the film had so many con stunts but hardly showed the preparation or ideas, they just presented them like it was the most normal thing without showing the logic or thinking behind it. 
The acting was solid but with so much talent involved the most memorable performance came from the two most unlikeliest ones: Rhianna and Awkwafina who both had charisma and the funniest scenes. Sandra Bullock was okay but I expected more from her in that kind of role. She aint no Clooney. Cate Blanchett was wasted, except for one good scene. Helena Bonham Carter had potential but wasnt used much. Anna Hathaway was enjoyable and had many self ironic scenes. Mindy Kaling was also okay. The soundtrack worked but it often felt it didn't know in which direction it goes -- just like the movie. Hardly any twists, often very predictable. Yes it was entertaining, I was not bored but you missed the Soderbergh touch. I think he could handle that material better than Gary Ross.",Ocean's Eight
110,CANpatbuck3664,Rocky Execution but Manages a Clean and Successful Getaway,6,15 June 2018,"I don't know if anyone was asking for this movie, but I can understand the idea. I love a good heist film and while I really enjoy the previous Ocean movies, I walked into this one ready to give it a chance (I had low expectations, but I tried to be as impartial as I could). The plot centres around a recently paroled Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) getting a crew together to grab an expensive diamond necklace off the neck of celebrity Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway). This includes her best friend Lou (Cate Blanchett), hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna), jeweler Amita (Mindy Kaling), con woman Tammy (Sarah Paulson) and pickpocket Constance (Awkwafina). With all the pageantry surrounding the Met Gala, a lot of this movie wasn't geared towards me, so I had to focus on the heist to get through the dull points. They do a few things differently which I liked but the movie is paced so slowly that my mind started to wander. Although the movie clearly had a sense of style (it was familiar, but it capably aped the previous Soderbergh movies) it needed a tighter edit or some funnier jokes.Even if you're attached to the previous Ocean films, there's some interesting names in this cast that may pique your interest. Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Rihanna are big enough stars to draw people in by themselves, let alone in an ensemble. I'll get to the highest billed actresses but for me the standout was Anne Hathaway. She's great at playing a vapid and self-centred celebrity but she's beautiful and she's got great comic timing. Sandra Bullock was fine as Debbie Ocean, she was oddly restrained, and I wish she had gotten more chances to show her abilities. She's very confident but she never cuts loose and because of that she's a little robotic. Cate Blanchett was also solid as Lou and they played off each other as a pair well enough for you to buy them as best friends. After Anne, Helena Bonham Carter was my next favourite as disgraced fashion designer Rose Weil. She had her own way of making Rose pathetic, but she was fun to spend time with. She was more vulnerable than the rest of the cast and Helena sold how uncomfortable her character was taking on this burden. I felt sorry for some of the supporting members of the cast, I felt like Mindy Kaling (who can be very funny) got almost nothing to do. While Rihanna and Awkwafina might not be as experienced as Bullock, Blanchett and Sarah Paulson, they got few opportunities to stretch or play against type. I'll also give credit to James Corden whose appearance breathes life into the movie when Ocean's 8 start to wear out its welcome.The biggest problem with Ocean's 8 is that the setup for the heist just fails to be interesting. The comedy (aside from Hathaway's bits) mostly falls flat and they lack the interesting characters to carry the movie until the action gets going. We don't get much backstory on any of our crew, even our main character Debbie is defined by missing her brother Danny and her anger at being betrayed by Claude (Richard Armitage). The previous movies in this franchise relied on the group chemistry of the cast and how eccentric the characters were. Ocean's 8 lacks those key ingredients. There are talented people here who do their job capably but instead of fire, there's only sparks. But when the heist finally propels the movie forward, things become more compelling (the heist isn't plausible but all you need is plausible deniability) and the comedy begins to gel. They also introduce a couple of twists that they think are more mysterious than they are, but they did add to my enjoyment of the movie. With an unexpected appearance by a former member of the franchise, the ending twist did put a smile on my face. It wasn't enough to elevate it to the level of the Soderbergh films, but it helped bring the grade up from passable to fun to watch.I've been pretty critical, but I would also admit that Ocean's 8 was better than I was expecting. I saw this with a friend and we both walked out pleasantly surprised. This movie can be picked apart and coupled with the long runtime, it drags really badly at points. But I as a fan of the previous trilogy, I liked it more than I didn't, and my actual grade would be a 6.5/10. I want to go up to a 7 but with how long it took to get going, I'm rounding down to 6/10.",Ocean's Eight

I have stated before that I am a sucker for heist movies, and this film had all the elements: the cast of characters, the soundtrack, the flashes back and forward. It is even well done and well acted. Buuuut I was kinda bored. Super stylish, but not super interesting. I guess the whole thing just felt a little too paint by numbers, which makes sense because that's how the previous Oceans sequel felt too. Heists are great, but at some point you do have to wonder if they will pull this off. I never did. The heroes/villains always seemed in command, and the plan's problems always seemed pretty small. The movie worked well enough, but I would have rather rewatched Lucky Logan .",Ocean's Eight

There was no back story of their relationships so therefore I felt nothing for them.Why was Helena Bonham Carter in this? Her hair infuriates me! She is actually quite beautiful but you'd never know it from her rat's nest hair and steampunk wardrobe. It's like she actively tries to look bad. She was reduced to drivel in this. Why did she even take this role?! This was just a bunch of randos.I'd heard how great Anne Hathaway was in this but how hard is it to act like an entitled spoiled movie star?!I don't get the appeal of Cate Blanchett but I can give credit where it's due however she added nothing to this. It could have been anyone in her role.Mindy Kaling was very random but I pry liked her the most. She played it pretty straight but mostly it seemed like even she couldn't believe she was there.Awkwafina?! Just no. Tried to be funny but wasn't. They just threw her in there as a flavor of the month. Same with Rihanna. She just sat/stood around looking like she was making a music video.Sarah Paulson was bland and added nothing but was better than most of them.I can't even remember who else was in this that's how forgettable this was and I just finished it!I find it laughable that this is all about women blah blah yet they spent the whole movie acting like men. The whole appeal of women is that they aren't men obviously. Women's unique characteristics should be celebrated. It shouldn't be girl power but by the way we're gonna act like men because we think that's the point. The way they acted was such a turn off.When I saw Kim Kardashian I about threw my tv out the window! I mean really with these people?! Still?! They are the absolute worst yet for some reason our mindless society can't get enough of these feckless ducklip selfy taking wastes of space. They lost me at that point! You're trying to make a movie about women power but then you bow to those despicable fakers who give women a bad name. Nice.The premise was good but they just couldn't pull it off. I kept hoping George Clooney would show up but nope! They couldn't concede one bit. They had to make it ALL women in order to make a point. This is a clear case of cutting off your nose to spite your face.I loathe this man hating trend in the movies now! I hope everyone else is getting sick of it too. Not everyone is itching to stick it to men so they shouldn't try to cram this agenda down our throats in every movie going forward.Sometimes you just need men.",Ocean's Eight

They are fun together, and that's what I was hoping for from this film. Instead, we get a fairly formulaic heist film of the fantastical quality known from the Ocean's film. This plotting as well keeps us focused on the surface action leaving some of the fun under wraps. Basically, I wanted more humor, wit, spark, etc. from the actresses. But, we are given only glimpses of this and then back to the standard plotting. Nothing at all wrong with the film. And I was entertained by it.

The actual heist scene is stylishly (and expensively) staged, but getting there takes a bit too long. As in the Clooney trilogy, there's an implausible (and not very original) twist in the tale. The cast seem to be having fun, but the audience was not. The script needed a lot more SEZ AND THE CITY-style zingy one-liners.Is this the launch of trilogy? OCEAN'S 9 and 10?

There's nothing actually wrong with it on the surface, the actresses are good, the sets and costumes are good but it's missing something and that's a reason for it to be a movie. When it comes to remakes some of them are good and some of them are bad. Ocean's 11, of which this movie is a kind of sequel to, was an example of a good remake. It took the story made famous by the Rat Pack and modernized it. It was a smash hit and spawned two sequels which did less well. So at some point this movie was considered to be a female version of the movie. Sandra Bullock even plays the sister of Danny Ocean, hence the name of the movie. The idea being that this then takes place in the same universe.What follows is frankly, the same movie. Sandra Bullock is at her parole meeting. She gets out. Meets up with her friends and they plan a heist. The only real difference is that there are only 8 people in this group and they're going after some jewels. Beyond that it is practically beat for beat the same movie as Ocean's 11. It's even to the point where the director tried aping Soderbergh's style with quick zooms and lingering shots. I get why they did that to maybe tie the movies together but it's coming off as forced and unnecessary.This could have been a much better movie. All in all I didn't hate it. It was fun enough but it was too much like the first one.",Ocean's Eight

122,CinematicInceptions,"Somewhat disappointing, but I would pay for sequels.",7,25 June 2018,"It's not fair to base something's worth on how it compares to something else. However, people inevitably do it, and in the case of Ocean's Eight it is an even more inevitable occurrence. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I couldn't help feeling disappointed in how it was lacking in comparison to the 2001 Ocean's Eleven. To the credit of Eight, the 2001 reboot is a masterclass in how to do an ensemble piece as well as a great example to follow when doing any heist movie. It set an incredibly high benchmark that Twelve and Thirteen couldn't live up to, so I think it would be a bit much to expect that Eight would fare any better. Also, technology has changed a lot in the years since we last saw an Ocean's movie and that means that it is much harder to pull off big heists. In real life, I think that this is pretty much a good thing, but it does make it a lot harder to write a crime movie in a modern context.With that out of the way, I'll get into what I thought was good and bad about this requel (I think that's the term for it). First of all, I loved the fact that the heist comedy genre is not dead yet because I've always liked movies of that genre and it was great to see some of those familiar tropes in a new movie. I thought that a good cast was put together that rivaled the star-studded eleven; even if I hadn't heard of everyone, it was a diverse group that was easy to keep track of. However, I wasn't as impressed with the characters themselves. Overall, I'd say they get a B minus. Some of their skills weren't that well-defined and each of their roles in the heist weren't all that specific, and a few of them got left to the side or thrown into the spotlight a bit sloppily sometimes. The characters also didn't feel fully realized. I think part of the reason for this was that more attention was placed on making Debbie Ocean the protagonist and establishing her motivations. While that's okay, I was disappointed to see that take the place of scenes that could have given the audience more of a connection with each of the eight. I would have appreciated more moments like Mindy Kaling's character saying ""Can't we just go to this thing? Do we have to rob it?"" On the upside, all of the actresses gave good performances and were cast well, with Cate Blanchett and Anne Hathaway standing out most. However, I wasn't thrilled with the fact that James Corden was the funniest presence in the movie.What irked me the most was the crime element, though. As stated before, crime movies are getting harder to conceive of with modern tech, but a lot of the heist and the smaller crimes throughout the movie were not thought out that well. It wasn't so bad that there were glaring logic holes or things that were crazy far-fetched, but the plan to rob the Met Gala did not feel foolproof. And in a way, the characters and movie sort of admit that it's not and mold the story to that, but there were a lot of points where I felt like it would have been all too easy to catch the criminals in the act. But one of the things that I want from a good crime movie is to be outsmarted by the movie I'm watching and to be impressed by the crime and I wasn't here. The plan wasn't that clear and the motivation for it that was shown in flashback wasn't either. I got that Claude screwed Debbie over somehow, but I didn't quite get how. Lastly, I thought the movie was lacking a solid villain. Claude was sort of a villain, but he hardly got any attention. I kept expecting someone working for the Gala to turn out to be the villain. This is more of an opinion than anything else, but I think that a good villain is essential to a good heist movie, even more essential than in an action movie or superhero movie. The reason that Twelve is the worst of the original three is that the Night Fox is not that great of a villain, particularly when compared to Terry Benedict. And to have a villain that barely shows up and is incredibly un-villainous to boot was very disappointing.I would recommend that you see this, if only so that studios will feel more compelled to make crime movies and hire good people to work on them. Despite the things that I've said in criticism of this movie, I must give Gary Ross and Olivia Milch credit because they took on a very difficult project here. Even if they didn't do as well as I'd hoped they would, they did a better job than I could have done and I would be interested to see other movies by them. There is not an incredibly feminist undertone here, but there are a couple scenes that say ""girl power"" not so subtly. Still, it shouldn't make opinions about feminism flare one way or the other. I know the ratings aren't great at the moment, but I would encourage people to let some of the plot holes go a bit and focus on some of the things that this movie does right. Overall Rating: 7.4/10.",Ocean's Eight
123,jordan2240,I don't like going into the ocean,4,11 July 2018,"Watched about 30 minutes of this, then my wife nudged me from a perfectly good nap so I'd see the rest. Full disclosure, I'm not a big fan of 'caper' films. They always require that the timing of everything works out perfectly and that every potential glitch gets resolved quickly by one of the characters that has some obscure skill or knows someone with the obscure skill. And they always feature a scene where something gets handed from one character to another to another to another when the original character could have just handed it off at its end location him/herself. This film is no different. No real surprises or moments of believable cleverness, and I didn't care if any of the characters ended up in jail. I might have seen the first Ocean remake (not really sure), but didn't see any of them after until this one, which the wife wanted to see. I wish she'd have let me sleep. Ticket was only 5 dollars, so no great loss.And what on earth did Mindy Kaling do to her face???",Ocean's Eight

I enjoyed the film. The performances were all great. The costumes in the movie were good. The editing was good. The pacing was pretty slow at first and I thought I was going to get bored but it picked up later on. Also there was a part towards the end where I thought it could've ended but it went on for another 15 minutes which was setting up for more sequels. Other than that it was enjoyable but not great.My Grade: B-",Ocean's Eight
126,funtasticfour,"Could have been, should have been better!",6,26 August 2018,"A great cast, a somewhat good idea. What went wrong? This movie was enjoyable enough, but just not as exciting as it should have been. Only the first Ocean's movie, so this probably ranks as well as 12 and 13, but it just didn't do anything new. Oh wait women. Great women, but they didn't do anything different or exciting. Also, the music was annoying. Almost the whole movie had a light orchestra playing that was distracting. Maybe some better writing before they try this again?",Ocean's Eight
127,abcvision,Missing the Rat Pack,6,13 June 2018,"The boys are missing in action but the girls are back in Oceans 8. This time a all star cast with Danny's sister, Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) at the helm. She pleads a reformed life to get parole but once on the outside she does what she does best organizes a job and seeks revenge with her man friend who put here away. The job is a simple switch and bait but is more complex than expected with the high tech security team protecting the mark. Overall I liked the movie but missed some of the cool rat pack suave style found in the other Oceans series. These women are slick but still are missing an authenticity of connection. If herding cats is a challenge, so is making these women not rat each other out.",Ocean's Eight
128,HEFILM,smooth as and about as exciting as clockwork until illogical twists occur,5,9 June 2018,"Neither the story or characters are very interesting or convincing. A few cameos from previous films don't add much.Pancake makeup plus digital skin smoothing is also pretty obvious on the two leads.And why Ocean's Eight they couldn't come up with 3 more women to round up the number? I don't care about that aspect really but everything about this movie is sort of a who cares affair.Wall to wall music tries and sometimes succeeds in keeping things moving along but it's all pretty mild on every level.It's also pretty straight forward until some mild, small twists which make zero sense at all.What little drama or melodrama that exists has to be bolstered by an awkward flashback. So okay none of the previous Ocean films have been masterpieces let's face it, but the ones that work do so because the actors, these films are more about star turns than anyone actually playing a character, interact and play off each other in hip cool ways. Certainly this cast of women could do that, they just don't or aren't allowed to in this film.Bullock, distracting ""de-aging"" makeup and DIGITAL skin smoothing and wrinkle removing aside-is game enough as the lead, but there is little real interaction with the rest of the cast. Blanchet feels like she's wasting her time and realizes it, the buddy elements with Bullock come off like they were or could be lovers--or something?, None of the rest of the cast has much to do and don't do much with each other. And that's what puts this into the dull zone.Director Ross continues to mostly be an under whelmer as a director, he is highly regarded as a writer in Hollywood for no reason that is demonstrated here.These movies need either cool plot twists or super style or suspense to really make an impact and none of those elements exist here.A few funny bits keep it from being a bomb but it's just not much of a movie.",Ocean's Eight

Perhaps the issue with the movie is, while attempting to reign in the hyper madness and glitz and pop of Soderbergh's 11, 12, 13, but still retain some series staples and some of the tone, the film feels at times a little familiar and at times a little bland; it doesn't carry or own its own tone and, unlike Oceans former entires, it doesn't create anything mind blowing or new or cheeky. Oceans was quite a revelation when it came out and it captured audience goers enough to warrant two more and each of those had its own bonkers experimental swagger. Gary Ross and the terrific ensemble have just made a crisp, swift, run of the mill heist movie. An Oceans fan film. Which is a shame because I wanted this film to light the world on fire but it hasn't. I hope they get a chance to make Oceans 9. Let a Gilroy and a Griffin and a Boal and a Soderbergh at the script then let Kathryn Bigelow go nuts with it.",Ocean's Eight

What it lacks is any of the chemistry from the other three films. The two ""main"" crew members have no chemistry at all, and no one of the other six ever connect, nor is there any effort for them to. And man, Cate Blanchett's character really didn't work for me. Her look, her costuming, none of it felt like she belonged. As boring as Bullock's character was, she at least had the con vibe. Blanchett seemed like she had been cut and paste from some 80's rock video and was looking to jump back through whatever time warp had brought her into this picture so that she could return to the 80's and hang out with Blondie, Adam Ant, or the guys from Flock of Seagulls. And smoke a pack of Kool's while doing so.I really liked the other six actresses and loved the guest appearances of the ""elderly"" ladies!

135,Okonh0wp,Better than the originals,9,25 June 2018,"Ocean's 8 has been getting hyped because it's an all-women's reboot, but in my opinion, it's just a very good movie. The unconventional additions of Helena Bonhan Carter and Rihanna to A-listers like Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett is just winning casting and James Corden (an underrated actor when playing a pushover) is the perfect foil. We might have nostalgia for the originals because they provided some much needed fluff in the wake of the somber slate of movies and current events in 2001, but Ocean's 11 and its predecessors were a landmark in detached snark as well. In a way, the originals were about highly paid actors mugging for the camera (and that camera being quite a show-off in the hands of Stephen Soderbergh)This film, in comparison, had more heart and felt modest in scale. Even though the monetary payoff was enormous, it was a relatively simple job. Any twists that came after were tucked away in the epilogue. Ocean's 8 is well-paced and knows where its strengths are as well. The reveals into each character, the side stories inherent in an ensemble piece, and the reliance on hiding information from the audience adds a lot of tension to the proceedings.",Ocean's Eight

Was there really any charm in the original Ocean reboot series? Nah!",Ocean's Eight
137,shawneofthedead,"This ridiculously fantastic cast deserves better, but they make the film worth the watch.",7,13 June 2018,"Strictly speaking, Ocean's 8 isn't a great movie. Its plot is more functional than fun, its execution more dutiful than dazzling. And yet, it's still one of this summer's purest cinematic pleasures - due almost entirely to the phenomenal cast assembled for the film. The eight leading ladies in Ocean's 8 are having so much fun, both on screen and off, that it's a delight just to kick back and watch them at work. They make the film better than it is and, by the time the credits start rolling, you'll be hankering for a rewatch - or, better yet, a sequel worthy of the cast's talents.The film opens on Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) - younger sister to George Clooney's Danny - who's spent the past five years in prison, working out the perfect heist. Once she gains her freedom, she starts bringing together the dream team that can help her steal a legendary $150-million Cartier necklace off the neck of ultra-vain actress Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) during the fabulously exclusive Met Gala in New York City. These include best friend Lou Miller (Cate Blanchett), fashion designer Rose (Helena Bonham Carter), jewellery expert Amita (Mindy Kaling), retired fence/middle-woman Tammy (Sarah Paulson), pickpocket Constance (Awkwafina) and hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna).The main problem with Ocean's 8 is that it doesn't have quite the snap and sparkle that it should. A heist flick should sing and sizzle off the screen, but Ocean's 8 rarely manages to do either. Steven Soderbergh - in peak auteur mode - threaded a heartbeat of fizzy joy throughout the original trilogy of Ocean's films. None of those films, starring a host of Hollywood's top leading men, would be considered classic cinema, but they were a blast to watch and puzzle out. In contrast, Ocean's 8 lacks personality. The film is directed with workaday efficiency by Gary Ross, who seems concerned only with getting the plot from point A to point B. It doesn't help that the screenplay - co-written by Ross and Olivia Milch - is too busy explaining the heist to actually enjoy it. Each aspect of this criminal endeavour is painstakingly laid out, leaving any hints of mystery and magic by the wayside. Even the film's plot twists barely register as surprises: one is mathematically guaranteed (the film is called Ocean's 8 for a reason); the other 'revelation' arrives less in the key of sleight-of-hand, more in the form of sledgehammer. But - and this is a huge but - the cast of Ocean's 8 is so staggeringly good, their on-screen interaction so delicious, that the film becomes better by their very presence. This is particularly evident when it comes to the heist's ringleaders. Bullock largely plays it straight as Debbie: all calm, collected and in control. But she nonetheless unearths a little sensitivity to Debbie's swagger. Blanchett, meanwhile, is having the time of her life as Lou - revelling in and radiating a rock-and-roll confidence that can only partly be attributed to the array of fantastically tailored suits she wears.They're even better together. As Debbie and Lou reunite to pull off their biggest heist yet, Bullock and Blanchett give a whole new meaning to the term 'partner in crime'. They could teach classes on the history and chemistry that they've created between their characters. Who - and what - are Debbie and Lou to each other? How did they meet, and what have they been through? There's certainly more heat and flirty sexual tension (whether it's resolved or unresolved is up for debate) between them than there is between Debbie and Claude (Richard Armitage), a man from her past that eventually gets tangled up in the present. You'll be left wanting more - more of these characters, more of their backstories, more of their lives and hopes and dreams and crimes. That's true, too, of the other women in the film, who aren't always afforded much depth in the script. Their personalities, for the most part, are interchangeable with the jobs they're brought on to do. And yet, having these characters played by performers with such natural charisma and sharp wit as Bonham Carter, Kaling, Paulson, Awkwafina and Rihanna gives them a spark of life beyond what's on the page. Hathaway, in particular, waltzes away with practically every scene she's in - a remarkable feat considering that she's sharing the screen with a host of accomplished scene-stealers. She is dynamite as Daphne, playing the ego and irony, monster and sweetheart, of her role in a fireworks display of comic energy.As for production design, it would be wrong not to heap praise upon the exquisite work of Sarah Edwards, Ocean's 8's costume designer. In this film - and for women in real life - fashion can be power: the clothes we wear tell the stories we want to tell, communicate the messages we want to convey. They empower as well as disguise, bestowing uniqueness and anonymity as necessary. Edwards understands this keenly, and has crafted a dizzying collection of gorgeous outfits that are full of rich character insight and detail - something that the script doesn't always provide. In the final analysis, it can be hard to separate Ocean's 8 from what it represents. After all, this is a summer blockbuster with a primary cast made up entirely of women - half of whom are over the age of 40 (typically the 'sell-by' date in youth-obsessed Hollywood). Like this summer's other female-led film, Book Club, it's a phenomenon so rare and so significant that it's worth celebrating. What's harder to celebrate is the unfortunate fact that Ocean's 8 isn't anywhere near as good as its cast deserves. That's the true crime here. Imagine a version of this film shot with the flair and style of Soderbergh, or the tongue-in-cheek silliness of Taika Waititi. Imagine a screenplay that gives these incredible women depth and layers that they don't have to invent for themselves. Imagine a plot that's smart enough to take your breath away. And imagine all of that - for a sequel. Here's hoping that this won't be the last we see of Debbie Ocean and her crew.",Ocean's Eight

Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett looked positively BORED to be there! I've never seen Sandra Bullock so miserable in my life.

I'm happy to say, this is the worthy successor to ""Ocean's 11"" that we've been waiting 17 years for. It has all the fun and thrill of 11 and is just as smartly written. The cast, for the most part work very well off each other, and there's lots of great twists. Unlike the recent ""Ghostbusters'' remake this isn't a gender swapped cash grab just for the sake of doing it. It has connections to the original, and while you don't need to have seen the original to understand it, it definitely helps. (Keep an eye out for cameos from some of the original cast). The premise is pretty much the same as 11 except instead of a bank the crew is robbing a necklace off of a high profile individual at the Met Gala and will divide it among the 8 of them. The ""Ocean"" in this one is the sister of Danny Ocean and she's putting her own crew together to continue his legacy. Even though Steven Soderbergh is not directing this time around (he retired after directing ""Logan Lucky"") he is an executive producer and you can tell his influence is all over it. It's a fun romp that was better than I expected.

145,ginocox-206-336968,A film about con artists who don't pull a con,3,2 September 2018,"Ocean's 8 (2018) is a victim of its own conceit. It seems more interested in being a film about and for women and showing that females (both actresses and fictitious characters) can perform as well as their male counterparts, than in being clever or entertaining. It's not without clever and entertaining moments, but those are overshadowed by elements that seem more directed at social/political commentary than pure entertainment. The film lacks credibility. A key plot elements involve the use of Mission Impossible style Visco glasses to capture 3-D images of a necklace which is then used in a 3-D printer to create an exact replica. The notion of printing a necklace with interlocking pieces, constructed of gold and diamonds, on a hobbyist printer, and producing an object that would fool experts is patently absurd - on the level of Gru's plan to steal the moon in Despicable Me. Cartier may be able to sell a fabulous necklace for $150 million, but that doesn't mean jewel thieves can fence it for anywhere near that amount. The plot of Ocean's Eleven was outlandish. This plot is cartoonish. The film is aggressively sexless. None of them dress in clothes that are particularly sexy or revealing and none employ feminine charms to seduce or detract. They look and behave like a crew of soccer moms, as if determined to make a film about women without using sex appeal. Sandra Bullock is a few years younger than George Clooney, but Ocean's Eleven came out 16½ earlier, when Clooney was 40 and Pitt 38. At 29 and 30, Awkwafina and Rihanna are the youngest of the eight, but perhaps that is the point, to counter the perception that females have briefer careers. The film lacks love. There is no romantic subplot. In its place is a vaguely misandrist revenge plot by a scorned woman, whose feelings toward her former lover aren't the least bit ambivalent. There's a vague intimation that Debbie (Sandra Bullock) and Lou (Cate Blanchett) are or were lovers, but it's only suggested in the tension and squabbling between them. The film lacks passion. One feels they are going through the motions, rather than fueled by passion. Debbie indicates she hopes the robbery will inspire some young girl who dreams of becoming a thief. What sort of messed-up motivation is that? There is no dark night of the soul, reversal of fortunes, taste of death or gathering storm. Nor is there any singing or dancing. There's a minor glitch concerning a clasp and another involving poor reception, but both are quickly resolved. In a similar vein, there are no gunfights, explosions, car chases, martial arts or memorable stunts. Not that a film needs to have all of these elements, but it needs something visual that's not too abysmal. Nor are there any adverse consequences. If the film has a moral, theme or deeper meaning, it was too vague for this viewer. The film gives us no particular reason to like Debbie Ocean or to dislike Cartier. She tried to cheat some people and her partner ratted her out to save his own skin. So, what? If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. We didn't sympathize with Danny because he was unjustly incarcerated. He took a fall and paid the price. Cartier hasn't done anything to deserve being robbed. Ocean's Eleven depicted Terry Benedict as a particularly ruthless casino boss who would go Keyser Söze on anybody who robbed him. None of the characters is particularly likeable or interesting, with the possible exception of John Frazier (James Corden), who plays an insurance investigator. Some are familiar caricatures. The film lacks humor. Ocean's Eleven offered lots of humor: The drag race between the monster truck and the radio-controlled model. Frank (Bernie Mac) playing on the car salesman's homophobia to secure a better price. Basher (Don Cheadle) using cockney rhyming slang. Saul (Carl Reiner) hamming it up. The list of cons named after celebrities. Danny (George Clooney) and Benedict's one-upmanship about hotel towels. The film offers ethnic diversity over entertaining diversion. This presents a greater challenge in making the recruitment scenes credible, an area where the remake of The Magnificent Seven also faltered in comparison to its predecessor. Ocean's Eleven offered scenes of Yen performing, Linus picking pockets and Rusty cold-decking Teen Beat cover boys. In monomyth terms, each of the crew should refuse the call to adventure. There are recruitment scenes, but they are less interesting and less credible. The film is about a group of con artists who don't pull a con. One doesn't feel that Cartier or the Met Gala was conned out of anything, whereas Ocean's Eleven succeeded in giving us the impression that Terry Benedict had been personally conned in both the robbery and losing the affections of Tess (Julia Roberts). There's a minor con involving a painting, a phishing scam and an amusing short con involving cosmetics, but the film feels like a simple heist film, compared with Ocean's Eleven or Logan Lucky.",Ocean's Eight

Not that a film needs to have all of these elements, but it needs something visual that's not too abysmal. Nor are there any adverse consequences. If the film has a moral, theme or deeper meaning, it was too vague for this viewer. The film gives us no particular reason to like Debbie Ocean or to dislike Cartier. She tried to cheat some people and her partner ratted her out to save his own skin. So, what? If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. We didn't sympathize with Danny because he was unjustly incarcerated. He took a fall and paid the price. Cartier hasn't done anything to deserve being robbed. Ocean's Eleven depicted Terry Benedict as a particularly ruthless casino boss who would go Keyser Söze on anybody who robbed him. None of the characters is particularly likeable or interesting, with the possible exception of John Frazier (James Corden), who plays an insurance investigator. Some are familiar caricatures. The film lacks humor. Ocean's Eleven offered lots of humor: The drag race between the monster truck and the radio-controlled model. Frank (Bernie Mac) playing on the car salesman's homophobia to secure a better price. Basher (Don Cheadle) using cockney rhyming slang. Saul (Carl Reiner) hamming it up. The list of cons named after celebrities. Danny (George Clooney) and Benedict's one-upmanship about hotel towels. The film offers ethnic diversity over entertaining diversion. This presents a greater challenge in making the recruitment scenes credible, an area where the remake of The Magnificent Seven also faltered in comparison to its predecessor. Ocean's Eleven offered scenes of Yen performing, Linus picking pockets and Rusty cold-decking Teen Beat cover boys. In monomyth terms, each of the crew should refuse the call to adventure. There are recruitment scenes, but they are less interesting and less credible. The film is about a group of con artists who don't pull a con. One doesn't feel that Cartier or the Met Gala was conned out of anything, whereas Ocean's Eleven succeeded in giving us the impression that Terry Benedict had been personally conned in both the robbery and losing the affections of Tess (Julia Roberts). There's a minor con involving a painting, a phishing scam and an amusing short con involving cosmetics, but the film feels like a simple heist film, compared with Ocean's Eleven or Logan Lucky.The problem with Ocean's 8 is not that it has an all-female cast, but that that they are determinedly and aggressively politically correct, inclusive, diversity-embracing, die-hard Clinton supporters who advocate gender equality. Political correctitude is not entertaining. Blazing Saddles is recognized as one of the least politically correct films of all time, but also one of the highest grossing domestic films at $586,231,300 in current dollars.",Ocean's Eight
147,ayoreinf,"Professionally done fun film, don't expect more and you'll get what you came for",8,25 June 2018,"It's fun film, that's the starting point. It has well written characters performed very professionally by a stelar cast. The plot is far from airtight, hence the 8 stars rating, but as is with many films of this sort, it doesn't really matter. The pace is relentless and most of the time one doesn't get the extra minute to realize it didn't make sense all the way through. The characters work, with very subtle nuances so we get to like them and care how they end up. For me that's the key point here. Once you care for the characters, you get involved in the story, the weak points in the plot become immaterial.  I can't single out any specific actress, they're all very professional, none of them has to go very deep for the role, some are performing a straight forward cartoon, that is Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway and they still do a proper job with it ending with a very human and likeable character. It's following in the footsteps of the previous installments of the frenchise, but though there's a lot of demand for this new womanizing trend for frenchises, it seems to get a lot of hate here. Yes it's very commercial, but so is most of the industry, it doesn't deserve any special hate just for being commercial.",Ocean's Eight

149,kaptenvideo-89875,Nobody likes people who steal... unless fancy movie stars do it!,7,4 July 2018,"A slick, generally entertaining all-girls-sequel to trio of slick, generally entertaining heist movies directed by Steven Soderbergh.The man himself is only one of the producers now, and almost none of the major characters return - they are probably saving those for the inevitable ""Ocean's 9"".But the franchise hasn't lost any of the original laid-back magic which rises from watching pretty people dexterously and confidently doing something that most of us just can't.If anything, replacing the main cast has turned out to be a good thing. I mean, who beside the most ardent fans can remember much of the original ""Ocean's 11's"" sequels (which was actually a remake but that's beside the point).The new one's about the sister of infamous Danny Ocean, gathering an all-female crew to pull a great diamond snatch.We have Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Helena Bonham Carter, Rihanna, and, er, some Asian girl called Awkwafina forming the eponymous eight.All-girls takes on popular genres or movies usually suck - ""Bridesmaids"" being one of the brighter exceptions to the rule. ""Ocean's 8"" officially breaks the curse (once more), demonstrating that girls don't always just want to have fun, they can mean business too!Most of the movie is exactly how one familiar with ""Ocean's"" series would expect it to be: cool people talking a lot, but also doing a lot of difficult planning which often rely on good luck but still will lead to amassing a great fortune. In other words, servicing all of your 'competence porn' needs for one sitting.The style of storytelling is as lean and no-nonsense as before. The dialogue is crisp and to the point, the same about the action scenes and pacing in general, there's no filler content or lame humour for the dumber part of the audience...Also, one is able to follow and understand the details of the ""job"" more easily than in predecessors, which is a good thing. So all's nice.Speaking of the ladies, they are every bit as cool and fancy as expected. Cate Blanchett and Sandra Bullock have rarely looked more good-looking, cooler or glamorous on the screen, Hathaway seems to have enjoyed her ""dumb but beautiful"" character...The other ones are mostly there for support, which is fine too, because eight major characters would be too much for 110-minute movie.Having said all those good things, I have to add that ""Ocean's 8"" also suffers from the main flaw of the series, although ""flaw"" may be too harsh a word because many probably wouldn't object or even notice. *IF YOU HATE SPOILERS, STOP READING NOW!!!*Namely, all four ""Ocean"" movies are so laidback that there's barely any real suspense, or at least it's not rising throughout the story. You can already assume that the nobody will get caught and the plan will be a success and there will be no real hiccups during the operation.A slick, generally entertaining all-girls-sequel to a trio of slick, generally entertaining heist movies directed by Steven Soderbergh.Is it just me, or would you also ask for some additional character- and world-building to support and give weight to all the fancy and cool that ""Ocean's"" has to offer?",Ocean's Eight

I had assumed it was a comedy film, but there wasn't very much comedy in it at all. It only became funny once James Corden came into it. If it hadn't been for him it would have scored a very average 5. The movie just kinda of sailed along, it had no point, nothing really stood out. And it's a shame because it includes some very talented actresses and I think their talents were wasted here. So yeah, was disappointed.",Ocean's Eight

The heist was pretty simple which doesn't make it realistic I guess, and this is probably the reason why the movie has gotten a lot of hate by mostly the users than the critics surprisingly. However I liked it because it was fun an light-hearted, sometimes it was hard to follow, but I understood the main points of the story. I think this movie was made to be ""fun"" which is probably another reason why it's got so much hate and that explains the lack of seriousness in the movie, which you would get in most heist movies.",Ocean's Eight

Therefore, the movie isn't that bad at all. What counts is perspective angle. Women probably love it. There is a sentence in the movie (said by Ms. Hathaway): I know bad acting when I see one. It is true that none of the actors put much of an effort to carry out their roles, but it is also true that there was no need to. Too many stars in one place to make acting convincing (see under ""Expendables""). And, by the way, it was all made for fun (besides the salaries, of course). Good direction, expected choice of music, girls look truly beautiful (although most of them are even without the right make-up and lighting), good editing, right pace ... all in place. It would pass even if there was no Ocean in the title. A nice little (expensive) movie to have fun on a lazy afternoon. Not more than that, but certainly no less either.",Ocean's Eight
154,austin0731,Hollywood's latest gender reversed remake/sequel,5,8 June 2019,"Ocean's Eight is the continuation of the Ocean's 11 franchise that stars a full female cast, in light of Hollywood's growing interest in tackling feminism and having full female versions of classic male lead films. Unfortunately Ocean's Eight does not land well, while the cast was brilliant with big names such as Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway and many more and the chemistry was there the narrative was dull and formulaic. The heist is nothing we haven't seen, a very basic and standard movie that is stylized to fit the modern audience.Unfortunately, Hollywood's attempts at creating female lead riffs on classics haven't yet had a breakout and I can't help but wonder why. Personally I think it is the fact that there was nothing in place to begin with, meaning rather than building a narrative that is interesting and exciting they are making this movie for the sake of making it, it seemed like there was minimal passion and a real lack of effective storytelling. I am not against female lead movies but I really don't think this is the way to go, a much better idea is to create a narrative that is actually interesting before considering the notion of a full female cast, and not the other way around. Because when having a female only cast is young only selling point the rest of the movie most likely falls apart at the seams.",Ocean's Eight
155,asifahsankhan,Crime does pay?,6,12 June 2018,"Everyone loves a good heist flick. At a running time of 12 minutes the very first blockbuster was Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery of 1903. In the 21st century the genre received a boost from Steven Soderbergh's 2002 remake of the Rat Pack film Ocean's 11 (1960). Sequels were to follow in 2004 and 2007. Another stylish old heist movie, The Italian Job (1969), was remade in 2003, while a new version of Jules Dassin's classic Rififi (1955) is allegedly ""in development"".After Oceans Thirteen Soderbergh declared the series was complete. This Hollywood maverick, whose output has alternated between arthouse experiments and mainstream entertainments, said the team wanted to go out with a bang. Yet Soderbergh showed recently that he still has a fondness for the heist genre with Logan Lucky, his first feature in four years.Now we find Soderbergh listed as producer for Ocean's 8, with Gary Ross in the director's chair. It's a sequel for the #MeToo era, with eight female actors in the lead roles, led by Sandra Bullock, who plays Danny Ocean's sister, Debbie.It's a brave move to attempt another blockbuster reboot with a predominantly female cast after the failure of Ghostbusters (2016), which is still trying to recoup its production costs. Some would say the problem with that film wasn't a misogynistic rejection of the cast but a plausible reaction to cinematic mediocrity. Ocean's 8 is just as superficial, but a much slicker production. It would be surprising if it tanked.In comparison to Solo: A Star Wars Story, the other blockbuster of the moment, Ocean's 8 moves along at a much brisker pace. Ross is not simply going through the motions with a reliable franchise but trying to make a classic heist movie with all the fairytale elements we've come to expect from the genre.Much of the fun of these movies consists of the twists and turns of the plot, as unforeseen obstacles arise and have to be overcome, so I won't dwell on the details. It's more interesting to try and figure out what the story means to a mass audience. It probably comes down to two main processes: taboo-busting and entitlement.Oceans 8, like almost all heist films, tells us that crime does pay. It introduces us to a charming gang of crooks who relieve a snobbish, ultra-rich elite of part of their surplus wealth. The members of the gang are representative of America's working-class aspirationals from various migrant backgrounds. Rihanna's character has impeccable black street cred and is a hi-tech genius.It's hard to believe there are many middle-class housewives like Paulson's character, who have secret lives as purveyors of stolen goods, however, the pleasure lies in watching the social underdog outsmarting those who would look down on her, while an eminently respectable mum leads a life of crime.For a society trained to measure happiness in terms of lifestyle and consumer goods the heist movie is an exercise in wish fulfilment. It plays on that old lament, ""Why them and not me?"" As a get-rich-quick fantasy it's right up there with winning the lottery.",Ocean's Eight
156,itsbobr,Sort of Entertaining,5,12 September 2018,"Danny Ocean's sister and con woman Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) is released from prison. She gathers a group of women to steal a necklace worth $150-million.Yes, this is another heist movie that tries to improve on Ocean's 11 and doesn't fail, but doesn't live up to the Ocean's 11 standard. The plan is to steal the necklace that will be on Daphne Kluger's (Anne Hathaway) neck during the big gala. Gimmicky, um technology is involved in that the real necklace is scanned via eye glasses and then transmitted to a unit that will duplicate the necklace but in Zirconium.So all we wait for is how this heist will be done. And this is slow going, no tension anywhere and it could have used some because there were no good lines, which is also to say nothing was funny or clever. Everything was too serious. No comic relief anywhere. There are too many main characters to follow if you are inclined to do that. It's like ""here they come"" ""there they go"" In and out. See? The music was good especially Nancy Sinatra's These Boots Are Made For Walking. But on the good side there was no foul language or raunchy sex comments. Notables: Cate Blanchett as Lou, Debbie's former partner in crime; Mindy Kaling as Amita a jewel thief who worked with Debbie in the past; Sarah Paulson as Tammy, the fence; Rihanna as 9-Ball, a hacker; Norma Lum as Constance, a petty thief; Helen Bonham Carter as Rose Weil, an aid to Daphne; James Corden as John Frazier, the insurance investigator; Richard Armitage as Claude Becker and he had implemented Debbie years ago and that is why she was in prison; Elliott Gould as Reuben seen in the beginning and cautions Debbie against getting caught.Yes, wouldn't you know it, there is a twist in here and it is something none of us centered on. (Who knew?)Sort of Entertaining, but not a must see, more like slices of life for the women. Again, too serious and too many characters to follow. May make a good made for TV movie.

157,FelipeCarrillo,The new progeny of Ocean's teamed up with Gary Ross loses the jackpot by prioritizing scenic glamour and abusive fidelity,6,4 August 2018,"This criminal would-be new series was one of the first in the uncontrollable avalanche of reboots/spin-offs/remakes coming from old-school classics and modern jewels strategically refocused on a female cast. A couple of years ago, when this news reached the ears of the cagey fanatics, a maelstrom of opinions began a still-latent debate about the pros and cons of making films on one-time used bases, creative recycling. This controversy got worse just when the name of the director in control came out: Gary Ross. The ""The Hunger Games"" filmmaker doesn't have the same experience or vigor behind the cameras as Soderbergh - just compare and contrast the quantity and quality of their films, - and that's clear in his newest movie realizing how much he based on the original trilogy to bring forward his vision and not lose control in the path of this simple, transient story. His ability as a narrator is enough to keep the idea on track, but the originals' dynamic pace and narrative precision are missed. That's why Ross, who is credited as screenwriter alongside Olivia Milch, doesn't give interesting additions to enrich this thieving universe suitably, however, there's a slight improvement with respect to the sequels thanks to its effortless, fine development, getting a pretty cool and manageable trip. The film aims to exalt the clan of women through customary feats and challenges, but does the opposite because handles elements that undeniably pigeonhole most of these ladies in the tiresome gender bromide as the terrible flicks it avoided to become: the MET Gala, designer dresses not as extravagant as expected, a multi-million dollar diamond necklace as the bull's eye and stereotypes of every culture spilled over the supporting characters. Although said setting works, it distorts one of the strongest justifications for this cinematic update.One of the biggest issues is that these intrepid thieves have practically the way free, there are no defined antagonists, actually, there is not one, neither James Corden's role manages to stay in that place and makes difficult to build true suspense and anxiety before an event that can change the course of the game, even when things get rough, the most dangerous enemies are two irrelevant FBI agents. It's a mildly amusing experience, to tell the truth, the story would lack comical spark if it were not for a couple of supporting characters and a few especial diverting situations. We're in front of a film that focuses its strengths fully on the plotting and execution of the robbery, although it doesn't get it too well.It's not possible to refute that it's a pleasant pastiche pastime, as a standalone film works particularly well and as a spin-off of an appreciated trilogy doesn't fulfill expectations it proposed. The centerpiece is an ambitious robbery again, only adding to the equation many more high-tech devices and a jam-packed setting with famous people with which Ross wanted to involve his story. It keeps a steady pace thanks to the role that every character performs, manages moderately well the narrative in the robbery sequence and doesn't waste time trying to be something that won't be able to, the resolutions are accurate, dry and concise and in the end, one ends up giving in to his funny but poorly original moves comparing with another of the most controversial feature films that set light to the debate: 2016 ""Ghostbusters"" reboot. There's diligence in the exposition and each lady plays somewhat the same role of their male counterpart from the original, some stand out more than others by the situations and the time put on them, but finally, proves that it has not been what we wished, is not as stylish as its components, but the ease displaying the plot and the extremely excessive respect make this an acceptable, undemanding fiction, a low-pressure evening of cinema.Many are the snazzy cameos walking through this audiovisual catwalk, either belonging to the fictional world or American entertainment. It's confusing and unlikely to understand in what place and time it sets, because according to what it projects, takes place in our world, but with important alterations, none of the actresses performs themselves for obvious reasons, not even Anne Hathaway with a role open to that possibility, opting only to increase its ""medium"" budget by displaying all-kind celebrities as Heidi Klum, Kim Kardashian, Common or Katie Holmes.The cinematography of Eigil Bryld gives the illusion repeatedly of being a kind of extended advertisement for the most famous museums, shops, and cities, since there is enough material focusing on brands, paintings, sculptures, and buildings, neglecting the mise-en-scène of the core story by trying to give a supposedly clever context. There are plenty of glamour and style in the performance of the film, especially in certain costumes designed for the recreation of the MET-special attention to a museum room showcasing the royalty's relics and jewelry over a moat, a particularly beautiful setting, - however, taking into account the endless visual opportunities that could be expressed on the most important gala-event in America with a different theme, it never makes an accurate use of this great potential because no designs are exhibited with the expected dimensions. The angles are quite specific and the camera movements end up being more showy than propositive, for example, the opening and closing scene, the way they play with the point of focus and how they slowly bring the character in question closer are awesome. There's no specific palette in the feature, the art department decides to follow the personality of each persona or the vibe of some places with simplicity to create every atmosphere, a welcome result that fails to transcend the usual, not even with Hathaway's or Bonham Carter's magnificent character. Juliette Welfling's edition work draws off too much from the source of inspiration, with scene-dividing changes, the emblematic visual games, the interspersion of situations and the old-school character introductions and props through different but simple, artful techniques, this modern-day spin-off weakens its avenues demonstrating a serious lack of personality and own creativeness making up a not-so inventive emulation. No homage if you abuse from the honoree's ideas in a big way. Daniel Pemberton's soundtrack plays by the rules as for the original melodies and despite he uses a few ones in his score, he applies small variations that fit well, while his own compositions extol the scenes thanks to the idiosyncratic rhythm, harmony and pace of the most traditional heist movies, no doubt, Pemberton did a great job for this half-baked flick.It's unbelievable the obnoxious product placement throughout the film. As the original film was a marketing pull for many of the casinos in Sin City, Ross' film tramples on a ridiculous multitude of brands, from Whirlpool to Subway, from Dolce & Gabbana to Coca Cola, from Epson to BMW. A personally tiresome overlong TV commercial that exceeds the limits of the tolerable.""Ocean's 8"" by Gary Ross is an entertaining, hard-to-avoid Hollywood heist film starring an all-star all-female cast that might have worked better as a standalone movie, nevertheless, this is a spin-off of the hit Steven Soderbergh trilogy that dilates the abusive use of some features that were attractive and groundbreaking at that time but today simply don't convince absolutely. The performances are a pleasure, even with the well-worn material to adapt, the script is laconic in its purposes and lightweight in the execution of itself, the direction by Ross gets to set up a moderately-glamorous summer film that satisfies the undemanding viewers running away from the sunniest days of the summer. If Warner Bros. has in mind to build a new franchise on these capable Ocean's, it must shake the scheme up and implement new and different moves to create its own criminal world, not one living under the shadow of Clooney's Danny Ocean.",Ocean's Eight

I was expecting another cheap feminist cash grab like the Ghostbusters reboot, but fortunately I was wrong. Very early on in the movie, they explain why the cast is all female in a non-abrasive way. My main beef with the film may be a positive in some viewers eyes; it was far too easy to follow. In a heist movie, I want twists, turns, and interlocking subplots. Oceans 8 feeds you everything you need to know in a matter of fact narration manner. The protagonists never have any bumps in their plan, so there is really know rising or falling action.",Ocean's Eight
159,carlos37andre,"So much talent, so little new to add to the franchise",5,23 July 2019,"I'll really try to be short with this one. As everyone wold expect this movies' cast is insanely talented. I love so many of the actress in this movie. Anne Hathaway, Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter and Mindy Kaling, we already knew were great. With a plus of the rising star Awkwafina, which was great in 2018 also in Crazy Rich Asians. So, definitely, the cast isn't the problem here.I just question the point of this movie even existing. At any point it tries to be more than just ""A Ocean movie with a female cast"", it's almost bit for bit Ocean's Eleven all over again. They even do the same getting out of jail thing, etc etc. There are conteless celebrity cameos throughout the hole thing, that feel no purpose in the story. James Corden is ok as the villan, I mean, the dude is funny, it's enjoyable to see him there, but there isn't nothig more there.Also, the movie keeps coming back and paying what I would say is sort of a forced omaje to the other movies. Another mistake here. It's almost like they feel they have to tell us every 30 minutes we are watching an Oceans movie.Overall, Ocean's Eight it's full with talent actors, who give likeable performances for almost 2 hours. Under the surface there isn't really nothing else to it, it's just another movie who uses the name of a dead franchise to make so more money out of it.A side note: Out of the entire cast, I felt that Blanchett's was the only one I thought the performance wasn't really there, I mean, she is awesome, and it's always great to see her, but she felt miscasted at times.",Ocean's Eight

All the movie makers twisting old roles and stomping on history in order to make diversity work (a contradiction in itself/won't work that way), here is how it is done and in a relaxed, natural, fitting way. We have great female characters (I know, too much for many gentlemen, so don't watch and get back into yout caves) of pretty much all colors (and blondes!), in newly written roles, and it works perfect. All right, we could do with some more range on the age-side and maybe some physically challenged people (at least someone with glasses maybe) and a bit fuller shapes, maybe in a sequel, but for now, it is perfect. Even some German words are spoken and not by Nazis - I am shocked, in a very, very good way. It shows: it can be done, and it can be done perfectly. I had a blast with any aspect of this movie and can only recommend it. Way to go, thanks Sandra and all the other great women and men being involved.",Ocean's Eight

You would think the actors would have turned to the hack behind the camera, and yelled: ""Hey, Dummy! The fake necklace is coupled, AND she's wearing the real one when she has her head in the toilet, puking her guts out!"" But no such luck. Stupid Sloppy is as Stupid Sloppy does.The owner of the lovely neck is Anne Hathaway, who plays a vapid creature named Daphne Kluger (why she didn't play herself, as Vogue's head honcho Anna Wintour does, is not for us lesser minds to ponder). Hathaway's ex, ""real estate developer"" Raffaello Follieri, defrauded investors out of $100 million in a scheme involving properties the Catholic Church was selling to settle assault claims. Unfortunately, humanity will never know if she so much as asked Follieri how the hell he was paying for their pricey amusements, as the FBI allowed her go on her merry way without so much as asking her a single question.I mention this because Ocean's Eight isn't just about fraud, it IS a fraud: one, big 110 minute rip-off! This odious ode to Girl Power (co-written by a woman!) doesn't have one compelling reason to exist. Bad enough Marlo Thomas, Elizabeth Ashley, and Elliot Gould are dragged out of mothballs for cameos which give ""cringe-worthy"" a bad name, it has more plot holes than a sieve. The ""criminal mastermind"" is the sister of the deceased (or not) Danny Ocean. Hours after Debbie Ocean is sprung from the pokey after promising to be a good girl, she relieves Bergdorf-Goodman and Burberry of a few goodies, then crashes at The Plaza, with an unwitting couple footing the bill. Any one of these stunts should have landed her back in the pokey, but no one catches on because she is a ""criminal mastermind""!Criminal Mastermind wants revenge against her ex, an art fraudster (you were expecting a Boy Scout?) for sending her to the pokey, so she decides to steal a bauble, dubbed The Toussaint, during The Met Gala, and frame him for it. She and her Sidekick recruit a motley crew with specific skills, one of whom comes up with the ""genius"" idea of creating the fake bauble from zirconium by using a 3-D printer. Forget that it is impossible for a 3-D printer to 3-D print zirconium AND that zirconium is heavier than diamonds -- these are ""criminal masterminds""!The ""master hacker"" warns of the need to erase digital footprints as she creates digital footprints. Vogue hires four members of The Motley Crew for The Met Gala without conducting thorough background checks. How did Criminal Mastermind get the mobile she uses to con The Plaza into giving ""the couple"" their room back? How did the ""master jeweler"" set up shop in The Met's kitchen bathroom without anyone noticing? Did I mention the DNA The Motley Crew leave all over the now-split real necklace that Criminal Mastermind slips into Art Fraud's pocket to ""prove"" he stole it?That this odious ode to Girl Power relies on a MAN (Yen from ""Ocean's 11"") to relieve The Gala of its other priceless bling was lost on everyone, too. Forget how we're supposed to buy that Criminal Mastermind moves over $300 million without the FBI and the Secret Service on her like flies-on-stink -- she is a ""criminal mastermind""!

165,Jared_Andrews,Bland and Absent of Fun--This Cast and this Franchise Deserve Better,4,16 June 2018,"When I heard that Ocean's 8 wasn't a remake of Ocean's Eleven, I was relieved. But that relief quickly evaporated when I saw the opening scene exactly mirror that of the previous 'Ocean's' movie. Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) is about to be released from prison (just as Danny was). When the parole board asks her about her plans on the outside, she launches into a fake-emotional soliloquy about wanting a normal life. Contrast this with the wry smile Danny gives when asked the same question and I could immediately tell that this 'Ocean's' movie is missing something that its predecessors understood and executed so smoothly-how to be cool. One simple tip: less is more. The directing talent gap between the two films is substantial. Gary Ross is a perfectly adequate director, but Steven Soderbergh is a master. This manifests itself in all the little details, from the foreshadowing that you don't realize is foreshadowing until later, to the clever way details of the plan are slowly revealed, to the ability to recognize and showcase each character's strengths. After Debbie is freed, she first visits Danny's grave, which is a bizarre choice by the writers. Why is he dead? Why is that part of this? Next, she meets with her closest confidant, Lou (Cate Blanchett, one of the movie's highlights). Debbie shares her plan, and then the two go about rounding up the necessary crew. Once everyone is on board, they meet so Debbie can reveal the plan and the score: they're going to steal a necklace from the Met Gala (just one necklace? hmm) and take home $15 million each.It's all familiar, though not much fun. The plan is too simple, the initial group meeting seems to last all of 20 seconds, and the characters are fine but dull. We see moments of banter that each have the cadence of a joke but don't elicit a laugh because nothing funny is said. I could go into more detail on the crew members, but why bother? They are underdeveloped and only partially given a chance to shine, even the best performers (shouts to Helena Bonham Carter and Sarah Paulson). A word to Mindy Kaling: You're funny! Please find a movie that lets you be funny! This is not it. The whole story is tame, devoid of any real liveliness other than the dresses. Often times this feels more like a fashion movie than a heist movie. Perhaps that's intentional. If so, the filmmakers made the grave error of conflating interesting clothing and interesting people. Enough with the lavish outfits, already. Geesh. In that same vein, there's a thin line between cool and statuesque stoicism. Too many times these characters landed on the wrong side of the line.It was frustrating to watch it all unfold. This is a heist movie, which should be quite fun, and these are talented, charming actresses who have shined in other roles. Here, they are relegated to a bland, though dolled up and pretty, existence. The film has all the ingredients and the chefs to make something fun, but they aren't given a chance to cook.A more challenging heist and an imposing adversary would certainly add some much-needed spice. If there is a sequel (after a successful opening weekend there likely will be), infuse some life into it. This cast and this franchise deserve better.",Ocean's Eight
166,aleksanderk-95350,Unnecessary,2,11 February 2021,"I decided to give Ocean's Eight a chance. After viewing it, this film felt under. The acting felt dull, to me and lacked any charisma. The film, also was slow and felt like it was dragging. I never felt, like it picked up the pace. Overall lame copy, of the Ocean's Eleven.",Ocean's Eight

168,blrnani,"Very slick, perhaps overly so",6,17 September 2018,"This is a very clever film that is very slick. The action and acting is excellent and lives up to the precedent set by the male trilogy. Further spice is added by the revenge subplot.
Where I think the film falls down is in the milieu. Whereas the targets in the trilogy were nasty people in the nasty gambling business, making the outcome feel like merited comeuppance, this is the world of the celebrity - people who are more famous for being famous than any outstanding individual achievements - which the public at large feel little connection to and so remain generally indifferent. That, in turn, throws the spotlight on the fact that the team is commiting a crime (in fact, several), basically for their own selfish purposes, and thus generates less audience sympathy - we all know this sort of thing goes on (if less showily) every week on Wall Street, after all.
So full credit to Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna, Sarah Paulson and Awkwafina for good performances. I was entertained by this film and would go to watch them again in something else, but if they want to hit the jackpot, put that skill and intelligence to use in a good cause that the audience can identify with.",Ocean's Eight
169,PCT1970,Drowned The Franchise,4,5 May 2019,"Director Ross should stick to making some of his fantasy films because it was a fantasy to think this film would work. He must not have read the script. The moment they decided to turn over this franchise into the hands of an all female cast, the folkloric franchise was in cumbersome position. It was a dreadful concept to try to think Danny Ocean and his crew could be replaced with females even if one is related. Bullock, Blanchett, Paulson and Hathaway do deliver exceptional and spirited perfromances, but the Ocean's franchise is a considerable shoe to fill. The plot revolves around eight females attempting to steal a fifty million dollar necklace. That's it and it's not much of a different premise from the previous films. What's an insult to the intelligence is that the viewer is apparently supposed to overlook the obvious daft deficiencies. Maybe the viewer is dazzled by the actresses' beauty instead. Maybe that's the con. So how do you botch the premise that has been laid out in your face from the previous films? Poor direction, flaws in the plot, lame chicanery, no inventive hoodwinks and a less than cathartic ending. On top of that their is superficial humor, no action and it's a bore. What a waste of some of the most talented and versatile actresses in the world. They were the reason I viewed this film and the only reason. Regardless this isn't an abysmal film, but it is most definitely forgettable. Not only is it at the bottom of the list in the franchise, but it also scores low in it's genre.",Ocean's Eight
170,WubsTheFadger,Ocean's Eight,5,12 June 2018,"Bullock, Blanchett, and their co-stars don't reinvent George Clooney's formula here, but the ensemble's camaraderie and notable talents make for a fun heist flick that combines fashion and humor. Ocean's 8 certainly isn't a giant misfire (as was expected by some), and the few mentions of Danny (who's never seen in the movie because he's supposedly dead) and his legendary crew are only necessary to keep the Ocean name in the title. The intergenerational cast should appeal to all ages, although there isn't an Elliott Gould-equivalent actress to add to the festivities. (Note to screenwriters for the inevitable sequel: Add a character older than Bullock, who's only 53.) Still, it's amusing to see the utterly New York Awkwafina (who plays the sleight-of-hand expert) trade jokes with Bonham Carter, who seems to channel her favorite real-life fashion icon, Vivienne Westwood, in her role.Rihanna is understated as a hacker with a penchant for a daily smoke, and Paulson is believable (as always) as a suburban mom who comes out of criminal retirement for the big score. All of the actresses are in fine form, really, although Kaling doesn't seem to get as much screen-time as she should, and there should have been a bit more about Debbie and Lou's history as criminal partners. The setting of the storied Met Gala offers plenty of cameo opportunities, with fashion celebs like Anna Wintour and Heidi Klum getting lines, while others -- like Katie Holmes, Kim Kardashian West, the Jenner sisters, and others -- are shown briefly to add to the story's authenticity. Is this movie going to earn any awards? No. But is it entertaining and worth seeing for the cast and clothes? Maybe not.All in all, this film could be missed.Overall Rating: 5.0",Ocean's Eight
171,jace_the_film_guy,Pleasant Surprise,7,9 July 2021,Ocean's 8 was a pleasant surprise. The cast had amazing chemistry and the heist was reminiscent of the original franchise. I hope to see a sequel with a mix of both the original cast and this cast.,Ocean's Eight
172,n-kefala,The cast shines,5,24 June 2018,"""Ocean's 8"", directed by Gary Ross, is a movie that is trying to be interesting, but is not, even if the new all-women setup puts a fresh perspective on this heist franchise. Like ""Ocean's Thirteen"", the last and least successful Clooney-Pitt movie 10 years ago, this one has the same plot and a well-chosen cast. Like its predecessors, this is a blockbuster, powered by the charisma of its stars rather than the acuteness of its script. It's hard to see any effort in the film. There's no comedy, no real drama and, worst of all, no tension when it comes to pulling off the heist. ""Ocean's 8"" is best described as a movie-shaped collection of brands rather than a real movie. The cast shines, but they can't do much with their weak script and direction.",Ocean's Eight
173,Breumaster,"It's Not the Original, but I Like the Female Way of Telling the Storry",8,5 February 2020,"It's no secret that this movie is based on the 'Ocean Eleven' movie and it's sequels. When I saw this movie, I was sceptical about the story. But I watched it and found it surprisingly good. Women do things in another way than men do, that's the whole recipe for this movie and it works. They made a new story leaned on the principle of the old heist movie series. It's interesting to see how women would handle the different obstacles to success as a group working together. I did like the characters and the interesting way the story goes with a little twist. We were well entertained. I would watch this movie again.",Ocean's Eight
174,MichaelMRamey,Not A Remake But Felt Like A Remake,6,28 October 2018,"I absolutely love Ocean's Eleven so I was skeptical about this one. However it wasn't that bad. It's a decent heist film, nothing special but entertaining nonetheless. I didn't like how they tried to copy a lot of things from Ocean's Eleven instead of making their own story and characters. Cate Blanchett was written hard to be Rusty but it just wasn't working. Sandra Bullock wasn't as threatening, it was hard to buy her in that character. As much as I like both actresses, they should have written their characters as a unique person from their male counterparts since this isn't a remake, but feels like a remake. If you can put those past films out of your mind for two hours, you'll enjoy it. The rest of the cast was great and I really liked Sarah Paulson's role as it was one of the few characters that actually felt new to the franchise.",Ocean's Eight
175,lbowdls,Flawless Diamond of a film!,7,12 June 2018,"Firstly, I want to say that I hate remakes, reboots and re-imaginings with a passion, especially with unnecessary re castings of roles with particular groups of persons like women etc. But 'Ocean's 8', whatever you call it - sequel or re-imagining - is faultless, as flawless as the diamond necklace they want to steal in the film.On paper the cast of Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Akwafina and Helena Bonham Carter should not work, but it does. If you don't like some of these stars, or all of them, believe me in this film you have no reason to not love them. They all work together like a well oiled machine and, to me, even better than the group of male stars in the previous ones. This film proves that a cast of all female characters doesn't come off more bitchy and erratic than a cast of men.The acting is the best I've ever seen of any of theses actors do and there are Oscar award winners amongst them. The acting, writing, dialogue, plotting, directing, editing, even pacing, are all perfect and entertaining and so much easier to follow than not only the male versions of Ocean's but any other heist movie I've ever seen before. In fact, the film may be so clear in its execution that I dare anyone seeing it to not plot - in their own heads only, of course - the possibilities of such heists themselves. And because of this the only minor downside I can possibly mention is that it is slightly lower in suspense than other similar films, except the aspect of will Danny Ocean/George Clooney make an appearance? Is he alive? I'm not telling. But hey, everything else is so perfect you can't help but be entertained from beginning to finish. If you think it may also not be full of comedy then just wait for the appearance of James Corden (as one of the best comic reliefs I've ever seen in any film) playing an insurance agent. He isn't bumbling or silly though; it is actually a great nuanced performance. Dare I say he steals the show (you can decide if that pun is intended or not). His personality and talents are perfectly cast for the film.
Even the soundtrack is perfect. It's not too much, not too loud, not distracting. The timing of the music and some amazing, perfectly placed songs are also ideal. Please do yourself a favour and go and see this diamond of a film.",Ocean's Eight
176,isaacochoterena,Not so different,6,11 November 2021,"The film manages to capture the attention of the viewer but does not feel much emotion.When the scam is carried out, there is no emotion why they are going to be caught, the formula is very similar to that of the first film, the film is very convenient and sometimes incongruous. The performances are decent, as is the production design, the idea is good but it feels without much emotion contrary to the first ones.The only reason it is worth seeing is its good cast, the rest does not cause much enthusiasm.",Ocean's Eight
177,PotassiumMan,"Fairly decent Ocean's spinoff, if somewhat maligned",7,22 August 2018,"In a nutshell, this is an A-list female cast having the time of their lives pulling off a daring, impossible-to-detect, endlessly stylish heist extravaganza. Several Oscar winning actresses are parties to a diamond heist to end all diamond heists at a super exclusive gala at the Met in Manhattan. One of them, Sandra Bullock, has an old score to settle.I saw this film out of sheer interest in Cate Blanchett's role but the real surprise here is Anne Hathaway as a glamorous, but seemingly dim bulb socialite whose colossal event is the venue of the heist. I haven't seen her in this broad a performance before and she pulls it off quite well. In fact, no one does a bad job here.A female version of the Ocean's series is not something to wring one's hands at, but it's fair to say that this film is widely disliked, something I don't understand because it's not terrible- not even close. I'm absolutely positive that it's better than the useless Ocean's sequels that came out in the intervening years after we first got acquainted with the franchise-to-be. All in all, I don't get the hate. Entertainment is entertainment. Recommended with a smile.",Ocean's Eight

Oddly enough, the best part of this movie, is the cast. I enjoyed the rapport between the actresses, as each had a very distinct role to play in the main narrative. The big swindle itself is a predictable, unrealistically executed stunt with little surprise value. The plot is simple, however the writing has several humorous lines and is surprisingly on point. So, if you can get over the unrealistic nature of the central heist and its lack of unpredictability, Ocean's 8 will otherwise charm with a superb female cast and sharp dialogue.",Ocean's Eight

182,Solnichka,"Sadly, the soundtrack and James Corden are the best parts of this movie",6,23 June 2018,"Let's start with the obvious: The cast lacks chemistry we associate with this genre of filmmaking, whether it be the direct comparison to Clooney/Pitt/Damon or even to lesser-known movies and their leading actors. Bullock and Blanchett just have no chemistry, and the duo is dull. The screenplay wastes Mindy Kaling, completely, in favor of ... Rhianna. Any way you slice it, the casting just rang hollow throughout the film. The positives were the music, as the pace of the film-which is kind of short, if you think about it-moves with the sounds very nicely, and James Corden, who brings out the first real laughs for the audience about 85 percent of the way into the film. Seriously, the movie just doesn't make you laugh at all. Helena Bonham Carter's character could have been funny, but it wasn't. Same with Kaling and Awkwafina ... just a very poor utilization of talent in the screenplay. In the end, you don't really care about Bullock's character, and the cheesy attempts to connect her to the Clooney character are weak. Even the ""surprise"" at the end is a lame way to remind us all this is NOT a worthy part of the franchise. It still has its moments, here and there, and Richard Armitage is kind of amusing simply because he loves himself too much in this role, but I still wouldn't buy this for my DVD collection, even if it was 2005.",Ocean's Eight
183,intrepidami,"An all female crew movie that's not, a thrilling heist movie that's actually really boring.",6,17 June 2018,"Let me address the first part of the title of this review. We sat through an entire movie to find out one of the original oceans crew is needed to actually pull off the main heist. With out him, they make less than a 1/4 of their haul. So much for the sisters are doing it by themselves angle, huh? Couldn't even be bothered to come up with a female contortionist? Couldn't have her be that guys sister or something?And what a drag to get to that point! Every single actress got her ""moment in the sun"" however those 3 minutes didn't make up for the bland filler that was the rest of the movie. Cate Blanchett could have done this movie by herself.These Ocean movies aren't cinematic masterpieces to start with. Critics are trying to be PC but this is the second worse of the bunch. The last Oceans was just everybody going through the motions to get a paycheck.This one really just used the everybody knows a world class hacker God, the investigator who is only interested in the win, not the recovery, and the woman scorned cliche. Yawners.Some of the ""bits"" were downright silly, like Sarah Paulsen is married to somebody who doesn't realize she's running a LARGE fencing operation out of her house?The tired old pickpocket who starts out pickpocketting the people who hired them?

184,paulijcalderon,"Would have benefited more if it wasn't connected to the ""Ocean's"" trilogy",6,26 August 2018,"Is this plan priceless? Well, it's a guaranteed formula. Here's the thing, I would have enjoyed this movie more if it wasn't connected to the ""Ocean's"" trilogy. This group of people should have existed in their own continuity and been given their own unique stamp. But now since it is connected, there's just no way to avoid the comparisons to the previous movies. Because you're always winking back at them. It's distracting! Plus, Gary Ross is did a good job imitating the style of Steven Soderbergh. But again; be your own thing, please. You don't need to take the name recognition of ""Ocean's"". Simply find your own personal style to the heist genre. That would have been more fun. I also need say that I don't love the original trilogy. They're fun though, and you'll get an interesting surprise on occasion. This new entry still has a fun vibe which is captured pretty well. The actual heist on the other hand... Could have been more interesting. I didn't feel like the team was utilised enough. Lots of the characters vanished in the background and then the pace drops drastically. Get ready for some catchy tunes! Because that's what makes the scenes flow better, right? Yeah, it honestly felt like an extra pulse was missing. So they felt the need to add famous songs to cover for the energy it lacked.The cast is elegant. They honestly elevate the material they've been given. Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and friends are all nice people. I like the idea of what each characters expertise is. Even the group banter is colourful and in the very least makes you smile sometimes. There is a chemistry. But then you can also interpret it as a bunch of Hollywood actresses joking around on set all day. Who are we kidding? The original cast did the same. They even had a bar on set. I'm sure the movie is gonna get a lukewarm reaction from most people. It could have gotten a bigger pass if it was an original story (not capitalising on the success of something else), but I realize that it equals less box-office. My biggest issue is the handling of Danny Ocean. His sister, Debbie, is leading the charge. Which is not bad as an idea. I could have cared if we got a passing of torch sorts of plot. But no, no... I don't know how much you guys care, but I'm gonna spoil one thing to make my point. Danny is killed off screen. No explanation, he is just plain dead. Although Debbie might chuckle at ""Oh, I didn't see the body"". The problem is also that it has little to no meaning for the plot. Debbie's motivation doesn't lie in the death of her brother. No, she's not seeking justice for the family name. She's getting revenge on the guy who betrayed her. Sure, that makes more sense. Then why do you have to always remind the audience that Danny is dead now? If it really has no relevance other than to forcefully take over the series? To me it felt disrespectful to kill that character, who is iconic to the heist genre, in a means to say ""Yeah, get rid of the person who carried this from the beginning"". Matt Damon may have gotten his cameo cut, but his character is not as important. George should have been there at the end. A brother and sister reunion, showcasing how important it was for both of them to make their family proud. It's a family of clever criminals after all. Perhaps have them joke about competing over the best heist or something. Most importantly, it would have added an emotional feeling at the end. Show that both characters learn from each other and that making robbery heists is what they love to do. A little humanity, you know. There's gotta be some care in the story.Anyway, there was my short tandrum. For all the fun moments it had, I just couldn't help that I often got taken out of the movie. Also the annoying/ungrateful decision of killing Danny is not OK. It's right in the middle for me. A good definition of ""Sure, I've seen it before. Meh"". At least the costume design looked neat.",Ocean's Eight
185,domtaylor,"11,12,13... 8?",6,1 July 2018,"There's some fun to be had in Gary Ross' attempt to copy Steven Soderbergh, especially thanks to the 'heist' sequence - which is exciting and actually rather well executed - and, perhaps even more so, to the cast. Unfortunately, the majority of the film is one-note, bland and predictable. When the film tries to pull the rug out from under the audience and surprise them, it really doesn't work. Things get even worse in the third act, with the arrival of James Corden's 'insurance investigator'. He adds nothing significant to the plot, besides annoyance, and is a distraction from the stars of the film, who were previously doing much of the heavy lifting. While 'Ocean's Eight' isn't particularly engaging, and adds nothing new to the 'heist' genre (except perhaps the predominantly female cast), there is some passive fun to be had here and it should provide some pleasures to fans of the 'Ocean's' series. 6/10",Ocean's Eight

I guess we still need male ideas in a female world. Or maybe it's just that you've been spoon fed the idea this is a movie for women because it's by women for women. Well, not it's not, not even remotely. The movie was written and directed by a man who barely understands guys, let alone women. If you think the guy who wrote Lassie and the Hunger Games should direct a movie that is 90% women, then you will get a male perspective of a women's revenge story. I wish the people involved had employed one of the many visionary female directors and given them card blanche. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it way more than a complete carbon copy of the Ocean's movies, with little to no ingenuity and so much forced exposition, that you'd think the moviegoers are mentally handicapped.Most of the characters are so badly written, with no growth or anything that would make them relatable. This movie is an insult to anybody's intellect. I hate seeing several great actresses squandered, but then again, it's their time... If you go into this movie and like it, that will be amazing.

The women primp, preen, ad try to look good as eye candy in a comedy that has no laughs, or a thriller that offers no thrills. You can pretty much dial it in in a film that is predictable from start to finish. Only James Corden offers some laughs-though not too many as a detective investigating the case. I don't really want to get on a rant, but making a film for the sake of making a movie about women criminals to appease the 'me too' and 'empowerment' crowd is just an excuse to further exploit those who are calling for more 'fem-centric' movies . I can understand if the film was attempting to tackle real social issues, but all it is is fluff, kind of like an extended TMZ story. A total waste of time and talent, especially from Bulloch, and Hathaway who have had better roles. Do yourself a favor.

194,Mike_Noga,A Ghost of Ocean's Past,5,28 January 2019,"I was really hoping this would be good. The Previous Ocean's films( even 12 kinda) were breezy fun. They had a nonchalant charm and good chemistry between all the actors. And while we all new they were gonna pull off the heist, it was still suspenseful because......maybe they wouldn'tThis one, sadly, not so much. It came off as half-hearted and even at times phoned in. The characters seemed unoriginal and cookie cutter. Which is anethema to a heist movie. Heist movies have been around for literally over 100 years. We all know how they work. The trick in making a good heist film, is in doing something different, something new or fresh. Maybe the film makers thought casting the movie with all female leads was the freshness. Unfortunately, like with the Ghostbusters reboot, that just wasn't the case.To me it seemed like everyone involved in the movie, from actors to director to the best boy ( Sorry Chip) were just going through the motions.Worst of all it committed the mortal sin of breezy heist movies. It wasn't fun.",Ocean's Eight

This movie was more about star cameos, pretty clothes, and an unnecessary amount of strutting. It kind of soiled the name of the entire Ocean's franchise. Honestly, it felt more like a testament to fashion than anything else. The director seems to have chosen a style over substance route and the plot is almost non-existent. These characters are not believable and their smug smiles really annoyed me. Nothing new. Nothing remotely interesting. Watch something else instead.",Ocean's Eight

People, review a movie on its own merits. It's not Gone with the Wind or Ocean's 11. It's Ocean's 8. Unlike many thriller heist movies, it actually explains what happened well. Of course it's unrealistic. That's why it's a movie and not a documentary. I enjoyed it.",Ocean's Eight
198,valen060,A Tad Too Simple In Carrying On the Family Legacy,7,17 June 2018,"I've heard various stories of this movie's beginnings when it was still a simple concept mentioned in various news articles online and when I did, I was already growing interested in how this would work when it finally materialized as an actual movie.The plot revolves around Deborah Ocean (Sandra Bullock), estranged sister of Danny Ocean (originally played by George Clooney) as she has been recently released after doing time behind bars. Upon meeting an old friend of hers, she concocts a plan by pulling the biggest heist that she's been planning in prison for the last five years: Robbing the Met Gala of its most prized jewel necklace.For a spin-off sequel, Hunger Games director Gary Ross did an impressive job by casting various, familiar celebrities that make up Bullock's all-female heist team. Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne Hathaway all had great personalities and quirks to boot. Debbie's diligent plan can pretty much rival that of her brother and seems to be effective as her team can definitely be up there playing alongside the boys. Sure, the plot feels too simple and can drag in some parts of what the main purpose of the heist is about (since I expected it to reach similar ranks as Danny Ocean's original team from the 2001 film), but aside from the flaws, I see potential in seeing where this can go if it were to continue. I have a feeling that Danny Ocean's fate is not what it seems in spite of his sister's own knowledge of what happened to him these days. Worth a watch if you're looking for a good caper film.",Ocean's Eight
199,clock_me,ok but not that great,8,9 June 2018,"Just finished Oceans 8 and it wasn't bad better then 11 and 12 
one thing i noticed was this was not a comedy
story was something we have seen so many times nothing new was added to make this unique
the cast choice was very good even thou Rhianna was cast which i was dreading lol
Ann Hathaway totally stood out from every one else
it dragged just a little bit in a few scenes but in the end it was totally worth it 
one thing that really bothered me was Sandra Boullack and how the guy who sent her to prison didn't even notice her no did any of the security people I mean all she did was dye her hair what about the nose or lips
also for some of the other characters they could have devloped them a little more just sayin
for a run time of only 1hour and 50 mins it only spent like 15 min or so on the actual heist and the rest on reveling what oceans 11 did oceans 8 tried to out do but failed however it still sits as one i will buy on dvd",Ocean's Eight

202,KathleenK22,A good but not great movie!,7,8 June 2018,The story lacked any action and maybe some of the characters could have been developed a little more. A half hour added to the movie may have fleshed it out a bit more. I missed Sandra Bullock's wonderful facial expressions. I think the actors could have had more to work with in the way of a script. It is not a bad movie but it lacked quite a bit. With such a magnificent female cast much could have been done. A few surprises at the end were appreciated though!,Ocean's Eight
203,richarddillomes,Give it a chance and chalk it up to birth pains,7,7 October 2019,"I love the Ocean's trilogy so when I found out that there's a sequel involving an all-women cast needless to say I was intrigued and excited. Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway and even Rihanna should've been more than enough to make this a runaway success, right?As my friend pointed out, when you juxtapose the two versions it's nice to see the obvious contrast: the men went for the casinos and loud explosions while the women targeted jewelries and quiet execution (though I'm not sure if that's necessarily a plus.) After that it's all downhill for the latter as while it had a solid storyline, the end product didn't seem as well carried out as the heist they pulled. For a movie that had a lot going for it: great and diverse cast (Oscars, Emmys and Grammy winners, women of all shapes, sizes and colors), generated a lot of buzz and riding off on the #metoo and #timesup movement in Hollywood, and lastly an orgasmic level of cameos, it is quite unfortunate that it still fell short of it's diamond-like caliber.One downside of comparing this to it's male version is you see that Sandra wasn't able to fill George Clooney's shoes. While she had plenty of screen time, she did not register quite enough to be on the same level. On the other hand, Cate Blanchett totally owned being the female Brad Pitt (don't @ me and say we shouldn't compare: they brought in a brunette and blonde combo for the leads, on some level they knew they were gonna be compared.) Anne Hathaway was stunning and you can see she had fun doing this (stop ageism, we need more of Anne H in the movies.) Rihanna was dispensable (was Halle Berry not available?), and the rest were okay as bit players: you feel like they're there more for the diversity than out of necessity. Maybe the male version didn't have this problem because we came in knowing it was about George, Brad and Matt.While I don't want to say that they needed a cameo from George (which I'm sure he'll eventually end up in one of the sequels) because it make it seem like the women can't fend for themselves (although from what I read Matt Damon filmed some scenes but they were cut allegedly due to the inappropriate remarks he recently made regarding sexual misconduct against women in Hollywood), in this case I wouldn't have minded because he's such a major part of the franchise that it should be treated as a positive than a negative.Overall it was a decent first outing. I'll give it a chance and chalk it up to birth pains as I'm sure it was hard enough to get an all-female ensemble movie out. But they need to step it up and know that if they want to be treated like one of the boys, they will need to play like the boys and bring in the big guns. Here's a tip: start by getting the most obvious choice for the movie's 9th member: Ocean's 12's Julia Roberts.",Ocean's Eight

It is thick with story and deep with character and an amazing plot-line. It is very well done. Granted, there are a lot of distractions, because many of the 'extras' in the film are real celebrities and you may get carried away pointing out Anna Wintur, Dakota Fanning, Marlo Thomas, or kim Kardashian, but upon a second viewing, and anticipating all those little 'gems,' I really paid attention to the plot lines and the story and I was rewarded ten-fold!

206,feyipuk,Hot rocks lacking in the Oceans coolness.,4,17 August 2020,"If this had just been another heist film, with a great cast and interesting plot, then it could have been a decent film. But making it a connected spin off to the George Clooney trilogy seemed unnecessary. Only reason I could see in making Sandra Bullocks character related to gorgeous George seems to be to side step talking about her criminal connections for pulling off this caper and the opportunity to ogle at pictures of him. Towards the start there's even a cameo by Elliott Gould as the recognisable Reuben from the 2001 trilogy trying to warn her about the dangers. Because everyone knows what the end result will be there!
Debbie Ocean is the brother of Dannie Ocean (maybe their parents weren't that imaginative with names), who has just been released from prison and looking for a score she's been planning during her lock down period, along with a little mission inside the mission that she may not have let her whole crew in on. She has one friend, the seemingly cooler Lou (Cate Blanchett) and together they put together a crew to pull off the job.The difficulty for me is that Sandra Bullock swaps the Ocean charisma for a penchant for languages. The Miss Congeniality and Speed star is great as a straight laced, law abiding, lead, but next to Cate Blanchett, she looks like she'd fall to pieces if her plan didn't go off with out a hitch (and when has that happened in an Oceans film?). The whole Richard Armitage relationship looks so weak and lacking chemistry, you wonder how could they have had a relationship in the first place.Just turning Dannie into Debbie is not going to make a good film. Yes, this is another movie that makes a big thing about it being an all female remake, when really it should just stick to a good story; Debbie exchange about ""Well, he's a him"" at Lou suggesting a guy joining their team gets about as much screen time as Shaobo Qin - Yen from the 2011 trilogy - who's listed as uncredited on IMDB (though he is in the film credits next to Elliott Gould), despite his role ultimately being pretty important to the mission!They swap the lavish decor of Las Vegas for a restrained sit down meal in New York, which is even weirder given they're supposed to be at the Met Gala, famous for all its grandiose outfits. In recent years Madonna's worn a 400 carat headpiece and Jennifer Lopez a 129 carat necklace. The 136.25-carat 'Queen of Holland' diamond - albeit reduced for the film to fit a woman - seems small compared to how much bling they could have removed from those in attendance at the real event.Ultimately, it was casting James Corden as the insurance investigator - at one point referred to as ""this little Columbo dude, everything but the trench coat"" - that killed it for me. Compared to the relentless Catherine Zeta-Jones, ""Smithy"" from Gavin and Stacy didn't come across as going to heat up the supposed ice water running through their veins, and really showed how badly planned the heist was that they would be worried by him.A heist movie at the Met Gala has so much potential for Hollywood to be Hollywood. Riding on the Rat Packs name to do so, seemed to add little and draw more comparisons as a result.",Ocean's Eight

But this film sets about being clever in an all too smug and contrived way. Sandra Bullock makes something like robbing a shop look clever - I wonder what would happen if we did the same thing? But having said that, I think perhaps the stars are the best thing about this film, they are all enjoying themselves.
But the plot is something else. It is way too complicated. Stealing a Cartier necklace was never intended to be an easy thing, and the number of people set up to get hold of this necklace, even if it involves poisoning half the people at the Met Party, seems immaterial. No doubt Warners set a big budget, I hope the box office returns matched their outlay, on this film I would have to say that they did not deserve it.",Ocean's Eight

It's just fun and I think sends a message to women, be strong and independent. I saw ""Book Club"" a couple of weeks ago. I loved that too. I'm glad that there are movies that are coming out now with woman who are in their 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's who rock. See it. On another note, I just wrote a review of the second movie that I went to see. A French film with the wonderful Juliette Binoche called ""Let the Sunshine In"". Stay away from it.

Luckily, it did the first. The movie keep the spirit of the first trilogy of movies but here it is from a women's perspective; which as we know is really different form the men's one. Although we are presented with some typical clichés in here, but we don't care at all. They need to rob at the MET? Let's do it with style. They need to steal a diamond necklace? Let's do it with style.All Ocean's movie are not masterpieces but they have something that draw us into them (besides the reunited cast) and they are movies that they do what movies have to do: entertain. They show us what we think is happening but there is always something that escapes the eye. Needless to add, the cast is brilliant! All of them shine. I personally live Cate Blanchett and Sarah Paulson, they are always terrific on-screen and steal the light from the rest. As an extra present, we are presented with many funny cameos that add a nice touch to the story.this is a light movie that could have been more but it is that kind of movies that don't need anything more because they do a pretty well job in entertaining us.

Others could have been replaced as they didn't seem to fit in well - or could be that I'm not a fan personally. Although some characters seemed a little out of place, they all still served a purpose in the heist in the end.The concept was great and it threw in some surprising twists that you miss throughout the movie that are then revealed later on.Not a feminist by any means, but it was great to see a heist film with women.

The main surprise for me was ""James Corden"" who really nailed it and was funny, light ,entertaining and probably the best part of the movie was when he showed up.The story follows a single line with few flashbacks to reveal part of the motive of the characters, the script is weak here without any remarkable content.When comparing it to triology, it's the least fun one, the least thrill, and the directing didn't add much here as it used to do with the triology.I don't know if it's because of the feminine style of the movie, but action scenes are absent here, everything moves very smoothly in a weird way according to Ocean's style of movies. And of course no action or technical gadgets used although a hacker is involved but all the tricks are out dated.Finally, it's the least Ocean's movie in everything, you can watch it if you are looking to spend some time or if you want to answer the question that keeps popping in your mind of ""How would the Ocean's team be like if all of them are women?!"".

This is the first Ocean's movie I've seen, and I've only watched a small number of heist films in the past, none of which I remember, not even Mission Impossible. And I appreciate that this is a ""re-quel"" it's a sequel; in the same universe, just with a different cast. This gender-bend trend in Hollywood got old before the Ghostbusters remake came out, but at least this movie has a ""half-star"" cast to prop it up.Story focuses on Debbie Ocean, George Clooney's characters sister, putting together a team to steal jewellery from a Gala, getting together a tech nerd, a girl whose good with skateboards, and some others.I enjoyed the heist most of all. I guess all the films before it are just the same, but for my money (or not, I got to see this for free :D) I enjoyed how all the characters worked together to pull it off. It's interesting seeing all the twists and turns these characters use, and I don't think the movie over did them at all. The actors are good, can't say any were terrible. I can't really tell now, and I'm not sure I'll ever get round to watching this again, but I like that there was no ""in your face"" fan service. I was expecting a character from the other films to show up for a cameo like George Clooney, but they didn't do that. Also, as a man guy dude, I'm happy this movie didn't shove in the cliche ""Girl Power"": it's ""Show, Don't Tell"" the whole way through, I bought it, and it just made me so happy by the end. There is one character that Bullock's character wants to get revenge on, and you buy her motivation; I just thought the pay off was a little stingy.Ghostbusters 2016 was abysmal, it did remakes and Girl Power wrong; this however does it completely right, it's just a shame this movies been getting slammed with bad reviews. But then, it's not a remarkable film anyway, and I guess it falls into the same problems every heist film falls into: It's a heist film, you're there to see people pull off a heist, A to B, that's it. Don't blame the actors, or the director, blame the premise of a Heist movie, there's only so many things you can with it.My grade will probably go down more once I've seen the previous instalments, but I'll have to wait and see.

Lets not pretend that we, women, do even nowadays lack proper representation! And movie and tv indistry is not doing even nowadays a lot! Yeah one or two badass female characters here and there, but the whole female cast, cmon... So my respect for the movie is primarily thanks to that.Second of all, yeah it hadnt been accurate, but she, is not her brother, and please all of you out there do not pay respect to the original Oceans because that team didnt steal in the Robyn Hood fashion but flr the thrill and money, just like this team did. And if there is any greater self entitled egocentric bunch its people on the red carpet and stupid unnecessary stuff like Met Gala. So... Please!And as, she is not her brother, this was not an extension but thr spin off of Oceans-ology, so, liter take on the story and more laugh is what did the movie good! Characters were all ok from my point of view and it is so sad seeing all of you self entitled ""critiques"" being so defamatory on the movie!Whats more - we need more movies like this and more casts like this one. And it is sad that movie industry after Oceans 8 didnt gave women the opportunity to assemble anotger all female badass team. Patriarchy afraid of something, huh?",Ocean's Eight
233,jimwt66,"Flat, boring, predictable",4,23 January 2019,"Another attempt at a PC remake that fell flat. The acting was OK (not great but OK) except for Rihanna, she needs to stick with singing. She is the worst in every part she has played. BTW, did she get a boobjob because it was a really good bra or they looked bigger.Anyway, back to topic. Acting OK, camera work good, script predictable. Chemistry, they must have thought it was a college class and skipped it. The other Ocean's even 12 had good chemistry and you could believe they were a team. This was slow to start and wrapped up fast. No real twists like the other oceans. It did have small twists but you saw them coming a mile away and they were minor.It is fine to rent for $2 but if you went to the movies and paid $10+ you would have been unhappy. Some say there were some funny parts but I must have missed them because I didn't see any. Maybe I was dozing due to slow pace. How this thing got a 6+ rating amazes me since 95% of the reviews I read were 1-3 and the rest 6's and the 6's said it was not good. Someone needs to teach people that 6's are better than average and not a boring movie as some of them say.The ending part where they snatched more jewels there was no way they would have had enough time to do all that they did and motor boat them back and forth. Not with a lock down and room to room search going on.Small cameos but nothing to save the movie and not the cameos people were expecting. I think they didn't want to taint the movie with a direct link to the other. It might have saved it if there was a huge plot twist and her brother was playing a part that saved their ass. But can't have that and make feminists angry :) I will admit that they did listen to the review from Ghostbusters about doing a parallel relation instead of trying to replace the characters. But the women just didn't have the chemistry. Maybe it is true when you hear female actors saying women actors don't get along with each other and that most of the female actors rather hang out with the male actors.",Ocean's Eight

242,kingbk-2,Pedestrian paint by the numbers boredom,2,19 June 2018,"I've been trying to figure out why I no longer go to the movie theater as much as I used to. I think I've figured it out. Hollywood treats us like suckers. They rewrite the same films over and over again, and expect us to shell out the $12-$15 for a ticket, $20 for concessions and do it week in and week out. Ocean's Eight is Exhibit B (Star Wars Exhibit A, comic book movie of the month Exhibit C) of exactly what is wrong with Hollywood today.Let me be straight up before diving in: I would LOVE an all-female crime film. I think an all-female crime film would be awesome. However, taking the Ocean's 11 script, tweaking it a bit and putting in female characters isn't what I had in mind. That's essentially what they did with this movie. Gary Ross took Steven Soderbergh's 2001 script, made some edits to it, replaced the males with females, and called it a day.I mean, Debbie Ocean, Danny's ""estranged"" sister? Really? Is the whole Ocean family corrupt? Guess we'll need a prequel now about how Mom and Dad had their first date by jacking a sports car. Yeesh. The beginning of the movie is almost verbatim Ocean's 11, except we moved the location from the West Coast to the East Coast. George Clooney had Brad Pitt as his right hand man. Sandra Bullock gets Cate Blanchett, who does a wonderful impersonation of a female Rusty Ryan, except without all the eating. Swap out robbing casinos with robbing diamonds. Gather the gang. Ho hum. Instead of getting Terry Benedict and Tess Ocean, we get someone who is basically both characters in one. As you can predict, just like Ocean's 11, Blanchett, like Pitt, questions the revenge motive behind the crime. They still participate anyways. And we get an hour or so of the most predictable, banal, anticlimactic heist ""action"" around. You know what will happen because you've seen most of this already. Sure, some new ""twists"" are thrown in, but again, you will feel deja vu with this film. I will give credit to Anne Hathaway. She gives by far the best performance in this crud. Her character is an biting satire of the Hollywood diva. Too bad they couldn't have given her more screen time. She would have made this at least enjoyable predictability. Instead, we get this mess, with some forced appearances by the Ocean's 11 gang. It doesn't save this mess. How about some original ideas Hollywood?",Ocean's Eight

Mission: Impossible, Murder Mystery, all of those countless superhero films, and now, the most recent addition, this.Please note that this review contains spoilers. Also, please note that I have not seen Ocean's 11 and therefore have no way of comparing the two movies.I just want to say that I liked it. That's the thing to keep in mind. It's not mind-blowing or life-changing but it's something good to watch in the evening on a movie night. I appreciate the fact that you finally have a female-led action movie, and yes, even though the acting wasn't exactly top-notch from all parties, there was an interesting dynamic between the eight. Anne Hathaway pretty much carried the entire movie and I think that her acting was definitely the best part of a lot of it.There are some funny parts, and the film plays quite easily so don't expect anything insanely intense or thrilling. I mean, there is some suspense but don't expect any David Fincher-level stuff. It's honestly not really anything special, but it is something fun to kill time with.The ending is quite satisfying, but near the end of the film everything gets a little bit confusing and I think that pretty much everything that happened after the heist itself could have been cut, as it drew focus away from the main event.

254,ChristianLeFeuvre,Watchable but not as good as it should be,4,18 April 2019,"When Debbie Ocean is released from prison, she is already planning her next heist. There's a spectacular Cartier necklace worth $150 million she has her eye on and, with a group of women to help her, the con is on.If you are familiar with, or even a fan of the Stephen Soderbergh's 'Ocean's' series of film, then the premise of 'Ocean's 8' will not be too much of a surprise.
In fact, the similarities with Ocean's Eleven stick out like a sore thumb. It seemed to me to have taken the blueprint of the original film and just changed the cast's gender and the setting from a casino to a gala night at a museum. The opening scenes are identical, 'Ocean's Eleven' had George Clooney as 'Danny Ocean' sat in front of the parole board explaining what he would do if he was released, Ocean's 8, his sister 'Debbie Ocean' played by Sandra Bullock sat in front of a parole board explaining what she'd like to do if released. The set up of the heist was very similar, even a couple of the characters had the same jobs, there was a tech-whizz played by Rhianna (so similar to character 'Livingston Dell' played in the original by Eddie Jemison), a pickpocket, played in this movie by Awkwafina (of course in the original Matt Damon played 'Linus Caldwell'), Sarah Paulson's character 'Tammy' is the one who is sent in to work at the museum just like Bernie Mac as 'Frank Catton' was sent in to work in the casinos in 'Eleven'. Oh, and just to make sure the link to the previous films was set, we see Elliott Gould and Shaobo Qin as 'Reuben' and 'Yen' helping out too.
The film is watchable and actually quite entertaining. The cast list is remarkable with talents like Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, Sarah Paulson and Anne Hathaway. There was a good twist at the end and cameos from a host of A-list celebrities including Hedi Klum, Kim Kardashian, Katie Holmes and Serena Williams. However I felt these cameos were there to distract the viewer from the fact that this was basically 'Ocean's Eleven', but with an all-female cast, the theft of jewels instead of money and a different director. It's was almost like the producers said.... 'Women probably wouldn't have watched 'Ocean's Eleven' because it was too much of a 'lads movie', so let's make it again but change a few things to appeal directly to women.""
Even though this film is a sequel to the original trilogies by Soderbergh, and the original trilogy was good. 'Ocean's Eleven' was a terrific remake of the 60's film of the same name with Frank Sinatra, and the sequels were pretty good too, although it has to be said, 'Ocean's Twelve' was by far the weakest of the three.
'Ocean's 8' isn't a bad movie, it isn't. I just noticed the obvious comparisons.
It's a good looking movie, the dresses were stunning. The music is jazzy and fits well to move the action along, the characters are well played and they all have chemistry together, and all in all it felt like a good and fun caper movie........but it felt like a good and fun caper movie we have seen three times already, and not as good as the previous three times (although that being said, it's better than 'Twelve'). It should have been its own movie yet part of the franchise so you could easily watch them all and get the connection. If you haven't seen the originals and just watch this one then you'll probably find it entertaining, but if you do watch the franchise, especially 'Eleven' you won't get away from the similarities. Despite the parallel, there is no 'villain' like Andy Garcia's character, or even like Al Pacino's character in 'Thirteen' and this made the heist lack any intensity.
I was always a bit wary of this film, as I believed it was just making a movie with an all-female main cast to appeal to the feminist film-goers. It turns out my theories seemed plausible. It could have and should have been so much better if they concentrated on making it its own thing.
It is an entertaining movie though. It has a wonderful cast, it looks nice, I never found myself wanting to turn it off and it was a fun watch, it just felt like there was nothing there. I had no problem watching the film, as I say, it's an entertaining caper film, but on the other hand, there was so much under the surface that bothered me cause it basically is just 'Eleven' with women!",Ocean's Eight

In fact, I couldn't even remember the names of the figures since the faces are just too iconic to be veiled with another name. Talk about the snatch, plentiful of logical issues and I'm too lazy to label.

If only Hermione and Katnis or Tris also in this movie as well, I won't hesitate to raise the rating even further.I think this movie carried Ocean's arch with girls power pretty good, much-much better than say, stupid women Ghostbuster 2016.

This time it wasn't the females fault.,6,9 June 2018,"This movie will go down as a success and it will be used to show how women can make a movie great, and how they don't need men in the spotlight for every movie. However, at the end of the day the movie was bland.
I thought the casting for the film was fantastic, they showcased their stars well and they put them in roles that they fit well. They used their celebrity status and showed them just enough to make people happy and to add up to eight people. The lead actresses were strong. I loved Helena Bonham Carter as the crazy lady which she frequently plays and Cate Blanchett as the rebellious mom. I could have done without Hathaway and Kaling, but there had to be eight, so what are you going to do. Even in the original Oceans they added random actors to just exist and glance over.
The largest driving force in this film is the fact that it is an ""all female cast"" something they really enforced. Which is the new thing, and I'm all for using any cast you want to make a great film. However, in a remake scenario it just comes off as posh and sassy. Like getting in an argument and yelling ""women can do it just as good, or even better than the men."" Kind of childish. But the reasons this film was made aside, because it was made they had to showcase the women in a perfect storm. From a story and directing point of view they had very little room to add conflict. These are supposed to be strong woman, and the smartest people they could find. But movies without conflict are nice to see but in the end lack depth, drive, and are boring. 
Other areas this movie fell down a few rungs was in the fact that it was an ""original"" sequel. With such a strong standing already, the Oceans movies already created a blueprint of success, so going away from that probably isn't your best idea.
In the end, the director Gary Ross put his best shot out there with all of the strings attached to every aspect, and Bullock and her supporting ladies can count this as a win for women. Just it's not going to be a movie that people are going to be excited to watch again.",Ocean's Eight

No real twists - until near the very end.It worked as a movie, it fits well into the Ocean series, it just didn't bring anything new to the table.Perhaps a little more time to flesh out the team relationships - though I've seen three movies with the other team, so maybe that's why I think they are a little more fleshed out.

268,cguldal,Mediocre,5,9 June 2018,"It's been said, so I won't repeat. I was surprised that the best performances were Helena B. Carter and Anne Hathaway. Yes, really, they were the shining stars, partly because the plot allowed them to have more surprising roles and the story gave them more internal/external conflict. Sandra Bullock was the usual (I call her the Keanu Reeves of female Hollywood, no matter what the character is supposed to be feeling, she has one expression, ok, maybe two expressions, and that's it.) Kate Blanchett didn't really have any real lines. The one scene where the two should have had an emotionally charged conversation fell flat. The writing was certainly not great, but I must say, the plot kind of sucked in general, so there is so much one can write around that. There was no real thrill, no real conflict. Bullock's revenge is supposed to carry the emotional weight in the story, but we barely feel it. We're told it is there, but we really don't experience how mad she is, how upset she is at having gone to prison for five years. 
The costumes, the small jabs at the fashion industry, and a fantastic performance by James Corden gets this film a few stars. Corden takes a rather flat character that is kind of sidelined and delivers, as he always does. 
I heard a few young people in the cinema exclaim that they had ""never seen such a smart movie"" and that, more than anything in the film, made me laugh! Ah, youth...",Ocean's Eight
269,ylopez-23794,Very empowering and entertaining as well big Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett Fan,10,11 June 2018,"Hello,
For one thing I have to say that I have waited since last year to see this movie. I have been reading a couple of negative reviews, but I said well that was going to happen lol. A lot of people were already predispose with oceans 8 because it had been done by Clooney and Pitt which I love. The problem is this movie is great, in my opinion it's not imitating oceans 11, it's a movie on its own with its own heist.
I love the movie I had certain reservations when it comes to Rihanna in the movie going up against Bullock or blanchett which I love or Hathaway which in my opinion those 3 stars are very good and let's not forget Helena Bonham Carter she was brilliant in this. Okay I am deviating Rihanna was okay meshed well with the others.
I love Sandra I thought she had the same arrogant good kind of cockiness I am in control thing going, was hilarious with her schemes loved it.
Cate was great there was a point when I thought before seeing the movie that. Cate should have been the leader, but I saw the movie and I am happy that Bullock pulled it off. My two favorite actresses Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett.
Anyhow the movie was great all 8 actresses worked well, I rate it a 10 because I love the ingenuity, the plot it was fun.
I saw this movie for what it was, a fun movie that it is not copying oceans 11 or anything, I saw it for what it is a entertaining movie that I enjoyed. I hope that we see more sequels in regards to this movie.
I do think that if you give it a shot you might like it forget all those user that were already predispose to this movie, they are not giving it a fair shot.",Ocean's Eight

Tries to be clever, falls flat.The biggest insult to intelligence is the 3D printer they use. For something that is basically the biggest part of the film, they put zero research into how this technology actually works..It's as bad as Richard Pryor being able to ""hack"" anything and everything into existence in Superman III just because he knows some code.Comparatively it's not the worst film out there, obviously, but far from the best.

272,dashtag1234,"Cliched, flawed, disappointing but still better than I thought",6,8 June 2018,"Ocean's 8 is the new Ocean's movie starring an all female cast, which is really cool how they put that together. The actresses are great, their performances are great, they fit the character, until the ending. The movie starts off introducing everything right away, it shows some character traits without any backstory. That's kind of a problem because as things move by very quickly, it's hard to understand the motivation of each character and the main problem with that is how unrealistic it is, and how it just starts right away. The movie is fun, for most of it, it's entertaining, slick, well-designed and directed, the main thing is that it's clever. Not the script, but the direction, parts of it are really awesome and funny. I felt that there was no character development here, though. Watching this, I knew there had to be a twist or else there was no movie, and the twist I kind of predicted, but I'm not sure how other people would be able to predict it. The twist is a little strange, it changes the story completely and it reverses everyone. Even if there is a twist, it doesn't mean that the ending goes dark. The end stays normal, it doesn't really show what I was expecting, a theme of friendship, but I guess that wasn't the point. If I were directing or writing, I would add in a theme of friendship but I guess not here. Unfortunately this movie was not so great, though it wasn't so bad either. I recommend it, just not amazing in my eyes.",Ocean's Eight

These characters were so unlikeable I found myself wishing someone in the movie would stab them all with a dull knife and end the movie like 20 minutes in. Even that would have been too long. Don't know how the director directed this movie without gagging at every scene. He must have had a big diamond studded mink lined barf bag. To tell the truth I didn't even make through the whole movie. I just couldn't do it. I'm not a fan of any of these female actors in this to begin with so don't really know what I thought I was going to get. Whatever that was, that's what I got. I didn't care much for them before the movie and even less so afterwards. A bad movie and not the least bit entertaining.",Ocean's Eight
275,iamjacksmoviechannel,Fun and Breezy,7,7 June 2018,"So like with ""Ghostbusters"" the point of these female led reboots is a girl power statement that women can do anything that the guys can do.I guess the thinking behind this one was women can rob stuff too, and they can do it with three less people. Think about that for a second and it's kinda funny. Sandra Bullock is Debbie Ocean, sister of that guy; just released from prison and looking to pull a big job she's had planned for years.It involves the Met Gala, a diamond necklace that has been locked away in a vault, and a glamorous celebrity named Daphne Kluger, played by Anne Hathaway.To do it she'll need to put together a crew; all ladies you'll notice because shit, I realize i'm guilty of not even batting an eyelash when it's all dudes. Her second in command is Jules, her former partner who's been running a bar with watered down vodka since Debbie's incarceration. The rest of the crew consists of a bankrupt, over the hill dress designer, a jewelry maker, a hacker, a tech guru, and a fast handed pick pocket.Much of the movie is spent hacking, replacing artwork, dealing with magnetic clasps. None of this really presents a road block to the crew but it's diverting til we get to the main course.Bullock proves again just how underrated an actress she is, being just as good as Clooney at showing the fortitude to corale these people and all these different moving parts.The rest of the cast is a little on and off and that has a lot to do with the movie never really feeling in-balance with itself.Blanchett never really gets much to do but there is a cast here who really does click on comedic tangents but then they disappear for a while and when they return that spark seems missing.Helena Bonham Carter again shows she's good at playing oddballs, Hathaway over-glams her character nicely, and Akwafina is probably the biggest surprise of the whole movie.Just the time where they really slay is all too short and there isn't nearly as much interest in what they do afterwards.There is a main heist here though and there is some real slickness involved, but again not much obstacle or much of Soderbergh's high style either. Luckily director Gary Ross gives the whole movie a fast-paced, lively elegance. He started his career as sort of a Frank Capra and I do miss those early movies of his but he imitates well and this proves a decent companion to Soderbergh's ""Oceans 11"". Sometimes quite a bit so because the movie takes plot points from that liberally, including making the job not just a job but also a revenge mission.Despite it's flaws though, this is a pretty breezy good time up until the ending which comes off a bit gangly.James Corden shows up in a funny but unneccesary 10 min role as a detective, apparently the happy ending wasn't happy enough so there are about 6 other happy ending montages to punch it up.""Oceans 8"" could have been a funnier, more suspenseful film instead it spends a bit too much time feeling like a day at the beach, which is kind of a partial reccomendation because, you know, it's summer.If you liked this, please check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more",Ocean's Eight

Even the two sequels didn't match it, they were great but, not as great. 
Oceans 8 is different. Obviously a different director who did a decent job; and a different cast that comes together fine - I guess that's how I feel about this movie, it's a decent and fine movie that has a familiar premise.

It doesn't reinvent heist movies, it sticks to what it knows. The cast is fine, the story extremely familiar, and the viewing experience is... meh.The cast is fine. They play their parts but they seem a bit lazy. Awkwafina, however, stands out the most in her role as Constance. Reasonable but nothing too special.The story and plot were all too familiar. It was like someone said ""hey, what if we did the exact thing Steve Sodenberg did but with less suspense, an easier lift, and a few shameless cameos?"" The story doesn't work that well either.The direction was just kind of basic. What made Ocean's 11 (2001) so intriguing was the way the camera moved with the environment, and that was lost here.

It's galling to see intelligent and talented actresses who I admire caught up in wooden dialogue and one silly plot contrivance after another. Rihanna is given little to do except look pretty..probably for the best. All the characters are 2 dimensional. Not a single laugh out loud moment or real sense of danger in the entire movie.

The cast is superb. Sandra Bullock is perfect as the heist leader. She portrays a strong personality while being feminine in a remarkable way. Cate Blanchett is also wonderful (although a bit underutilized). Anne Hathway is perfect. The heist itself is cool and brilliantly worked out. All in all it is close a very perfect spinoff of the original franchise. The movie shows more of art and fashion than the original. I loved the part about Banksy.

283,pokedom,Lacks everything that I love from Ocean's 11,4,13 June 2018,"Ocean's 11 is one of my all time favorite movies. The style is unique and engaging, the heist is fun and intriguing, the cast is lovable and memorable, and basically every joke and piece of dialogue has something extra behind it. All of this combines to make an almost perfect movie. Ocean's Eight doesn't even try to attempt this level of film. It is so far removed from the idea of a good Ocean's Numerical Value Movie that I can't even consider it one. It's just your substandard heist movie with a recognizable name on it.Does that mean the whole movie is bad? Not really. I like some of the actresses in it. Sandra Bullock does a good job, so does Cate Blanchett. The two have great chemistry, and with a better script, or just one that doesn't rely on Ocean's whatever to sell, I'd buy tickets to a movie with them. They have the same kind of chemistry Brad Pitt and George Clooney had in the original, that is to say, rich, interesting, and fun to watch.The heist for the most part is okay. It's too short and predictable (which we'll get into), but for the most part it made sense. It's not as good as the original, of course not, because the whole reason the original happened was because they just didn't like the guy they were stealing from. And of course because the guy also has Danny's wife. Here we don't have the kind of figure that Mr. Benedict was, but the heist is still kinda fun. There's some cool things they do here.But that's about all this movie has for itself. Everything you'd want from an Ocean's Numerical Value movie isn't here. The style with the interesting and engaging cinematography? Gone. The clever editing? Gone. The wonderful music? Gone. The simple story? Gone. Steven Soderbergh didn't direct this one, and some random hack did instead. And it really shows. The editing is awful. The transitions sometimes make no sense and look like garbage. There's an over reliance on artificial zoom ins, sometimes looking totally awful and other times just being distracting. Most of the film is just shot-reverse shot. There was absolutely nothing special about it. The music was so loud and grating at times that it drowned out the dialogue. It's not even score music, it's just popular songs pulled for the movie just because of one lyric. And the story...The story is bad. The script in general is weak. There's almost no moments of levity, no moments that made me go ""wow that's neat"". The amazing dialogue has been traded out for unfunny, uncreative nonsense. And the story? Basic revenge with the twist of jewelry theft. You can predict the outcome of the final heist well in advance. It just goes off too smoothly, you just say to yourself ""that's not the end"". And then the movie goes on for another 20 mins. With James Corden thrown in. And it goes on. And on. And on. By now you already know the twist(s). Then it keeps going. And going. And going. The end of this film is awful, if I haven't made that clear.They killed Danny. Fine. Whatever. But George Clooney is very alive and very much a player. He'd happily be a mentor to this new sister character if you gave him enough money. But even if you couldn't get him, lots of cameo opportunities are missing here. You get one of Casino Security Guy, one of the Chinese Acrobat, and... that's it. No Matt Damon, no Brad Pitt, no Mr. Benedict, not even Ms. Ocean. Nothing. And it's not like the movie can't carry its own weight without tiebacks to the original. What I'm saying is the movie fails at carrying its own weight and needs more people to carry it to the finish line, but hands were in short supply it seems.While I do like Cate and Sandra, the rest of the cast doesn't have the same magic. Awkwafina and Rihanna in particular are *awful*. Dresser lady is whatever, gemology lady is whatever, Anne Hathaway is such a shallow character that it was kinda distracting sometimes. She sees this prototype necklace and starts breaking down like OMGGGGGG I'M GONNA LOOK SOOOOOO BAAAAADDDDDD!!!!1!! Have I mentioned the dialogue in this movie kinda sucks? And the villain isn't intimidating in the slightest. He gets Sandra arrested to drive the plot before the movie even happens and we cut to that halfway through with a flashback. Compared to Mister Benedict, nope. Just not fun.Just not fun. What a wonderful set of three syllables to describe this movie. I wanted to like this, I really did. But this movie lacks everything that I loved from the original, and it's a damn shame. Given better material and Steven back in the director's seat (since he's clearly talented and cool), this could probably work. But as it stands, I really don't recommend it. As a follow up movie it sucks, as a stand alone it's terribly made, very predictable, unfunny, and just bad. I get why this was made, I get that women have limitless potential. But this just isn't the movie to show that. With more time and talent, yeah. This could work. As it stands- or crouches in this case- not really.",Ocean's Eight

The plot is exceedingly similar, the characters are simply female versions of the original male characters and stereotypes, the set-up is similar; pretty much everything is boringly the same from one aspect.From another point of view, it's completely different.....It had absolutely none of the chemistry of the original group, none of the suspense, none of the interesting and witty dialogue, the fun to watch nature of the original is completely absent from this poor mirror's reflection of a film.The film might have been OK if it tried to start its own chapter in the genre of high-stakes cons. It could have walked on its own 2 legs and become a medium for women to shine. Instead, it is a poor attempt at a copy of a film where men are simply replaced with ""empowered women"" who copy men.

I only remembered Sandra Bullock and Rihanna from the trailers - they're both likeable enough so I figured, ""Why not check it out?"" I was pleased to see Anne Hathaway and she gave the liveliest performance, but it wasn't enough to save this turkey. Anne is like the Nicolas Cage of actresses - I can watch just about anything she's in, but it's at best a 50/50 proposition that it will be an entertaining movie.
Obviously, comparisons to Ocean's 11 are inevitable, but O8 reminded me more of the Tim Burton remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: Both C&tCF and O8 feel like scene-for-scene rehashes of things done infinitely better in other films, with all the soul, wit, and drama sucked completely out of each scene.In the case of O8, it wasn't just a single film that had already shot its scenes better in every way, but just about every heist film you could ever think of, including O11, O12, O13, The Italian Job, Entrapment, the Thomas Crowne Affair, The Score, yada yada yada.
Cate Blanchett added nothing. Mindy Kaling's role was throwaway and in no way empowering for actresses of Indian descent in Hollywood cinema, if that was one of the reasons this movie was made (it certainly wasn't to entertain audiences with an interesting crime caper).HBC's role was to wear some spy technology that was used much more suspensefully in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. Rihanna's role was to set up a blind spot on some security cameras; that was done much more suspensefully in The Score. Awkwafina's role was to slither underneath some bathroom stalls - how demeaning compared to the acrobatics from that other Asian actor in the O1x movies (who also managed to outdo her in this movie too!)
I spent a good deal of the movie wondering why Kristen Wiig was so unfunny in it until I realized it was Sarah Paulson from American Horror Story and The People vs. O.J. Simpson. Her talents were squandered here too.
Sandra Bullock's only purpose was as a tease for a non-existent cameo by George Clooney as Danny Ocean. Like Sean Connery, who also appeared only as a photo in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, George Clooney was smart to sit this dud out.
The guy that Sandra Bullock set up to take the fall was some guy nobody really cared about, apparently not even Sandra Bullock based on her acting.I love how the shocking twist is that they didn't just steal the big necklace, they stole all the other necklaces too. Big deal, who cares, the big necklace was already valuable enough they should have just split that.I'm really glad that Jennifer Lawrence did some of her social justice ""equal pay for actresses"" stuff before this movie was released, because it won't fly as far after this bomb.

299,GoldenBlunderbuss,Thick on talent but thin on plot,6,25 July 2018,"A gang of thieves and conwomen plan an audacious heist at a jewel fashion show and gala dinner - and that's it for the minimal plot.
Sandra Bullock leads an amazing cast as they attempt to steal priceless jewels from a fashionable gala dinner using Anne Hathaway (who, confusingly, is playing an actress not called Anne Hathaway) as an unsuspecting mark who is going to unknowingly steal the jewels for them. There's next to no real plot of which to speak - namely the characters go from one set-up situation to the next with little to keep an audience interested in the finer details. In the words of BBC film critic Mark Kermode, ""The plot is wafer thin - if you sneezed it would snap in half.""The biggest issue is that we're meant to be rooting for Bullock's thief when she gets others involved in her dastardly scheme (which she only wants to do because she can) by backhanded means. Bonham-Carter's fashion designer (who happens to be essential to the group's plans) is pretty much forced to join to pay off debts, while an old friend is yanked away from her daughter into one last big score against her will when Bullock turns up at her happy suburban family home and refuses to leave until she says yes.To show this isn't just an all-female remake but instead a legit sequel that happens to be all-female (something I'm all for, by the way!), it not only makes great efforts to tell us that George Clooney's Danny Ocean is dead (or is he?), it also seems to suggest that Frank Sinatra's Danny Ocean from the 1960 original might be the father of both Clooney and Sandra Bullock's Debra Ocean. Phew! Catch all of that? Don't worry, I didn't either! In short, it's a neat way to get around this not being a remake but rather a continuation of the story.Much like a packed lunch cheese sandwich it's not bad, it's just uninteresting. There's nothing to get your teeth into and you're left with a dry claggy taste in your mouth (ok, the analogy broke down a bit there!). That said, it's not deserving of the wave of hatred and internet troll bile that engulfed the all-female Ghostbusters that's beginning to show signs of being directed at this film. It's not a good film, but it's not bad. It's just there.Best Quote: ""Great to see you. You look ..."" - ""Recently incarcerated.""",Ocean's Eight

301,travishouze,"""Ocean's 8"" Play's it Too Slight",6,14 June 2018,"Ocean's 8 follows the legacy of Danny Ocean's con and sleight of hand ways by his estranged sister (Sandra Bullock) taking on a job worth millions and assembles 7 women with unique skills to pull it off. One thing I appreciated about the film is that for a film that introduces 7 new characters, you get a visual sense of how good the film says they are. One that stands out to me is Anne Hathaway who plays the self absorbed celebrity who's use to having her way and you can tell she's having fun in the role.One of my biggest issues is while the heist is interesting to see how it unravels, I found it a little too ""convenient"" and neatly wrapped at times. The conflicts that do occur feel no more than stepping over a rock that should feel like trying to hop over a fence. It's just a personal reference to see heist movies where characters have to improvise.In the end Ocean's 8 is a fine good time for a summer movie. While I like the actresses, I wish there was a little more depth to the characters, and that the heist carried a little more weight. But if you want to beat the heat and see some actresses with great chemistry, give this a shot.Rating 6.8 / 10",Ocean's Eight
302,orlando-somera,"Despite some improbable logic, a good time at the movies",8,13 June 2018,"I read the bad reviews and had low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. The thing is, some of these actresses are just too much fun to watch, even at the distance of the 'silver screen'. I particularly enjoyed Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchette's performances. But Sarah Paulsen and Anne Hathaway more than pulled their weight too. It's true it's easy to imagine their being asked to do more but I wouldn't push our luck. It's got to be hard to get this kind of crew together. The script, though flawed, is still fun and executed with polish and flair. This movie doesn't break a lot of new ground, but I wasn't sure women could seem as crafty and ingenious as they are here, but they certainly can. And that's progress.",Ocean's Eight
303,mt-95256,"Fun Team-Up Heist Movie, but Nothing New",6,2 July 2018,"TL;DREverything you expect from an Ocean's heist movie - but adds nothing elseThe all-female gender-twist works wellVery little jeopardy - every problem is solved easily and doesn't excite the audience for more than a scene or twoNothing new - even has an ex-relationship sub-plot like in Ocean's ElevenVery stylish, but doesn't make up for a lack of characterisation in some charactersHalf of the cast as excellent as expected - the other half not as annoying as they could have beenA promising start to a potential trilogy...?-----------------------------------There's still a way to go, but with any luck cinema audiences might be starting to realise the potency of 'girl power.' 2016's Ghostbusters may not have been liked (at all), but if Wonder Woman showed us anything, it was that enjoyable films led by strong women can still be a strong pull. Now we have a gender-twist on Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven (itself a remake of the original 1960's Ocean's Eleven with Frank Sinatra). I can't help but wish that instead of continuing or rebooting existing franchises with this gender-swap, Hollywood would create a unique franchise... but then again, we all know that would struggle to bring in the same size audience... Fortunately on the whole this works - a stylish and enjoyable, although ultimately unnecessary, take on the Ocean's heist movies that still ticks all the boxes - but sadly, no more than the ones you expect.Admittedly, it's tricky to take over from precious Ocean's films and do a heist movie that's different. Every cliché and genre trope you can imagine comes into play - even the ex-partner related sub-plot is similar to Ocean's Eleven. But even though it's nothing new, the story is nevertheless an enjoyable one. It's a simple, fun structure with a couple of twists up its sleeve (even managing to wrangle in a couple of former cast members as nice cameos...) One of those twists even gives you that longed for ""yay"" feeling you need in all heist movies - though it's not quite as euphoric and satisfying as the Clair de Lune scene at the end of Ocean's Eleven. Still, it does have its issues. From the various problems that are inevitably easily solved in a couple of minutes to the drawn-out end with James Corden's insurance man's investigation. The story seems so set on its characters succeeding, that we never pause to question if all will go well; there's no real jeopardy, a huge failing of the film which weakens it. Whether it's a small aspect of the plan going wrong or someone out to get them, nothing poses a threat to excite the passive audience.Still, it's undoubtedly a fun film even just to watch. Whereas director Gary Ross had to stay fairly grim and gritty for The Hunger Games, with this film he lets loose and has fun - especially with cinematographer Eigil Bryld, who photographs the heist almost as beautifully as he did Bruges in In Bruges. There's still an issue that perhaps they went with style over substance however, since there seems to be more time allowed for aesthetics and style rather than characterisation, sometimes coming across more as an advert than a film - but when it complements the personality of the characters as well as the overall film as a whole, it somehow manages to work.When initially hearing about the film when it was being cast, I had mixed feelings: with the likes of Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Richard Armitage, Sarah Paulson and Helena Bonham Carter, how could it fail to be anything but excellent? But then they throw into the mix the likes of Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, James Corden... I admit my doubts grew. Fortunately, the good half of the cast are as excellent as you would expect, and the more iffy half is (to my eternal relief) not nearly as irritating as I had feared.While Helena Bonham Carter's Irish accent is strange and seemingly unnecessary, she's nevertheless excellent and funny. As too are Armitage, Paulson and Hathaway, the latter of whom is a joy to roll your eyes at. Bullock and Blanchett still steal the show as the leads, managing to drum up a nice level of charisma and chemistry to rival even Pitt and Clooney (although they'd still win, but not by too much...). Bullock especially deserves special mention, able to take over from Clooney's former lead so well without even noticeably breaking a sweat.In an ideal world, the other half of the cast would be different, but as it is at least I can say they don't ruin the film. None of them outstay their welcome and all contribute to the film's story and even give some comic moments! Rihanna hasn't changed my mind that ""musicians"" should usually stick to ""music"" - but at least it almost makes up for Battleship and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets... Corden's casting still beggars belief. I can't help but feel he was only cast to cash in on his current popularity; his part would have been better (and made more sense) played by anyone else.On the whole, Ocean's Eight is more of a success than it could have been. Yes, it doesn't beat the original Ocean's film, does little to surprise us or shake things up (other than an all-female group) and is a little too breezy and easy-going. But it's still enjoyable with comic moments, has some nice characters and nods to the original without rebooting completely - and it's a refreshing joy to see a female-dominated cast in a film for everyone. Ocean's Nine and Ten perhaps...? (They've left just enough room for a trilogy - it can't be a coincidence!)",Ocean's Eight

305,chasemykleby,"The movie isn't great, but not terrible. It's just another ""cool"" heist.",6,9 March 2019,"Review for Ocean's 8
(6/10)Bullock, Blanchett, and their co-stars don't reinvent George Clooney's formula here, but the ensemble's camaraderie and notable talents make for a fun heist flick that combines fashion and humor. The movie isn't great, but not terrible. It's just another ""cool"" heist.
At times the film feels like a tourist ad for New York City, as Debbie cases the Metropolitan Museum of Art and wanders through its galleries, Modigliani and Van Gogh paintings in the background. Many brand names are on display, with a couple of forays into Cartier's and a quick visit to the Vogue magazine offices. Throughout, the movie teases the idea that Danny Ocean is dead. Or is that another of his long cons? The unstated tease, of course, is the possibility that Clooney will show up. As with all things in Ocean's 8, it's best to approach this with lowered expectations. The movie itself is trying to capture Clooney's ""heist crew"", but falls short and it all seems to easy for the crew.
Their plan seems like it is going to be extremely difficult to pull off, but it is very easy. Easy enough that they don't steal just one necklace, they steal over 20 necklaces. If you're going to make a ""Ocean's"" heist movie, bring something difficult and make it more interesting. With a promising cast like that, not to mention the glittery party setting, ""Ocean's 8"" should be great fun. Instead, it's a kind of noncommittal semi-fun.
The very existence of a film like ""Ocean's 8"" makes an odd double assertion: remakes or reboots putting women into roles originated in movies centered on men prove (as if anyone doubted it) that women can be as good as men in any role-but also that their movies can be as bad as any in which men star. ""Ocean's 8"" isn't bad-it's simply not up to the talents of its cast.",Ocean's Eight

We never see even one of the women having problems. They're making their plan, they do their heist and having fun trying to be witty (they're not). Soderberghs Oceans movies always presented a plan and the movie got us interested in if this plan will work. Most of the time it didn't and they had to improvise. Not so in Ocean's 8. We don't really know what the plan is but it's working perfectly fine without any interruptions. And a big personified villain is missing. The best guy we get is James Corden. He has like 10 min at the end to steal the whole show. He should've been there all the time.",Ocean's Eight
310,JelenaG890,Good cast in a dud of a film.,3,16 September 2018,"Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Sandra Bullock, Sarah Paulson, Rhianna, Helena Bonham Carter. All arguably talented people, who have charmed in other roles and mediums. What went wrong???
For one thing, this script was terrible. You can't blame this film being a dud on sexism (like many people probably have). A bad script would be a bad script no matter the gender of the actors starring in it. The characters are also neither compelling charismatic, or charming, which the characters in George Clooney's Ocean's 11 were.
They did far too much with this film, from the 10,000 celebrity cameos (hey look, there's Marlo Thomas! Hey look, there's Elliot Gould! Oh, look, Kim Kardashian and Heidi Klum!) to the overblown heist plot. They threw everything but the kitchen sink into the mix, and yet the plot was still underdeveloped.
There was also a MAJOR plot hole that somehow no one picked up on. Early on, it was established that Anne Hathaway's priceless diamond necklace could only be taken off by a special magnet. Yet, when the heist happens and the necklace apparently just ""fell off"" into the water, somehow no one thinks to question how that would have been possible.Lazy script writing at its finest.The cast members are all so talented, and deserved a better script. In my opinion, Anne Hathaway fares way better than Blanchett or Bullock, who in my opinion, just fades to the background despite being the film's lead. Hathaway shows far better comedic timing, and overshadows her co-stars. It was good to see her back on the screen.I just really hope they won't do a sequel to this turkey. You're better off not paying to see this in theaters. I'm so thankful I rented it on demand and didn't spend $20 to see it.",Ocean's Eight
311,alvesmarceloalves-73751,Disappointing movie,5,25 June 2018,"Pretty disappointing movie. It had everything to give a new gas and renew the franchise, but the version directed by Gary Ross and scripted by the director himself and Olivia Milch was much lower than the story led by Steven Soderbergh in the first remake of the classic 1960 movie. The structure is the same as the version starring George Clooney. The difference is that now Sandra Bullock makes Debbie, his sister, and also leaves the jail on parole to take a hit. For this, she recruits seven women. Among them, his right-hand man, Lou. The role here is of Cate Blanchett doing the role that in the 2001 movie was Brad Pitt. Cate, incidentally, is in a rare moment when he does not shine in a movie. It could be an excellent movie, but the script and the dialogues are not good. Even though it has a fun ending.

The other 6 are so simple characters, totally undeveloped and one just wonder what is it they do so good to be considered in the planing of the hit.

315,ShanTeaTime,"Another senseless ""girl power"" movie attempt that doesn't land",3,14 August 2019,"""Ocean's Eight"" is both a continuation and a spin-off from Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy and features an ensemble female cast. Led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.I have never seen the other ""Ocean's"" movies in the original trilogy, so from that perspective of comparison I cannot comment on it. However, I do know it was originally a male cast so this feels like a women empowerment movie. We get a huge cast of notable people set in this heist movie with not a lot of depth to it. Noone is given much to do, besides Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett whom actually acted off of each other quite nicely.So, we start the film and I am loving the dress that Sandra Bullock is wearing as she's leaving jail. We also get to see Anne Hathaway literally looking stunning throughout this movie, hot damn she's gorgeous! But other than these two things, there isn't really much to love in this film. It's all very blah. The cuts in between certain scenes were a little too Microsoft Powerpoint looking. The soundtrack is all over the place erratic. And for the last time, stop casting Rihanna in movies! She cannot act! Her character literally made no sense, I'm sorry you can hack apartment lights now? Like what?Like I stated before, this movie was marketed literally just as ""how many famous women actors can we squeeze into a single movie? type of film/plot. Everyone is a plot device. Letting in all of these random people into the heist seems like a really stupid idea, but for arguments sake I just went with it. Some scenes are comically ridiculous and not believable at all. Though I very much doubt they were going for ""realism"", it can be a fun time at moments. For a film with such a large cast, we could've used for way more character group dynamic/development. It never feels like a ""team effort"", but detached.I'm assuming that the George Clooney framed picture is a reference to the original trilogy? Or its the weirdest celebrity name drop ever in a movie. That brings up another point I had. Whenever films have both actors playing character while simultaneously having celebrities cameo as themselves...it sticks out so obviously to me. I cannot deal with it! So by the end I said to myself, okay the heist happened...now what? Why is there still 30+ minutes left in this film? Oh, its because James Corden had to make an appearance as the most unconvincing detective ever! I'm sorry but he makes the movie worse and he's barely in it.Don't jump into this one expecting too much other than some kinda cool action sequences. All that's surrounding this heist is bland and kinda boring, but some of the cast brings a slight charm to their role. So I'm going to assume that the original trilogy succeeded far more than this side film. Final note, this was marketed as a ""comedy"". I did not laugh once during this entire damn film. Take with that what you will.",Ocean's Eight

I just assumed that it would be a summer block buster packed with enough action and comedy to keep me entertained throughout the whole movie, just like the other Ocean movies, and for the most of it this is what I got. 
NEGATIVES:
Yes the whole concept isn't as promising at the first one and of course I already knew that from the trailers. For me it isn' that bad for a sequel, it may lack the chacacter chemistry and suspense that the first Ocean movie delivered and some of it's parts were poorly written and very convenient for the plot comparing to the first one but I don't think that the franchise has much potential and it has more sequels that it needs so of course after a certain point it loses it's originality. 
POSITIVE
Ocean's 8 is packed with a very talented female cast which elevates the movie and sure makes it pleasing enough to watch. Anne Hathaway although very talented wasn't much suited for the specific character that she was given but it didn't really bothered me, besides she had some funny lines and managed to give me the whole asthetic of the rich and kind of crazy star. The plot is mostly good and not with many plot-wholes and it's both simple and complicated at the same time. There are also some funny moments throughout the movie and the advantage that it had comparing to Ocean's 11 is the back story for Debbie Ocean's relationship with Claud Bekker, it was a really nice touch that gave us the oppotunity to understand the character's motive little bit better. Also the movie justifies the Ocean name in the title something that I really didn't see coming.
CONCLUSION
Ocean's 8 is a fun block buster and a decent addition the Ocean's franchise. It has it's flaws like many movies in the category but it has a solid cast and a respectable budget so I didn't feel robbed or disappointed after exitting the theater. I knew what I wanted to watch and I got it. It isn't perfect but it sure isn't bad.

Alas, in my opinion, these are the only 2 actresses properly cast and they are both terrific in their roles. Plus, the script really didn't offer anything to get excited about. As one reviewer noted, the first part is way too slow. Once the process of the heist starts, the action (or the dialogue actually, as there's really no action per se) picks up. And that is where the casting really hurts this movie. Unlike many of you, I'm NOT a Rhianna fan and this movie did nothing to change that opinion. She is not a good actress and, in my opinion, has zero charisma. I'm not familiar with Sarah Paulson's work, but this role didn't endear me to her. However, I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt as the script had a lot to do with that. I like Mindy Kaling, but in every scene, I felt like I was watching Mindy Kaling, not her character. Cate Blanchette & Helena Bonham Carter are terrific actresses but are, again, let down with an inferior script. I was pleasantly surprised with Awkwafina. I look forward to seeing her in other movies. All in all a mediocre entry into this series. I say that with the expectation that the studio will give all of them another chance with a sequel. I would have no issue watching another one with these ladies (even Rhianna), but the script will need to improve dramatically. (By the way, not happy with the final scene in this movie, unless that's a con as well.)",Ocean's Eight

I read the poor IMDB reviews while waiting for the movie to start and perhaps that lowered my expectations, however, the movie was great. These sorts of things shouldn't be compared to their priors, like a new partner, you take them for what they are in the present. Were there better heist movies yesterday, sure there are. This was another decent heist movie, it hit all the notes a heist movie should, including a slight of hand surprise twist at the end. You leave feeling good, what more could you ask for. Nice to see a couple original oceans characters brought back for cameos and a lovely surprise with you trying to place the older wealthy women gala guests popping up near the end, Marlene, Ethel (Coma), Diana.

352,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,"Weakest spot is in the writing, strongest is in the Hathaway.",6,8 June 2018,"In this soft reboot--outside of a character connection, the idea of a heist/recruitment, and some scenes that they clearly wanted to serve as a mash note to O11--it really did not feel too much like O11. In fact, its plot felt more like Tower Heist with a tone closer to O12 and a deliverance that played out a bit like Logan Lucky. It opens up with a score similar to that of what David Holmes used in the past, but outside of the different score bits this film has an actual soundtrack as well to give it its own style (personally, I would have preferred an ""only score"" flick).It's a very female-driven film. Not just by cast, but also with themes. A lot of this movie involves fashion and high society (as the heist itself takes place at the Met Gala, that's probably expected), and that lost me a bit. Even the target, although more tangible than that of what O13's objective was, felt a bit too small-scale. No, they didn't need to knock over another Vegas casino, but there was something great about that in O11 and O13 that was lost in O12, and it did the same again here. They didn't spend any time making the city backdrop become a staple or character in this film either. Everything was always shot very close and with a lot of interiors.As I outright claim in my review title, the weakest aspect of this film was the writing. I just don't think they were really all that clever, at least in that I had seen it all before. What do all heist films tend to have in common? The suckers around the protagonists eat up everything they are fed. Everything has to work in such a convenient way for it to all be pulled off. In 2018, I'd like to see a heist film that sets up a lot of contingencies when things don't go right, and this one felt very linear. Also, one thing the previous Ocean's films did really well was kept the audience in the dark about a lot of what the protags were doing--that they weren't just tricking innocent bystanders, but they were tricking us along the way as well. I'll admit they got me once, but on two other occasions it seems like they tried and I just didn't fall for anything there. The rest of it was all very plainly laid out and we were just going along for watching them attempt to execute it.These writers also simply didn't know how connect the (male) audience with its characters the same way as its predecessors. The players served their parts just fine, but only a couple of them had actual personalities. Plus, George Clooney and Brad Pitt developed such a ""cool"" dialogue with each other all of the time and always knew what the other was thinking. Maybe I'm actually looking for them to be closer to that film more than the writers wanted to, but this felt a little generic as a result. Plus, they upset me with one of their tie-in decisions to the previous trilogy, but I'm sure that was a decision that looms far above their control.Now, it probably seems like I'm majorly harping on this film, yet really when all was said and done I'd actually say that I enjoyed watching it. It wasn't a great film by any means, but I certainly did enjoy it. What I think saved it was one Sandra Bullock and one Anne Hathaway, with heavy emphasis on Hathaway. Though let me first say, Sandra played so low-key that I wouldn't be hard-pressed to claim this might be my favorite performance of hers. It's not her best performance, but she didn't feel as much like a ""try-hard actor"" in this film as she normally does, so it made me like it a lot more. However, the REAL show-stealer in this was Anne Hathaway, and I didn't even remember she was in this film before she showed up. I LOVED Anne Hathaway in this. I mean she was the really redeeming quality of every scene that she appeared in. If I rewatch the film any time soon (which I likely won't), it will be for her alone. Her delectable presence got me to go with the idea of the female-ish tone that was being played out. Rihanna got into her character nicely as well. I did not like Cate Blanchett or Helena Bonham Carter, sadly enough. Mindy was kind of ""there"" as was Sarah Paulson (who they tried to give some character to, but forgot along the way), and I liked Awkwafina but honestly didn't know who she was before this. Lots of celebrity cameos and a few callbacks to the previous films as well.Time will tell where this ranks with the other Ocean films, but right now I'd place it at the bottom. At least O12 had an artsy appeal of filming in Amsterdam and it felt like there were a lot of high stakes risks given Isabel, Benedict, and The Nightfox. Sodebergh did enough in that one and the dialogue was witty to still keep it at #3 on the list. Though gents, please feel free to take your significant other though if you'd like; they'll probably dig the fashionable aspects and you'll enjoy enough of the caper aspects to leave like I did, saying that you liked it and move on. If there is one other nice takeaway for this film, it's that everyone looked like they had fun filming it, which is an important staple of the Ocean's series.",Ocean's Eight

While the women were all trying to outdiva each other we are supposed to believe they worked together???

Easy peasy, right?
Well, the first action made by the main protagonist in this movie, is to con some makeup from a cashier, whilst being mean to her.
Now, I don't really like mean and grumpy people who steals makeup, so guess what, she's now in the minus column. That's bad writing.
I stayed for the rest of the character introductions, but they were all either completely blank, or in the minus column also.I understod then, that the movie was not gonna work for me, so I turned it off and thew it in the bin. Glad I didn't pay for that sjoit.",Ocean's Eight

Where the previous had intrigue, misdirection, flamboyance, comedy, thrill, suspense and craft..... oh dear.... how this falls short.The acting is not in question, with the talent this movie had there is no doubt, but the storyline, my goodness, Ross whom has written for movies such as 'The Hunger Games', Seabiscuit and 'The Free State of Jones', surely has the talent to come up with a script that is far more worthy of such a franchise.It is far to one dimensional and predictable, yes there are fundamental flaws in the reality of some of the workings of the heist, but these could be overlooked inside a better script, but instead only highlights it's failings.

370,zain-nov,A cast which could triumph the screen was put to a wasted work.,4,29 August 2018,"A cast which could triumph the screen was put to a wasted work.
Ocean's 8 starts with a promise to offer something spectacular but then it focusses too much on introducing characters one by one and following its predecessor instead of layering out its own trap. Ocean movies hardly get intimate with the characters but what they did have in common was a good heist in the end with a twist. While 8 offers the twist but not the good heist which makes the twist fall flat. All the jokes, moves and twists are very much predictable. One who has seen the trailer might be able to deduce whole plot. 
Only job to be done was of stylists and costume designers, which they did the best. Every member of the cast looked stunning and somehow performed to satisfaction. While many subsidiary characters were unrelateable, Cate Blanchet was signed to a role which had no use throughout the movie.

I get that ""hacking"" is still a somewhat mysterious phenomenon to most people (the most accurate I've seen yet is still The Social Network when Zuckerberg steals the photos off the Houses' Facebooks), but given the budget a movie like this comes with, you could at least hire a guy who has the slightest idea how hacking works. It's 2018, not 2001. You can't get away with the nonsense portrayed in this film anymore. It ruins it for me, completely.To people who aren't much into computers: If this was a medical drama, it would be equivalent to a doctor performing brain-surgery with his eyes closed, high on mushrooms, using a remote-controlled chainsaw.

IN my opinion this was a bad idea. Although the actors and their play was great they were suiting their roles, the plot was very boring. When you compare this one, to the previous Ocean's movies. You can clearly see my point! There's nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly. If there weren't similar movies before, I would have considered this a quite fascinating one. This is the kind of movie that will be enjoyed countless times. The dialogue is slick, and always to the point. There are few (if any) overdone scenes and/or lines that tend to become annoying over time. The cast is almost all big names.

379,aliahmedashraf,Bland & disappointing,4,26 August 2018,"Unlike the Ocean's 11, 12 and 13 series which I found to be pretty entertaining, this was by far the most bland one yet. Sandra Bullock cannot portray a con artist. The initial sequence of her getting out of jail was a nice way to kick things off but as the movie progressed, it actually flopped on most fronts. In what I can only assume is mid-2018, we are led to believe that you can just walk into a cosmetics store and act as if you're returning stuff and simply walk out without the anti-theft system going off. We are also led to believe that you can simply call a hotel after checking out and retain your room without any verification whatsoever. It was a clever attempt I completely get that. But it doesn't work for me. Gathering the team? Equally frustrating. You can't just pick up an estranged woman (Rose) and tell her ""what if we could make it all go away?"" Next we have Rihanna making another one of her annoying on-screen appearances. That too, as a hacker. Complete with a little sister who just happens to know a work-around to an anti-theft lock on a 150m dollar necklace. It's all too convenient.Mindy Kaling provided SOME comedic relief but that too was undone when her character is working her magic on the necklace in a ""bathroom break"". Again, it's a matter of convenience that no other employee noticed her equipment in a bathroom setting. I was a fan of Sarah Paulson and actually hoped she'd be an asset to this movie. I was wrong. She portrays a retired con-artist back in it for ""one last job"" cliche. I felt the sequence of copying the jewels in Zirconium was rather lame. It gives me the pretence that one can just use a 3D printer and go on a stealing spree to replace actual jewels with replicas.Another rather convenient series of events leads us to the insurance investigator who just HAPPENS to be friends with Debbie.And finally, I find it very odd that Daphne Kluger would get involved in the con, knowing the celebrity status she holds. We are also led to believe that after such a steal, Daphne won't be chased by the media and she arrives without a tail at the safehouse that the others are in.The movie is listed as ""Action/Comedy/Crime"". The first part isn't true by a long-shot. No plot twists that make you go ""WOAH I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING!"" A drab 4/10 simply because I absolutely love Anne Hathaway.",Ocean's Eight

It starts with the Sandra character being released from Prison and she starts stealing straight away. I guess this is supposed to be funny, cause she is on parole. And as the film is making a point that she is stealing from a posh store, I guess that should make it ok. But I don't know anything about the policy of said store, it being fictional and all, but in real life quite often the salesgirl on duty has to recompense for everything that get's stolen while she is handling the checkout, so stealing is still wrong.
I would forgive all of that if it would make for an entertaining movie, but sadly enough, this is not the case. I guess this is suppose to be a comedy, but is not funny at all.

384,kynick2,Oceans 5,5,2 October 2018,"I spent the first part of the film matching up the characters with their male counterparts and quickly discovered this film was going to be woefully inadequate. I had hope for Blanchett aka Brad Pitt but she was underutilized. The rest of the cast simply lacked the charm and acting chops of their male counterparts. I love Sandra Bullock but she was more like Sandra Bland. The comedic parts were simply not there. They had an asian but the asian guy in 11 was funny as hell in what little time he was onscreen. The back and forth between Matt and Scott as brothers was simply fantastic. You don't have anything that comes close to that dynamic in this film. Rhi Rhi is nice yo look at than Bernie Mack but give me Bernie any day of the week. Where is Elliott Gould when you need him? I personally would have loved to see more Mindy Kaling.

The ocean saga continues!,9,24 August 2018,"I won't even go into how much hate this production got before it began production because of its ""All-Female"" cast. All who judges a creation based on the genders behind it is most likely a human of low intelligence. Enough said.I have been a big fan of the ""Ocean's"" franchise since the first movie Ocean's Eleven came out 2001 and as many others I was both excited and a little scared about what the revival of the franchise would bring and what it would achieve. The fact that it was an all-female cast did not bother me, but what was worrying me at first was how they would make the switch from the old characters whom we loved to a whole bunch of new ones, and also how they would keep the atmosphere of the original trilogy intact. But then I started to see what actresses who signed up for the movie and after seeing that the acclaimed actresses Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett & Helen Bonham Carter was in it my interest for the film rose a little higher. I saw the movie hoping for something decent, but what I got was even more. Director and writer Gary Ross did a very good job in making this movie with the atmosphere feelings of the past movies, but also with a feeling of renewed purpose and something that felt fresh. Especially the lead actresses Sandra Bullock & Cate Blanchett was amazing as they were an equally good duo as their predecessors George Clooney & Brad Pitt was lastly in Oceans Thirteen 2007.This movie was one of those I had high hopes for and I was for once pleased to see that my high hopes were rewarded. It was clever like its predecessors. It was funny like its predecessors. It was charming like its predecessors. It was smart like its predecessors.If you truly liked the original Three Oceans movies, then there is a very high chance that you will like this as well. I for one hope to see Debbie & Lou and their associates in new schemes one the big screen again in the near future!Very good!",Ocean's Eight

398,pooz_the_gun,Just seems lazily made in some facettes,4,28 February 2020,"So let me preface this review by saying, when I heard that an all female ocean's movie was coming out I thought: Mh. OK. Seems unnecessary, but hey. I loved the first two and kinda liked the third one. Never seen the original rat pack one. So let's give it a shot.Let's start with the good. They didn't wanna take anything away from the original trilogy by adding something insulting, but instead even got two actors back for a cameo which had a nice touch. They also included a tie in with the trilogy. Sandra Bullock and Cate blanchett obviously run the show here and Sarah paulson is good too. It also still have the fast paced camera work and combined with the music you start to reminisce.However, now to the wrong parts.
This movie doesn't have any tension. You never get the idea, that the plan could fail. Any attempt for tension is artificial and falls flat. For instance the rihanna scene... let's just call the sister. No network let's just ask to go upstairs for lights. It just always seemed too easily solved.
The supporting cast also seemed quite miscast at a few spots. Rihanna and Mindy kailing and especially James Corden, with especially him being completely unbelievable.Coming to the twists. Making Anne Hathaway realize what was going on seemed actually quite cheap, because it didn't make any sense for the movie and especially for the supposed investigation, because he could just tell the police that it got there right after she spent the night, and a few other things that didn't make sense because of this. It almost looked like the the film makers were scared to include one pretentious and dumb female character for cheap, yay, girl power points. And I think it's the opposite if you just don't treat your characters like real humans, but I'd rather continue now.
The purpose of the insurance guy who instead of telling the cops the truth just helps Debbie Ocean?! You could've cut all his scene's and it would've made just as much sense, especially since cordens acting just made me want to face palm through his scenes.All in all however, this could've worked. It didn't only because it wasn't made with care and possibly with passion.",Ocean's Eight

402,lertad-1,Star Power with a Cast that Cares More than the Crew,4,28 September 2019,"Much of the Ocean franchise is more about the star power exuding their charisma on screen. And in this part, Ocean's 8 is admittedly enjoyable. The big names' chemistry is energetic and the experience can be like being starstruck from watching them hanging out with each other.On the other hand, the lesser known supporting cast show their inexperience and seem like they're there just to show that acting is not easy.Moreover, when you go into a heist movie, you expect to exercise some suspension of disbelief. But it is also the creators' job is to create an experience that makes it easy for the viewer as well. Unfortunately, Ocean 8 fails at this at every turn.For every great riff-off between the headline stars, you get insulted by the poorly thought out plot and improbably circumstances and dues ex machinas that the movie throws at you. Ocean's 8 is an emotional tug of war, with fun moments leading you to forgive its faults only to be followed by a more and more benign situation that takes you out of the movie once again.Over all, the movie is entertaining for what it is, but see it only if you're either a superfan of one or more of the leading actresses, or you don't mind having your intellect and standard expectation being insulted by the creators just because you happen to be interested in watching what looks like a fun popcorn flick.",Ocean's Eight

It is a universally known fact that women can act, so if anything, such attempts disprove the idea that sexes are identical, showing women are not as good in certain genres as men and vice versa.",Ocean's Eight
404,Paradox-Warrior,unoriginal... uninspired,2,13 September 2018,"Okay, so let me get this out of the way first. When I first heard about this movie coming out, I had absolutely no outright objections or problems with it being an all-female cast. When it comes to movies, I don't care if a character's male or female so long as they're interesting and entertaining. Unfortunately, Ocean's Eight fails to deliver on almost every level.So, first of all, let me just say that from a personal standpoint, I was seriously pissed that they killed off Danny in this movie. Not only did the loss not have any real weight with the characters, but it just felt really cheap in this case. There is a moment where Bullock's character does say she doesn't know if he might have faked his own death, but there's really no purpose other than the very beginning and in the literal last few seconds of the movie that doesn't pay off at all. Not to mention the two cameo's by Elliot Gould's 'Ruben' and Shaobo Qin's 'Yen' come off as only shallow versions of their characters. I was particularly pissed with how pussified they made Elliot Gould. Ruben was always one of the last few 'Good Fellas' types in Vegas, but in this he was damn near a blubbering mess because... they needed to show strong female leads compared to the males? I don't know. Regardless, it was pretty insulting to the characters.Now, all of those complaints are, admittedly, small potatoes when it comes to the movie as a whole. Even with those issues I would still have enjoyed the majority of the movie... if it wasn't so damn BORING. That's pretty much the biggest complaint when it comes to Ocean's eight. Forget about the characters, forget about the motivations, this movie was flat out boring. I actually found myself completely tuning it out at times and when I snapped back in I didn't really feel like I'd missed anything. For an Ocean's movie, that is almost criminally bad since all of the others made it so you were paying really close attention to everything they did to see if you could spot the con or figure out how they were going to pull this off. With Eight, I honestly couldn't have cared less if they pulled off the job or not. There was absolutely no suspense or anything to grab and hold onto my attention.Part of this, I think, is the significant lack of any real antagonist. In the other Ocean's movies, there was a 'bad guy' who was devilishly smart and necessitated the crew combine their talents and work together in order to accomplish their goals. In Eight, there is literally no antagonist for the crew to go up against. Basically, there's absolutely no sense of danger or suspense that any of them will get caught, and in a movie like this that's a big no-no. There's the one big 'surprise' at the end when it turns out that in addition to their primary jewellery target, unbeknownst to most of the crew, three of them were working a second job at the same time to steal a big collection of crown jewels. It's supposed to be this big reveal and the best it got from me was a mostly disinterested 'oh'. I didn't even really care when they did the whole showing how they accomplished it either. It was all just so BORING, and in a heist movie under the Ocean franchise, that's a death knell.The movie also didn't know how to end. In the first movie, which this one was clearly trying to hit beat for beat, it ended with the crew gathering together and then going their separate ways, followed by Rusty picking up Danny when he's released from prison to reunite with Tess and they drive off into the dessert. In Eight, they do this whole montage of how each woman is going to spend her take and, frankly, and I know I'm repeating myself, it's boring.And that's the crux of it here, what I've been repeating over and over, but that's just how it was. This moving was boring and, honestly, probably not worth your time.",Ocean's Eight

The Oceans character is completely unlikable and played with no emotion from Bullock. Any problem encountered by the characters is solved within 2 minutes-usually by a girl from the 'hood with a laptop. The narrative structure is mostly backwards, so there is no tension at any point. The only part I really enjoyed was at the very end when a tiny character is introduced as a big reveal that is mostly a throwaway. Also I did enjoy Anne Hathaway, though she was given little to work with. The worst thing was the scene which takes place inside a Subway sandwich shop for absolutely no reason, except to function as a commercial. That's clearly the reason this movie exists at all-to make money off some big name stars with waning careers. Critics gave this overall positive reviews.

The story itself is tedious, it never entertained me. Laugh in some parts for lack of logic and realism in real life (Who wrote it?). Debbie's goal is to get revenge on the ex and steals all the jewels, just because she's good at it. If it's so good, do it all by yourself (Debbie can not without her partner Lou, Amita, and the Asian guy).

 The premise is clever enough and the execution good, but it does feel a little like the other Oceans but less fun, which is a shame.

It might not be brilliant but it is exactly what the genre is all about. There is no character development, there's no deep message, it's not Oscar material. It is something to kill two hours of your day.It is the first time I will say all the hate is actually coming from the fact that many people feel threatened by a female cast in a ""male"" genre and that's all there is. Plot holes are inevitable in this and similar genres, it's what people complain about when they don't have anything else to point to. Character development when you have a two-hour movie with 8 new characters and when the plot is the main idea of the movie? People saying they expected anything like that are just not being honest but instead looking for reasons to hate the movie.Bottom line being, the movie is just what you should expect of the genre.

So how bad could it be to watch them all together?Really really bad. Bullock gives a cold dull performance and none of the others are really given enough screen time to do anything except Sarah Paulson who provides some nice moments. Although the Clooney & Co Oceans 11 also didn't do a deep dive on their characters somehow they managed to be more vibrant and engaging and you routed for each one. In this film, you just dont care and the heist itself contains plot points that even the suspension of disbelief doesnt aid.Then there is a sort of twist involving a character that is so ridiculous I winced. James Corden pops up, making it worse again and as for the secrets of the heist, well by that point I just didn't care.A huge waste of many talented actresses with the only bright moment being a cameo or two and some lovely dresses.My advice would be that you go each ladies IMDB page and pick another of their films",Ocean's Eight
432,daisytheunicorn,Great movie!!,9,20 February 2020,Loved this movie from beginning to end. The way they were able to pull of the twist at the end with Anne Hathaway while it being in our faces from the beginning is brilliant!

433,borromeot,A Comercial Operation,2,16 June 2018,"Well, yes. what else was behind this ""idea"". Money. What's wrong with that, you may ask? Look at the movie. That's my answer. Not a moment of originality let alone truth. Very dispiriting because Cate Blanchett is an actress I truly admire and I felt uneasy, uncomfortable seeing her in the midst of this misguided money grabbing scheme - pun intended - An all female cast of glittering names, a power force on their own, right? So why not make sure they get a script and an idea that is worthy their talents. Within the last two years there's been a sort of abrupt stop and there are only reboots - Will & Grace, The X Files for heaven's sake, Baywatch, not to mention the comedies with Amy Schumer one a remake of ""Shallow Hal"" the other one with Goldie Hawn. Goldie Hawn! and they can't come up with a vehicle that is at least funny. Talking about Goldie Hawn, Overboard was remade, and Flatliners. The brilliant Melissa McCarthy made about a hundred films, can you remember one? Okay I stop. I love movies, I always have that's why I notice that something is going on, I don't know what but I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

434,filmexperienced,Bedazzled,5,25 February 2019,"As that glitters is not gold....and there was an awful lot of bling in Ocean's Eight. Unapologetically leeching onto the Ocean's franchise, as a means to appear of a piece rather than just a rip-off, this sadly derivative offering couldn't quite match the cool of the 2001 original, however it packs a lot of charm to try and paper over the cracks. Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, sister to, you guessed it, Daniel Ocean. Not that he appears, nor do any of the 'main' players from the previous trilogy. The brand new all-female eight vary from classy (Cate Blanchett) to quirky (Helena Bonham Carter) to personality-free (Rihanna). Most are watchable, and they need you to in order to get you to invest in a plot with mostly predictable twists and turns that make for a very pedestrian heist, with little to no sense of danger. By the time very poor excuse for an adversary James Corden shows up, you'll care little that he has no impact other than to annoy. This is versus the originals pretty damn scary Andy Garcia. Whilst this might be a remake / reimagining car crash, it's like flipping an Aston Martin or Lamborghini at high speed - looks amazing, whizzes along but it's not until you reach the end you realise it was all for nothing.",Ocean's Eight
435,lovellallen,Not great,5,8 July 2018,"Having loved the previous oceans 11 trilogy, and this was female cast I was hoping for more.The down fall of this starts off because I can only assume the filmed this with cold colour scheme so it's not full of the brightness we are used to.There are some laugh out loud moments but not enough to carry the film.The best part of the film was the actual heist but even that was boring.So here's my issue: one missing the suspense from the actual target. Yeah they framed the ex .... But if he knew they were trying to set him up some how and putting preventive measures in place more interesting story.The actress who was the jewelry bearer was involved (I didn't see that coming)... So why bother get someone else to sneak off the jewels ... They could have took it off themselves.... Why on earth would she include herself anyway? Why would they still bother put stuff in her food? Made no sense and they should have shown how they roped her in when they filled us in about the whole heist. They steal a whole heap of jewellery and pretty much just throw that in at the end which is cool... Because while everyone is busy being checked they stealing the whole exhibit of jewels but they don't seem to give us hints that something else is going on which is probably adds as to why the film is so boring, there's no real suspense and no real secrets with the smarter audience. Hopefully they will learn from the mistakes in this film and do another one because the premise is good.

Unfortunately, it was closer to Ocean's 12. Sister to Danny, Debbie Ocean leaves prison on parole only to find herself immediately recruiting to pull off a jewel heist from the Met Gala. The movie opens with an opening plot twist and then closes with the same, leaving you wondering if it is indeed true. Compared to the the Vegas Ocean movies, this movie lacked everything that made those two special. 8 was predictable, slow and presented no style or sophistication.

441,Stars-and-popcorn,Ocean's 8 gives Eleven a Run for Its Money.,8,8 June 2018,"'Ocean's 8' had a lot to live up to after what a tremendous success Steven Soderbergh's 'Ocean's Eleven' was. The all-male original was filled with more charm and style than you could shake a stick at. Luckily, 'Ocean's 8' features such an incredible cast that it has no problem not only living up to any expectations there might have been, but also distinguishes itself as a fun and fascinating heist movie.After the lackluster success of the Ghostbusters' reboot and the recent Overboard film, I wasn't completely sold on the idea of gender-bending successful films. The concept is intriguing in principle, but in a way, it feels lazy. 'Ocean's 8' though isn't a reboot or a remake, it's a spinoff from 'Ocean's Eleven' featuring Danny Ocean's sister Debbie, played by Sandra Bullock. As charming as the old silver fox George Clooney is, Bullock manages to embrace her role as his younger sister and proves to be a more than worthy addition to the Ocean family. She manages to encompass the sophisticated and playful confidence that Clooney displayed, but manages to create a character that doesn't rely on her family ties to win over audiences.The rest of the cast is filled with unbelievable talent. Featuring the likes of Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, and Sarah Paulson, they manage to create such genuine chemistry that it's hard not to fall in love with all of Debbie Ocean's crew. Like the original 'Ocean's Eleven', Debbie's heist requires a group made up of people from all walks of life with a variety of criminal skills that will come together to pull off an impossible heist. It's hard not to notice that there aren't any men on the crew, but as Debbie puts it so elegantly, ""Women go unnoticed."" Thus her crew relies on the fact that they will all be constantly underestimated due to their gender, but prove that anything boys can do, girls can do too.'Ocean's 8' relies a lot on the chemistry I mentioned earlier and it's a brilliant decision by Gary Ross. All of the actresses in the film do what they do best, especially Mindy Kaling and Awkwafina who are delightful as the comic relief of the crew. Of course, all the women in the film are delightfully charming and play their parts perfectly, it's a dream cast and like 'Ocean's 'Eleven'' it wouldn't have been possible without such a talented crew coming together. It's just hard not to gush about the performances given and I wouldn't be surprised if audiences got a chance to see these ladies comes together for another film. After all, you have a nine and ten left to film in the Ocean's franchise.It might seem tacky to talk at length about the costuming of such a film given that so often Hollywood is more obsessed with who a woman is wearing than who they actually are. However, given that the heist of the film takes place during the annual Met Gala, an event known for it's gorgeous and adventurous fashion displays, it would be a crime not to say that the dresses the women wear are breathtaking. Not only that, but the fashion choices throughout the film really add to the story overall, just by looking at these characters you can immediately tell what kind of people they are. Like 'Ocean's Eleven', the story is filled with rich and colorful characters and their costuming goes a long way to adding legitimacy to their portrayals.'Ocean's 8' definitely takes a few notes from the original, most notably in the editing. Unfortunately, this is the one place where it falters. The film is filled with quick cuts and short scenes which make it feel rushed at times. Worst of all it tries to embrace the unique transitions that 'Eleven' used from scene to scene. Something that felt very appropriate for Las Vegas, but doesn't make a lot of sense in the Big Apple. It feels like it's trying too hard to grab onto the spirit of 'Eleven', something that is completely unnecessary given the quality of the story and performances at the core of this film.I've compared 'Ocean's 8' to 'Ocean's Eleven' quite a bit in this review because there's no getting around the fact that there was a lot for it to live up to. I'm glad to say that this movie manages to stand on its own two feet far from the shadow of its predecessors. While it might not be quite as good as the 'Eleven', there is no question that it is much, much better than the sequels. I found 'Ocean's 8' to be a delightfully charming night out at the movies. It's filled with plenty of twists that you'll never see coming and is a sly and smart heist film with an all-star cast. I was hoping that it would be a good movie and I'm happy to say it was exactly that. While it's not perfect, I think it's well worth the price of admission and a film that will leave you satisfied and smiling.",Ocean's Eight

It never pretends to be anything else.In Ocean's 8, you get memorably characters, a team that's realistically diverse and interesting. Yet that is not belabored. Nobody tried to make this movie into Norma Rae or Thelma & Louise. They stuck to what makes these movies fun ... the heist and glamor. That's what makes this kind of movie click, and this one does. I'm not sure why this movie is getting dissed. I suspect that if it were the same plot, but with Clooney & Co., it wouldn't be. In fact, this basically is the same as the other Ocean's movies, just played out with women and the heist is jewels instead of casinos. Bullock and Blanchett pull of the same buddy chemistry as Clooney and Pitt, their merry band of co-conspirators are just as smart and worthy, and certainly the casting is a lot more interesting. Let's be honest, with the earlier versions, do you actually remember any of the cast beyond Clooney and Pitt? Maybe the criticism is because the women get to dress better and in a fun twist walk away with their loot in plain site, which a male cast could not pulled off. It was more fun than revealing a bag of money.You don't go to see this kind of movie for anything other than sheer entertainment, and this delivers.",Ocean's Eight

To get up on Sunday morning, write a review, and make sure you let people know about this movie and save them wasting 2 hours of their time and their hard earned money as I did last night. The only suspense and twist of this movie was the high rating this movie has gotten on here at IMDb (6.3). I don't understand how SOME people have given this a 10/10 rating! I was a product of the 80s so I have no idea what a patriarchal society is or what it looks like - I have understood it to be an expression used by people when they need to find excuses for their failure. Also I note that the high rated reviews are mostly from June and July (fake and fishy?). Based on the comments of some of the 10/10 - it is obvious they haven't even watched the movie. All the more recent reviews are, IMHO, more appropriate in the 1-3/10 range.What was the point of making this movie except to cash in on the ""female empowerment"" crowd. And clearly only some people got sucked into that theme to watch this movie AND give it a high review. Were they (director, etc) afraid that if there were some male actors in the team then they would overshadow the females in the movie??The acting is plastic, predictable -> everything about the movie is obvious and boring. I think it is an insult to ""female empowerment"" that takes the complex and beautifully executed plots of the other Ocean franchise and applies it in a child like manner to an all female cast - as though women would not be able to handle a more complex plot. Well there are a couple of males in the plot but they are only around so the women can kick them around (metaphorically speaking).There is a GLARING hole in the plot (well there are MANY) -> where the necklace was last seen on the CCTV and where it was actually found (double face palm). I don't consider this a spoiler. This movie cannot be spoilt by anyone more than it already has by the story line and cast.If you really must watch this movie then I suggest that you wait till it comes out in a medium where you can watch the entire movie in 10 minutes by fastforwarding right through it.

471,nikcoppin,A Drop In The Ocean,5,23 June 2018,"Ocean's EightThe movie started okay, I'll say that much. The Wildcat has certainly developed into quite the con woman crook since keeping the bus going along at a steady 50mph a few years back.In securing her early release from the clink and a couple of amusing little cons immediately after gaining her freedom again, we look like we are in for something quite funny and special.Sadly, from here on in after reuniting with Thor's evil sister Hela, who seems to be doing nothing more than making money swizzing customers in a bar out of their hard-earned money for watered-down beverages, they start recruiting some ne'er-do-wells for an elaborate heist of some seriously expensive diamonds from a museum gala.An elaborate heist that despite some of the best security systems in the world in place, was apparently masterminded from a jail cell with very little contact with the outside world.None of these new recruits seem to be in any way skilled enough to pull off such a daring heist anyway and the chemistry between them is virtually non-existent, as is the humour. Both of which were there in spades in the previous three Ocean's movies.They also seem to be able to convince people to do things rather easily along the way, which is probably down to some lazy writing, but nevertheless comes across as contrived. Things just happened to fall too easily into place to make for the theft of this $150 million diamond Cartier necklace.And as if things weren't flat enough, we are then treated to the appearance of James 'How Is This Guy Famous?' Corden making an appearance as an insurance investigator. Yes, that's right, an insurance investigator. Not the boys in blue from the NYPD or the FBI investigating the theft of one of the most expensive items of jewelry in the world, but a chubby annoying insurance investigator.If his part in proceedings was meant to add some comedy value, it failed just like any other attempts along the way.No real twists and turns, no good laughs, no chemistry, all wrapped up in a nonsensical unbelievable plot. The only real con here would be them convincing more people to part with their hard-earned cash to go and see this poor addition to the Ocean's heisting franchise.It's not like a really awful movie or anything, but if this is where the franchise is heading, let's just hope there's not an Ocean's Nine, or whatever number they decide to call the next one. At least not until they decide properly what they want to do with this new band of nefarious characters.",Ocean's Eight

I love a movie about ""the little guy"" conning ""the big guy"" for some greater meta-emotional motive, but this movie is about the moral less con-artist conning the working class WITHOUT PROPER MOTIVE.
Is this a poor attempt at women's empowerment?? If so, step up, Hollywood. Even if the cast had been all men, the plot would still be sickening.
The cast and entertaining character dynamic are overshadowed by this ridiculous story line that lacks focus.
Also the movie makes it seem really easy to pull this off, and that really threw me off quickly. It's not that easy, folks. I haven't tried, but I know it's not that easy.

Also, I would like to note that I'm not a misogynist. I can enjoy movies with female leads. I really enjoyed Atomic Blonde for instance.I do however believe that female leads should be chosen due to merit and story function. Not just because it's en vogue.So let's just cut to the chase. Yet another successful franchise was abused in order for political gains. Just cast a bunch of ladies, and the sheep will follow. Or not. Ghostbusters already failed, and this wasn't an overwhelming success either.Let's first start on a positive note. Anne Hathaway was amazing. I loved her role, and she delivered an awesome performance. Well done! Unfortunately the rest of the cast completely bombed. I normally really appreciate Sandra Bullock, it's just that she was more like a robot in this movie. It could be the botox, or maybe she's bored with it. Idem dito for Cate Blanchett. Let's not speak of Rihanna, she should just stick to singing. Or to autotuning rather.The story was bland, the heist was bland. There was no chemistry between the cast.

There's another scene where they state that they don't want to recruit any men because apparently men are always the ones get attention, overshadowing the poor woman, but this time it was OK because they don't want any attention drawn to them during their heist. I guess these eight clever woman forgot that one of them is a star guest at the celebrity gala who was going to be wearing the jewels that they were all planning on stealing. Yup, no attention was drawn to them at all. None! All thanks to boycotting those typical attention seeking men.Oh, but wait a minute, they did end up recruiting a male. They recruited Yen, the acrobatic contortionist from the original Ocean's movies to swing from the ceiling stealing many more jewels. Was his share even calculated at the end?

To this reviewer's eyes, it was:
1. suspenseful, 2. clever. 3. and charming!
It IS mostly Ms. Bullock's film! She's as attractive as ever, even though her character is cold and calculating. Also wonderful is Helena Bonham-Carter.
Of course, a viewer expecting explosions, gun fights, and/or chase scenes would be ""bored"" because NONE of these happen. In many ways Ocean's 8 is more like a European film, because it focuses more on the cerebral than the physical.
Other pluses for Ocean's 8:
1) It is a Women's Empowerment film, as every major character is female;
2) It is politically-correct, as the ""gang"" includes several ethnicities (Asian, Black);
3) AND, it revolves around NYC's wonderful Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of this reviewer's favorite places.

I'd recommend this movie for Insomniacs.Lucky for me I was playing on my xbox and was just glancing from time to time at the TV but what I saw showed how hollywood had turned all PC.

No I wouldn't want it like millions others and same for these type of reboots with women as it just doesn't work.

492,nbtempest,Please stop,1,25 August 2019,"Movies have been remade for years, it's been a common remiss method by studios and writers for years to milk a script or character for decades. Rather than create something original, it is most certainly simpler to stand oh the shoulders of proven success and try and grab some dollars from that vantage point.
In this case, it is a remake of a remake. Similar to the theory in multiplicity, when you make a copy of a copy it doesn't come out as bright. Putting together an overall A- cast when all weighed together doesn't equal a successful film when the film itself is a poorly constructed agenda driven guilt film. ""If you don't like this film, you must not believe in women's rights"" and such nonsense.
Rather, how about take the same female cast, and come up with something original, unique, and truly invest in the idea of an all female lead film. If you want these films to do well, then do better at constructing the idea behind them. Ghostbusters, the hustle, what men want, all horrible films dripping with the same indolent creativity.
However, I feel this cry for better films will go unanswered as the film industry continues to question why less people are going to the movies. If your going to shovel poorly duplicated drivel at the public, they'd rather wait for it at home where the snacks are cheaper. So bring on the next batch of these turds, when Sally met Harry, she's not sleeping in Seattle, Ms Schindlers list, or whatever awful ideas are circling the conference room table.",Ocean's Eight

506,evelitan,Amazing movie! Don't mix gender politics with good entertainment.,10,3 December 2018,"Ok guys, so I see I lot of bad reviews for this movies because it was female centric and it lacked in plot development, I do not agree with them (obviously), so I'll ramble about it ahead if you want to continue reading.
Firstly, let's not start going down the ""talent"" lane of this movie. Seriously, the entire cast are amazing actresses and one can hate them as much as they want (there are always going to be displeased people), but one should also be objective (or mature enough) and nobody can question how talented all these women are. The director could've done a better job, but there's always room for growth I guess.
Secondly, of course I am glad they did this female version of the movie, the heist was pretty ingenious, the crew was perfectly selected, they showed some backstories as well... all the while stealing from the MET with an incredible finesse and elegance. And this is one of the important things that is lacking in the male versions.
Of course, I love the fact that women are empowered by this movie and honestly it was about damn time, but don't mix gender politics with good entertainment.
So, in short, I loved the movie and wish it was more than 110 min. (whereas the male versions were longer). It's a light, funny and originally approached crime story that shows a group of marvelous women getting the job done! So, if you haven't seen it, don't rely on reviews posted by people you don't even know their real names, just watch it and enjoy the movie!",Ocean's Eight

Then you take that crutial break to re-evaluate your life and yell at the wall about how your life is in ruins and how of all people this had to happen to you. After about 15 minutes of this self-reflection you collect yourself and it all hits you... there's only one option in order to achieve success and that is to rip it off with one mighty pull... you take a second for preparation... already wincing in agony from the knowledge of what is yet to come but at the same time mentally prepared because you can almost feel the pleasure of a weight being lifted off of you... your body tenses as you prepare to tear with full force... and in a blind fury you focus all of your energy to the power you must put into that one life changing pull.. you rip with all of your might letting out an angry grunt in an effort to mask the pain... that second of spiritual madness goes by and you look down... only to realize that it's still there.... that feeling of complete disappointment is what I assume it would feel like to watch this movie.

508,Scott27,Uneven but Thoroughly Enjoyable,8,23 September 2018,"A unique crime dramedy that fits right in with the original trilogy and stands as another example of female-led films making big profits. ($70m budget/$140m domestic gross - second-highest gross of the franchise)I'm an enormous fan of the Weintraub/Soderbergh Ocean's trilogy, so I came into this trying to balance skepticism with optimism being that it was not shot by ""Peter Andrews."" A great leading cast that balances megastar names with newcomers. Early on, the character building and plot development was uneven, caught in the middle of trying too hard to emulate - and sometimes unnecessarily mirror - the original and find its own style. The sequence establishing Debbie as a fast-talking con artist able to wiggle her way in and out of anything was longer than it needed to be. Subsequent character intros were weak with the exception of Amita (Mindy Kaling) and Tammy (Sarah Paulson). The good character development didn't come in until more than halfway through where it should have been deep into plot. Better late than never, in this case. Few films possess the charm and simplicity to make you root for moral ambiguity like an Ocean's film, and this film was no different. A high-risk, high-reward heist that was complex but easy to follow with a twist that is a signature of the franchise. The details of the heist picks up where character development drags and pulls you through the film at a fast but manageable pace with a satisfying ending. Reuben's (Elliott Gould) cameo was a charming addition while The Amazing Yen's (Qin Shaobo) was a pleasant surprise. Neither were overpowering but provided enough to connect the two halves of the franchise. Selfishly, I would have liked to have seen more of the old crew but leaving it at two was probably the best decision. My greatest disappointment was in the lack of a quality villain on the level of Terry Benedict, The Night Fox and Willy Bank. Claude was a generic and boring patsy who never came close to being an equal on screen with Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock). The previous three films had a tangible sense of the crew having a formidable foe whereas this one did not. However, this did substitute a similar amount of suspense built around questioning whether or not their plan was strong enough to pull it off. I enjoyed James Corden's character quite a bit and I wish he had been in the entire film as a true antagonist. His jovial yet highly intelligent persona simply clicked, as did the reveal that he had been the person who previously took down Danny for the ""Incan Matrimonial Headmasks"" job. Underused, but I hope he comes back in any planned sequels.Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) as the defacto ""mark"" turned co-conspirator was the highlight of the film for me, right down to her final gag at the end of the final sequence. Where this film was no match for the quick-witted humor of the original, Daphne did her best to provide levity. Overall, if you liked any or all of the Weintraub/Soderbergh trilogy, you'll probably like this one, too. I'm holding out hope for another trilogy so that 8-9-10 can line up with 11-12-13, and if the box office numbers are any indication those sequels are likely already in the works. Hopefully they contain stronger character development, a bit more comedy and a stronger ""mark."" Both of those would turn an 8 into a 10 for me.",Ocean's Eight
509,hannahgrahambell,"Familiar structure, fun new characters",5,8 June 2018,"From the first scene, it is clear that Ocean's 8 plans to follow the exact same beats as the original, which may be enough to turn off viewers who are looking for something original. However, the movie picks up as soon as Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) begins recruiting her partners-in-crime for her planned robbery at the Met Gala. Sandra Bullock proves equal to the legacy of George Clooney as the lead, and her team of robbers are impeccably cast. Each one possesses their own particular brand of coolness; iconic actresses Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter delight as much as newer actresses Rihanna and Awkwafina. Anne Hathaway in particular seems to have a lot of fun playing the prima donna Daphen Kluger. Their confident performances give the sense of female empowerment that the film undoubtedly wanted. Unfortunately, the film does not spend enough time with the characters, and instead delves into the comparatively lackluster heist-plot.
Aside from the glamorous dresses and celebrity cameos, the Met Gala is not different enough from previous settings to stand out. Strangely, the level of difficulty of the robbery seems softened for the female version. This may be because audiences know what to expect from previous films, or because the writing is simply lazy. At multiple points, plot holes are hastily stitched together or ignored. On top of this, the movie contains unnecessary flashbacks and explanations, further dulling the excitement. Instead of making good use of the spectacular cast and fun characters, the writers and director feel like they cannot deviate from the formula established by previous Ocean films. This is not only boring, but it also leads to the aforementioned plot holes. 
Viewers who have not seen Ocean's Eleven or who are just looking for some brainless fun will be satisfied, but those hoping for a new spin on the series will be disappointed. It is not the all-female cast that hurts this movie; they are the film's greatest strength. It is the unwillingness to break out of an old creative mould that prevents the female version from being as good as it deserves to be.",Ocean's Eight

I zoned out half way through the movie and I never zone out when a movie is good. It almost felt as if all these actress's were all in one movie because they were all offered really high salaries and whoever created the movie had a vision in their head, hired all these Hollywood actress's the director had idolised and thought that they'd play the characters that he wanted to portray in the best way possible. I really believe that some characters in this movie, did not suit the role that they played and seemed out of place. The plot was simple, and the plan that they carried out had almost 0 flaws, which made it boring. There was no intense moments in my opinion. I felt underwhelmed after watching this movie.

A cracking cast portraying loveable rogues doing improbable but plausible heists with a twist. Unfortunately Oceans 8 has the cast but all else disappoints. From the beginning the crew just seem cold and harsh. You are left either disliking each or feeling nothing for them at all. The actual theft is just daft. A unique lock defeated by a teenage who had looked at the key. Really? And then the necklace of heavy diamond with an unbreakable lock falls off? 
You are left concluding that this film is marketed on female empowerment because it couldn't be promoted to plot, acting or enjoyable viewing.

This had none of the wit, charm, character richness, suspense or action of the original. It was dull, teetering on tedious, and an insult to women.More than anything, what this film screams is that an all-female cast simply cannot achieve what an all-Male one can.

It takes so much from the 2001 Ocean's 11 that I couldn't believe that this was actually made! It literally starts off the exact same way 11 does... Connection the whole time, which is not what anyone needed.The connection between that and Ocean's 11 should be obvious by the title, yet they want to mention Danny Ocean and how Debbie (Sandra Bullock) is related over 5 Bloody times to him, even shows a picture of him...Anyhow the film gets rolling by getting the crew together which is so unbelievable I wont even give that the time of day...Wait I will... Rhianna is the hacker ""9 ball"" BHAHAHAH Give me a break..The idea is simple: Get a rag tag team together and steal some Jewels from the MET Gala. To pull this job off is to make a replica of the real thing...mmmm sounds original. Honestly going into the story is pointless because as i look at my notes while writing this, I flip the pages in disgust...Nothing about the story is new or exciting.The story and characters are so similar it's frustrating. Blanchett is Pitt, Bullock is Clooney, Paulson is Damon etc.. I can't even give this a proper review...Here are just a few cringe moments from the film...-Classic: ""Sorry I was late, there was traffic..."" (IN NEW YORK YOU DON'T SAY!?!)
-Using Tinder.
-The actual use of the 9 ball.
-Banksy reference.
-The tech eyewear device literally takes 5 minutes to scan like a dial tone computer.
-Convinced the Diamond company to use their most expensive item by just speaking french to them...
-Classic: Someone's in the bathroom hearing the main character talk to themselves in the mirror and walks out(without washing hands).
-Painting toe nails while on the mission because apparently that's what girls do...
-They robbed more than you think revile...

-Don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it.
-Play the game like you've got nothing to lose.Upon being paroled, Debbie Ocean immediately steals a bagful of items from a department store and then commits credit card fraud by re-booking a hotel room after the couple have already left.The latter breaks rule number 2, the couple didn't deserve it.

Ocean's Eight in my opinion had me a tad bit confused the whole time and it's just the perfect definition of a fairytale. It was just not that great of a film and totally HOLLYWOOD.

I think it was casted perfectly and writing never fell into any silly one-liners.The last line of the movie was amazing. I love the series and the way they handled it was awesome.

The director has tried to make it look like the Soderberg movies by copying his style, but it didn't work out as well and it looks a bit parodical. There is no excitement in the plot and it falls flat - you cannot feel a proper build up to something and character development is lackluster at best. 
The idea about the heist was decent and there was some good twists, but mostly things seemed forced. Things looked overplanned and you never get the feeling that they might get caught. 
My biggest issue was casting. Sandra Bullock looked artificial in the role and didn't seem to give it her all. Rihanna is completely out of place and I think they didn't give her many lines, because she was just bad at acting. Richard Armitrage was not nasty enough to be disliked and James Corden had no place in that movie - he was just comical. I would have to say that Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter were great and if they got a few more of the roles as right as that the whole movie would have been a different animal. Bottom line is that it is not as charismatic as the George Clooney trilogy.",Ocean's Eight

So I decided to go see this movie for myself and form my own opinion, regardless of the gender of the cast.Honestly, this was a very good movie. I'm not saying it was the greatest movie of all time, but it was very well made. Sandra Bullock played the classic badass criminal mastermind that we love to see in the Ocean's (and other heist) movies. The rest of the supporting cast was also very well chosen and diverse. It had all the classic elements of a Soderbergh film, except that it had female (main) characters. In my opinion, this did not take away from the movie at all. If anything, this only added to it's uniqueness.I wanted to talk a bit about some other aspects of the movie, but this may have included some spoilers, and I honestly want as many people as possible to see this review so that more people can give this movie an honest chance!So go see it, and just enjoy the movie for what it is: an entertaining heist movie!",Ocean's Eight

Unlike those movies, this one didn't bore me one second. The pace is fast, the story stays focused and compact, the jokes are actually funny, there's an eye for detail (Helena Bonham Carter speaking good French, Sandra Bullock being epic while ranting in German), all the actresses are great.

Movies are supposed to be fun, not a political stunt. I don't mind all-female movies at all, as long as they are good, which definitely isn't the case with this movie.

Where Steve Soderbergh and his cohorts carefully crafted a strong story, with snappy dialogue and identifiably quirky and likable characters, this film essentially said ""Let's get some strong female actresses, toss them in a heist film and see what happens"".

575,ddemk,Ocean's Eight Review,7,21 June 2018,"I had tethered expectations heading into the all women reboot of Ocean's 11 entitled Ocean's 8. The reboot stars Sandra Bullock (Speed, Our Time is Crisis) as Debbie Ocean, the sister of the former title character, who is deceased as of this film's beginning (spoiler, sorry). Playing the Brad Pitt character to Bullock's Ocean is Cate Blanchett (Carol, The Aviator). The movie begins as Debbie is released from prison and follows the ""eight"" as they attempt to rob a valuable necklace off the neck of actress Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway) at the annual Met Gala. Celebrity cameos and a strong supporting cast including Rihanna (Bates Motel), Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story), Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club), and Mindy Kaling (The Office), as well as cameos from Oceans vets Elliot Gould and Shabo Qin made for an enjoyable hour and forty minutes.In ranking of Ocean's films I would put this at third best, behind Ocean's 11 and 13, but in front of 12 (Why did Tess pose as Julia Roberts when she was played by Julia Roberts? I don't know the dictionary definition of pretentious but if you asked me to describe it for you I would likely reference this scene). The characters held their own and Bullock and Blanchett have always been strong leading actors, without needing to be put in a ""women's"" movie to prove such. The twists and turns throughout the film were what one who has seen prior Ocean's films would expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.In terms of films which are meant to highlight a demographic traditionally not known for being able to book franchise caliber films, namely women, it wasn't as good as Bridesmaids, but also not as bad as Ghostbusters (why were Murray, Aykroyd, and Hudson in the film but not as their original characters? It literally made no sense). I would rank it about the same as I did Rough Night, which was said to be the women's answer to The Hangover (I'm not sure if I actually heard this or if I'm making it up, if it's the latter then I would like full credit for a stellar analogy). I've read these films are unnecessary and all the counter arguments to them, such as ""if women want to be empowered they should start their own films as opposed to rebooting films carried previously by men"", to which I would strongly disagree. I think we can have both, and I enjoyed watching Bullock/Blanchett/Carter play off each other as I did Clooney/Pitt/Damon in 2001. If a film is good, it is good, and if the film is all women and it is good, all the better. I gave this 7 stars on iMDB and would recommend giving it a look. Thanks for reading.",Ocean's Eight

The movie had a lot of bad cliches, e.g. the enemy can be easily convinced so that the heroes can get what they want, Daphne Kluger joins the other women not for the money but simply because she needs the company, the trope with avoiding the lasers etc. The plot moved too smoothly and I didn't worry too much about the protagonists' fate, since there seemed to be no ups and downs, and all problems were resolved too quickly. It's not that the plot wasn't clever, but it seemed to get too straightforward at some points.

I didn't understand why the asian girl, at the moment of stealing the necklace, didn't switched them on spot (Because the way she was portrayed she was capable of it). And then nobody would notice anything. I cannot believe that the male actor-the one that was framed- didn't notice the diamond in his pocket days after the robbery.

586,cam-88268,Sadly Agree,6,20 July 2019,"I loved the Oceans Trilogy of the early 2000s, which prompted me to go right back to the original with the Rat Pack, which set the tone for the new movies, and, admittedly rolled my eyes when they announced its reboot with all female cast. I don't have a problem with that, the new Ghostbusters was pretty good, and I sorta like the new Doctor Who (I think it's the writers that are getting that wrong!), but I did think ""do we just have to do this with every successful franchise now?Regardless, I did get excited about how they would find a new original plot that could compare with the (admittedly) sometimes confusing, yet amazing intricate storyline's of the previous 3. I like Sandra Bullock, in fact, I liked most of the cast, it was a real gathering of 'fun' artists I thought may make a great team... but then 5 mins in and it just didn't have that same quirky ness and charm of the other Oceans. TBH, Sandra, not any of the others were that likeable, there was no real spark between them.. the banter just didn't feel real, the timing wasn't there, they really just didn't have the charisma needed to pull off what really is a character driven movie.Rhianna just looked like a sullen teenager throughout it.., I don't know if that's what she was going for, but it wasn't endearing at all. Helen, while one of my favourite actors, just looked uncomfortable in her role, like she didn't even quite care. I could go on, but the truth is it just fell flat, and I'm not surprised to see that almost every other review is similar in its opinion.There are a few positives, I laughed at the bubbles in the window, but even then, Helen just didn't pull that scene off.The 'twist' was ok, and loved the cameo, little predictable (come on, pulling a heist in a museum where they mention over and over about the current Newell display, as if they weren't going to do something about that...), but unlike the earlier movies, there just wasn't the 'clues' thrown in along the way that made you go ""aaahhhhh...that's why...."", apart from the submarines of course, which I did watch with some appreciation.Maybe it just lacked that glamour of Las Vegas, and the numerous Cameos and Easter eggs from the previous movies, maybe it just didn't have that chemistry between the team, nor the amazing soundtrack to boost that feeling of 'naughty fun', but, it's watchable... it was following some pretty big footsteps, and like all reboots tried to throw in a bit of nostalgia to keep the fans happy, but in the end, I hope there isn't going to be an Oceans 9..",Ocean's Eight
587,vecda-39097,Better than expected,7,15 October 2018,"I'm an old white-guy who usually has trouble overlooking plot holes in movies. But, even though there were plenty of those, I enjoyed this movie. The ladies costumes were not very interesting to me (but I expect a lot of women enjoyed that part of the movie). I found the pacing even, the overall plot was okay, and nothing happened to make me freak out. Light-hearted entertainment. Check it out.",Ocean's Eight
588,scifi-97852,I really wanted to like this movie,2,5 September 2018,"I love heist movies. Seriously. It's one of my favourite genres. And I went in wanting to like this movie. I loved Oceans 11 (not so much Oceans 12) and Oceans 13 was pretty good too. I loved Logan Lucky. They were fun. They were campy. They were even a bit stupid at times, but they had a weird kind of heart to them that Ocean's Eight was just sorely lacking. Right off the bat, the movie just kind of felt off when the first time you see Sandra Bullock she's in jail and in full makeup. Sandra is a beautiful woman, I think she could have gotten away with not having makeup for a scene or two since she was in jail. I know it's supposed to be a suspension of disbelief, but it's the little things that kind of bring a movie together, and this was an immediate ""wait, how does she look that good?""Cate Blanchett was severely under utilised, starting with the fact she was watering down well vodka. Okay, okay... okay... seriously? She's obviously a very successful business owner and I'm supposed to believe this conman has been reduced to watering down well vodka? Not the good stuff evidently (which if you run a successful club/bar, you're hardly ever using well stuff anyway), but the well vodka. Somehow I almost expected John Taffer to jump out and start lecturing her about bar practices and this to turn into an episode of Bar Rescue. But I digress. The rest of the cast were introduced in similarly uninspiring ways. Helena Bonham Carter was also heavily under utilised, a supposedly frazzled designer who never really seemed to be designing anything and didn't seem all that interested in fashion at all. Anne Hathaway was having fun hamming it up, and good for her because she seemed to be the only one that realised that hamming it up for heist movie is kind of needed. Rihanna was the typical ""hacker"", by that I mean nothing she did would probably ever work. I did love her making a website in a matter of minutes when most programmers, including myself, are barely capable of tying our shoes on a good day. There was a pickpocket, she was in it. I mean that's about as much as I can say about her. Mindy Kaling was the jewel expert, and that's about as much character growth as she got. Sarah Paulson was also in the movie. Yep. The biggest disappointment I can say is in the Oceans movies, either the original with the Rat Pack or the remakes with Soderbergh, you get a sense of the team interacting with each other and their dynamics. That was severely lacking with Oceans Eight. There was no arguing among the women. There were set-backs or quips or sitting around joking with each other. There was no chemistry which is a shame because I have no doubt that these women can have a lot of on set chemistry. The other thing the movie was lacking was a defined villain and defined goal. Danny Ocean in the remake was getting Tess back and sticking it to Terry Benedict. And Andy Garcia did an amazing job at making you hate Terry Benedict. Oceans 13 was about getting back at Willy Bank for hurting Reuben. And Al Pacino plays a good villain, how can not hate the devil (callback). While the ex-boyfriend may have been a villain in this movie (spoiler) he's not really in the movie much. You don't get a sense of him being the bad guy until she tells her story halfway through the movie. And even then, yeah he's dick, he's a bad guy, but he's still not in the movie so he doesn't get to define his own villainy. Andy Garcia and Al Pacino marked their character as bad guys you wanted to hate and see taken down. This guy, who I can't even recall his name, was just kind of a jerk. And unlike in Oceans 11 where Danny is able to really show how bad of a guy Benedict is by getting him to confess that he'd give up Tess for the money, we just see this ex boyfriend get a lawyer. Lastly, and pardon me if this is taking a while, the ""reveals"" aren't too revealing. It was a surprise in both Oceans 11 and Oceans 13, and Logan Lucky even, when you realise just how much work went in behind the scenes that you didn't see. That wasn't really the case here. The case, and here comes the spoils, is that one, Anne Hathaway's character has been working with them for part of the time. And two, they got more than one necklace. Which first, the trailers show Anne working with them, so that wasn't a surprise at all. And second, they talked about getting more than one necklace. So that wasn't a surprise at all. So the big reveal that the women all seemed shocked by was actually kind of anti climactic moment. You can't talk about doing something then say ""nah"" and then do it anyway and then say ""ha! Got ya!"" So, the movie is missing chemistry, characterisation of anyone really, even Debra, a defined villain, and a reveal. Meaning, this movie isn't a heist movie at all. It's just two hours of people walking around, staring at things and using tech and jargon that ultimately leads to no payoff. So kind of like working for Google. Also, really? Killing off Danny? C'mon. What? C'mon.",Ocean's Eight

590,sophiebrooks-75145,Woah!!!,9,31 December 2018,"Upon watching this film, I had never seen the original/previous films related in the franchise. Going in with a clean slate, I fell in love with the plot and the characters, finding myself rooting for the actors to succeed in illegally stealing billions of dollars in a jewelry heist. The emotional power of the film wowed me and left me extremely impacted.
The use of short cuts combined with long continuous shots to show the different characters in their roles in the heist provided an extremely engaging perspective for the audience. Each of the characters have their own backgrounds and roles in helping the whole heist become a success, like piecing a puzzle together that ultimately fits perfectly in place.
The humor intertwined in some tense moments combines to produce a wonderful balance of laughs and nerves throughout the film, making the movie more dynamic and most certainly not boring or predictable.

The first thing that hit me was the density of O13. There happens a lot of things all the time. O8 is slow. Much camera sweeping over beautiful things (too fast though, to really take it in). There is a clear lack of suspense. In O13 there are twists and uncertainties. In O8 things are pretty obvious. In both movies characters are rather shallow, likable and charming. O13 is a single pile of plot holes and impossibilities, while in O8 most of it is actually doable, in a Hollywood kind of way. The acting of Sandra Bullock and the others is good and the costumes at the Gala wonderful, saving the movie. But while the script of O13 is great and the dialog funny and surprising, O8 starts off well and then looses it. The script of O8 is dull. Why? It costs nothing extra, (other than will and talent). There is plenty of space for a surprising point of view or suspenseful trouble. I wonder if there is some not so well hidden sexism and racism in Hollywood. Black Panther is by far the worst of the Marvel Universe Franchise, a pure insult to the African culture in my view. And here we have an all women edition of an otherwise all men franchise and again, it is so much worse than the other 3 movies. As if they simply do not want to make great movies if the heroes are not male and white. I still enjoyed it and would award it with 6 stars for the effort of the actors and designers that lifted themselves above the poor material they were allowed to work with.

The main idea is very much similar to the first Ocean's movie and this makes it very much predictable. So the first half is a replica of the first Ocean's film where you have the main plotter pitching her idea to her partner in crime ( the best friend ) which is followed by making a proper team and a plan to execute the job.

I haven't seen the series prior to this.As a woman, the personality present in the script is very fun for me and I was very behind these characters. A guy may get a bit less out of it.I like the different character types present- I really enjoyed irish accent'd, eccentric-wreck fashion designer Bonham-Carter, and surprisingly very into self-absorbed Hathaway.I like the heist, the steps taken are all enjoyable, and I knew watching that it was more an experience of the sequence rather than a story of character arcs. It's theft; I didn't care for it to be more than that.Has some flaws. I'd ask for more interaction between the 8 as those parts are most fun, and I was crying out for more Mindy Kaling. Blanchett's character really doesn't do anything except drive- I imagine she's the most on the cutting room floor.My main, real gripe is it goes too smoothly- I was waiting for the down-turn mid-heist where something really cocked up, and that felt like an actual writing flaw. James Corden's character is a deeply ineffectual villain. The overly perfect execution denies much expected suspense and fun.It was enjoyable regardless.

It's free.What a mess. There were some thinks I liked. The overhead shots of New York in the opening scenes were impressive. The cameos from the Ocean's 11 guys were cool. That's it .The plot was bad. The heist of the necklace actually came during Ann Hathaway vomiting. They couldn't come up with something imaginative?: There was no camaraderie between the gang members and they didn't convince me in the least they were the specialists the played - hacker , pickpocket, etc. Furthermore,, Mindy Kaling, Aquafina and Rihanna can't act. Though with Rihanna that's probably why she was given many lines.Another problem is the casting. A heist movie is for the most part a guy flick. The women in such a film have to be very attractive to get men to watch it. . like Bond women or Charlie's Angels. The women in Ocean's Eight don't come close to looking like Bond women . The only attractive one is Rihana and she has the smallest part.I'm surprised I managed to watch the whole movie without walking out",Ocean's Eight

Sandra Bullock seems to have morphed into Michael Jackson, and could barely stumble over her lines. Rihanna cannot act. The introduction of James Corden was just the icing on an already dire cake.The plot made very little sense, and lacked any of the charm, intelligence and sense of excitement from the original Ocean films.

668,imnorangabro,A little boring but the heist itself was fun to watch.,5,16 June 2018,"I found the entire movie to be quite boring, all except the heist which i found to be fun to watch unfold.The entire first half of the movie follows the women plotting and planning the heist. I found it quite tedious for whatever reason and what's more is I didn't like the main character at all. I'll be honest, I thought she was a bit of a**hole. I couldn't connect with any of the characters because there was hardly any backstory or anything, no chance to build a sense of likability towards any of the characters apart from the main character and some chick who I think was called Tammy. I think the director focused so much on building it up to the heist and less on character development. However, I did enjoy watching all the bits come together.What made the heist fun to watch was to see everything just happen and the genius of it all. It was like watching dominoes fall almost. I'll be honest here, I barely remember anything about the start of the movie except the main character coming out of prison and something happening in a cafè. I'm not sure if it says more about me or the movie.I give it 5/10. If it focused more on character development and giving us a protagonist that was far more likable, I believe I would be able to give a better score.

669,harinderjeetsinghtiwana,A solid reboot with a spectacular cast and a simple yet elegant plot.,8,6 June 2018,"Got the chance to watch it on Wednesday preview night and I was impressed by the movie more than I thought I would.
When I heard couple of years ago that Ocean's franchise was getting an all female cast reboot I was worried about another ""Ghostbusters"" scenario but I'm glad I was wrong. the whole cast is very good and chemistry between them is fluid, no one looks out of character (even Rihanna).
The plot is pretty simple and resembles the Ocean's 11 with enough material to keep you interested through the whole movie but the movie shines in how brilliantly each character is used from Sandra Bullock to Anne Hathaway. the background score is slick just like other Ocean's movies.
In this period of reboots and franchise with big budgets this movie has its own charm and is not trying to be different just for the sake of it.",Ocean's Eight

I know they have to flush out characters, which I enjoyed but when it came to the heist...lame. not to mention that the guy investigating them wasn't even a real threat.

The connections to previous movies felt like they were just thrown in so they could say it was part of the series. Why/how did Danny die? Either they left it out for a sequel (which makes bringing it up here pointless) or they couldn't think of a way to incorporate it which makes including it a poor writing decision. The only other connection it had to the previous movies were the cameos, which, again felt forced and unrealistic.Overall, this movie lacks the character and spirit of the previous Ocean movies which is it's ultimate downfall. Were this a separate movie, it could just be chalked up as your standard Hollywood mediocrity, but being connected with the Ocean franchise, this is ultimately an unnecessary disappointment.",Ocean's Eight

682,erbcwrite,I'm gay and I like heist movies,9,17 August 2018,"Y'all need to chill out. Honestly. It's not a horrifically bad movie. If it opens with Sandra Bullock conning her way through like 10 minutes of movie time, you can count me in to ignore any plot holes from then on out.
Cause you know what really sucks about most action movies, antihero movies, superhero movies? I get to go from scene to scene of men doing cool stuff. That is what the ocean's series is built on, is it not? Men doing cool stuff. This is what we mean by representation. Maybe this movie isn't the best written, but I am more than happy to spend a few hours of my life watching women be criminals and do cool stuff! Especially if those women are Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina, Sarah Paulson, and Anne Hathaway, who are all very talented and all of whom I am very attracted to! Because that was not an option I had before. If you don't like ocean's 11, you can go find some other male-dominated action-based movie, probably in the same theater at the same time. This is what we've got for this side of the genre. This is what we've got for female-dominated action movies, and it knocked me flat with how much I wanted and needed it. And until we've got a better one (which, subjectively, might be a while because I really liked this one myself), I'm gonna give this one a little gentler expectations.

It has a relatively steady pace so if you're expecting car chasing, bullets flying kind of a heist movie this is not it. Still, it's exciting and intriguing. You'll witness a good friendship between smart and talented women, high sexual tension between Sandra and Cate's characters, funny dialogues and a perfect plan with the occasional tension of something going wrong. Great on-screen chemistry from the actresses, talented cast, good directing. I remember leaving the theatre totally satisfied and filled with positive vibes, I felt the same thing when I watched it again on Netflix the other day. Don't tie it to the other Ocean's movies, consider it an independent one and enjoy a fun ride.

699,scottswain2001,Waste of time,1,30 November 2018,"A feature of the early 2000s Oceans films were some clever plot twists that genuinely surprised, even if they were somewhat far-fetched. The attempted plot twists in this movie are SO far-fetched that I found myself shouting ""oh, come on!"" at the screen. They're just ridiculous.Firstly, why the hell would Anne Hathaway's character, who is supposed to be a major Hollywood star, risk everything she has to join a gang of theives she's never met, in an incredibly over-complex heist, where she is likely to be questioned by highly-trained, high-level law enforcement officers. On top of that, how did the gang even know she was on to them, so had to be recruited? Oh yes, and she also basically prostitutes herself along the way in order to help frame Debbie's ex! Hoorah for feminism in 2018.Secondly, they explicitly say that the various crown jewels on display are too difficult to steal (perhaps due to the 3 foot deep moat?), so focus on the Cartier necklace. Yet, at the end, they've managed to steal all those others too, and apparently that was the plan all along! Why go to these HUGE lengths, when apparently all they needed was a bit of a distraction (why not just set off the fire alarm!) and Sandra Bullock to keep the security guards busy asking where the bathrooms are (is that really the BEST a team of scriptwriters could manage?).All the other minor little plot-holes also compounded to become extremely annoying, too. Need the seating plan of the event? No, problem, just get a job at Vogue magazine that starts tomorrow and involves access to everything to do with this event! Need access for a van. No worries, just tell them they need a vegan caterer and your crew are hired. Need a unique, hi-tech, special magnetic key for the highly secure lock on a 150 million dollar necklace? Oh, that's easy, my little sister will make one in the time it takes to drive over there! FFS, COME ON!!! Oh and also, once you've pulled off this amazing heist, go and pretty much admit it to the insurance investigator, who for some reason, doesn't immediately report you to the police and is satisfied by recovering a fragment of what you stole.Sometimes, one can almost suspend belief (not this much) if the characters and acting are great. But this was far from the case here. Helena B-C was pretty good as her usual quirky oddball type, but Rihanna was wooden and emotionless. Why does Hollywood always assume singers can act?! On the other hand, Cate Blanchett is usually a fantastic actress, but had little to do apart from stand about in a kebab van!Don't pay any money ever to watch this rubbish. In fact, don't waste your time even it it's free. It's frustrating, boring, and charmless.",Ocean's Eight

Maybe ... but - this too is just happening because, reasons. Then the are characters. The main one's are the most interesting but the rest of the crew I kinda forgot. There's no convincing reason for most of them to actually be invested in this.I honestly do not understand how they could screw up that movie so badly. I mean - this actually could have been amazing!

705,dmprnbsn,It was a fun movie,10,22 June 2018,"My 14 y.o. daughter and I saw this movie on our girls night out. I was excited to see another ""Oceans"" movie being a fan of the Sinatra original and the Clooney remake. Sandra Bullock was cool in her part as Debbie and I totally felt the vibe of her character and Danny Ocean being siblings, let alone partners in crime. Cate Blanchett was great as well. I loved all the women in it and they gave it their own spin. Helen Bohman Carter I thought stole the movie with her quirky performance. Is this movie like the original, no, but I like how it pays homage to the its predecessors with two familiar characters from the Clooney version and the Nancy Sinatra song, ""These boots are made for walking"" in reference to the Chairman of the Board, Frank. It is a fun flick with strong and sassy females that complement each other. I just wish that Danny Ocean would of ""popped out"" in a cameo appearance besides just being in a picture frame. Otherwise it was good caper with a twist and if you don't take it to serious a fun movie.",Ocean's Eight
706,spazzmonkey404,I made a Mistake...,6,17 July 2020,"I shouldn't have read the reviews before watching this film. Normally I wouldn't have but it just kinda happened and I had a bad taste in my mouth. It was a fine film. It had all the elements the film needed to be an Ocean's movie but in honesty the attempt to make a new version of the story fell flat for two reasons.
In making a sibling of the ocean family address these matters differently than her father to her brother would have makes this film feel like an organic piece but i would argue that she comes off as a woman scorned and the entire plot plays into tropes of the woman that this film could have defied and broken.And that it greatest appeal of the ocean films is the twist. That while you are watching this happen over here something is happening over there. These movies are close up magic at its best. While the tradition continued in this film, the ""bigger heist"" was concealed to most of the team and only serves to make the audience wonder why we watched a hand off dance for an hour and a half only to use a convenient throwback to the other films and have only really need two people.The star power is incredible and they all shine the way they should. But you could say I have some notes.",Ocean's Eight

It is just frankly pathetic and poor screen writing and another sad attempt of Hollywood's lack of understanding to understand the problem. It is just an embarrassing movie with great actresses which should have picked a better script...,Ocean's Eight
709,granlo_walle,"It's ok, just ok",6,8 November 2018,"Ok, so going into Ocean's Eight I was highly skeptical. Was this just a feminist statement making a movie from a known fairly successful franchise with basically an all female cast. However because of the cast I couldn't be helped but be sucked in after all several of these women are in my opinion worldclass professionals. As one would expect the actors do for the most part deliver.The performance of the actresses is not what makes this movie less enjoyable, it is as it often is the script and there are several points which at least I find myself disliking, but I'll offer three.First is the choice of vindictive personal motive for one of the main characters is a bad one, I didn't like it back in Ocean's Thirteen, but atleast then it seemed somewhat just, and in the first installation which is probably what the writers attempt to mirror the character's motives for their behaviour is more intruiging. In this installation not enough time is given this motive so it feels petty and vindictive as opposed to just which it ought to.Second is that it seems the marketing idea of targeting women have spilled into the script and the writers were shouting girlpower through a giant megaphone all the while maintaining classical gender stereotypes, so the entire script just oozes with hypocrisy.Third is connected to the twist, those who watched and enjoyed Ocean's Eleven remember that you didn't see the twist coming and it was quite well explained and it seemed to fit with the rest of the narrative. This time it doesn't it hardly fits the description of a twist it is more like the writers felt like what they had in the end didn't suffice so they put a little extra on top that they hadn't planned for as they wrote their first draft.These main three points is what I believe keeps the movie from in the subsection OK/Watchable instead of good or possibly great.",Ocean's Eight

So forgive me for expecting the same for this sequel with an all-star female cast. Oh lordy, was I wrong! It's like they decided their target audience was primarily women so they felt they had to dumb this down to a level that an imbecile would believe it was plausible. The very first scene was a portent of what was to come. Sandra Bullock leaving prison after a 5-year incarceration, in the same slinky, beaded, black evening gown that she was arrested in? So she went through a trial in that dress? Was sent to prison in that dress? And no one could bring her an appropriate change of clothes for court? Or for her release? The second scene was a mind-boggling, ridiculous shop-lifting scam that would never work in a million years, but we should believe she pulled it off multiple times, leaving with bags and bags of luxury goods. Ten minutes has elapsed and already I am wondering how anyone with any status in the business agreed to this script. It just got worse from there. I hoped that at the very least the actual scheme to steal a 1.5 million dollar necklace at the Met Gala would be clever and believable. There were so many asinine, unbelievably stupid aspects of it, I can't even list them all. There wasn't even much in the way of the fantastic fashion that these events are known for. Bummer.The cast was entirely wasted on this cringe-worthy drivel, and they seemed to know it. I cannot believe they are making a sequel. I won't go into every plot hole and dumb thing about this film because the only possible reason you might want to sit through this, is so you and your friends can drink shots and yell at the screen, every time something implausible happens.

That was not Ocean's 8.
Take out the slick dialogue and replace it with unfunny jokes and lines that might as well be ""HEY I'M A WOMAN ISN'T THAT QUIRKY"". 
Take out the great camerawork and replace it with bland shots with no interesting positions or targets of focus.
Take out the cheesy but pleasing editing and replace it with the same style, but now used so often in the movie that it has been boiled down to just cheesy
Take out the intriguing performances that gave the characters decent motives for such a terrible scheme, and replace them with bored actors whose characters are just bad without a hint of good. You will now have Ocean's 8.
I find it rather funny that limiting the main cast hasn't made them easier to remember. In fact, I could name over half the original gang from 11, while the one name I remember from 8 is Debbie, only because I found that having another D. Ocean as the lead was a stupid way of connecting it to the original trilogy.
Remember how the boys robbed casinos in Ocean's 11? Well, now they're girls, so they have to steal a necklace. Girls and jewelry go together like boys and casinos, I guess.
And the woman who is supposed to be their enemy randomly joins their team with one of the worst motives I've ever seen in a movie. The motive in question is that she is lonely, and so steals the necklace from herself? I swear I lost half my brain cells from that alone.

It's not as slick and maybe doesn't have the twists and turns we were expecting, but I was surprised that I was entertained by this film. Sandra Bullock doesn't appear to age at all, ever. She did a good job as Debbie, which would be difficult to do with a limited script and minimal character development. The fact nothing is explained about her brother is very bothersome to me. I also rolled my eyes at the heist revolving around a fashion event, since this was an all female cast. I'm not a politically correct person, but I'm apparently more interested in seeing people steal from vaults, apparently.The rest of the cast was fine with what they had to work with too, though I didn't find Anne Hathaway very likable and her sudden introduction into the heist was rather silly to me.

It was refreshing to see a movie where the women's major topic was not men, and there weren't any gratuitous sappy fake romances, no nudity and no violence.I'll be seeing this a second time and maybe a third time, just to revel in the jewelry and costumes (loved Bullock's Met Gala dress!).",Ocean's Eight

There's no doubt they had an impeccable cast and the dialogue writing was not bad either. But you can't make Ocean's Eight only about sass and dressing up for the MET! They barely show them putting the whole heist in place and the whole thing looks superficial.
I don't want to be a sexist but come on, it almost shows that you spoilt the story cause it's hot a bunch of women instead of hot testosterone oozing all over the story!

I get the hashtag whinery about women and equality and opportunity, but none of those are an excuse for the creation of this celluloid blasphemy. This film fails on every level, indeed it creates levels previously unfailed in. Setting aside this project's packaging as an unashamed cash grab, one can only wonder how 2 women the caliber of Sandra and Nicole could stoop so low as to soil themselves in this fetid dumpster drain valve on screen.

Theres really absolutely no acting required in the Movie, just say youre lines and thats it. Almost two hours and literally nothing is happening. Theres no Comedy, no Action, no Drama, no nothing. I know, people will love it only cause of the big Names but this Film really isnt worth watching at all. You just following Sandra Bullock from one Room into another Room, saying few things and thats literally it. Also, there are few things that make you go 'wait what?'. The Necklace weights 6 pounds they say and yet they manage to popp it off the neck of Anne Hathaway without her noticing it? Even after she's done with Puking?

Only 2 cameos from the 2001 Ocean's cast, and they had to be the least expensive of everyone they could have gotten.

Maybe the hype I gave it was too much, because upon waking out of the cinema, though being satisfied with my experience, I couldn't help but think to myself ""That was it?"".Most of my disappoint stemmed from the first half of the movie. I'm not expecting 8 new major characters being introduced in 30 minutes to run like clockwork, but boy was it clunky and unengaging. It's these moments where the usually delightfully wacky scene transitions turn irritating.The movie steadied itself as the actual heist began, and began turning into the fun thriller I was hoping for. The performances by the actresses were pretty solid, with Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter being my favourites. Dare I say it too, but James Corden actually gave a performance I somewhat enjoyed (the brevity of his role notwithstanding).The film held up to its roots technically, with cheesy camera shots, scene transitions and music following the trend. It all flowed fine and when it ended I thought ""That was good"" and left with nothing more. But when I thought a bit deeper I felt a little bummed that all it was was 'good'.Nevertheless, I am glad I chose to see this film and intend to watch plenty more heist films in the future. I probably however won't hope for another Logan Lucky, lest I never get it.",Ocean's Eight

The Cast (and the chemistry between them), 2.) The Direction, and 3.) The Plot. ""Oceans 8"" is basically about a group of women, all from different backgrounds and skill sets, who work together to rob one of the most popular galas of all time. The movie's script added wit and intelligence, and the way the actresses portrayed their characters were nearly perfect to a tee. I feel as though a lot of people were expecting some action packed movie, but that is not what this is. This movie is about a woman's plan and how she set it into motion. It was very much worth the watch, and I'd go see it many more times if I have the chance.",Ocean's Eight

I love the other Ocean's movies, and didn't think that this looked too shabby. I was quite amazed by the cast, and tried to not think of this as another bad remake with women to create equality (this is not meant in a bad way, I would love better roles for women in movies, but maybe something more original than remakes) Anyways, sitting in the cinema I had a number of mixed feelings. First of all, the story was vague and badly written. Things felt like they were all over the place, and certain scenes made no sense whatsoever and could've been scrapped. Not to even mention part of the ending, only working as a way to make the robbery ""cooler"". The characters had potential, but were all quite dull and not interesting at all. I didn't care whether they succeeded or not. Some camera shots seemed very amateur-like and bad, and this made me quite sad considering how greatly shot the earlier movies were. To summarize, this movie is far from it's predecessors in quality, I found some parts humorizing, and I'm happy they at least didn't use too many character stereotypes, as I was afraid they would. Couple good jokes, but that's it for this movie.",Ocean's Eight
819,thegentlenesspact,Never a clever moment.,4,1 November 2018,"It's really bad. With no exaggeration, I think this script was written by an algorithm, and that algorithm, in turn, may have been written by aliens who have never met a real human (some exaggeration). The jokes(?) are, at best, tangental to humor. It's as though they relied on faint memories of successful quips others have used, yet they forgot the context and delivery that made them funny in the first place. I don't know who the target audience is, but the filmakers think you're idiots and need every detail explained twice. Spoilers shouldn't matter, but, just in case, I'll come up with a spoiler-free analog. Imagine one of the thieves shows up with an industrial drill and tells the others, ""I'm going to use this to drill into the vault."" It really is that condescending. I also hated the soundtrack. My guess is they realized the characters have no character, so they kept demanding ""more character"" in the music. ""For some reason, our movie isn't fun. Put more fun in the music.""

823,emma_jadex,It was everything it needed to be.,7,30 June 2018,"I feel that so many people expected so much of this film because of the fact that it was an all female cast, but can I just ask why does it need to be an absolute masterpiece? I can guarantee some of the all male cast films we have seen for the past decade have definitely not been masterpieces. Why couldn't these women just make a really enjoyable fun movie? It just shows the pressure that the media and the spectator put on women and that they are expected to do twice as much as men to get the same recognition.My initial thoughts on the movie were: Loved it. When is the sequel? Why is there not more? Blanchett and Bullock would make a killer couple. Rihanna in that red dress. Anne freaking Hathaway. Mindy Kaling needs to be in more movies. Paulson is so damn good.The first scenes of the movie where we are introduced to Debbie Ocean (Bullock) are great. I especially loved one of the 'cons' she pulled which including the stealing of multiple items in the most clever way. Are we sure Bullock is not actually a con woman in her spare time? Because she definitely could pull it off.I also appreciate that unlike most male centered films, this one did not need half naked women parading around for no reason at all. However Richard Armitage is always nice to look at and listen to.Also why is everyone so shocked by Anne Hathaway's performance? Have you not seen Les Mis? Interstellar? One Day? Love and Other Drugs? ANYTHING????? That woman can steal a scene.To conclude this review (if you can even call it that, more of a opinion), I will ask, why is there not more of these movies? Like honestly, as amazing as it is to have an all female led film, why does it have to be so out of the ordinary? It shouldn't be. This should be the norm. Women are just as talented as men and as the box office shows, they can bring in just as many viewers.

Though the real gems new to the overly popular franchise were the perfect pairing of Ann Hathaway and Helena Botham Carter. Hathaway, my personal modern day Julia Roberts, proves again how versatile of an actor she truly is. Receiving most of the film's biggest laughs from the audience in attendance. Carter is just pure genius ! And her few solo scenes with Mindy Kaling had us begging for more. Sandy Bullocks portrayal of the leader of the pact was surprisingly laid back and chill. Still proving to be current at the box office and on the top of her game. Rihanna and Awkwafina shined along side their A-list costars. Both playing the more hipster roles of the group. The Pop Star even got a round of applause when her character switched up her usual get-up for a Met Gala look. The last time a professional singer got an applause in a movie, she was being kicked down a flight of stairs by Ali Larter. Cate Blanchett and Sara Paulson are just Hollywood gold.

Biggest problems for me were a mediocre plot and that I wanted to see more of everyone than we actually saw.People seem to be giving this a 1 for no descernable reason (besides maybe sexism? or a lack of understanding of how a 1-10 scale works?). One review even said ""This is not a horrible movie"" in the review but still gave it a 1. That's not how that works yo. A few others specifically use the trend of gender-swapping movies to bash this one without actually grading the movie itself besides saying it's ""bad""The people who give it 6's are coming from more of the right place. Hell, even the people giving it 3's are better than the 2's and 1's. You can dislike the movie, that's fine.

This being said, I obviously wasn't going to tell them how much was wrong with this movie, hence, I'm now writing this review.Let's start with the product placement. I realize that most movies have product placement, but it seems so commonplace that you don't even realize that the neon bud light sign in a bar was purposefully placed there. Yet there was a scene in Oceans 8 that came out of no where, had no implication towards the story (other than a 5 second end movie scene) and really just irked me. I paid 36$ to see an ad for Tinder?! Jesus Christ, if I wanted to see ads for online dating, Id drive down the street and look at the ""singles atlanta"" Pickett signs that are posted every 500 feet.

It's like any of the other Ocean's movies except it isn't as entertaining and lacks any sort of energy. The women aren't even dressed well enough to be eye candy.

It's not derivative, even though it pays homage to the original Ocean's trilogy, from the opening scene. But we realize right away that even though Debbie is as big a con as brother Danny, she's her own person.
While there are similarities to the other movies, most are common to the genre at large.
I loved the ambiguity about Danny's fate. I love the Debbie's and Daphne's character development- the latter being a bit of a surprise. I love the twists, and the drop-ins by unexpected characters.
Just as Charlie Croker would have made John bridger proud with The Italian Job, Debbie would have made Danny proud with this job. Even if she didn't keep it simple.
It's chock full of humor, including homage to the actresses and their past work. One reference to The Princess Diaries made my wife LOL, and we're still discussing whether the word was ""eagle"" as in the original, or ""ego"" which is even funnier. Speaking of which, Anne Hathaway is really funny as an egotistical bad actress.",Ocean's Eight

It lacks everything that made first Ocean's Eleven great. There's absolutely no chemistry between the actors that make up this female driven charade. Sure, it looks like the women had a great time doing this movie when they were doing their interview rounds trying to sell this debacle. I just don't think they ever sat down to see what a lackluster movie they were selling. This movie is full of talent, but absolutely none of it shows up in the final product. I was really hoping this would work, cause who wouldn't want women succeed. I would definitely recommend a pass on this unless you plan to just let the movie play in the background and ignore it. On a side note, whoever did Sandra Bullock's botox injections should be shot death, she looks ridiculous.

I had great hopes for this film as a big fan of the prior Oceans films especially 11 and 13 but this film fails to live up to the crime, suspense filled movies of the past films. Sandra was a perfect fit and still feel she is for a future project but she was to big for a heist that was not big enough. The heist wasn't big enough, the suspense wasn't high enough and the depth of the characters being developed wasn't done well enough. Everything was in place for a great female lead version of the great Oceans franchise but it just fell short. I'd love to see a second try at this and hope the script can deliver with more for such a great cast and franchise. I give Ocean's Eight a 4.3/10 due to a cast that is star filled and it kept me somewhat entertained the first time watching it but would not have interest to see it again.",Ocean's Eight

847,kimdahui,so-so movie,3,18 June 2018,"I watched Ocean's 8 trailer when I went to watch Deadpool in Orem cinemark. It made me really to watch it because of Rihanna. She is my star. So I watched ocean's 8 last week. This movie genre is action/adventure or suspense/thriller. This movie is a bit same movie, one of favorite Korean suspense movies which is called 'The thieves' it came out in 2012 also it is a crime movie. The beginning of both movie were a main character came out from the jail and stole a precious jewel. But I disappointed when I watched Ocean's 8 because I could not find any tension and urgency in that movie. They easily gather people, made a plan and stole a jewel successfully which is $150,000,000 without any obstacles. I think throughout the movie has tightly easinesses. During the movie, the most part that I expected was stealing scene. This scene is shown in the trailer already which was not that interested. Honestly I would like to recommend to watch The thieves because for that movie that I recommended has details, tensions while an leader looks for member for stealing a jewel, and has many obstacles while they are on the work. I feel bad to compare with a movie, Now you see me, but this movie is a way better than Ocean's 8.
One thing that I can tell is all the actresses in that movie are awesome; Anne Hathaway's different acting that she normally does, Cate Blanchett's girl crush, and cameo, they are all fun while I watched it. It was excellent for casting those actresses but not in scenarios and directions. However, unlike previous crime movies, I think that it is okay to watch that all the leading actors as women, and to watch that they are led by women as a center.
Finally, I hope this movie will be a good starting point for the future of the film industry.",Ocean's Eight

850,sophiafrudd,As someone who doesn't watch the Oceans Franchise...,6,9 April 2020,"I'm not really one to care too much about an overall premise of heist movies, but rather how they exhibition it.
The cinematography was okay, but wasn't as consistent as I hoped and honestly gave me flashbacks to when kids were using Video Star and iMovie transitions.
The crosscutting-shots of several scenes overlapping at the start were promising, but it didn't really adhere to any narrative purposes, deeming it just oddly placed and kind of useless.The characters were either desaturated or too exasperating, Which could actually work in Oceans 8's favour as I think they favour one common feminist value, that women are ""diverse, and all of different tones"", which accentuates and corresponds to their multicultural cast - But with Oceans 8 bland, generic and often too commercial approach has given us nothing to learn about the characters - Little to no character development, and a lack of intimacy that would make Ocean's 8 drivel of a storyline (a bit more with the presentation of it) more interesting and would give atleast the audience an origin of care. Ocean's 8 is something of a disappointment, a shallow shell of what would be an interesting set of characters, and even more with it's story-line that doesn't give anything new or it's ""flare"" that it inconsistently shows us.One particular thing that contrasts with my opinion above is that I liked the sense of the ""film living beyond the viewer"" - One primary example of this is the introducing of the characters - It's abrupt and doesn't give any footage to further insinuate the characters backstory, or where they came from. It's straight to the point, as if (in the story-line) they don't have time for it. (The exception maybe being Tammy as she keeps on saying she ""doesn't do it"" anymore, but furthermore it isn't in depth).Some may say it's messy or lazy, but It really gives a sense of it being fast paced. It also feels like it is living beyond, as it makes it inherently obvious that Debbie is Daniel's sister that served 5 years, therefore leaving time to think of what happened in those 5 years - it is made obvious why she was put there, but not how she was actually ""planning the heist"", for example. (I still can't stand upright with this point as I haven't watched any of the other films.)But this doesn't excuse the intimacy that would make for a much better film (maybe making us care for the characters, would make us care for the story), as the premises execution isn't as interesting as I would've hoped.Some plot holes do occur, as Tammy somehow has a ""device"" that can print anything that a seemingly easy-to-get high-tech glasses scans for - and to say quite comically.Although this film wasn't the worst, it definitely wasn't the best.
This feels more like a comic strip blurb, rather than an actual movie. It had potential stylistically, but just wasn't consistent and didn't adhere to narrative purposes.",Ocean's Eight

Especially the whole MET Circus. And the actresses where all great, no doubt about it. But it was just all too perfect and inhumane. There was literally no emotion. Sandra Bullock never ever smiled once and her face looked like a robot. I was rather shocked what plastic surgery does to people. Do actors really think the public wants them to look like this? Also the make up was rather intense. Nobody is perfect and it is much more appealing to see a real person, with lines and natural smiles and emotions, instead of these plastic faces. All in all a plastic film to me. Very well done, perfect in every way, but no llife, no emotion and definately no feminity in this one. More like woman trying to imitate men.",Ocean's Eight

We got about halfway through it and turned it off it was so boring. Maybe kids will find this fun so I gave it an extra star for the kids.

862,shieldsk-66314,My New Favorite,9,13 March 2019,"Ocean's 8 had a lot to live up to, and it still exceeded all of my expectations. When I first heard that another Ocean movie was being produced, I was a little nervous. How could it possibly measure up to it's prequels? These movies were some of the best I'd ever seen. No other movie was quite like them.
I remember the first time I watched Ocean's 11. My family was having a movie night, but we couldn't agree on what to watch. Everyone was getting frustrated until my dad suggested Ocean's 11. Before then, I had never heard of the Ocean movies. When he told us what it was about, we all agreed to watch it. And it was amazing. I can't tell you how many times I've rewatched it since then. All of this just to say that I have a lot of happy memories associated with Ocean's 11.
Anyways, I was sure that Ocean's 8 would (sadly) be a flop. And then I saw the cast. There are so many amazing actresses in this movie that I can't decide who to list first! Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Bird Box), Anne Hathaway (Princess Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada), Rihanna (Annie, Home), Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland), Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians, Dude), Mindy Kaling (Mindy Project, The Office), not to mention that it was set during the Met Gala, so you can see all of your favorite celebs that might not necessarily act. After actually watching the movie, I was blown away, and I wasn't the only one. Ocean's 8 made $41.5 million opening weekend, which is more than any other Ocean's movie.
Another reason I loved this movie was because of the great mix of genres. While the plot of all the Ocean movies are very similar, with this new cast, the movies were very different. The gang has a sarcastic and comedic attitude throughout the entire movie, which makes everything much more entertaining. Obviously, this is an action movie because their main objective is to steal a necklace, but there is also a little bit of drama when a certain ex-boyfriend shows up. This movie is somewhat of a thriller, but it's not at all scary. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the other Ocean movies or who loves a good heist movie.",Ocean's Eight

Easiest way to break a unique magnetic lock? Introduce a teenage girl from the hood who is a ""genius"" and just knows what it is and how to just disable it with some ultra hip words. OK... let's assume you even buy into that nonsense...An even more stupid moment, is when the jeweler, disguised as a dishwasher, gets hold of the necklace she goes into a utility room and starts cutting it into pieces with a wire cutter. Why didn't they just do that to get it of the neck of the wearer?During the caper, the priceless and most valuable necklace in the world just some how is presumed to have ""fallen off"" - yet no one seriously questions how absolutely impossible this would or should be.This could be the LAZIEST script writing ever.

Fantastic ensemble cast, brilliant characters, great comedy, great action and like all good heist films there's plenty of details you have to pay attention to. Is there a word for female bromance because Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett were perfect together in every scene, I couldn't take my eyes off them. It doesn't take itself too seriously which really worked for me. If you want there to be realistic action at all times and serious stakes/tension maybe give it a miss, but if you want to be engrossed and entertained with 2 hours of well scripted, popcorn fun, I can highly recommend it.My main criticism is the marketing - there was no need to make this an Ocean's film. There's only a brief mention that a character is the sister of Frank Ocean, and beyond that they're all new fully independent characters so they could have made this film as a stand-alone and not lost a thing. I guess that's the (risk-averse) Hollywood marketing machine for you. This will have unfortunately put off a lot of people, who hated the all female Ghostbusters (that in my opinion was lazy) and might explain some of the negative reviews.

The casting director did their job!!! Anne Hathaway as Daphne Kluger is an amazing choice. Her stature and whole style is perfect for the character. Sandra Bolluk as Debbie Ocean is another respectable choice.The Plot:
(Spoilers)
Oceans 8 is the follow up after the Oceans Trilogy. But which an, obvious, feminine take. A large portion of the production crew is female as well as all the cast leads. The theft of the Met Gala creates an interesting and unpredictable difference that separates O8 from the rest of the Oceans Movies.The Characters:
Almost every character in the show is enjoyable to watch! Lou's (Kate Blanchette) sassy quips are enjoyable. The calm demeanor and smug attitude of Debbie parallel the rapid tone of the movie. Even the return of Yen is a fun callback to the other Ocean movies. Even the other characters are likable.As a woman, this movie is empowering.In the end, Oceans 8 never gets old.

The film is not as thrilling as the heist that I expected, however, it's not too boring, the film flows exceptionally, it's not too intense, it's easy to watch and understand. Sadly, the plot is predictable and has the twist and end like the other Ocean's series, nothing could blow your mind on this Ocean's Eight. The movie leads by eight actresses with remarkable characters, each character has their areas of expertise. The cast is most of Hollywood and oscar-winning actresses such as Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham. Surprisingly, the unexpecting cooperation of Anne Hathway at the end.

Inspired by her late brother Danny, Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) assembles a team of multi-talented women to pull off a jewellery heist at the New York Met Gala.Debbie is the first character we're introduced to, masterfully manipulating the parole board to secure her release after five years in prison. I'm hooked on Debbie right away; she's a determined, mischievous genius who will take what she wants, laws be damned, and I can't wait for the ruckus she's going to cause on the outside.Upon her release, Debbie reconnects with her long-time partner-in-crime, Lou (Cate Blanchett). The on-screen chemistry between Debbie and Lou is fantastic. They know each other inside out, with the kind of close friendship where they are starkly honest and tease each other with no love lost. They adore each other, and they've been through some shit together to create this unbreakable bond. Adding to the satisfaction of watching a beautiful on-screen friendship, it's refreshing to watch a film where the main two women are partners rather than rivals.Once reunited, Debbie and Lou get to work recruiting their perfect heist team; fashion designer Rose (Helena Bonham-Carter), hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna), stay-at-home mum Tammy (Sarah Paulson), con artist Constance (Awkwafina) and jewellery maker Amita (Mindy Kaling). Their target - a $150 million diamond Cartier necklace on loan to celebrity Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway). Although there's little room for character development with an ensemble cast, they're entertaining to watch as a team and play their individual parts well. I'm particularly drawn to Bonham-Carter's portrayal of the eccentric, anxiety-ridden Irish fashion designer slipping into irrelevancy and Hathaway's spot-on, spoilt prima donna. My only reservation is with Rihanna's pot-smoking, Rastafarian character Nine Ball, which feels like it's bordering on racist caricature.The writers address the heist team being all-female only once, with a satisfying little wink to the audience during the team selection scene. Lou suggests recruiting a man and Debbie delivers what is probably my favourite line in the whole film; ""A 'him' gets noticed, a 'her' get's ignored, and for once we want to be ignored."" I'm relieved the writers only address the team's gender briefly. I was afraid it could be made a recurring, patronising gimmick (omg, guess what guys... they're LADIES!) - as if they are pulling off a heist despite their gender. But thankfully that's not the case; the characters are bomb-ass, professional cons and their gender doesn't matter.On top of the already star-studded main cast, Ocean's 8 is packed with cameos. A long list of celebs including Heidi Klum and Kim Kardashian play themselves attending the Met Gala, while others have character cameos. I'm not sold on doing both in the same film. Self-cameos suggest the plot happens in our world, while character cameos seem to contradict that, so Ocean's 8 plays out in an in-between land where Serena Williams exists but James Corden doesn't. But perhaps I'm irked because James Corden doesn't really play a character, he is just himself by a different name, working as an insurance investigator rather than a comedian. With the heist being set at the Met Gala, it's reasonable to expect a parade of outrageous costumes that the A-list party is famous for in the real world. I was disappointed that the costume styling ended up more in line with Hollywood glam than WTF glam. Maybe the costume budget was drained from hiring such a huge, high-profile cast. Like any good heist film, the story has a riveting series of twists and turns as the crims try to outwit every obstacle and security measure. It never goes seamlessly to plan, but unfortunately the curve balls in Ocean's 8 were far too easily solved for my liking. Part of the fun of heist films is watching the crooks think on their feet to resolve impossible situations, and the strife was lacking in this one. Call me a sadist, but I want the characters to struggle - it makes the resolution all the more satisfying.Despite some flaws, Ocean's 8 is a consistently fun watch and a worthy addition to the Ocean's franchise. Go see it for an ideal night out with your heist team, or if you need some inspiration to steal from the cinema's overpriced candy bar.",Ocean's Eight

878,diegofavengers,The return of the oceans,7,27 October 2021,"Oceans 8 could be seen like one of the thousands of movies that have been realesed last years with the feminist message inside of it.And it is that movie but the writers took it to another level treating it as movie and later like a message. Not like the most recently movies of this style that treat this kind of films first as a message and later than a movie.Having this clear then we could talk about it, the movie have a great cast but in their tried to give all her a good time in camera, the unique that have it is sandra bullock, this is the most comun problem of movies with a lot of great actors.In the other aspects of the movie is very well, have good sound, soundtrack, the way it is write is good, the photography is normal. And the argument and characters unfold very good.To finish i can say that it is a good movie, with good actress and argument.

This is the BEST version of an all-female heist that you can put out for the ""modern times""?I TRULY went in with a positive outlook, hoping the best for it, and wishing that the IMDB review was wrong. I did NOT watch any trailers and thus went in BLIND --except for knowing its score on IMDB of course. OCEAN'S EIGHT has got to be one of the WORST movies I have seen in a VERY long time! They say ""it's about time"" in reference to an ""alternative fact"" that an all-female Heist film has never been tried before. What!? ""SET IT OFF"" was made in 1996! And I STILL love that filmSET IT OFF was a MUCH BETTER EXECUTED all-female Heist film, and I cared about the characters' well-being. There is absolutely NO ONE in OCEAN'S EIGHT that I cared about.Except for Sandra Bullock's ""Debbie Ocean"", and Rihanna's ""9 Ball"", I seriously cannot even remember the characters names! And I just watched it! ***spoiler alert***
It was SLOW as ALL hell! Devoid of anything resembling action. It was filled with plot hole after plot hole, there was NO tension, NO danger, NO drama, almost ZERO HUMOUR, incoherent speech DESPERATELY trying to be passed off as smart, a detective guy was awkwardly inserted --like an afterthought, and for its Cardinal SIN: THERE WAS NO ANTAGONIST! In a barely related event, Rihanna's teen sister (who laughably HAS TO help out with the heist in a cursor capacity) mysteriously claims that she was chased by a cop --with no explanation why. It would have been MUCH BETTER to SEE that chase than to HEAR about it. Hell, they even needed a MAN from the original OCEAN'S ELEVEN movie (in the end-explanation) to climb around to help them steal the OTHER necklaces. In that regard, it should be named ""OCEAN'S EIGHT --PLUS ONE"".No sir. This film needed holy water.",Ocean's Eight

885,jahoog,It was below par,3,18 June 2018,"Having loved the dialog, chemistry, twists and turns of Oceans 11 and 13, I had high hopes for Oceans 8. However, I fell asleep about 30 minutes in and woke up just before the heist. There are many forced laughs, several plot stretches, and rushed writing.The heist itself was a decent concept, but some issues with the script:
why would a necklace with a special magnet just ""fall off"" while running and end up in a pool of water. Oh yeah, and we made a replica of the necklace, why don't we put it around Daphne's neck after removing the real one? No, we'll throw it in the pool of water.Obvious foreshadowing - Daphne looking at Rose's phone, Debbie planting something on her estranged boyfriendThe magnet: uh oh, that's a problem. Oh wait I got a friend and she figured it out in like 2 minutes. No biggie.Reuben shows up. He says a few lines. Reuben leaves.Danny is dead. Really?The movie never really picks up until the heist sequence. Hence my unexpected nap.Now the Good:
Awkwafina (Constance) - really funny and probably the best character presenceRihanna (Nine Ball) - I forgot that was Rihanna. She did a good job with her character.Anne Hathaway (Daphne) - pretty much steals the show in my opinion. She was the most dynamic characterYen shows up. That was cool.Daphne's first scene. Much like Danny's first scene in O' 11The Bad:
Lue (Cate Blanchett) - didn't even realize this was Cate Blanchett. She got a horrible script and her character and relationship with Daphne really didn't go anywhere. I'm thinking a Drew Barrymore might have been a better fit.The dialog - a few ""ha ha "" lines but nothing like the dialog between O'11 characters. Remember ""a Boeski, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros and a Leon Spinks, not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. "" - nothing even close in this script.character development - Sandra Bullock was just ok, but didn't show her star power. Paulson and Kaling could have been substituted with anyone else. Carter was quirky but forgettable. There was just not enough interaction between the characters to feel for them.All in all, it was a good idea but one of those ""I should have listened to the reviews"" mistakes.

The typical style of the oceans films was that you had no idea what was going on in the film till the end, and that there would be things that look like mistakes that would'nt be. There really wasn't any of that in this film, things happened and then it was over. The actresses were all reasonably good, however their weren't personally any stand out performers.

What could you possibly wish for more? I personally liked the fact that they spent more time on preparing the heist and explaining how are they going to do it instead of showing every second of it right away. Don't compare this movie to the previous Oceans movies, I know it's the title itself that makes the connection, but forget about it and just try to enjoy this movie as its own. They showed every single detail of the heist and the detailed planning that Debbie was doing while in jail. She forms a group of powerful women and they do their jobs perfectly.

Sometimes critical dialogue was buried in the sound mix, which is a complaint I have about a LOT of movies these days. (Hollywood, please have one person who has NOT read the script listen to your whole movie to insure that the dialogue is easy enough to hear over all the surround sound effects. If the sound editor already knows what the character is saying, then he will hear it clearly while mixing, and the rest of us will not. And yes, I have cranked up the channel level on my center channel speaker to enhance dialogue in movies like this.) Anyway, some of the complaints about this movie might be because the ideas and plot move very quickly. My partner could not keep up with the fast pace.

And Anne Hathaway had me rolling as an over-the-top prima Donna actress. The movie follows pretty much the same formula as the previous Ocean's with minimal set-up for the zany characters, a lot of planning, the heist itself, and the fallout with a twist at the end. I think a lot of the problems that people (men especially) had with this film was that none of the women are seen to be in relationships, with the exception of Bullock's ex. Even the mom has only one mention of her husband. Most people aren't used to women NOT being in some sort of relationship in movies, but I found it relaxing and refreshing. In the other Ocean's there were very minimal relationships, of course the exception being Danny, because the movie is about a heist!! I did not especially the ending and loved the way these women worked together. Someone complained that the cast didn't have enough ""chemistry or charm"" but I felt that this was an excellent portrayal of women coming together to work and becoming friends along the wa, without a gratuitous ""bonding over brunch"" scene.

Blame could also be put on the theater where I watched the movie at, where the auditoriums didn't have good surround sound so I could hardly hear what the characters were saying most of the time.However, upon rewatching the film (after watching the original Ocean's movies), I would definitely rank this entry (in my personal opinion) as one of the better films I've watched from the franchise. Compared to the Ocean's Trilogy movies, I felt like there was a bit more humor here and the pacing was decent at most.

This movie offers no conflict and the script feels like it has no challenges for the characters. They get along with each other right away. They aren't tested. There isn't even a propper third act or climax at the end of the second act. Usually, the characters are down at the end of act too, wondering wether they were doing the right thing or not. Just any conflict. But not here. They actually suceed at the end of act 2 which makes the third act incredibly boring. There is nothing to achieve. Any time there was a potential conflict they ere able to fix the problem at ease. There wasn't a single moment in the movie where Bullocks character had no idea what to idea. Her plan worked out perfectly. There is no character development at all, they all do what they do without asking questions or having a different opinion on what they do. There really should have been some drama, unexpected turns and such.Those scenes were really annoying in my opinion:Helena Bonham Carters character finds out that the necklace can only be taken away with a special magnet. She already figured out during their test phase. They were able to find a solution right away! This would have been more exciting if it would have happened during the real act. But then they were able to take it off and trick the guardians without any problem.Anne Hathaways character was the only one who was involved without knowing it. That's what the characters and the audience members believed. But she finds out. But instead of becoming a problem for Bullock and Co. she joins them right away. Again, no conflict, they always know how to handle the situation.The waiter who gets the necklace without knowing it... He puts it down on a table. Sarah Paulson gets inside the floor and says: ""Go back to work"". Problem solved after no more than 20 seconds.I think the cast was wasted.

The cast are great, the twists are great and it is always fun (as heist movies should be!), the energy this film exudes is a joy to behold. There are a few pacing issues, and the beats do echoe that of ""11"" a little too closely at times, but overall this instalment works not only as a sequel/spinoff but also as a standalone film.

Sure, but not any more or less than in previous the movies. The cast was well balanced, with Blanchett and Bullock having and especially great dynamic.This movie isn't bad by any means, and I think a lot of the reviews that are extremely negative on here and calling it another ""Ghostbusters"" are thinly veiled excuses to hate on reboots(if you can call it that) or movies with women. It wasn't a bad movie. It just wasn't. And I have seen plenty of bad movies to know. Movies that are different... are not inherently bad. I'm honestly curious if this movie was exactly the same except with men, would they still be rating it 2s and 1s? Interesting to think about how many comments on here are the same trolls from before.

Having seen Ocean's 11 Which was the best of the original trilogy I well maybe this could be the new Ocean's 11 cuz usually the 1st movie is the best. But when it came to this hell and no was all I can say about this poor excuse of a movie. It just felt dry bland and boring. The storyline was written half fast and the dialogue was absolute trash.

Those movies are all the same any way and this one didn't deviate from that same boring archetype.They robbed people. They got revenge on the ones who wronged them. Humor was splattered in randomly. There was a twist at the end. If you were looking for any oceans movie to blow you away all female cast or not you should reevaluate your life because you're a boring person.

968,locomarjfs,"Nice, but not as good as Ocean's Eleven",7,7 April 2019,"This movie is certainly entertaining and fun to watch. The idea of having an all-female cast is one of the latest attempts of Hollywood to promote gender equality (although, I personally think that they should make more original movies with a female cast rather than recycling existing ones). However, there are flaws in the script and the dialogue that doesn't make you feel like you are watching an Ocean's series movie.First of all, the necklace. If you were Cartier and had to lend a $150 million jewel, you would have someone to make sure that the necklace being used was always the authentic one. Instead, Tammy just dropped the fake one on the water, pretended to have found it and everyone just acted normal as if nothing happened, despite there were designated guards, whose only job was to keep an eye on the necklace at all times.The dialogue is a bit poor and obvious when Debbie and Lou explain how they stole the rest of the jewels. The script could have been more creative and sutil instead of narrating exactly how the robbery was done.Two characters not well constructed are Reuben and John Frazier. Reuben here is a totally different guy, not the daring, eccentric guy we are used to from the previous movies. And despite I love James Corden, his acting here is forced, trying to be funny but not really accomplishing it. As a bonus: Cate Blanchett doesn't feel natural with the character of Lou - tale Rihanna, for reference.Anyways, besides these flaws, I had a good time watching this movie. It excites me that it let the door open for another, and the fact that the Ocean's franchise is not over yet.",Ocean's Eight

Everything concerning the heist was clever written, and the characters really all had a potent role in the whole proces. Now, i would like to both adres the positives and the negatives concerning the plot, script and overall vibe. So beware, spoilers ahead!The first, and formost, issue is the beginning of the movie. Much like most excisting movies, they like to take the time to introduce every character, THOROUGHLY. It got boring, really, really fast. Even the introduction of Debbie Ocean got me jawning. Let alone, the other 7 masterminds of the operation. Other than some cheesy jokes and, if i counted correctly, two possible major plotlines (debbies ex boyfriend and 5 years of necklace stealing dreams in jail) the first 45 minutes werent that interesting. It was just bad dialoge alongside a bad pace. 
As for the characters, Debbie and Kate (dont remember the name of the character) had a nice and geniun friendship going on, but Kate's character wasnt that interesting in the first half of the movie. Same goes for the other ladies, Debbie was on the forground for most of the time. Rihanna was fun to watch, same goes for Akwafina and Sarah Paulson. They did good with what they got from the writing staff. Mindys character, i dont even remember what her name was (i dont even remember half of the names, probably says enough), she didnt do much for me. And dont get me started on Helena Bonhem Carter.. man, what the hell happened. I love that woman, but this character, totally missed the mark (again, the writing team..). Most of the time i found her to be annoying, what the writers probably ment to be as 'funny'.The whole vibe switched when they actually stole the necklace. Hataway was a joy to watch, and her character was one of the few i found geniunly funny. The heist was perfect, to perfect, but it was fun to watch. Other things, like framing the ex boyfriend and the 'famous yet dumb Daphne (Hataway) secretly joining the necklace stealing group', 
were so obvious that i again lost interest. The plottwist wasnt such a plottwist after all. Everyone saw it comming.So, if you are looking for a movie because you already orded the popcorn and the large soda, this movie will do fine. Debbie Ocean has the famous Oceans charm and along with her palls, they make a good team. However, this movie is not action packed. Its slow and at some point really boring.

To the surprises at the end of the film and how it pieces together. 
And to my surprise James Corden didn't spoil the film ether. Luckily he played an mild mannered investigator working for the insurance company and wasn't big headed and without his massive ego like he is most of the time.

The dialogue from certain characters also was off and overall didn't always fit. I think the biggest problem with the movie is it's marketing. Promoting a movie based on it being a female cast is neither persuasive or good. Also, having a full female cast really doesn't help the me too movement or other feminist organisations.

The movie has the themes from the original trilogy, but instead of imitating, gives a personal and womanly point of view. The result is excellent.
The cast, and the perfect characters (really on the spot), can stand the film alone.
The ambient of the galas, the big jewelry and fancy dresses, is used very well, in a climax ending with the beautiful actress walking down the staris of the museum in evening dresses.
I loved the movie, and i fell in love with it. So what was not convincing?
If you look at the movie like an heist movie (which it is), it leaves some doubts.
Danny had a moral, her sister steal just for stealing, and from the beginning of the movie, not for necessity but for pleasure of fancy cosmetics and hotel.
The plot twist are not really good, the first one shows how they could not do the heist without being noticed, so they make enter in the team the 'victim' of the stealing. The actress is not the real victim, but you got the point. The second is just 'we have stolen more stuff and one of Danny friend helped us', it's not a real plot twist on the plan. The heist part was really fun, but the plan wasn't that good.
I don't know if the movie was made out of a 'feminist wave' but if it were, I really would have liked more to see a woman directing the movie, there are a lot of good actress with lot of visibility (and they were SO GREAT in this movie, really good job). But not so many female directors (In the Academy Awards' 92-year history, only five women have ever been nominated for Best Director, and only one, Kathryn Bigelow has ever won).
In the end, I think this is a good movie, and a possible iconic movie in the female film lovers.",Ocean's Eight

They are all polished and fleshed out in such a way that makes me think that this film's entire target demographic is shy queer women like myself. The characterization in this movie has the perfect amount of detail for an ensemble heist film. There's just enough to each character to make each one a candidate for the lead in a solo spin-off (or, barring that, the lead in one of my more inappropriate dreams). The banter, the mannerisms, the lack of any real positive male romantic interests, it ticks off all the check marks.

It's weak. Danny was driven by more than creating the most elaborate heist ever designed and weirdly enough New York didn't do enough to match the ""natural"" glamour that Las Vegas luxury hotels and Rome/Amsterdam offered in the franchise's past.

Rihanna needs to smoke weed on screen more often, cuz that was fantastic. Piece of advice for future movie makers? Learn from this movie and start giving Helena Bonham the spotlight she deserves. Loved the twist at the end. Absolutely delicious I ate it up. Saved the movie from being a revenge heist and made it a stunning piece of art that absoLUTELY belongs in the MET.

Majority of the acting wasn't very good which didn't help the movie. Rihanna can't act, so Hollywood pleaae stop trying. Same with Mindy Khaling.

Even though it's a two hour movie, at the end it felt like only 30 minutes had gone by. It's that captivating. I personally appreciated that there wasn't any shoot out/car chase scenes typically done in heist movies. Yes, there are some references to the previous Oceans movies, but it doesn't add much to the storyline and honestly, this movie would have stood up well without being tied to the series.

With the bombarding marketing campaigns all over the net and IRL, plus thanks to kiiinda recognizing the name from somewhere, I ended up checking this film out.
Walked out of theater kinda confused. The film was just... nothing special. But maybe it's the cinema magic of a huge silver screen + magnificent audio devices shaking you up, resulting this small feeling of rush in my blood, that kinda made the experience more intense.
Fast forward to present day, present time (AHAHA!), and I have finally watched the first two of the older Oceans movies. All I can ask is: What the heck happened??
The quality difference between originals and this new ""reboot"" is night and day! And NOT in the favor for the 2018 movie, that is. The character chemistry, pacing, even the basic cinematography in the 11 and 12 are so high above anything the 8 has to offer, that it feels like an insult to even call the latter a part of the same series. You may call this new film a ""spinoff"", but even spinoffs can be made to work and feel like part of the original IP.
It has now come to my knowledge that Ocean's Eight is starting to shape up to be a big flop, and that is no surprise for me. It's even more pathetic seeing how the actors and the marketing folks behind the film are now stirring up some controversy in order to silence down any and all critics.

This gives quite a short movie that leaves with great frustration. Visually, it mixes what 2018 cinema can render when put in good hands and some surprisingly awful screen effects if not frankly cheap sometimes (the whole Cartier scene is just pure displaying of random jewels and agressive montage).

Loving rihanna as a computer hacker, we always see only guys as hackers and then when you go start working in high tech jobs you feel like an alien as a woman. this movie is huge for girls' perspective on life. Before most badass movies were about guys and female character's there were only there, naively supporting guys which in real life would be total psychopaths, sociopaths and narcissists. Or oversexualized female characters only, like there is nothing more to them but their sexuality. Also I loved it that the ladies weren't in their twenties. finally also we show women as worthy in older age than twenty and again not for their beauty but for their intellect and also good on their own. Like we always show men - powerful on their own, plus there is a relationship for them as well. Ah and also thatn you for showing how beatifully women can work together and not beign against each other. That's how we show men and women we would always only show as fighting against each other or if they are teaming up it is for gossip party or just to hunt for relationship etc. This is how we them behave because this is how we think it is. Movies affect us much more than we realize so for the girls and women this is a great movie. Loved it.

Would see it again!,9,9 July 2018,"Light summer diversion - I love caper/heist movies - I wouldn't say its as good as the original Oceans 11 - which I would rate an 11.. - But then remakes rarely are - I would say the same of the rest of the Oceans series.Loved the acting, The plot twists, the humor - I was laughing out loud throughout...e.g. ""The Ego has landed""
It's also just really amazing and so much fun, as a woman, to see a female action movie - where the women are the actors, not the girlfriends, wives, moms or prostitutes. The female buddy dynamic between the women on the team is great.. I could really relate to the main characters.. I loved the characters ....Helena Bonham Carter was hilarious.",Ocean's Eight
1066,sabrinackall,Lots of fun: disregard the haters,9,7 July 2018,"It's a by the numbers heist movie, yes - let's be honest here, they all have the exact same formula, and I'm not just talking about the Ocean series. But this one was quite clever, witty, and surprisingly realistic where the ""hacking"" was concerned. The decors were beautiful and the characters much more fleshed out than usual. Instead of two leads and a bunch of filler characters, it actually feels like a team. It also had much smaller plot holes than most heist movies.So sit back, enjoy yourself, and don't be fooled by the salty comments of people who clearly haven't seen the movie. It's good, very good.",Ocean's Eight

1070,jeremybro,Horrible,1,9 August 2018,"Why would you take a classic movie with a almost all male cast and change it so drastically. Next time you have an idea to take a classic movie and replace the cast with girls DO NOT!
DID NOBODY LEARN FROM THE REMAKE OF GHOSTBUSTERS WITH ALL GIRLS? It was HORRIBLE! WHY WOULD ANYONE MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN?
LEAVE CLASSIC MOVIES THE WAY THEY ARE, BEFORE THE WHOLE CINEMA INDUSTRY IS RUINED!!!!",Ocean's Eight

the NECKLESS has has a SECURITY SYSTEM to OPEN...They said to the 2 BODYGUARDS that the NECKLESS fall out of the head 
of the model...
It can't leave the HEAD of the MODEL without OPENING the SECURITY SYSTEM...
What a BUG in the SCRIPT...

1073,nunnyabiz,May cause drowsiness or a feeling of abnormal sleepiness,2,26 August 2018,"This was obviously written and directed by a man and the characters show it.
I love almost all the main actors in the film but the script was written for men and when the women attempt to pull it off it just doesn't work.
Three different times I tried watching this and each time after about 10 or 15 minutes I was bored.
I wouldn't even want this playing in the background unless I need something to help me sleep.
For Jebus sake Hollywood stop trying to jam a square peg into a round hole just so you can look like your trying to put more females into lead roles because so far its having a disastrous effect (cough cough Ghostbusters: Answer the Call).
Do something original so the audience has nothing to compare it to.",Ocean's Eight

I thought the acting was superb & it was gripping the whole way through & just so enjoyable the whole way throughHowever, I just wish she hadn't been the brother of a criminal. She didn't need some joint to another male criminal for that to be why she was a criminal. I want it to be fully her, not still about another man ya know?Anyway, excellent film!",Ocean's Eight
1078,aciarandres,As time goes by...,4,10 September 2018,"Ocean's 8 and its unparalleled cast of brilliant actresses barely make justice to the original movie -and then franchise. In an effort to jump on the bandwagon of the Feminist movement we are going through nowadays, the movie and its large cast lack of time to well-develop a more realistic portrayal of real empowered women. What needs to be done is to come up with characters to whom people feel more related to. Maybe all these problems are due to the simple yet boring plot; a female member of the Ocean family gets out of jail just to keep doing what she does best: to rob. That's when she recruits other women to help her steal an amazing piece of jewelry during the MET Gala, the most ostentatious fashion event ever. Although the great job of Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway and other actresses made in this film, the absence of elements that can keep you on the edge of your seat or hilarious and epic scenes is what makes this movie feels like a waste of time. So, if you don't have anything better to do on your Sunday afternoon, and you want to see some brilliant actresses in the same room, then you can watch this film as time goes by.",Ocean's Eight

I will def giv it a 9 out of 10. Not a 10 only because there is potential for a big following if they bring back some key characters and give us a bigger heist ...... I really hope they do....",Ocean's Eight
1081,wessam_man,Dumb,1,13 September 2018,"That was one of the dumbest movies i've ever seen, i was actually excited for this but man that was rubbish, the fundamental of any movie is to make the spectators sympathetic towards the hero but here did any one care? we barely got to know any of the characters besides the fact they were thieves, as for the con itself it was a huge let down, one of the biggest heists in history? the famous model who had all the money in the world was with them, the detective is their friend so they're not really that good it's just anyone who could find out about them was a friend, didn't get me to care about anyone didn't care about sandra's revenge didn't care that her ex got framed, this really was bad",Ocean's Eight

1086,zawodnaa,"Too much focus on looks and fashion, no plot",1,29 October 2018,"The movie is about the attractive, mature women trying to convince the audience that they are some sort of smart criminals. There is too much focus on perfect looks and fashion but no place for actual plot. In every single scene the ladies' make up and hair looks stunning, the clothes are stylish and seem to be very expensive. It almost looks like a beauty contest. Instead of criminals, the movie should be about the retired supermodels who try to find their way after finishing modelling career. That would be more interesting.",Ocean's Eight
1087,antego-09137,"there was no thriller, suspense or punch",4,4 December 2018,"Great cast...unbelievable really when you think of it. But somehow they managed to make them all appear mediocre. It was just okay. For a budget of $70million and building on the precipices of the first movie , i expected more action, more heart thundering moments....but it really felt short. I kept waiting for that gaspy moment...until the credits started rolling....I have never watched a movie where the heist was more easier.. this is supposed to be a thriller but it felt more like a comedy...James Corden i love but he was totally lost in that character...They didnt need Mindy K either...goodness.....whoever wrote this script didnt do a good job",Ocean's Eight

It is easy and fun to watch and the cast is brilliant - Sandra Bullock performed admirably.

1090,shakilla-31778,Great movie,5,30 January 2019,"I enjoyed the Ocean movies for their sleekness, star power, and step-by-step heist instructions and Ocean's 8 from writer director Gary Ross, entertained me as like series the others. This is a really great movie. Okay, this movie a little less, as this entertaining trifle could have been shot through with a little more energy, tighter editing, and humor with a script rewrite. It settles for glamour and the mechanics of pulling off a heist, losing some much needed zip along the way. The film opens on Sandra Bullock's Debbie Ocean, incarcerated for years and pretending full rehabilitation at her parole hearing. Once sprung, her intentions crystalize as she pulls together a diamond heist she been planning all those years behind bars.",Ocean's Eight

The necklace can only come off with the magnetized key so how could it have fallen off while Hathaway was running? It was fitted around her collarbone, there is no way it could have slipped off and when Paulsen grabbed it from the moat it was still clasped together and all the ""strands"" were still intact- nothing was broken. Did anyone else notice that?",Ocean's Eight
