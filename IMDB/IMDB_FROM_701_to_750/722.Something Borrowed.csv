0,SnoopyStyle,Goodwin is the only saving grace,6,23 November 2013,"Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Darcy (Kate Hudson) are life long friends. Dex (Colin Egglesfield) was Rachel's college friend when Darcy budded in. Now Darcy and Dex are about to get married. But Rachel still has feelings for Dex and they sleep together.This movie has 2 problems and 1 great positive.Colin Egglesfield is a horribly bland lead. It's unbelievable that two great girls are battling over him. John Krasinski is an infinitely better lead. There are countless others that would be a vast improvement. Although Krasinski and Ashley Williams have some funny jokes.Second problem is that Rachel jumped into bed with Dex so early. It puts her in a moral deficit right off the bat. It makes rooting for her next to impossible.The one great positive is Ginnifer Goodwin. She pulls off the impossible by being such a sweetheart. I can't help but root for her no matter what. I don't think the movie people actually questioned the premise. At least, they could have given GG the moral high grounds.",Something Borrowed
1,neil-476,I could have given Kate Hudson a good slap. Several times.,7,20 May 2011,"This is a film of people who look like other people. Ginnifer Goodwin (learn to spell your name properly, girl!) Looks like what Sally Field would have looked like if she hadn't looked like a cartoon, Colin Egglesfield looks like Tom Cruise-lite, Kate Hudson looks like her mother, and John Krasinski looks like UK TV person Andrew O'Connor.Once you get past that, you have to get past the fact that this isn't a romcom, as it has been sold in the trailer, it is simply a rom.Darcy (Hudson) and Rachel (Goodwin) have been best friends since childhood. Rachel is gentle, submissive, and always puts Darcy first, and Darcy is pushy, assertive, and always puts Darcy first, too. In law school, Rachel falls for Dex. Just as she is about to dip her toes into relationship waters, Darcy muscles in and overwhelms the fledgling feelings they have for each other. Some years later, when Darcy and Dex are getting married in the near future, the feelings Rachel and Dex have always had for each other finally emerge, and the dilemma is what to do now? The main other featured characters are Ethan (Krasinski), Rachel's best friend (who is himself in love with her but doesn't declare it until late in the film), Claire (Ashley Williams), who nurses an un-reciprocated yearning for Eathan, and Marcus (Steve Howey), an ignorant promiscuous oaf.This is firmly in chickflick territory and is amiable enough without ever seriously addressing the moral dilemmas facing the main characters (this is Rachel's film, not Darcy's). In fact, it not only doesn't face those dilemmas, it gives the main characters an easy exit route by compromising Darcy's morals, so it does not succeed as a drama and, despite some smiles, it is not (as already indicated) a comedy. And, while the movie is mildly likable, I found myself looking at the main characters and thinking: Rachel is an absolute doormat, and brings her misery on herself; Darcy is obnoxious, selfish, and pretty much a hateful, hateful person throughout the movie; Dex is an indecisive wimp, dominated by his authoritarian father; Ethan is as guilty of what he accuses Rachel of as she is and, as a character who is intended to be sympathetic, is deeply unpleasant throughout the film to both Darcy and Claire; Claire (who gives good cause for Ethan to reject her constantly) exists within the film solely to deliver one line.Marcus is no more than a plot device but, despite being deeply unappetising, is the only character where what you see is what you get.I suppose there is an argument for saying that all these people display human frailties - indeed, which of us does not have one or more of the weaknesses they display? - but I found them irritating, particularly when mulling the film over after the fact.I also found the ending unsatisfying. I wasn't at all sure that the right people got together for the right reasons or that relationships were resolved in ways I found realistic and/or believable.",Something Borrowed
2,anaconda-40658,Something Borrowed Should Have Been a Pen for a Re-Write.,1,4 June 2015,"Something Borrowed (2011): Dir: Luke Greenfield / Cast: Ginnifer Goodwin, Kate Hudson, Colin Egglesfield, John Krasinski, Steve Howey: Pathetic juvenile garbage about one relationship falling into another and regardless how it unravels it never gets it right. Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson play life long best friends. Goodwin just celebrated her 30th birthday and Hudson is engaged to a guy whom will reunite a fling with Goodwin when screenplay contrivances take affect. Director Luke Greenfield previously made the disgusting The Animal, and he proves quickly that his talent hasn't grown. The cast is at the mercy of idiocy. None of the characters are remotely likable. Goodwin spends much of the film in a fling and hiding it from Hudson. Hudson couldn't be any more annoying than she is here. She is constantly mugging her scenes. Goodwin is suppose to be jealous because Hudson steals her moments, however she is also cheating. Colin Egglesfield plays a total douchebag who was once involved with Goodwin but ends up with Hudson, now he bangs Goodwin while juggling Hudson. This guy is a creep and doesn't earn much credibility in any relationship. John Krasinski plays a guy who trails Goodwin like some lost puppy then he pretends to be gay in order to get another female off his back. None of it is interesting or funny for that matter. Bland filmmaking with a boring screenplay at best that would make better toilet paper. Something should be borrowed alright. Perhaps someone should borrow a hammer and beat this worthless piece of trash into oblivion. Score: 1 / 10",Something Borrowed
3,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Something Borrowed,7,19 June 2011,"Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson star as best friends forever Rachel and Darcy, and it's no surprise that these two are of the exact opposites in nature, with Rachel being the nerdier, studious, shy and soft spoken lawyer and Darcy the more gregarious, carefree and flamboyant bride to be, about to get married to Dex (Colin Egglesfield) with whom was sort of introduced to her when she gatecrashed Rachel and Dex's would be date many years ago. So one party gives the man up, the other takes him away, everything's fine and dandy and careening toward nuptials, until affections got slipped which translated to a one night stand and there's a serious love triangle established, with the usual guilt complex coming into play.So begins the situation where the groom to be cheats on the bride to be with the designated maid of honour, and whether the affair that is growing stronger with each passing day can actually be kept under wraps. In essence this is a story that tosses these questions around seeking solutions, which has many characters exploring their relationships with that added and unnecessary complexity since such things are entirely choices made whether to deceive, to stop, or to continue so long as one does not get caught. Taking place in the city to the weekend getaways where chums bond prior to someone's big wedding, Something Borrowed explores the multiple romantic tangles between friends, where it's only a fool who cannot see pass each of their buddies' infatuation/liking/lust/crush.While the story isn't too much to shout about since it's pretty much rooted in formula and the inevitable convenient cop out development in the last act to make everyone look good, thus achieving probably the best and most desirable win-win situation rather than the pain that is likely reality, Something Borrowed relies heavily on the cast to deliver the film, made easier since everyone's playing a version of themselves from their filmography in what would be heavy typecasting. For instance, Kate Hudson seems to be the go-to girl nowadays if a film has requirements for a ditzy blonde with that outgoing personality. And for Goodwin it seems that she cannot shake off that damsel in relationship distress type of role given her breakthrough in He's Just Not That Into You, being the person who prefers to be in the shadow of another, and giving things up for the status quo.The shining light in Something Borrowed happened to be that spot on reflection and portrayal of how male and female confidantes differ from each other, when Rachel has Ethan (John Krasinski) to listen out and to offer advice, and Rachel herself being on the other end when Darcy comes knocking and confessing too, granted that the former is somehow the third party involved. But it does go to show how direct and well-meaning, often straight to the point do guys dish out pearls of wisdom, compared to the more beating about the bush, sneaky manner that the fairer sex do theirs, probably highlighting the hypocritical ways especially when all the beans got spilled. It is this aspect of the film that lifts it above the usual rom-coms to stand out from its peers.Based on the novel by Emily Giffin, do stay for the coda during the end credits, which suggests a follow up movie to be made, but knowing just how this one did at the box office, having to watch everyone come back for another go since there is actually a sequel to the book, will seem a little bit of a wishful thinking. I won't mind having another go with all the none too subtle Heineken product placement though.",Something Borrowed
4,Hellmant,Something Superficial!,5,26 May 2011,"'SOMETHING BORROWED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Romantic comedy/drama based on the best selling book of the same name by Emily Giffin (which is the first in a series) about an insecure young lawyer who falls for an attractive law schoolmate only to have him stolen by her abusive best friend. The film stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Kate Hudson, Colin Egglesfield and John Krasinski It was directed by Luke Greenfield (who also directed one of my favorite romantic comedies 'THE GIRL NEXT DOOR') and written by Jennie Snyder (who's only other writing experience is sappy TV melodrama like '90210' and 'GILMORE GIRLS'). The film had a lot of potential to be an honest well thought out character study about friendship and love but it drowns in sappy romcom clichés.Goodwin plays Rachel, a lawyer who fell in love with her schoolmate Dex (Egglesfield) in law school but never got up the courage to tell him (due to the fact that she thought he was too good looking for her). Dex also had feelings for her but being the prettyboy that he is, and always being used to women making the first move on him, waited for Rachel to come on to him. So when she didn't and her self-centered abusive (but good looking) best friend Darcy (Hudson) did, Dex decided to go for her instead. Several years later Dex and Darcy are engaged and Rachel blurts out one drunk night that she used to have a crush on Dex which then leads to an affair between the two. They then struggle in deciding what to do about their feelings without hurting Darcy. The whole time Rachel confides in her other good childhood buddy Ethan (Krasinski), who's actually nice and cares for Rachel, who also has been keeping his feelings from somebody.The film deals with a lot of interesting and relatable relationship issues (at least for me) but doesn't come to a satisfying conclusion on any of them. First off the casting is all wrong; Goodwin is way too attractive to play a plain and constantly single nerd, which is almost always the case in Hollywood films (they're consistently trying to relate to the insecure and 'unattractive' but then cast someone the complete opposite of 'unattractive' in the role). Hudson is beautiful but not nearly as ideally 'drop dead gorgeous' as the role should have required (she's not anymore physically attractive than Goodwin really). Egglesfield is the perfect example of a prettyboy but he's so wooden and uninteresting, why would anyone like Rachel even be into him?! The movie is supposed to be an argument against superficiality when it is in fact just as superficial as it's characters.I've read several viewer comments that question why someone like Rachel would put up with a friend like Darcy but this is where the film is most relatable to me and I think it happens quite often in life. Often times the less confident and more insecure will stick by friends who treat them like s--- and constantly take advantage of them out of some sense of loyalty and feelings of moral responsibility (I know I have). It will usually reach a breaking point though and if the abused grows stronger, and wise enough, they'll finally realize it needs to come to an end. I thought this was the area of the film that was the strongest but in the end there really wasn't enough of it. The romance became too much of a focus point and it was far too fake, forced and distasteful in my opinion. I also didn't like how the movie kind of blamed Rachel for not saying something to Dex earlier on when Dex could have just as easily said something to her. I have friends (sexist and somewhat old fashioned) who still think it's always the man's responsibility to make the first move. I think that's definitely an outdated and ridiculous belief but in this case I think the guy definitely should have made the first move. Usually the people who don't often date and feel insecure are less likely to say something and make a move, the fact that Dex always needed to be pursued and some sort of a prize is another reason why he didn't deserve Rachel. You have to give the film some credit for fleshing out these issues that are somewhat important and relatable to almost everyone but how it handles them from there on out is pretty weak.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8",Something Borrowed
5,Robert_duder,Surprised at the backlash. Decent comedy.,8,24 January 2012,"This film seems to be receiving a host of really bad vibes from people. I, for one, am quite surprised. Yes the film is heavy on infidelity, broken friendships, lying, cheating, and everything else but isn't that life? And not only that why is everyone so upset about watching it in an age of trash Television and reality shows that have one person dating multiple people all the time, or Soap Operas where infidelity is common place. A lot of professional critics have this at the tops of their worst movies of 2011 lists and I'm confused. It isn't a bad movie, its entertaining, the characters are decent, the chemistry is good, the romance is there...its pretty straight forward. It isn't mind blowing but its perfectly entertaining and that's really all that matters.Ginnifer Goodwin is very well known for been the consummate good girl. Sweet, and always pure. So it was kind of nice to see in her in a romantic comedy where her character is pure as the driven snow. She's flawed and the entire situation is flawed and she's good in her role. Kate Hudson is her best friend and basically an unlikable dirt bag but she does the role well. I am not a big Hudson fan so I was all for seeing play the promiscuous party girl that you won't like at all. It obviously helps soften the fact that her best friend is cheating with her fiancé. Moral? No. But not the point. Colin Egglesfield is the object of both their desires. The problem is that Egglesfield is kind of unlikable too. Him and Goodwin have good chemistry but he sort of bounces back and forth between being a romantic lead and being sort of a moron. But the more romantic moments in the film work well enough. John Krasinski plays Goodwin's best friend and he's okay in a comic relief role but the forced and sudden potential romance between Goodwin is kind of pointless.As a director Luke Greenfield is sort of all over the board in comedies from horribly campy Rob Schneider to the slightly more sophisticated raunchy comedy of The Girl Next Door and this one falls right down the middle in many ways. I think the thing I liked about Something Borrowed is that its real, and heart felt and not your typical everything is rosy and perfect rom-com. It isn't by the books and it isn't something you can tell every single moment before it happens so for that I give them kudos and people should stop chastising the film for being what it is. Its not your perfect date movie necessarily but a decent, if not slightly dark, comedy. Give it a shot. 8/10",Something Borrowed
6,MLDinTN,"a movie about 2 selfish, lying best friends...",2,13 February 2012,"if that sounds great to you, then check this film out. But I thought this was terrible. All 3 main characters in this are terrible to one another and claim to be best friends. Dex and Darcy are to be married; however, Rachel was the first to meet Dex in law school. She basically let Darcy have him by not being proactive. So, just weeks before the wedding, Rachel and Dex sleep together and the next you know, they say they love each other, but Dex doesn't want to leave Darcy. And they continue the affair. Rachel is supposed to be the good one here, but how can you even like her with what she is doing behind her best friends back. Then at the end to make it ""OK"" for Rachel to be with Dex, Darcy announces she's pregnant by some other guy. So lame.BTW: Kate Hudson looks awful in this. They must have run out of budget for all the airbrushing for her.FINAL VERDICT: Do not watch this.",Something Borrowed
7,inkblot11,Something nice for the proverbial romantic comedy fans; enjoyable,7,23 May 2011,"Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) has had a best friend since grade school, Darcy (Kate Hudson). However, sometimes it seems surprising that they are still pals. Darcy is a Type-A Princess with an ego the size of Mount Rushmore. So many times Rachel swallows her comments, such as at her surprise thirtieth birthday party, the one she asked Darce NOT to throw! Also, Darcy is engaged to a handsome lawyer, Dex (Colin Egglesfield) while Rachel is still searching for the right guy. In truth, Rachel introduced Darcy to Dex long ago, for R and D went to law school together and were study partners. Yet, sometimes, it appears that the two bar members cast longing eyes at one another. This exasperates Ethan (John Krasinski), another childhood friend of the girls, although this gentleman is far closer to Rachel at the moment and he finds Darcy tiresome. After the party, Rachel hears that Darcy left her $2000 handbag in the bar and Rache goes to retrieve it. Somehow, Dex and his former study partner end up taking the same cab and extending the night, if you get the drift. Horrors! Now, there is a love triangle in secret and a formidable quandary for the cheaters. As ""their crowd"" often goes to Long Island on the summer weekends, where Darcy still tries to fix Rachel up and where close quarters are the norm, will the deception come to the surface? And, who does Dex really love, Darcy or Rachel? Should there be a wedding at all? This is an enjoyable romcom, although it is somewhat complicated and the characters are flawed. As the main star, Goodwin looks lovely and has a charming sweetness, in contrast to the gorgeous Hudson's fine turn as the conceited witch. Egglesfield is eye-popping handsome and also has a sensitivity that is very appealing. Krasinski provides great comic relief while the supporting cast, including Jill Eikenberry, is nice as well. Naturally, the costumes are sensational and the Manhattan setting, crisp script and zestful direction add up to a mildly successful film. Do something nice for your gals, guys, and take her to see Something Borrowed soon.",Something Borrowed
8,tabuno,Can't Quite Succeed Being Creatively Different,7,12 January 2019,"23 December 2016. Credit can be given to the producers and scriptwriters in trying to accomplish something different with this drama-comedy romance. Unfortunately, the tortured ending sequences don't quite make this movie really that different from most mainstream comedy romances. What this movie tried to explore was the more serious, real dilemmas in romances, triangular relationships. Something Borrowed didn't offer up a My Best Friends Wedding (1997) balance of comedy and drama as well as the more sobering reality of romance, instead of the more typical Cinderella experience. This movie did offer up a more dramatic romance outline instead of a comedic bent and instead incorporating humor within its dramatic plot outline for a nice change. Overall, Something Borrowed becomes something borrowed but was ultimately returned to the more unoriginal outcome found in most movies.",Something Borrowed
9,DarkVulcan29,John Krasinski makes this somewhat watchable,4,15 May 2011,"Rachel(Ginnifer Goodwin) is an attorney, is single, and miserable. Because her best friend Darcy(Kate Hudson) is engaged to Dex(Colin Egglesfield), the thing Rachel and Dex have always has feelings for each other, but things got complicated when Darcy came into the picture. So how will this all play out? John Krasinski is a scene stealer, cause he gets most of the memorable dialog, and the only one here with any logic. Ginnifer Goodwin is alright is alright in some parts, but gets less interesting for the rest of it, Colin Egglesfields character is just an annoying one note performance, and Kate Hudsons character is the worst one, she is just so pathetic and obnoxious that it's not even funny, please I hope for a better romantic comedy for 2011.",Something Borrowed
10,dar0417,Better then expected,5,31 January 2020,Surprisingly not that bad. Very predictable and had a few laughs.,Something Borrowed
11,davispittman,Very very disappointing,1,5 April 2017,"This is one of the most disappointing romantic comedies I have ever seen, if not THE most. I thought maybe it would at least be half decent since it featured some of my favorite actors: Kate Hudson, Ginnifer Goodwin, and John Kransinski (Jim from the office). The script is WOEFULLY underwhelming. The writing is not only cliché, but it's also dull and it just seems to me like they didn't put any effort at all into writing good dialogue for this film. The characters are just cardboard cut out romantic comedy stereotypes. It's pretty hard to care about what happens to them too because either they are far too dull and underdeveloped or they're just bad people lol. Cheating with your best friends boyfriend is the main theme of the movie. That could be an interesting set up for a movie, especially if you intertwine some emotional/sentimental value between the two friends. This movie doesn't do anything like that. Absolutely nothing about Something Borrowed is interesting, fun, entertaining, or even the least bit humorous. 1/10 for this very poor romantic comedy. There are oh so many more romantic comedies out there to watch that are so much better.",Something Borrowed
12,EUyeshima,Formulaic and Tiresome Rom-Com Focuses on Ethically Challenged Lovers,3,29 August 2011,"Had the smarter, more unpredictable ""Bridesmaids"" not opened in the same month, perhaps this studio-manufactured 2011 rom-com would have seemed fresher and more appealing. Not a chance. This film would have been dreary no matter when it was released simply because director Luke Greenfield and first-time screenwriter Jennie Snyder regale in the tired clichés that permeate what passes for a story of a female friendship that unravels over the noncommittal man that comes between them. Based on Emily Giffin's 2005 chick-lit novel, the movie focuses on the ethical compromises women make when they hit their thirties and find themselves enduring the pressure of getting married. Such is the case with Rachel White, a rising attorney who gets herself drunk enough at her thirtieth birthday party to sleep with Dex Thaler, the fiancé of her best friend Darcy Rhone. What Rachel thinks is an unfortunate one-night stand becomes something deeper since Rachel has had a crush on Dex since they attended NYU law school together.Once their unrequited love for each other becomes exposed, the inevitable complications ensue. However, the complications are less about ethics and more about setting the stage in typical by-the-numbers fashion for the final pay-off. To make the affair between Rachel and Dex seem less illicit, Darcy is, of course, portrayed as a self-absorbed narcissist none the wiser for the deception that the illicit lovers are perpetuating. The only one who knows what's going on is Rachel's conveniently platonic friend Ethan, who naturally encourages her to tell the truth to Darcy. Meanwhile, Darcy is trying to pair Rachel off with a moronic player named Marcus, which shows just how little she thinks of her friend. Endlessly perplexed as to what he should do, Dex continually succumbs to family pressure and turns Rachel away. The back-and-forth shenanigans grow tired quickly, and the film becomes an exercise in patience and sheer boredom. My sympathies go out mainly to Ginnifer Goodwin and Colin Egglesfield who have to play Rachel and Dex in a constant state of frustrated yearning. Goodwin, in particular, has charm to spare, but her efforts are wasted here.No stranger to stupid rom-coms, the indefatigable Kate Hudson appears to be playing the same role she played in the similarly bird-brained ""Bride Wars"", but the enervated air of indifference that informs her performance here is the only reason I find her tolerable. However, leave it to John Krasinski to steal the picture as Ethan, a warm-hearted lug of a confidante who would have been gay in any other formulaic film and provides the only link to reality for the viewer. His is the one voice of reason for Rachel, but all the while, I kept thinking how this likable actor really needs to fire his agent and get a role worthy of his comic talents. Steve Howey as Marcus and Ashley Williams as a horsey girl obsessed with Ethan play their repellent stock roles predictably. The movie bounces between Manhattan and the Hamptons in a superficial manner befitting the shallow characters. At the end of it all (and it felt quite long at 112 minutes), you couldn't help but think to yourself that they all deserve each other. Sad to say that Hilary Swank was one of the producers of this commercial drivel.",Something Borrowed
13,p-stepien,Whitewashing Betrayal,2,18 January 2013,"Self-condemned to monotonous loneliness bridesmaid Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) possesses an undying romantic endeavour, not coupled however with success with finding soul mates. So hapless is her misguided lack of belief that she throws her best bet at love Dex (Colin Egglesfield) into the arms of her best friend - the happy-go-lucky self-centred childhood friend Darcy (Kate Hudson). When the couple announce their intent to marry Rachel is left sighing in hindsight of foregone opportunities, with only the sarcastic ever-friend Ethan (John Krasinski) there to comfort her. Nonetheless the situation turns on its head, when Rachel and Dex sleep with each other after getting drunk....As far as romantic movies are concerned they necessitate either well-wrought humour or a good feel for substantial romance. ""Something Borrowed"" fails on both accounts, instead delivering an sour taste with some doubtful contemptible immorality, where culprits get clean slates for sleeping with fiancées or best friends, while guilt isn't something overly time-consuming for the supposedly empathic Rachel. With Rachel throwing herself into an affair without any remorse, finally bringing about a poorly contrived confrontation, which absolves all parties involved, ""Something Borrowed"" borrows both patience and credibility. Despite charismatic performances within their respectively bland roles by both Krasinski (the only comedy factor in play throughout the movie) and Hudson, dropping the movie is a trivial matter of not having to watch such a morally repugnant contrition sweetened into a banal happy ending.",Something Borrowed
14,napierslogs,"It's a thin line between comedy and drama, and which emotions are reasonable to force on your audience",6,6 May 2011,"Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) is turning 30, but it's the immature Darcy (Kate Hudson) who is getting married. ""Something Borrowed"" is a romantic comedy, so obviously that inverse world will right itself, eventually. It was a longer process than would seem necessary.As the tag line says, it's a thin line between love and friendship. It's also a thin line between drama and comedy, and also between which emotions are reasonable to force your audience to go through. I am its target audience, moreover I'm Rachel exactly, so they won me over from the start, and then I laughed and I cried. Both of which more than I was expecting too.It's a shame that the funniest characters were the superfluous ones. Creating one good character was apparently hard enough for Hollywood, so the supporting ones were just props to move the strenuous plot along and deliver some reasonably funny lines and situations. John Krasinski, in particular, deserves better than that.Goodwin's Rachel and Krasinski's natural humour and disposition put ""Something Borrowed"" slightly above average.

15,TheUnknown837-1,I have the misfortune of not being a member of the target audience,5,2 November 2011,"For the entire running time of ""Something Borrowed,"" based on a popular book by Emily Giffin, I sat uninvolved, disinterested, and with an utterly empty feeling in my heart. And yet in the weeks that have passed since I saw the film, I have gotten a negative back-lashing from every female audience member that I have spoken to about it. And I'm not entirely surprised. ""Something Borrowed"" is a romantic comedy and it is steered directly at its target audience. My misfortune is merely that I happen to be beyond the target audience's parameters. Pictures of this sort sometimes work for me (I have a real soft spot for ""Sleepless in Seattle"") but oftentimes to not.""Something Borrowed"" was one of the cases where it did not.I doubt the original book would have much appeal to me either if its narrative resembles the film's. As it opens, we see two lifelong pals celebrating a momentous occasion. One is played with great screen-friendly charisma by Ginnifer Goodwin; the other with ice-cold insipidly and aggravation by Kate Hudson. They are celebrating that Miss Hudson is getting married to prim and elegant Colin Egglesfield. Unbeknown to Miss Hudson, her fiancée and her best friend have secretly loved each other for years. After a night of drinking, Miss Goodwin and Mr. Egglesfield find themselves in bed together and frantically try to cut off the age-long feelings they've had for each other...to no avail. And then it becomes a race against time before the wedding comes.What do they try to accomplish? Nothing, really. And that was my core problem with ""Something Borrowed."" What the two star-crossed lovers (Miss Goodwin and Mr. Egglesfield, that is) do in that two hours of space in between is rather dull and arc-less. They ogle, they talk, they try to let bygones by bygones, sleep together again, and on and on before a recycled, would-be emotional climax straight out of dozens of other romantic comedies that in and of themselves, were not that impressive to begin with. A truly great romantic motion picture, such as ""An Affair to Remember"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle"" delves with toying around with the narrative arc, such as playing the inevitable ""discovery of betrayal scene"" in the middle instead of at the end, and thereby allow the audience to wonder how it will turn out at the end.Miss Goodwin is a charming actress with a screen-friendly personae. But she's the only one who really sticks out in any way. Miss Hudson is hardly sympathetic given the slattern-role she is given and she plays it with just about as much charisma as a howler monkey. Worse still, is the love interest with whom they are indirectly vying for. Uninteresting as Miss Hudson is, she is infinitely better than Mr. Egglesfield, who acts and performs like a stack of wood. Obviously chosen for his looks as opposed to any acting competence, Mr. Egglesfield makes for a dull love interest and as a result, left me wondering just what it was about this fella that made these two girls so hungry for him. Add to that a pointless subplot about a ""best guy friend"" who thinks he's a homosexual (John Krasinski) and we've got a lot of rather dull character-to-character dynamics.All in all, however, ""Something Borrowed"" is tailored for its target audience they have, to a great extent, loved it. I can still visualize the sour expression I got from the girl who sat in front of me in my English class as she whirled around when I proclaimed my disliking for the picture and the sharp way in which she responded ""Well, I thought it was good."" And the girls in the dormitory with whom I watched the movie were ""ooing"" and ""aahing"" all the way through. So for its target audience, ""Something Borrowed"" will stand firm. For me, however, it was just dead in the water. It was well-directed by Luke Greenfield, but utterly lacking in Jennie Snyder's screenplay, and most of the principal cast members. ""Something Borrowed"" really ought to be titled ""Everything Borrowed.""",Something Borrowed
16,Christian_Dimartino,It's Casablanca... when you compare it to Valentine's Day.,4,21 October 2011,"Kate Hudson has had bad luck for a long time. I miss the Hudson who was Penny Lane. Where did she go? I'll tell you where: Fool's Gold, Bride wars, and, just recently, Something Borrowed. Something borrowed is up there with one of the years worst films.Ginnifer Goodwin is the likable one. She has just turned 30, and she has always had a crush on her best friend's(Kate Hudson) fiancé(Collin Egglesfield). So one night, they do it. You know, bang. And from there they start having affairs and try to keep it a secret.Almost nothing about the film works. The film tries way to hard for us to like Goodwin. She's cute, so how can we not? It tries way too hard for us to like Goodwin, and way too hard for us to dislike Hudson. It makes all of the unrootable characters obnoxious, and to me, it got under my skin.There are a lot of very corny moments, and you end up not liking any of the characters in the end. The only thing that works about the film is John Krasinski, who once again brings comic relief. And even he has a flaw. Krasinski's character is here because... can anyone answer? He's there because he John Krasinski? I'm not quite sure. Even with a pointless performance, he still nails it.So, overall, Something borrowed is what the title promises. I mean, it's not the worst movie i've ever seen. I mean, if you compare it to The Ugly truth or Valentine's day, two examples of pure suicide, then it's not that bad. But its still bad.C-",Something Borrowed

As Darcy prepares with her nuptials with Dexter (Colin Egglefield), Rachel celebrates her thirtieth and reevaluates her relationship with both Darcy and Dexter. If she acts on her feelings then it will change the dynamic of their relationships. Should she play it safe and simply suppress her feelings? This movie is full of unexpected twist and turns. As a male viewer it is also interesting to see a film that exposes about all those insecurities woman have within themselves. Directed by Luke Greenfield the movie does follow the book Something Borrowed and the cast brings to life how no matter how bad things happen life always work out. by Dr. Wilson Trivino",Something Borrowed
18,TaylorYee94,I can't believe I wasted 2 hours on this garbage.,3,17 September 2021,"I had been guilty and uncomfortable the whole time just watching this movie. A lot of movies portray affair (well....in other words, cheating just like in this movie) romantically just because of what they have between the two or artistic portrayal. The director is incapable of doing art, so he tries to justify 'cheating' between Rachel and Dexter by demonizing another character because he is not capable of making romance romantic. He keeps adding up troubles and obnoxiousness of Darcy whenever something goes wrong between the two (by the way, their indecisiveness is what causes the most of the trouble). And what's up with John Krasinski's character? He is the only sensible one that draws empathy from audience. The director stupidly throws away Ethan's character development or story development and wastes it as a tool, a love interest of Rachel, which does not make any impact on the main plot. Do Not Waste Your Time on this.",Something Borrowed
19,bob_meg,Goodwin warmly anchors this much better than average CF,7,1 October 2011,"The term ""chick flick"" is getting a bit passé...though I might stop using it if more movies come out with the depth and emotional heart of ""Something Borrowed."" This film looks at first glance to be torture for almost anyone...Kate Hudson's name alone in the credits is cringe-inducing. But this film has a bit more going on than you'd think, and it has the brains to cast Ginnifer Goodwin --- a talented actress and comedienne who can sell the ""good girl"" act with breezy effortlessness and with as much panache as a modern day Mary Tyler Moore --- in the lead as Rachel, forever second-fiddle to party-girl powerhouse Darcy (Kate Hudson, in a performance that's tonally perfect).Rachel's long-time crush on Dex (a little-too-perfect Colin Egglesfield ---- really, have American men become such bland clods that the only appealing men to chase on film are now all British?) is coming to a head as his wedding to Darcy approaches.John Krasinski's performance here as Rachel's best-friend-in-waiting seems a bit too close to his alter-ego Jim Halpert, but the guy is so good at the role --- and genuinely funny and touching here --- it's almost a shame to wish him out of it (think the parts Tony Randall always wound up playing in the '60s).But Goodwin is really the reason to see this movie. What could have been a phoned-in, faked performance is filled with real emotion, real pain, and real joy. It's a refreshing comedic turn in a highly commercial film that --- while it's not going to win any Oscars --- is an overall good time at the movies, without leaving you feeling like you were just lobotomized.",Something Borrowed

21,jonathanruano,Something Awful,3,22 August 2012,"""Something Borrowed"" is a big-budgeted soap opera film which tried to create drama from the dumb situations of its characters, only to fail miserably. I would love to figure out where these characters got their jobs, which reward them with overly generous salaries for doing no work and for thinking as little as possible; because honestly I have not been able to find jobs like that in any of the job postings. Living in this universe of fake, lucrative employment and almost endless leisure (these people get more vacation time than French employees), little time passed before Dex (Colin Egglesfield), Darcy (Kate Hudson), Ethan (John Krasinski), and Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) found themselves in the type of situation reserved for soap operas. After all, their lives were too boring to have any other kinds of complications. Colin Egglesfield, in particular, approaches these problems as a person having mastered the art of soap opera speak. How else can you explain why Colin tells Ginnifer that he wants to have sex with her over the space of a weekend in order to figure out whether he wants to stay with her or marry Darcy (Kate Hudson)? And how else can you explain why Ginnifer agrees to ply herself? Does anyone imagine such a ludicrous scenario unfolding in the real world? And yet, ""Something Borrowed"" is filled with situations like these which make the film increasingly laughable and bad as time wears on. Yet apart from the plot, I really did not sympathize with any of this film's characters. Dex is a nasty piece of work who seems to only get by on the basis of his good looks. Ethan (John Krasinski) is a nice enough fellow, but he is mostly boring because he is given very little to say or do in this picture. Rachel (Gennifer Goodwin) is almost nauseating with her moaning and complaining and for her determined refusal to date another guy, in the hope that the loser Dex will return to her someday. Kate Hudson is probably the only remotely interesting person in this whole movie, but one cannot help thinking that her undeniable acting talents could serve a much better script for an entirely different movie. Lastly, I am not sure which audience this movie was for. Was it catering to the soap opera fans? If so, I cannot imagine this film being superior to the TV soap operas that cheat on their budget. Was this film made for the fans of romance-comedies? Maybe, except the filmmakers of ""Something Borrowed"" take their material so seriously. I guess, in closing, I just did not like this movie.",Something Borrowed

It was definitely funnier the second time (etc.) that I saw it! I really love the summer weekend trips and scenes! The soundtrack and editing (especially for flash backs) are very well done. Yes, it is a pretty ridiculous and annoying scenario, but I think part of the reason I enjoy it is the fact that it is different from most typical romantic comedies, in that there is not one definitive protagonist for whom the audience roots. Both of the two women have done something wrong (like normal humans!) and I feel like people could relate to either character.",Something Borrowed

The only one not as dumb mentally or emotionally as a bag of rocks is the one played by John Krasinski (not sure his acting range includes silly stupid, fwiw).Do we believe these people met in a law school?

25,cnycitylady,Pure Fluff,6,1 January 2013,"Lets get one thing straight, this isn't an Oscar gaining film, this isn't ""The King's Speech,"" hell this isn't even a good Disney Movie, this is just Pure Fluff. And with that in mind lets review this film fairly, without all of the harsh ""moral lessons"" that everyone keeps throwing in your face about it.Now the premise of the story is that Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) is in love with Dex (Colin Egglesfield) who is engaged to Darcy (Kate Hudson.) The fiancé and the best friend are in love with each other but are both too scared to do anything about it. They struggle with themselves as they try to figure out what is ""right"", or whatever. Now the characters are both overly developed and not developed enough. For example, you get a glimpse into Rachel's past and you see how she has always been the same, a constant character, not really growing or developing. She has always been the ""timid and ugly"" girl. You see that she will probably never change or differ, and they tell you this in many ways as the film runs on. They practically drill it into you the entire two hours you are watching it. But for characters like Darcy you only see what Rachel sees. The girl who gets everything she wants and who doesn't appreciate it (and perhaps this is true.) You see Dex, (probably the most underdeveloped) as the ""Hot"" guy who is shy and uncertain of himself. But isn't he still a man? Shouldn't he take charge? Even John Krasninsky's character became tedious as he would lecture Rachel about her choices, complain about listening to her personal life problems but then inquire as to them. They don't evenly divide the depth of the characters and you are left with all of them coming out as shallow in their own way. The acting is okay, again nothing to write home about. Ginnifer Goodwin is perfect in the ""I'm not good enough for him, I'm too shy"" role, even though she is stunning and more attractive than the ""Hot best friend"" in this movie. Kate Hudson is type casted as self-centered ""hot"" best friend (Who wasn't so good looking here, she looked bloated the whole time) who very irritatingly thinks only of herself. And Colin Egglesfeild (whom I've never seen before) fits in as the spineless fiancé scared to take control of his life while John Krasninsky basically reprises his role as Jim for comedic relief.Now all this notwithstanding the story is still an okay rom-com. You get the light and airy feel of the world they live in, with no real problems to speak of. Everyone had a house, a job, and loads of free time on their hands. The characters have fun with each other and are not really deeply conflicted with what they do to each other or with what is done to them. Any woman (whether they liked the film or not) will sit through it multiple times to either applaud at the ""justice"" done in the movie when the cute girl gets the hot guy or to scream at the television at how ""f**ked up"" these supposed best friends were towards each other. Either way, you have got a movie that will entertain in the most superficial way possible, a classic piece of fluff chick flick that will withstand the test of time.",Something Borrowed
26,bjones,Pleasant evening,7,12 May 2011,"This is a pretty good example of a modern romantic comedy. It's less of a comedy but enjoyable nonetheless, made that way by the star, Ginnifer Goodwin.I can say that this is the first film where I have decided to buy a ticket based solely on the presence in it of Ginnifer Goodwin. I wasn't disappointed. She is luminous in most of the scenes she's in - and there are a lot of them considering she's the central character. She's never looked more alluring, more beautiful. But it's her delivery of the material that's the most satisfying. She is just a truly wonderful actress and she breathes real life into the part of Rachel, making us truly her ally in helping her achieve success and happiness.Goodwin is solidly backed by the lovely Kate Hudson as Darcy. Hudson is in perhaps her best performance as an over the top, somewhat obnoxious, intellectually challenged, manic blond filled with an almost mean-spirited, selfish self-interest. She is on the border of mercilessly taunting Goodwin's character in much of the film and Goodwin, playing ever the gracious friend, puts up with her friends excesses. The graciousness meets it's biggest challenge when her college study mate Dex, played by Colin Egglesfield, is swept out from under Rachel by the overbearing Darcy, who always gets what she wants.The interplay between these two actresses is a definite cut above the usual silliness of romantic comedies and Goodwin comes off looking much the better of the two, but that may be partly due to the greater sympathetic nature of her character. If you really watch Hudson she's riveting in places.The men in this offering, Egglesfield, John Krasinski and Steve Howey do their level best to provide counterpoint to the two leading ladies, but ultimately it's all about the girls. Krasinski is the most watchable, and likely the better actor but Howey adds some oddball charm that also makes it a better film. At one point Hudson refers to him as a caveman; that's an apt description.Finally, there is a character named Claire played to a turn by the terminally cute Ashley Williams. She's fun to watch.All-in-all it's a good movie to take your favorite girl to.By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",Something Borrowed

28,sinncross,Case gone cold...,6,11 July 2011,"By her 30th birthday, Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin), a dedicated attorney, bemoans the fact that love is not in her court. Her best friend Darcy (Jennifer Hudson), however, is closed to being married to Dex (Colin Egglesfield) whom Rachel met in law school. After a few drinks together Rachel confesses to Dex that she always had a crush on him which leads to both sleeping together. With Darcy's wedding not long away, Rachel finds herself in dubious territory.Something Borrowed had the potential to be a multifaceted affair. On one hand it is your average romantic comedy and on the other it offers a portrayal of ethical issues surrounding love. It is a pity the latter is downplayed to a rather basic understanding of the issues. The narrative does its best to help the viewer identify with Rachel and it is not difficult to do so for the first third. She is the good girl who is studious and in love with a guy who she feels is too handsome for her, but loses him to her best friend who always has to be better than her. This sort of identification begins to fall away with Rachel's self pity, which is thankfully attacked by her long time friend Ethan (John Krasinski), and her rather willingness to engage in an affair. While the ending is not something new for the genre, it is quite surprising how the film appears to glorify the act of cheating to the point of it being acceptable. There are no dire consequences to actions and so the narrative becomes unfortunately one dimensional. That said, there is no denying the fun factor associated with the romantic comedy nature of the film so it is not all bad.Thankfully, the actors do a decent enough job of keeping the story afloat. Goodwin and Egglesfield are perhaps not quite up to par with Hudson and Krasinski. This is easily due to Hudson having the most exciting role and Krasinski stealing scenes with his humour and charisma. This merely leaves the more romance orientated and weak dramas scenes for Goodwin and Egglesfield to wade through.Considering the thematic elements expressed in the story, sexual content is fairly tame and without nudity. Violence is only really shown through a horror film being watched by some characters and language is on the tame side.There is potential to push past the romantic comedy genre, but the story of Something Borrowed is light hearted to its detriment as the possible avenue to build a thought provoking tale is never really attempted. Additionally, not all of the actors are given the strongest material to work with and this becomes evident when the best scenes require particular characters. On a simple level Something Borrowed does work, but with such pressing issues alluded to early on in the story it is saddening that nothing comes of them: something blue indeed.",Something Borrowed

33,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Something Borrowed,4,16 June 2011,"Something Borrowed follows Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) as she meets Dex (Colin Egglesfield) at university where they become best friends with feelings clearly developing but neither of them acting on said feelings. So when Rachel's best friend the selfish and obnoxious Darcy (Kate Hudson) shows up and asks Dex out, Rachel gives her blessing, Dex says yes and several years later they are engaged to be married.This leaves Rachel distraught for letting Dex slip through her fingers and with the cowardly and wimpish Dex (I'm sure just what ladies look for in a man) still conflicted as to what to do next. After Rachel's birthday celebrations though, she and Dex end up sleeping together and supposed hilarity ensues as they try yet again ignore the chemistry between them and just let life run its course.Thank god for Ethan (John Krasinski) Rachel's friend who gave a voice of reason to proceedings by at least attempting to beat some sense into the main characters who seemed to be oblivious to everything around them. I think my main fault with the movie was the storyline and the way we are supposed to feel for Rachel despite the fact that she didn't make a go of it with Dex, everything that happened to her was self inflicted and she has slept with her best friend's fiancé; and given that Darcy isn't a very nice person to say the least that either of them hung around with her in the first place.The supporting cast outside the four main characters didn't add to the film in any way shape or form. With some movies you get the token celebrities who show up for 10 seconds, say a line and then leave again and this is how the rest of the cast felt to me for the entire movie. They were just written in for one line and then would disappear never to be seen or heard from again.Apart from a few witty remarks here and a bit of slapstick, there was not much comedy in the film with the overall feel of it leaning more towards a drama with a bit of comedy rather than the other way around which I feel is the better mix for this genre. There was nothing wrong with the acting with Goodwin and Egglesfield doing their jobs and creating some chemistry but it was merely a minor consolation which can't cover up the rest of the issues highlighted.As romcom's go this was one of the worse that I've seen so much so that even if your an avid fan of this type of movie you'll have a hard time getting any pleasure out of watching it.

34,markdroulston,Sigh...,2,28 December 2011,"What is it about romance, one of the most well-defined genres in film and literature, that seems so hard to get right? Each year, countless vapid love stories flood the cinema (or more often the DVD shelf), polluting our screens with their noxious, saccharine presence. In 2011, Something Borrowed is perhaps the most offensive example; a pointless, over-long mess populated with unlikable characters and underdeveloped plots. Something Borrowed is a love triangle of sorts, beginning with our 'heroine' Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) sleeping with her best friend Darcy's (Kate Hudson) husband-to-be Dex (Colin Egglesfield). Floating around in the background is old college pal Ethan (John Krasinski), the only decent person in the whole film, who unfortunately has no bearing on the plot and serves only as a shoddy bait-and-switch device, dropping out of the conclusion completely and with no explanation. Hudson, who seems to have the lame romantic comedy market sewn up at this point, is the worst offender, and Darcy is so wholly despicable that it's almost impossible to believe that any of the surrounding characters would put up with her self-obsessed demeanour for as long as they have. At times it feels as if the filmmakers are attempting to shake up the formula a little, yet none of it comes together in anything resembling a satisfying conclusion, and ironically a more predictable climax to this story might have redeemed the film at least a little. None of the character arcs are believable or interesting, and at almost two hours, Something Borrowed outstays its welcome by at least 30 minutes.How films like Something Borrowed continue to get made is understandable; the audience for this nonsense are nothing if not easily amused. However, it's hard to believe that even the most dedicated romantic comedy fan will find much to enjoy in this film. It is a scar on the face of romance, and doesn't deserve to be seen by anyone. And for the love of all that's holy, please stop giving Kate Hudson these scripts.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Something Borrowed

Something Borrowed is not one of them Ginnifer Goodwin is certainly getting used to playing perennial single woman. As Rachel, she is an almost replica of her character in the far superior and that's saying something, 'He's just not that into you'. Working at a New York legal attorney office, Rachel is a good girl. However, after her 30th Birthday party and a lost Chanel handbag, she falls into the arms and in bed with Dex.

42,Psyche-8,"Something borrowed, something troubling",6,24 September 2012,"I saw this film at the cinema after seeing a trailer for it. I was expecting a romantic comedy and while there are comic moments, I would describe it more as a romantic drama.Perpetual good girl Rachel White (Ginnifer Goodwin) has always been insecure. So much so, in law school she missed her chance at a relationship with her best friend Dex (Colin Egglestone) by being afraid to admit her feelings for him or see that he was in love with her. After hearing Rachel tell her lifelong friend, outgoing Darcy (Kate Hudson), that they are 'just friends', Dex lets himself be pushed into a relationship with Darcy. A few years later, Dex and Darcy are engaged and Rachel is still single and unable to completely forget her feelings for Dex. On the night of her 30th birthday, Rachel finds herself thrown into company with Dex after Darcy has gone home early. Having had a few drinks, Rachel lets her guard down a little and light-heartedly confesses to Dex that she's had a crush on him since law school. To Rachel's surprise (she assumed he knew), Dex is stunned and impulsively kisses her. The next day the two of them wake up in Rachel's bed, having slept together. And so it begins...I had some issues while watching this film due to the subject matter. The trailer that I saw did not reveal that Rachel and Dex slept together, merely that they had kissed and in my opinion, while a kiss would have been bad enough, having full-blown sex is something else. As the audience, we're meant to be mollified somewhat by Dex's revelation (early on) that '(Rachel) was all I ever thought about in law school' and he later goes on to admit that he assumed Rachel had never returned his feelings because she effectively set him up with Darcy. It also doesn't take Dex long to tell Rachel he loves her. But, I'm sorry, however you dress this up, cheating is cheating. I remember watching this film and thinking, ""How can this possibly end well?"" While we're sure that Rachel is a more suitable partner for Dex than Darcy, what they're doing is still wrong and thus I found it difficult to root for them.Of course, as it turns out, Darcy is no angel either and Rachel and Dex end up living happily ever after but believe me, there is some very uncomfortable (definitely non-comedy) viewing until the story reaches its resolution with some tears from me, as well as cursing at the screen because Dex treats Rachel appallingly for a large part of the movie, essentially stringing her along while he dithers over how, when and indeed if to end things with Darcy. Meanwhile, Rachel lets herself be treated like a doormat and while her and Dex do end up together eventually, I worry about whether letting a man walk all over you beforehand is a good starting point for a relationship. Just because they're together now, does that mean that Rachel won't let Dex treat her that badly again? Will the two of them now be completely honest and open with each other? I have my doubts.Having said all that, the film does improve on second viewing and if you can park your moral conscience for a while, what follows is a quite touching story of two people who are completely in love but have both made stupid mistakes that they must do their best to overcome before they can be together.

I even saw a couple especially good ones this year. However, I can't quite say that for ""Something Borrowed"". It's not that this was a bad movie, because it wasn't. Everybody gave a good performance, and the characters were welcomingly flawed and damaged, yet, ""Something Borrowed"" has a fondness for formula and clichés that ultimately hurts the end result.The story follows Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin), a woman who's never gotten what she's wanted. She had a big crush on Dex (Colin Eggelesfield), ever since law school. One night, on a semi-date with him, he meets Darcy (Kate Hudson), who he falls in love with immediately. Fast forward some time, Dex and Darcy are engaged, and Rachel is turning thirty. Due to drunken behavior, and not-quite-healed wounds, Rachel and Dex have a fling, and the film is about the downfall from that.Ginnifer Goodwin isn't a particularly good actress, yet I like her. She has a kind of cutesy flawed type-A personality that brings this kind of character to life. I liked her in ""He's Just Not That Into You"", an ensemble romantic comedy which I felt that she kind of held together. In this one, she's the heroine you're supposed to root for, and yet it isn't easy to. She sacrifices so much of her potential happiness on her jackass of a best friend. She lies, cheats and betrays everyone, yet, in the end, she owns up to her own issues, which I liked.Kate Hudson was the best thing in this one, for me. Her antagonist Darcy was much better thought-out and realized than the rest of the characters. She plays the bitch awfully well in this one. Soap opera alum Colin Egglesfield is a welcome addition to this soap opera of a story. He does a nice job, he's pretty to look at, andthat's all he really has to be. ""The Office""'s John Krasinski was very good, being the voice of reason among all of the mess going on.What kills this one for me is that it ended almost exactly the way I expected it to. A lot of the characters are reduced to stereotypes, and they never quite come to life. If these characters had more room to work with, and with a better writer, this could have been a fantastic movie. It feels chaotic, yet at the same time, it has a slow pace. It has soap- opera feel, with sitcom-y jokes thrown in. It has a few good moments that almost make it a good movie, but in the end, it falls flat.Apparently, this was a best-selling novel by someone named Emily Giffin. Also, there was apparently a follow-up novel, telling this same story from Darcy's perspective. I can't help but think that would have made a better movie.",Something Borrowed
44,pyenme,"Not SO bad, just not good.",5,13 October 2019,"I see all the bad ratings for this movie, and don't get it. Of COURSE it has an idiot plot (Siskel and Ebert bemoaned them all the time!) that could have been resolved in the first five minutes, but then there wouldn't have been a movie. That said, it was a lesson in standing up for what you want - and unfortunately, hurting people along the way might just happen, if not intentionally. I did cringe a bit at Kate Hudson's self-righteousness when she finds out her friend and boyfriend have been together when SHE got pregnant from her affair... And yes, I wonder how 20-30 somethings afford apartments in NYC that must be $7000+ a month, based on what I have seen online. Final opinion is this is an okay little movie that I didn't mind watching.",Something Borrowed

46,Houmatt,Not for guys,2,8 May 2011,"I saw this film because I met Emily Giffin, who was kind enough to give me a signed copy of her book. I was nice elsewhere, but not really honest. Here, I will be honest.First off, I find it hard to believe Darcy and Rachel have been friends as long as they have. Realistically, Rachel has serious boundary issues in that she allows Darcy to force her way in and take just because she can. Throughout the film, Darcy displays an ""it's all about me"" attitude. I would call someone who behaves like that a lot of things, but ""friend"" is not one of them.Second, why does Dex have to be such a mama's boy? And why is it implied Dex's mother is depressed, and only her son's marriage will make things better? Third, I am glad I didn't read the book. If the film is like the book, then just like Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, it was written with a particular audience in mind, and it is not middle-aged men. And it is not accessible to anyone outside of that target audience. So don't come to this film expecting ""Steel Magnolias.""",Something Borrowed
47,sara2520,I understand the hate,9,4 September 2017,"I understand the hatred for this movie by both sexes, but I love this movie. It's one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time. Emily Griffin, the author and screenwriter of this movie, bravely tackled areas in her stories that others don't and I enjoy many of her stories and the universe she created where all the characters are connected somehow and you can see the progression of the characters in different stories. Most of the hatred from this movie comes from the Darcies of the world whether you're male or female. Yes, Darcy, the best friend,did knowingly take Dex, the object of desire, from Rachel six years ago, but most of the audience is on the side of Darcy. Because even though Darcy was obnoxious, Rachel broke the girl code by sleeping with her best friend's man and in a way taking him back from Darcy six years later. The majority of the viewers dislike the characters of Rachel and Dex because Rachel betrayed her best friend and Dex cheated on his fiancée with her best friend. These are two things frowned upon in our society. And then add more dislike if you had this happened to you in real life. This movie draws you in and depending on what side you're on whether you relate to Rachel or Darcy determines whether you like this movie are not. I never had the close female friendship like Darcy and Rachel had in the movie. Most of the girls I befriended or try to always stabbed me in the back or took advantage of me like a Darcy. So I relate more to Rachel's character and even though Darcy played wonderfully by Kate Hudson was so much fun, I rooted for Rachel like Ethan ( John Krasinski) did. Ethan was a combination of two characters from the book and represented more of the audience's viewpoint about the relationship of Darcy, Rachel, and Dex and helped move the plot forward since both Dex and Rachel acted passive aggressive about their predicament. Every Rachel needs an Ethan in her life for motivation to move forward.The movie was well done and very much like the book since it was written by the author with only a few alterations, which is why I took a point off. The editing and music were amazing. The casting was perfect and looked and acted just like the characters of the book. Kate is the perfect Darcy along with Ginnifer as Rachel, Colin as Dex, and John as Ethan. I loved the locations. New York and the Hamptons became characters of the story too. I loved this movie so much and watch it on repeat. The only things I didn't like was coming towards the end when Ethan declared his love for Rachel. It wasn't in the book, came out of left field, and made absolutely no sense. It weakened a perfect character. The other part was the ending when Darcy turns and smiles at Rachel like all is forgiven. Another part that weakened a nearly perfect movie. Darcy doesn't forgive Rachel until the second book Something Blue. I'm disappointed that since this movie has received so much hate and six years have passed, the second movie is unlikely to happened. The actors are now in the forties and all were on board for a second movie years ago, but the critics trashed the movie. I actually like Something Blue as much as I like Something Borrowed. Something Blue would have been about the redemption of Darcy's character and her and Ethan getting together which is why the final scene is of Darcy running after Ethan in London. Yet, I loved this movie, loved the friendship between Darcy and Rachel. I have so many favorite scenes in this movie but one of my favorites was the Salt and Pepper dance scene when they did all the popular hip hop dances. A coworker was the one who introduced me to this movie and paused the movie to break down the name of each dance step. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie. If you're a Rachel of the world who sits back and let someone else take everything away from you, you''ll like this movie. If you are a Darcy and hate when someone breaks the girl or bro code, have been cheated on or betrayed by your close friend, you're going to hate this movie and it will make you mad.",Something Borrowed
48,ja-191-280465,"A wacky, roller-coaster of love movie.",4,10 July 2012,"""Something Borrowed"" is one of those silly, brainless romantic comedies that we've all seen before. Two best friends Rachel(Ginnifer Goodwin) and Darcy(Kate Hudson) are in love with the same guy Dex played by Colin Egglesfield. Only one is about to marry him while the other is secretly in love with him. Pretty soon, Rachel and Dex acknowledge their feelings for each other and the two decide to carry on a clandestine love affair. What's worst is that Rachel has been in love with Dex ever since college yet she's never had the courage to act on feelings for him until Dex and Darcy got engaged. And that's when the insane, melodramatic saga begins. After a few wild nights and a day or two in the Hamptons, it becomes clear that the only character worth rooting for is Ethan, Rachel's guy pal who forces her to act like an put adult and admit the truth about her feelings for Dex. Overall, the movie contains a pretty decent cast. However, there is absolutely nothing to be gained from this movie. There's no need to over analyze anything because the ending is so completely obvious before it actually gets there. The two leads Darcy and Rachel are both morally conflicted in more ways than one. Darcy cheats on Dex while Rachels sleeps with him and steals him away in the midst of their engagement. I'd much rather watch ""The Notebook"" for two hours than watch this atrocious, romantic comedy-wannabe again.",Something Borrowed
49,pjlb2008,Hilarious romantic comedy,9,24 October 2012,"This movie is hilarious. Kate Hudson's clueless, self-centered grandeur is unforgettable. All other characters, even the less important characters are memorable. The personalities of all characters are well-developed. The personal relationships among the leads have a ring of truth. The humor is not contrived. The plot is not contrived. The plot flows from beginning to end. The ending is surprisingly strong. You will laugh. You will cry. You will think. The movie illuminates how much the fickle hand of fate can affect a person's happiness. One of the better romantic comedies I have seen in a long time.

50,BoredNow33,Total Lack of All Morality,2,28 July 2020,"Ok, so do most movies have true morality? No. Movies are an escape from reality and the rules and morality that goes with it. But usually there is one or two good people in a movie. This movie had one, sort of, who was severely underused and cliché.Every character was unlikable. Even John Krasinski and Steve Howie, both actors I love. Steve was his typical ditzy playboy, which he plays so well. He was funny, but completely unlikable. John Krasinski was supposed to be the voice of reason in a group of reasonless people. But he came off as whiny and unforgettable in the movie.Onto the main 3 characters: Kate Hudson, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Colin Egglesfield. There is not one pleasant quality about any of them at all. They are all awful, selfish, horrible human beings. They are all cheaters and liars and complete backstabbers who couldn't care less about the people in their lives they are supposed to love. If I had friends like these, I wouldn't need enemies.I get it, it is a movie. But it was not enjoyable to watch, it will not be something I will want to remember, and it would not be something I recommend to others to watch.2 stars for at least getting to see John Krasinski and Steve Howie in something, even if I didn't like their characters.",Something Borrowed

Then one of them becomes pregnant in the Hamptons. The brunette goes to London to find herself, but all she finds is John Krashinski with open arms. The audience is forced to feel bad for John Krashinski, but I did not. I felt bad for the dippy guy's father, who didn't get his way when he wanted dippy guy to marry Kate Hudson. Sometimes you don't get everything you want in life, Dippy Dad. Deal with it.There is apparently a sequel coming out. I think it should focus on John Krashinski becoming a serial killer.

54,batudingin,Weird movie with mediocre performance but still enjoyable,9,12 July 2011,"You can really tell when something is made from a book. It has wonderful understanding of the whole situation. It also has a better point of view of third person rather than the first person. And this movie has them all.I love Kate Hudson at many movies, but somehow she chooses to be shallow and comedic drunk in a way that people know she is not. That certainly makes me hate the ending of the movie in the way Kate acts. You know what I miss after seeing Kate? Drew Barrymore. Even Goldie Hawn would put a better performance here. Having said that, I think Kate is a great actress with really bad taste and or advice from people around her regarding the material that she should choose.I love Ginny, but after seeing her so long in the conservative arena, Big Love, it is hard to picture her as this independent not happy person. But she still pulls it off. Having said that, there are better actress out there that deserves this role in this particular movie.The Guys was crap. I like a lot of the actors in other shows, they bring in The Office style of comedy, Shameless weird way of comedy, And the other cosmetic metropolitan man. This is not a good thing. A bit too much of everything in the end. Should have cast better instead of just focusing on easy marketing.The story is great, too New York without the feel. Doesn't remind me at all with 'New York I love You' or Nick play list with Michael Cera, which is both a great story about the city. But this story has the entity of Love and Friendship, in general. I would love to read the book now, Hopefully the next saga would be having other actors and actresses. Since this one closes the book. But the story has enough twist and turns in the last 30 minutes to actually draws your perception from a bad movie to a good movie. Hopefully they make the next movie better.",Something Borrowed

It made me laugh, I loved the romance, despite the negative reviews, I thought it was a good film.However throughout the years, the more I've watched it, the more I dislike the characters.If Dex and Darcy had been dating and engaged for a couple of years, that would be one thing and more understandable. But they've been together for SIX years and Rachel hasn't only found anyone else to date, ever, but Dex and Darcy have spent many years together and now they're about to get married and buy a house. And Rachel and Dex have finally been honest about their feelings for each other all these years and they finally get to make love and all that Jazz.I looked over the cheating part when I first watched it, thinking they deserved to be with each other and how Darcy wasn't that great if a person. But rewatching it, they're all not that great of people. The only logical, decent person is Ethan. And he's completely right when he tells Rachel that Dex is being a douche, just leading her on, and she's acting like a pathetic, no self-esteem girl.The ending is fitting, but I think Dex needs to be single for a bit. He jumps from a six year engagement straight into a relationship with Rachel. I think if there was a sequel, he would act scared and dip out before their wedding as well.But if you're looking for a corny chick flick with John Krasinki, give it a go.

56,moossaboossa,A little underrated,8,7 May 2011,"By far, 'Something Borrowed' is not an Oscar worthy masterpiece. But as far as chick flicks are concerned, this one was very enjoyable. Unlike many movies I've seen with a similar storyline, this one focuses not only on the present but also on the past. In fact, if you're able to see past the shallow plot, you'll find that there are some actual thought provoking ideas behind 'Something Borrowed'. The movie deals with choosing between what's morally right and what's right for one's happiness. Various characters seem to dwell on the past, and it therefore also addresses people's inability to forgive themselves for past mistakes. Personally, I could really relate to some the issues the character's faced, such as Ginnifer Goodwin's regret over making the wrong choices which therefore altered her life. The movie often veers from being a typical Chick Flick to a Drama, and some scenes brought a little tear to my eye. The acting was excellent, the actors performances very convincing, and some scenes (such as flashbacks) were very well directed. Admittedly, there was some back and forth within the story, and some scenes were added purely for reaction- but overall, this, to me, was a great flick for a rainy Saturday afternoon.",Something Borrowed
57,reysia,This story wasn't the best romance i've ever watched but this movie surely inserted various value and things to be learned in relationship especially for men.,6,2 April 2012,"This story wasn't the best romance i've ever watched but this movie surely inserted various value and things to be learned in relationship especially for mens. Many good things can be learned from Ethan and bad things to avoid from Dex. The story isn't one of teenage story because its complexity. But, I don't really like the idea of heading forward for the past which was done by Rachel and reflectly done by Dex in this movie. This story is romanticly and dramatically served but not so good in the end.I'd like to frame my point in Dex figure. Dex is a gorgeous man but not so good in personality. I know it's very hard to choose between marrying Darcy and turning to Rachel. But, that didn't mean he can hang those two girls like in this movie. Mens have to decide. Girls don't like being hung by mens, right? Lessons we could learn from Dex' story is mens must have the courage to decide and ready to accept the consequences. Don't be greedy or you'll just fail yourself. Why would he take Darcy since the beginning if he had a crush on Rachel. Err..nonsense.The second thing that we should learn is ""don't make too many assumptions"". Dex and Rachel were making assumptions each other that end their 6 months relationship. They liked each other but assumed the opposite each other. Well, that was another lesson to learn from Dex. Mens probably should have the courage and initiative first.On the other hand, Ethan was a perfect mate for Rachel though she doesn't wonder him at all. Ethan has a good personality that mens eventually should have. Ethan is my favorite character in this story. :)Love may come emotionally but it has to flow both logically and emotionally.",Something Borrowed

It was believable, as the characters really drew me in. Most of the time, chick flicks seem cheap with unbelievable obnoxious characters. But this show showed a little more realism and heart. There were good sides and bad sides to all of the characters. Okay so most people will end up hating Darcy because of what she did concerning her fiancé, and the fact that she treated the lead so badly. But there were moments where she did sincerely seem to have a heart. She was a selfish person. But she also had amazing qualities of being able to let go, have fun, and be a strong opinionated woman. A lot of strong people are a bit ""selfish,"" so the two qualities can naturally go hand in hand.The lead (Rachel) was also interesting. She cared greatly and always wanted others to be happy, yet she had weaknesses and did not stand up for herself. Personally I only half liked her character. My favorite was the ""best friend"" (Ethan). He was funny and actually spoke the words that the audience was probably thinking. I would have liked to see him and Rachel get together. I think that would have turned out the best for all parties. Having two weak people together is not going to lead to the healthiest of relationships. I can see the communication breakdown already as Rachel carries on with fake smiles and hides her feelings when something goes wrong.I thought I saw a little jealousy in Hudson's character. I found it interesting that she stole the man (Ethan) that she knew her best friend had interest in, and then cheated with the man (Marcus) she thought was going to make it with her best friend at the beach house. It seemed like she wanted what her best friend had, from controlling her every move, making her a servant, and stealing any man who had interest in her.Needless to say, this movie's plot and message was terrible. Interesting, yet did not provide any worthwhile morals. People did bad things and got rewarded in the end and the only good guy gets left in the dust. Well, okay, it did have the moral of standing up for oneself and taking chances. Though, it sort of ruined that moral at the end when Rachel said how much she missed Darcy and lied about being jealous of her just to placate her. After that little scene I wondered whether she had learned anything at all from her new found freedom from her master. Anyway, hopefully no one who hasn't seen Something Borrowed is reading this due to the spoilers, but I would recommend watching it if you like chick flicks in general. It's a fun little ride and has its romantic parts.",Something Borrowed
65,ptomley47,"Enjoyed a predictable romance, a adaption of Pride and Prejudice",5,27 March 2019,"Can I just say it was predictable from the word go. Also I had a huge feeling that the genders had been transposed and it is a 'reworking' of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.I have not read the novel it was based on but even if the genders hadn't been transposed it would have been predictable. The cliche girlfriend confidante/ gay friend
The female producers have not produced anything slightly enlightening to the female experience for me.
I was really surprised how good Colin Egglesfield(Dex) was but Kate Hudson (Darcy) looked old enough to be the Dex's mother's sister. In the scenes where they're together I kept thinking they look like sisters. (Darcy)Kate Hudson reminded me of Bette Davis, Joan Crawford or Tallulah Bankhead in one of their extreme characterizations
Ginnifer Goodwin looked like a young Sally Field but I would have like her to dress more couture/upmarket/conservative only to differentiate her character her more from the brash 'loud' Darcy. So Dex would have gone for the quiet well dressed professionally ambitious hard working woman over the Darcy character. In Pride and Prejudice there is also a Mr Darcy character that falls in love with an insignificant 'sparrow' of a woman with no background and ordinary looks

68,thdudeabides,Good acting ruined by a shockingly shameless storyline,4,1 April 2021,"By definition this movie is a romantic comedy as there is romance and comedy in it, however you cannot overlook the absolutely shameless storyline that the 'friends' are embroiled in. The acting is good and the character personalities do come across well as we do learn a lot about the characters, even if the arrogance and shallowness of some characters is at times overbearing. Ultimately though I honestly could not believe what I was watching and how one could even root for any couples like you should do in any romantic comedy. I found it almost criminal at how long the movie took to address the heinous act the story filters around.The main character is quite likeable but you cannot forgive the acts of betrayal that actually happen. The fact that these scenes are also shown with a romantic soundtrack is just as shocking at trying to justify. The movie in my opinion left it far too late to try to justify any of it. The revealing scenes should have been shown a lot earlier instead of two thirds of the way through, at which point you have already endured cover ups and near misses that do more harm to the likeability of the characters you are supposed to be rooting for. If the revealing scenes had been shown earlier then maybe you would be a bit more accepting of the storyline. This is of course meant as a twist, but it just makes the characters more twisted instead of the story itself.Overall, you are left wondering what exactly the message is that this film is trying to convey. It is probably trying to express that true love will triumph no matter the consequence. However, the message I saw being expressed was that life is too short so one must do what is wrong, no matter the consequence, to get what you want. Whatever it is, the ideology is sending a dangerously confusing message to any young adult watching the movie.",Something Borrowed

The problem with the ""mistakes"" everybody, except for the gay friend of Rachel, is constantly making in the film, is that they are so bloody obvious. And not only that: Ethan, who mysteriously falls in love with Rachel, although he is gay, constantly tells her, what she's doing wrong, to no effect. So when the audience is already biting their lips, Rachel still acts like an idiot over and over again. This is simply unbearable.",Something Borrowed

Is it a finely crafted film, with a riveting script? No, but it was a good way to enjoy a Sunday afternoon with a friend.Kate Hudson, Gennifer Goodwin do a good job making the friendship believable and warm, which could have been difficult considering their different temperaments. Colin Egglesfield is so handsome and those eyes can make you forgive a someway stiff performance. John Krasinski steals the show though, with his spot on delivery of the best lines in the movie.Be sure to stay until after the credits for a little bonus blip.Hoping they do the next story, John Krasinski would be fabulous.",Something Borrowed

I'm maybe getting older, but it's nice to see the settling down couple contrasted against the worried loner in middle age (maybe that's because it's familiar!) and I guess other (teen rom-com) movies explore this theme often enough too, but little is said of these people's lives except the romantic journey they're caught up on - unfortunately this results in two dimensional characters that exchange advice like it's going out of fashion.It won't break your heart or show you something new, but it's a refreshing, enjoyable movie.",Something Borrowed
74,jamesebsmith,Something Watchable,8,22 December 2011,"I'm not a regular watcher of soppy chick flicks but Something Borrowed left me feeling okay – I could even make it a habit. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Rachel, who's suffering a very premature mid-life crisis at 30. She has a romantic fling with her best friend's fiancé, Tom Cruise look-a-like, Colin Egglesfield. Kate Hudson plays the dim but bubbly friend, Darcy, and Egglesfield plays Dex - a stereotypical all-American boy - put upon by his stiff parents, but all round nice guy.The resulting love triangle plot is wholly predictable but saved by good acting performances, a feel good factor – that you have to buy into to some extent – and some funny moments. An excellent performance by John Krasinski, who plays Ethan, as the cuddly but astute friend of Rachel, seals Something Borrowed as a comedy well worth checking out.",Something Borrowed

77,skfla500,I think this is DEFINITELY a chick flick.,1,15 October 2011,"1st: Gennifer Goodwin. I should give this another couple of stars just because shes in the movie. And she looks great. Maybe Goodwin is not a hotie-hotie but she is definitely a hot cutie. But even her cuteness (and believe me, the entire movie revolves around her being cute & vulnerable) could not make this movie the least bit interesting.And Kate Hudson? She is bad in this thing. I've liked her in some other movies but I just found her annoying, very annoying, in this one. I'm sure most of us have a friend or two somewhat like her. But if they were like Hudson? We, unlike Goodwin, would probably start a schedule to take turns putting Prozac in her morning coffee. I did feel for the fiancé though. Facing a lifetime of living with the Hudson character? Wow.I didn't find any one scene in the movie that had any flavor or reality to it.I'm not certain even a lot chicks would like this movie. Maybe the girls who seem to want the guys that are already taken? The grass is always greener? But I recommend that you don't waste your time. Even if you like Kate Hudson or Ginnifer Goodwin. If a chick flick is a must, find something else.I don't want a refund, I want the 5-6 hours (it truly felt 5-6 hours long) back.",Something Borrowed

I find no excuses for it as to hurt someone and betray someone in such a way is despicable but i also found it verry hard to like Darcy. Theres no clean cutting, she was a b**ch. She was self involved, selfish, arrogant and entitled. No one deserves to be cheated on though. So for that i also disliked at the two lovebirds Dax and Rachel. I mean how long did it take for them to get their act together and realise they love each other ? Only when hes about to get married? Its ""My best friends wedding"" all over again.Dax was being undecided and a jerk to be honest. Wanting rachel but practically shoving his relationship with Darcy down her throat and then he expects her to stick around and just watch them be playful with each other. I mean yeh its nothing more than she deserves since she did sleep with an unavailable man but still he was a jerk for wanting that for her.The only person i loved was obviously Ethan who was funny and the only likeable character. (Also i have a little crush on John Krasinski so that helped) Why couldnt rachel just be with him? He would be great for her and treat her as she deserves. Ah how i wish. Way better than fickle Dax.Anyway overall. A fun, drama filled movie. You were rooting one minutes them booing the next. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.

By that, I mean that they keep making poor choices (all of them) and as a viewer, you don't sympathize with them enough to make them nice enough to identify with anymore. The only good thing about this movie is John, even though this role isn't different enough to get that ""The Office"" guy label off of his forehead. The actors, in my opinion, aren't all that bad.

80,movieexplosion,"Romantic Drama, not a comedy. Not for Guys",1,16 May 2011,"First off this movie has been marketed as a romantic comedy which is not the case. Sure it has some humorous moments and indeed seems to start off as a rom-com but it becomes serious.The main character Rachel loses out on a potential boyfriend Dex to her best friend since childhood Darcy(Kate Hudson). Several years later and Dex & Darcy are engaged and on the night of her 30th birthday Rachel ends up sleeping with Dex whom she still has feelings for.This movie certainly has something to say about the nature of affairs and the moral conundrums that they can cause and at times this movie is tough to watch. Overall it is mildly entertaining and personally I'm more of a fan of rom-coms and that is what I was expecting. In fact I think this is a Chick-Flick in the strict sense of the word as these days romantic comedies tend to be somewhat entertaining for men too, this is one for just the ladies I think. John Krasinski as Ethan, a friend of Rachel is good as ever and playing Tim from the office as usual but I'm not complaining, use what works, Jim Carey, Will Ferrell, Clint Eastwood & Robert De Niro have been doing this for years to good effect. If you really just want to see him in a leading role check out 'Away We Go'.Anyway this is a movie just for the ladies. Rom-com's are more suitable for couples I think and this is a drama which focuses pretty much exclusively on romance.",Something Borrowed

84,acidictrip,Horrendous mess. Avoid. Like. The. Plague.,1,25 January 2015,"SPOILERS!! This is hands down the worst romcom. A total lack of redemption and spine from any character, and a horrendous plot if there is one and if ever there was one. At one point, that I air-slapped one of the leads. Kate Hudson and Ginnifer Goodwin should move on from this genre. But I guess in Hollywood, if you are a hot blonde, you are doomed to always play the rich, dumb, partying, skimpily-clad blonde,and if you are Ginnifer Goodwin, well, you are basically typecast as Ginnifer Goodwin. All the actors did a good job, but when the plot is so terrible, no amount of good acting will help and this movie proves it. Rachel (Goodwin) and Darcy (Hudson) are best friends from childhood. Rachel is the smart, plain-looking, yet pretty-in-a-way brunette, Darcy, the above-described blonde, Dex (Egglesfield) is the handsome, rich lawyer, and Ethan (Krasinski) the only sensible one in this mess. So, Rachel and Dex really like each other all through law school, but Rachel has a pathologic need to hand over the good things in her life to her best friend, because she thinks she doesn't deserve them, despite obvious evidence to the contrary. In reaction to that, Dex doesn't ask her out either. On her thirtieth birthday, Darcy, who by now is engaged to Dex, throws a huge party for her, after which she gets drunk and ends up sleeping with Dex. This is where the movie starts to fall apart. Rachel and Dex start to meet secretively and realise that they have always loved each other and are meant to be together, but they'd rather sneak around behind Darcy's back and spend romantic nights, than own up and deal with the consequences. Instead, Dex is house-hunting with Darcy and upon seeing him with Darcy, Rachel tries to make him jealous by sleaze-dancing with his friend, Marcus. Dex hasn't an iota of courage to come clean to Darcy and instead, when his father warns him to forget Rachel, he stares blankly instead of standing up for himself and the woman he loves. To make matters worse, Darcy confesses to Rachel that she cheated on Dex with Marcus and when she asks Rachel if she should still marry Dex, despite everything, Rachel gives the thumbs-up. Ethan (Krasinksi) figures out what's going on, but he loves Rachel, and wants the best for her and keeps telling her to do the right thing, in vain. When he gets sick of the charade, he even tries to make things right, but Rachel breaks his nose before he can say a word. Way to go! Finally, after what seems like eons, Rachel does admit her feelings to Dex, and Dex, being the coward that he is, chickens out. Rachel gets upset and goes to London to where Ethan has relocated by now (probably to escape this madness and keep his body intact, I don't blame him). Ethan tells her that he loves her, that unlike with Dex, she is his first choice. Rachel gives an awwww-but-I-don't-love-you type expression and of course, Ethan ""understands"". Rachel returns to New York City, because after all, her best friend needs her at her wedding. Never mind, the fact that she slept with said BFF's fiancée and stabbed her in the back, but who cares, right? When she gets back, Dex is waiting for her, he has called off the wedding and they run into each other's arms. Darcy then shows up at her place and tells her that she is pregnant with Marcus' baby and despite the spineless Dex hiding from her in the kitchen, she finds his jacket and understands the truth. She is mad at them and shouts, 'I hate you!' to Rachel and leaves. Two months later, Dex and Rachel are together and Rachel meets Darcy on the street, who tells her she is happy, patting her baby bump. She is better off without these toxic people in her life. She eventually ends up in London and is last seen chasing after Ethan, who can't seem to catch a break from this craziness and is seen running away from her. The writers made Darcy cheat on Dex only so that she'd seem worse and they could redeem the lead pair. The worst part is, when Darcy first meets Dex at a bar where he is with Rachel, she proposes that he ask Rachel out to which Rachel says no and that they are just friends. Only then does Darcy make her move on him. Even after Dex follows her out and asks if she is okay with him dating her friend, she acts as though she is fine with it, though she clearly has tears in her eyes and every fricking pore in her body is screaming no. Rachel is the worst excuse for a friend, Dex, for a man and a fiancée. Darcy is made evil just to end this never-ending crapfest. The one star is for the line when Ethan says to Rachel, 'You and Dex deserve each other, he won't leave his fiancée to be with you and you don't have the nerve to ask for what you want.'

The main characters are so terrible. They try to spoon-feed us Rachel GOOD and Darcy BAD, But wait... Darcy tried to get her friend the date with the man of her dreams but she rejected him, not once, not twice, but three times! We are also supposed to hate that Darcy is so selfish but wait, WHY is she so selfish? She is a bit demanding but the fact is she isn't selfish in any way that most brides aren't selfish .And OK maybe Darcy is a little selfish but mostly Rachel is SO saccharine sweet and backbone free ( great qualities in a lawyer!) that she can't say crap if she has a mouthful.Dex is pathetic. What kind of MAN just dates whomever he meets? What kind of well to do, good-looking, LAWYER (again!) doesn't have the mental gumption to say "" hey, girl I see EVERYDAY and like, want to get a coffee?"" Then goes on to date the girl he doesn't like for 6 YEARS?The characters I like though they also have their own levels of pathos as well, Ethan, Marcus and Clair. Marcus is a total Neanderthal, but he is also unapologetic about it and funny. In a different movie, i could wag my finger because he cheats but in this one, he gets a pass. Clair is so enthusiastic, she is sadly in love with Ethan but AT LEAST she shows courage of her convictions! Ethan is the only character that you actually come to love. At the end of the day, you just feel like what the HELL? This is insultingly bad. We are supposed to hate Darcy and you don't, you are supposed to love Rachel and you don't, you are supposed to feel sorry for Dex and you don't.

The premise, A good girl who is kinda cute (Goodwin) is overshadowed by her hot and vapid best friend (Hudson) and loses her college crush to Hudson. Hudson ends up engaged to the man and Goodwin is jealous and wants him. This film deals with friendship on different levels, girl girl friendships, guy girl friendships. It also deals with adultery and morals which the characters morals are very low. The problem with this movie is that Hudson and the guy who plays her fiancé are very unlikeable. Hudson while written unlikeable still does nothing funny or good for the movie. The fiancé guy is a pretty wooden actor and is holding down the other actors he works with.John Krazinski is the best part of the whole movie, even though not every one liner is funny, he seems to give the best performance.

Dex and Rachel both successful lawyers who reside in New York City, went to law school together and were secretly infatuated with each other for years. However as soon as they were getting close, Darcy interrupts the ""play"" and infiltrates their dinner and the rest is history. Rachel walks out of the bar/restaurant with tears in her eyes (unknown to Dex) but he still offers to take her home and goes after her outside on the sidewalk where she claims she is okay with what is going on between Darcy and himself. When the two are on the brink of marriage however, Rachel and Dex's hidden attraction is finally revealed.I think this movie is a microcosm of real life. Although Rachel and Dex should have been upfront with Darcy and true to themselves about their feelings and what they wanted from the beginning, it just goes to show that you can't hide from true loveit has a way of catching up with you. Ginnifer Goodwin's character, Rachel was a bit insecure and unsure of what she brought to the table and Dex was a bit shy and easily beguiled by Darcy's advances and intentions. Again we see this everyday in real life and we need to take from this movie what we can. Ethan performed the imaginary role of narrator or the voice within throughout this entire movie to bring some reality to the plot. Rachel allowed Darcy to walk all over her and get her way throughout their friendshipthis time Rachel wins. Yay for Rachelit's a chick flick and Colin Egglesfield is a cutie and such a talented actor who sometimes makes you forget that you're actually watching fictionI hope to see more of him on the screen in the not too distant future.

104,mariob-580-773242,Different from the rest,8,27 April 2016,"I am not one for romantic dramas but this one was eye-catching. The reason I don't see romantic dramas often is because it tends to ALWAYS be the same story over and over again: Girl/guy finds the other. they fall for each other, blah blah blah. There's no depth, there's no hook.This one has a hook. So much of a hook I feel this is on a borderline between a romantic drama and a self-discovery. It's more of self discovery from Rachel's point of view. At the root of it, she's discovering not who her heart belongs to, but finding her voice. She's finding her voice in what she needs to be happy, in this case, that's not only love but how she wants her life run (which is not by Darcy). One aesthetic of this film stood out to me: Editing: Non-linear storytelling. The flashbacks are done in a smooth way. They are all started from Rachel's point of view pin-pointing on a object that reminds her of a specific memory between her and Dex. The non-linear storytelling serves as a dive into Rachel's emotions.I felt the characters' depth well well executed. One thing I found interesting about the other reviews for this movie is that people rate it low because people didn't like the personality of the characters. Just because a person is the main character doesn't mean they have to be perfect. Rachel like Darcy like Dax are not perfect. I really enjoyed Darcy: She's this woman who has gotten EVERYTHING she wanted and not very smart, yet she is very persuasive. I feel the reason Rachel stays linked to her is that Darcy is a rep of what Rachel wants her life to be. Dax is a bittersweet character. He's follows his heart but is a wimp in the process. The twist with Ethan was great! I was expecting that because I've seen the youtube video, but It was still nice to see. All in all, I enjoyed it and would definitely watch it again.",Something Borrowed

Darcy and Rachel are BFF's and Darcy is weeks away from marrying Dex (newcomer Colin Egglesfield), Rachel's friend from their law student days. The problem is that Dex and Rachel have feelings for each other, what will they do? This is a really above average romantic comedy. It's actually believable and has real heart. The actors are excellent. John Krasinski steals the show as Rachel's author friend Ethan, he is remarkable. Colin Egglesfield holds his own for sure, and is great as the honourable but torn Dex. Kate Hudson is great fun and adds a real likability to an unlikeable character. Ginnifer Goodwin is sweet and not as needy as she sometimes comes across on screen.

Somehow the writers of this story want you to believe because Rachel has an inferiority complex ( see a psychiatrist Rachel you obviously have the money since you go to the Hamptons every weekend) that it is OK to steal her more confident and superficial ""best"" friend's fiancé . It is not , and they at no point during the affair when it was actually an affair show me that it should be . They do however when the affair can become a relationship and when the wicked witch has been knocked down from her throne , show me all her warts ***spoiler*** Cheating on her spineless wimp fiancé with an idiot named Marcus ,and getting pregnant. It was like they threw that in there to say ""hey what they did wasn't so bad she was doing it too , and she is horrible person. She deserves the pain they have given her cause she is a horrible person "". Well writers and Holly wood you didn't sell me on this , I would have liked the couple more had they faced it head on it could have saved the romantic comedy . Not focusing on the whole premise the movie was built around it was a decent movie . Really funny scenes between Ethan and pretty much everyone , He and the idiot were pretty much the best part of the movie for me , along with Ethan's stalker . I loved the movie when Ethan was there , the rest of it other than the anger I felt toward the main characters was a blur. To the guy who played Ethan never ever ever do a romantic comedy again ,not because you were bad but because you are the only thing that saved this movie . You could do regular comedy leave this place before you become the gay best friend for the rest of your career .",Something Borrowed

This was different. First, too many loose ends were left untied. Dex's fear of his parental expectations were never really explained, so it wasn't clear why they preferred party-girl Darcy (Kate Hudson) over the stable, classic, lawyer Rachel (Goodwin) in the first place.Then the issue about Notre Dame that quietly defined the ladies' shallow friendship was never resolved which would have been given perfect closure during inevitable confrontation between them.In the end, all the characters were liars/cheaters including John Krasinski's Ethan who lied instead of telling the stalker he wasn't interested. I guess that was the token ""gay"" reference that movies must work in or else they are panned in L.A. today.But with any good romantic novel or chick flick, the gentleman ultimately takes the lead and plays the strong hero to help the situation come to a satisfying conclusion. But here, the main love was a pansy of a character who didn't have the spine in college to say how he felt and didn't have the guts to stand up to his parents (what was that about anyway?)and it was Rachel who had to take charge and tell him how she felt, and it made Dex look even weaker.The show was stolen by Kate Hudson's performance but in the end she too was a liar and cheater.

It deals with infidelity, lying, betrayal, etc. The friendship dynamic between Rachel and Darcy actually reminded me a lot of my own friendship in high school. So trust me when I say people like Darcy exist. And it's draining to be their friend. They're always there for you and praise you, but somehow it's also always about them. I saw so many people being irritated by Rachel, but guess WHAT? People like her EXIST. The character isn't written poorly or exaggerated. I guess I liked this movie so much because it IS reality. And I liked this movie because it's not a clear cut ""she was wrong"" or ""he was wrong"". It's about a girl who was always second to her best friend, basically wasted her twenties, and finally put herself first in the end. So, yeah. Don't watch this if you wanted a light hearted romcom.

I plan on reading the book. Although each actor did an amazing job, I do think John Kranski was the shining light in this movie. I also was moved by the performance of Colin Egglesfield. There is one scene outside of a bar where you can see his torment; he doesn't say any words but his emotions are written all over his face and it was amazing. I could personally relate to being a relationship or making a decision out of fear and not taking the risk at achieving true happiness. I think that is the real message or reality behind this movie not whether or not Rachel or Darcy were right or wrong, good or bad. This movie reminded me that we all have choices in life about what makes us happy and we can only blame ourselves if we deny our true desires because we feel we are not deserving (Rachel) or if we are aggressive and abusing others in order to achieve it (Darcy). I thought this movie was very thought provoking about what motivates you or makes you happy and if you are living your life for others or yourself. It brought a lot of emotions out of me including anger, anticipation, and sadness. I think we have all been Darcy or Rachel at some point in our lives and that is relatable.

This is a typical chick movie so guys are to be bored if they are not into this romantic type of comedy. Ginnifer and Kate are very good. The classical friendship between Rachel and Darcy is nicely depicted. Ethan as a moral, and wise voice to Rachel is also a nice touch to the movie. Although the film might appear a little bit naive, it is really lovely to watch.I have to write something about the clothes the actresses wear. They are both dressed very nicely and in sync with their characters. You can see that the production crew thought about every detail.

I also thought there definitely was potential for the movie to turn around but the stupid behaviors of the friend(Rachel) went on for too long throughout the whole movie. It was in no way empowering, nor romantic. The most disappointing part of the whole story is that she remained friends with her friend while trying to woo him over. Too bad Darcy never found out what kind of person(character) she was. Even in the end, she disses her friend at her wedding. I really expected the movie to go a little differently than it did, OK a lot differently. Rachel ended up becoming the villain in the end.

Unfortunately this character wasn't even in all of the scenes and the other characters paid almost no attention to him.

130,sanived,"Not ""That Bad""",7,8 May 2011,"**Spoiler Alert** It wasn't that great, but it wasn't that bad either. I did read the books - first, there is so much depth and emotions to most of the characters, even Darcy and her relationship with Rachel, that it's near impossible to transcend onto the big screen. I did not go in with grand expectations, so I wasn't thoroughly disappointed, although I do believe they could have done more to develop the relationship between Rachel and Dex. I think that's the reason why Dex appeared so shallow -in scenes where he ""cried"", Colin Egglesfield also looked like he was battling a severe case of constipation instead of a moral conundrum...I really enjoyed watching John Krasinski as Ethan, and although I'm not a terribly huge fan of Kate Hudson, she did well as Darcy. I won't lie, in the book, I cried when Dex moved on from Rachel, but in the movie, I did shed tears when Darcy confronted Rachel about her betrayal. That was probably one of the most ""real"" scenes of the movie. In hindsight, I think it would have been a nice touch to have Rachel ""narrate"" the movie from behind the scenes - so that way, it would connect the audience more to her innermost feelings and if they decided to make Something Blue, they could do the same for Darcy.",Something Borrowed

I see about two to three films a week and it takes a lot for me leave my ten bucks worth of pop corn and soft drink in the trash and walk out in the middle of the film.The same scenarios were repeated time after time...we get it already, enough.The people looked the same in all the flashbacks, you couldn't tell if it was a flashback to the college days or not...confusing and didn't cut well as plot reinforcement. You didn't care about the characters at all as they were all so shallow, Kate Hudson is great but she couldn't save this snooze of a film. The pretty boy that played the lead over acted because he couldn't act and was totally unbelievable, typical model turned actor.The casting of the other characters was so expected and stereotypical it was pathetic.

132,rebrov85,Paint by numbers school of chick-flicks,3,15 May 2011,"In the last few months I have been fortunate enough to see a wide selection of good films, with offerings such as Limitless, Source Code and Hanna all providing me with many hours of entertainment. Sadly this run of form came crashing to a halt as I entered the cinema to see ""Something borrowed"".Luke Greenfield's romantic 'comedy' was always going to be a test for me as it is a genre of film that I certainly don't favour, but I tried my best to remain neutral and unbiased, hoping that it would turn out to be one of the few gems that you can watch with your other half without wanting to gauge ones' brain out with a plastic Ben & Jerry's spoon. Sadly this wasn't the case.Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a career-minded lawyer, who has grown up watching her best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson) succeed at everything despite her care free attitude and 'party-animal' approach to life. Darcy has even managed to get herself engaged to Dex (Colin Egglesfield), who was the focus of Rachel's romantic attentions at law school.Rachel gets the gift she has always wanted on her 30th birthday, as her and Dex share a kiss and end up spending the night together. She wakes up feeling awful, but is torn between the feelings of guilt for stabbing her best friend in the back and her desire to be with Dex herself.As we move towards Dex and Darcy's wedding date, we watch as Rachel and Dex are inexplicitly forced to spend more and more time together. With both Rachel and Dex seemingly the perfect couple, Dex then has to make a tough decision. Does he stay with Darcy to keep everyone around him happy or does he follow his heart and go with Rachel. Harrowing stuff indeed.My 2 cents One thing that irritates me about the term 'romatic comedy' is that it implies that films from this genre are actually funny. I went through the entire film without even a snigger.Ginnifer Goodwin is quite a likable actress but the dialogue given to her was predictable and bland. Her supporting lead Kate Hudson, in my opinion, is the most overrated comic actress out there. Her portrayal of the demanding party girl Darcy was purely awful. She did a very good job in showing Darcy as a truly despicable character - I'm pretty certain this wasn't Greenfield's intention. If Darcy was one of my friends I would have to fake my own death just to avoid her 'hilarous' antics.The American 'Office' star John Krasinski was even rolled in to provide some semblance of real humour as Rachel's good friend Ethan. However, his talent for cynical, sarcastic one-liners was wasted on a character that was simply not needed in this film.The main love interest Dex was a good looking lawyer type, but his character was so underdeveloped that they could have opted to lever a cardboard cut-out into each of his scenes.The main area that the film failed in was its inability to make the audience feel any kind of sympathy for the lead characters. Fair enough, Rachel was a nice enough women whose love life may evoke some form of pity but this still wasn't enough. The underlying problem was that despite making a lot of Rachel and Darcy's close relationship you got the impression that they wouldn't have cared if they never saw each other again (interestingly this was the only feeling I shared). They constantly lied to each other, moaned about the others' personalities and generally seemed to dislike spending time together. Deep down they really didn't seem to like each other much at all.With this feeling prominent, it makes me wonder why we had to watch an hour of Rachel and Dex dithering about the right thing to do. In my opinion, the right thing to do would have been to have never made this film.For me, this was a poor film. Not all rom-coms are bad but sadly this won't go down as one of the exceptions. It was from the paint-by-numbers school of chick-flicks, sticking rigidly to the formula that many romantic comedies follow. If you like films like this type of film, many of which feature Jennifer Anisten, then you would probably enjoy this film. Not for me though thanks.",Something Borrowed

I always like Kate Hudson and Ginnifer Goodwin's works and this one is one of them.There are some scenes you want to interrupt everything and explain what is going on, cause I think relationship between the main guy and the main girl made me a little bit bored sometimes. But then they putted a funny, tense scene and took me into it. I laughed hard, I felt sorry, I understood the way they felt, so acting was pretty successful.And if you are a John Krasinski fan, you should watch it. Because his character is really nice, his scenes were so much fun to watch. He was sweet, a loyal friend, funny, supportive and handsome. And made me smile every time he shows up.About Kate Hudson, I think she handled easily to show us her character, you understand the girl she plays, and somehow she makes you love her.So If you're looking for a movie about friendship, marriage, fun and parties, romance and following your heart, you should watch it.

It's a revelation of what truly is happening, even the people who think ahead could make mistakes. In this movie there's no villain, it's just bunch of friends who had different personalities and were caught up in a love triangle. I swear, if you give this movie a try you'll love it.

So when this movie came out, I immediately grabbed my friend to watch this because I couldn't hold my curiosity any longer. Kate Hudson, Ginnifer Goodwin, John Krasinski, and a Tom Cruise look alike that is Colin Egglesfield, very intimidating cast, yes? This is a very light romantic comedy, definitely not the most original one too cos its very predictable and like I said, very light. I love John Kransinski for the most part because he's the character that's in between everyone else, retaining the balance of the movie. I just find his sarcasm very charming, especially towards Darcy, although I'm not sure what started this sort of ""feud"" between the two (haven't read the book). What I don't get though is how Darcy doesn't notice this thing between Rachel and Dex, until towards the end of the movie.

The degradation of morals in America have come to a point of plain dirt, but of course that's what we're made from. It amazes me that Hollywood champions the ""goodness"" of man yet pumps out stories that literally scream out depravity. Oh how we need redemption Lord Jesus. A pig with lipstick on...that should be the American film logo. Darcy is made out to be this terrible friend, therefore it becomes okay to wrong her. Rachel is supposed to be the sweet, lovable type who constantly gets run over, therefore it makes it okay for her to sin. Yes SIN, that is the best word to describe the backwards ""progression"" of this debacle of a love story. This is a lust story. Love is not based on feelings & emotions but choices & actions. And Dex, is this guy really supposed to be some kind of knight in shining armor? He is a glutton...TOTALLY selfish. Something Borrowed is shameful as Hollywood & America once again mock the honor of marriage & fidelity. This is a movie of deception, the deception that if you just go for what you want (and feel is deserved), even if it deeply hurts someone else, YOU will be happy in the end. There are dire consequences to sin and the disregard of the feelings or emotions of others. This is a sinful farce of a fairy-tale. Smh",Something Borrowed
142,lweidenauer13,I really LOVED this movie,7,11 June 2014,"This was a fun chick flick in my opinion, lots of morals involved here and a situation that occurs much more frequently then some people would like to hear. I don't condone cheating but sometimes you have to go where your heart is and in this movie Rachel was merely reclaiming what was hers in the first place. Her BFF didn't really love him anyway and was also sleeping behind his back so I have no sympathy for her whatsoever. In reality Rachel wouldn't have let a hot guy like that go so easily to her BFF. One negative is that if you're going to portray someone as being less attractive than the other girl at least choose an actress that isn't just as pretty as the other. I enjoyed the comedy aspect of the movie too, JK is extremely funny.",Something Borrowed
143,madannsmom,SPOILER ** Good Romantic Movie,8,30 May 2011,"OK, so this is not an Academy Award winning movie! But did anyone really think it is? What it is, is a cute, happy ending movie that has one of the most handsome guy (Colin Egglesfield), with some sinfully gorgeous eyes, in it. Kate Hudson does a good job of being selfish and happy-go-lucky, Ginnifer Goodwin is very sweet and plays her part well, and John Krasinski is WONDERFUL as the go to one liner guy! I was happily surprised at the ending, which gets screwed up in so many other movies, The Breakup, My Best Friend's Wedding to name a few. If you are looking for a good, sappy, girlie movie,this is a good one, but don't see it if you are looking for an Oscar. The guy who plays Marcus is also very cute, but his part was downplayed, as was the ending. SPOILER **Be sure to hang out and see the last scene in the credits (hopefully we will be able to catch up with the sequel), which teases you about Something Blue! Hopefully John and Kate will be back to make us laugh with a little romance in London! I hope that we will get to see Colin Egglesfield get more comfortable in more movies.

I see this movie as someone finally after 30 years putting herself first! Finally putting her happiness above all others. Why is that wrong? Yes the timing sucks and I'm the end she looses her best friend, but isn't that life? As for someone who has a hard time finding their voice and a hard time putting myself first, I find this movie beautiful. I think GG did an amazing job and will back this movie till the end of time.

145,SarahRT,Worst. Movie. Ever. Made,1,27 March 2015,"I saw this movie years ago, and whenever the subject of worst movies comes up, this one is always #1 for me. There are movies that stay with you because they are great and tell great stories that stick. This one sticks for all of the wrong reasons. I am kind of disgusted that there are human beings that like this movie at all, because I don't think the characters portrayed in the movie can possibly all exist together in the same social circle without the universe imploding on itself. The unlikable levels of nearly all of the characters are off the charts. It must set a record for the highest amount of unlikeable characters in a movie ever. All of the women remotely associated with this movie should have their woman-card revoked. This is a vile film and horrible plot for women, and I would say also pretty bad for the men too. Seriously, we should have a national holiday to annually remember the tragic events that lead up the the making of this film, and vow to never subject humanity to a movie remotely like this ever again.

I only watched through to the end because I knew it was going to end with a big revelation, it was inevitable, but I just wanted to know how. But seriously, don't waste your time, the storyline is not original, the writing cheesy, the acting even worse! The only redeeming quality was John Krazinsky's character, which the rest of the cast treated like crap the entire time, he was the only good person! Ugh I hated it hated it.

148,amyfromar_98,Great movie!!,10,16 April 2017,"PLEASE READ ME! This is a great adult rom/com. If you are not mature enough to understand this movie then you will probably give it a bad review which a lot of you have. The break down is Darcy: ""borrowed"" the love of Rachel's life one night while Rachel was on a date with him (Dex) in college, Dex: thought Rachel wasn't interested & that she had set him up with Darcy, Rachel: the weak, no voice, never stand up to Darcy, best friend that she was walked away that night because she ALWAYS let Darcy win... Darcy was SUPPOSED TO BE the best friend, she knew Rachel had feelings for him, she knew they were on date, but did she care no, not at all, & that had been the story of their friendship since day 1. The day of Rachel's birthday she was blowing up Rachel's phone at 7:30am because she needed something and when she no longer needed her she hung up promising she would call her right back but did she? No, Dex called at 9:30pm & Darcy took the phone, he even had to remind her to tell Rachel happy birthday... So to those of you saying Rachel ""stole"" her best friends fiancé, you are just too immature to see the bigger moral picture of the story. Rachel finally stood up for herself & took what was hers to begin with, Dex. I absolutely LOVE this movie. I watch it at least once a month. I am planning on reading the books & I can't wait for part 2 to come out Something Blue, where Darcy ends up with....ETHAN!!!",Something Borrowed
149,greekalygirl,"Those who hated it, missed the point entirely",8,25 May 2019,"I never could understand the reason behind such hate for this movie. It's based on a book, yes, but since when are movies ever better than books anyway?
With that said, this movie is relatable to me. When it first came out, I was in my late 20's, close in age to the characters in the movie, with a best friend I've known since I was 10 years old. Hence, if you are a chick who has a lifelong childhood friend who is 30, you will probably love this movie. If you didn't, you missed the whole point.
People who review it, want to say it's ""immoral"" or has ""bad acting"". News flash: reality for a lot of people, IS immoral. Many women deal with this kind of situation everyday. Yes Rachel was a doormat, but we all have that one friend. And yes, Darcy was a selfish beotch, but that's how a lot of women act these days, especially in a city like NYC. All in all, I thought the actors were perfectly cast.. the acting? Kate Hudson is always great, and John Krasinski is an amazing comedic actor. Ginnifer Goodwin has played better roles, but she did a good job as the submissive, never-sticks-up-for-herself-friend Rachel. Colin Egglesfield is pure eye candy, bearing a very close resemblance to a young Tom Cruise, it's easy to see why these two women are both head over heels for him,
This movie is not meant to be taken too seriously, y'all. It's a light comedy with a look at what it might be like if you were in love with someone who you never thought would like you back, let alone marry your best friend. The truth is, there are more than likely people like this, who are in a similar situation, but never had the nerve to tell the other person how they felt.
For those who bash the movie - you're completely missing the point of it. The moral? Life is too short to go about it, never telling people how you really feel. If you don't, your decisions might later on prove to just benefit someone else, someone you might even know personally. And if so, you might have to live with the mistake of seeing it right in front of you everyday.
Lighten up people. It's a movie. Appreciate the humor, the message, and most of all, the moral of it. How's that for being ""immoral""?

No morals or like-ability to any of the characters. I had to keep watching it, just to see how they actually ended this mess!Unfortunately I like many of the actors in this film, but this has done them no favours. I'm still confused by the plot and why random people were brought in for zero reason.Worst rom com I've ever seen.

The acting is as wooden, shallow, and unconvincing as the sets. New York has never looked so soul-less and hollow.The protagonist is a coward who spends the entire movie pathetically waffling like a toddler who can't decide on an ice cream flavor.

The author of this story wanted to get into real life characters instead of the usual romantic funny ones so she made everyone as stupid, evil, and sinful as the worst person you know. The only character I like in this entire film is Ethan(John Kransinski) who is the voice of reason among this group of idiots and he is hardly in the film at all. Rachel(Ginnifer Goodwin)is suppose to be the heroine that you sympathize with and hope will have a happy ending, but you have a difficult time liking her after you see how horrible she is a decision making and what bad taste she has in men. Darcy(Kate Hudson)becomes more of a jerk as the movie goes on and you would be glad she doesn't marry Dex if it worn't for the fact that they deserve each other.

What saddens me is that I try to watch his movies objectively and while I feel he is an extraordinary talent, I think he will always be typecast as JIM from ""The Office."" Now many actors over the years have had this happen to them but is it fair and can it be undone? So many reviews of every movie he is in say he acted like Jim in the office. Well, he is on every week. They see him every week yet he goes out of that mold and is, IMO, a wonderful actor.The movie is NOT your typical RomCom and delves a bit into the lives of people in and around their thirties who realize that life is a serious venture and they have to address it so. Read between the lines. Since no one is married here, there is no infidelity but it does promote premarital sex in a very strong way.

157,racheldennae,"I like fluff as much as the next guy, but we are SMARTER THAN THIS",1,23 October 2021,"The star goes to John K. As we all love him for being just different enough yet just the same enough in every role. He's funny and clever, kind and intelligent and the real catch. But guess what? He's also the only person in this movie with a brain and guts and some kind of moral compass (except for one uncharacteristic misstep). He goes to London for his book and obv. To meet Emily Blunt and they're MFEO, so all's good there for me. I'd take away a half star for the pathetic admission of ""like"" in the sunset of the movie - which I can't actually fault him for as much as I can the god-awful writing. I have watched a few doosies in my day - I can even be specific and say I've seen the two main characters in some doosies. Ginnifer Goodwin seems to be doomed to be the silly, slightly nerdy (albeit gorgeous - I mean... In real life true nerds are not nearly as beautiful and stylish), well-meaning, and she's-sweet-and-innocent-so-we-all-root-for-her character. Which is sad because she's not a bad actress. And Kate Hudson plays.. well, Kate Hudson. *Eye Roll* It's like Gigi from ""He's Just Not That Into You"" is best friends with Andie from ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" except she's not faking the airheaded bitchiness, it's her real, vapid and unbearable personality. I don't know why they think we love airheads, bitches, and women with bottom-of-the-pit self-worth, but they must. Otherwise, what motivation would they have for churning out one piece of garbage after another? Maybe it's so we can throw all these hits into a dumpster fire and heat the city for a month. Oh, and I would be remiss if I forgot to mention the two token supporting characters. Yes, it gets worse. We have behind door number one, the overly-zealous, eager friend who supposedly falls into Ethan(John K)'s unlikely trap of ""sex-only"", and now she's confused to the point of pursuing him to a cringey degree which is odd because he is boldly speaking his mind the entire movie EXCEPT when he is talking to her. The attempt to drag that storyline through the entirety of the movie leaves them with the ""only"" option of using the tired and a bit outdated fake-gay storyline. And behind door number 2 is the mildly attractive and charming, yet incredibly douchey and inappropriate ""best friend"" of the male lead. Yet, we have zero reason to believe these guys would be friends except maybe a moment near the end when we realize Dex is probably marrying Darcy for the same reasons he is friends with this idiot. Which is?? He has awful taste in close relationships? And his dad is Dex's dad's realtor??? Ooookay. As usual, the ending is as predictable as they come and the ""right people"" end up with the ""right people"". This in of itself is a contradiction because in the real world, it takes time for people to have the courage to do what's right and what is healthy. You don't just jump from toxic to perfection. And don't get me started on this GARBAGE ""friendship"" and the pukey push-and-pull they tried to sell. Like I give a shit if you ever talk to me again you thoughtless wench. And guess what? I love a good mindless flick. Turn it on and bask in the nonsense. Fine. But sheesh. Make it make sense at least. Incredibly boring. Worst hour and 47 minutes of whatever excuse for cinema this is. It dragged and dragged and by the time it got to the end it felt like a big fat, ""I guess that's it."" DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.

The writing is so chaotic and the story itself is morally corrupt. Everyone in this movie sucks except for Ethan (our lovely John Krasinski). I wish everyone would have ended up alone except for Ethan. Everyone is lying and cheating and being toxic. Dex sucks because if you've liked someone for six months you don't start dating their best friend. Rachel sucks because she slept with her best friends fiancé and she couldn't tell her best friend that she was in love with Dex. Darcy sucks because she crashed her best friends date with a guy she was in love with and then stole him and then later cheated on him and got pregnant by a gross dude. But also Ethan sucks because he told a girl he was gay to get out of dating her. Miserable awful people having everything work out well for them? That doesn't happen in real life.

162,alwaysfirstnature,Rachel has severe character flaws,1,11 October 2021,"Rachel in the film Something Borrowed is a friend no one needs. Her traits on the surface are sweet & innocent however she has an underlining side of jealousy & envy. Darcy is ambitious & outgoing and maybe a bit self centered but I know she would never lower herself enough to do something as dirty as Rachel. The film tries to paint Darcy in a light that is unfavorable to the masses so that it makes up for how Rachel sleeps with her fiancé but in truth the bad friend is in fact Rachel, the one that would continually sleep with her supposed best friends future husband. She had the chance to make him hers 6years prior but she chose to remain friends with him. I am not sure why this writer tries to make us feel empathy for Rachel when she had the choice to be with the guy first, she chose to take a backseat for 6 years. It's too late at that point you're an adult & made that decision you have to move on and live with it. She willingly broke a lifelong friendship for a guy & broke another woman's heart to feed her own desire, this is selfish beyond all measures. This is not a true friend. Nothing about this film was easy to watch but if anyone can learn from this, never take a backseat for the things that you want & most important watch for ""friends"" that continually compare themselves to you, they are more likely to have major character flaws such as jealousy, envy & selfishness.",Something Borrowed

166,hilda-gastelum,Missing the point.,6,6 August 2012,"This is not a great movie. in fact, it barely passes as a good movie. However, i find that most reviews are missing the point, or are holier than thou goody two shoes with the naivety of a teenager. This film is all about the messy complications of being an adult and people seem to either ignore that fact, or not care, in which case, its not the movie for you. is it obnoxious and arrogant? yes. if that is what they were going for, it was brilliantly cast. Kate Hudson, Steve Howey, and the actress who played Claire were amazingly cast if they were going for 'characters you want to punch in the face'. John Kransinski did a good job of playing Rachel's best friend, but I did also find he was a bit of a traitor. the way he almost continually throws Rachel under a bus is something i would never forgive from any of my friends, even if he meant well. and his admitting feelings for her at the end was cliché. it completely undermines everything he does in the movie previously, as having an ulterior motive, instead of just being a good friend. it makes him look like a sabotager, in my opinion. it also ruins the relationship coming up for Ethan (if you read the books you know what i'm talking about) and it makes it look second best. Colin Egglesfield and Ginnifer Goodwin (as she always does) saves this movie. both actors and their chemistry bring a much needed vulnerability that keeps you rooting for them. I admit that I wasn't as emotionally invested in the film until the ""4th of July date'. with one teeny little line-'i didn't think someone like you, would like someone like me'- the whole movie made sense. Dex and Rachel's insecurities and lack of self confidence were both well displayed in this movie, and you gotta give them props for trying to be selfless and do what others wanted instead of what they did. it wasn't like Darcy was any good to them anyway. she was terrible, so it makes it easy to really root and feel for them.",Something Borrowed

168,iheartmuffin,"Ignorance Is Bliss, And A Happy Ending",2,10 February 2012,"Speaking as a 21 year old female, as a ""target"" audience member, this film missed, by a long shot.What was portrayed in the trailer of this film is certainly not what you get. Luckily I didn't end up spending any money to watch this film because in the end I would have severely regretted it. What you get from this film is a cast (apart from Ethan's character) of self righteous assholes who are too afraid to deal with their problems and let it spiral out of control. The only voice of reason being Ethan, who was drowned out by the deafening sound of the other characters constant need to proclaim their victimization. The delusions, whether purposeful or complete ignorance, were completely far fetched, only adding to my distaste for the main characters.Rachel, who is supposed to garner the sympathy of the audience is portrayed as the victim and unrightfully so. She spends the entirety of the film blaming others for ""taking"" what she wants when really all she had to do was ask for it or at least try. I found myself almost offended that the writer(s) of the film would ask me to emanate some sort of empathy for Rachel. Her life is a product of what she has done or lack there of. She had no right to be upset with Dex or Darcy after the first night at the bar when she should have spoken up or one of the countless other times before Dex and Darcy were engaged/on the verge of marriage. To continue her charade throughout the film was both irritating and utterly far fetched, especially to ask me to feel any sort of happiness of deservedness on her behalf at the end of the film. Darcy was exactly who the film makers wanted her to be, the ""antagonist"". Not to state that she was protagonist by any means. To me Darcy was a lazy/unoriginal direction to take a character who needs to be the bully to Rachel's passive submissive role. Her undeserved scene near the end when she finds out about Dex and Rachel only fuelled my distaste for this film. Foremost for her to feel hurt when she did the same thing to Dex was laughable and as per the role hierarchy did the trick to make her seem horrible, which she was. However to ask me to feel sorry for either Rachel or Dex in that moment is pushing it and unacceptable to be honest. They're all adults and they know what they're doing.Dex remained a constant reminder of why relationships can get to such ridiculous points. Now I'm not saying it was JUST him or it's JUST men in general by any means. If he really ""loved"" Rachel that night at the bar as he claimed, there would have been no need to go out with Darcy or continue a relationship with her. If he was unsure of Rachel's feelings and wanted to see if she had any interest (although I'm not sure Rachel could have made it any clearer) before settling for Darcy, there are these things called phones or conversations in which people can discuss things and ask questions before making decisions that ultimately effect feelings and lives. For Dex to have his little thing with Rachel on the side to ""see"" if it was something just goes to show how unsure he was that he ""loved"" her. Maybe I'm just old fashioned but if you love someone, you don't need test things out and have another person on the side just in case it doesn't pan out so you're not left alone in the end. Seems romantic right? The only redeeming character in this film is Ethan who ends up alone in London after telling Rachel everything she'd been pining after for 6 years. But hey, he's only the best friend and not as ripped as Dex, so we knew that couldn't go anywhere. I'd like to think the voice of the audience, or those of us watching with any sort of intelligence or ability to see past the ""OMG IT'S SUCH A ROMANTIC LOVE STORY AND HE'S SO HOT"" nonsense, is spoken through Ethan. Everything I wanted to convey to the other main characters was appropriately spewed at them courtesy of the only conscious character. I'm glad he was left alone and across the ocean from them, they all deserve each other. So I suppose what you're to derive from this film is do whatever you want regardless of feelings, do NOT make decisions that will compromise your need to let things ""work themselves out"" or ""see where they go"", be a victim until you get the chance to be unworthily self righteous, hide secrets until consequences arise and don't deal with them accordingly, don't listen to advice from someone who has your best interests at heart because it's making you take a look at yourself and your choices, and don't worry because in the end everything will work out and you'll get everything you want, if you're not Ethan.All in all a complete flop as a romantic chick flick and a solid A+ for making me yell at my screen like a fool.

I always said this to my friends ""don't introduce your wives to your best friend cuz he knew all your dark dirty secrets"" :).About acting, can be better. This was a typical formula movie. Directors/writer etc. what were you thinking????????????????? Same old love triangle story not a very good plot but i have hoped to see something new will happen soon but no way man. At the end i just like to say to everyone to please ask Entertainment industry to.................... come up with a good idea/ideas and make a movie based on that but not like this one.thanks for your time.",Something Borrowed
170,wal777,Great movie!,10,15 July 2012,"I love this movie because it rewards the unlikely hero, which is Rachel. The prettiest girl doesn't always get the guy. It is funny, smart, has a bit of drama and romance. Love it, love it, love it. A must see movie. For sure! All the actors are wonderful, good casting. And if it was actually filmed in New York, it was beautiful, I am glad it did not have a lot of profanity. The guy that plays Dex was new to me, but he was perfect for this role, handsome and smart looking. I just want to say that the producers and directors did an awesome job! If you watch this movie you will not be disappointed. I don't have much more to say about this movie. My summation says it all, great!",Something Borrowed
171,foosey-snarf,Something Taken,3,28 June 2011,"This is you're basic romantic comedy. I went into the theater thinking it would be predictable, but to my surprise it wasn't. I was very disappointed about how it ended, focusing only on the main characters and forgetting about an important sub-character. John Krasinski was funny to watch, the other actors were nothing special. Many of the scenes were very cliché, and almost boring to watch. Kate Hudson is the same character she always is, a bad friend (Something Borrowed, 27 Dresses, Bride Wars)and a bridezilla (Something Borrowed, 27 Dresses, Bride Wars). If you plan on watching this one, I would suggest waiting until you can rent it.",Something Borrowed
172,jule-groth,Very great adaption!!!,8,1 March 2011,"I've been able to watch a test screening of the movie in early February during the Berlin Film Festival in Berlin, Germany. I've been a big fan of the book(s), so I was really looking forward to how they adapted ""Something Borrowed"". First of all, the actors were great. I didn't expect it at first, but Ginnifer and Colin were just perfect as Rachel and Dex. They did such an amazing job and I was sitting in the cinema with a pounding heart the whole time. Kate and John were hilarious, but I didn't expect any less and just because of those two, I really hope they'll adapt ""Something Blue"" (the sequel to ""Something Borrowed"") as well. I've read the book a couple of years ago, so I don't remember every detail of it, but I don't think they left any major facts out. It's a great chick-flick. I'm not sure if guys will enjoy it much, but it's a great movie to watch with your girlfriends/mother/sisters, etc.",Something Borrowed
173,mishkascott,Kate Hudson was not suitable for Darcy role,8,17 May 2011,"From some one who has read the novel, Kate Hudson did not fit the part of Darcy. Although this may be a ""shallow"" observation, it is the basis for the entire premise of the novel's plot as well as the movie's. In the book and also in the movie, Darcy is described as one of those ""beautiful people""...a girl that sticks out among thousands. Kate Hudson may have been more suitable for the part many years back, but now she is nothing close to the character's description. Unfortunately, yet fittingly, an individual more like that of Megan Fox ( I realize she is not the best actor) or just anyone else like maybe even a younger Angelina Jolie for example could have fit the part just as well. The character herself, does not require an immense background of acting as she is a ditsy character all around.Even so, the movie itself stood close enough to the book for me to call it decent. Ginnifer Goodwin played the role of Rachel very well and although Ethan was not a huge character in the book, he worked well into the movie. But damn...Kate Hudson needs to stop taking roles she isn't made for.",Something Borrowed
174,AnnaSyl,Something Blew.,1,5 May 2011,"What an insufferable piece of garbage this was. Giffin's book is more nuanced, giving the characters in this story a complexity that makes them somewhat likable. The movie fails with this, and in all regards. Virtually every person who graces the screen in this film is detestable. Each is worse than the last. There's no one to root for here. There is only one way this movie could have been redeemed: if the Hamptons house these losers shared was torpedoed (with the cast inside) in the final scene. That's how difficult it was to endure this long, tiresome, insulting rom-com. If I could subtract points for SOBO's misguided inaccurate and one dimensional depiction of New York City as a yuppie transplant's playground (dutifully carried over from the novel) I would. And if I could subtract points for the rampant and blatant product placement permeating this horrific film I would. But I can't, I've already given this movie the lowest possible rating.",Something Borrowed
175,Pocket_boy,So morally conflicting!,3,6 May 2011,"I went in to this movie expecting a fun light-hearted funny romantic comedy. Boy was i wrong! It started out on an okay note with a tacky surprise party for Rachel (Goodwin) thrown by her life-long best friend Darcy (Hudson), and did i mention life long? We'll come back to that. well no more then ten minutes later Rachel has slept with Dex (Egglesfield) Darcy's fiancé. Now let me remind you that Rachel and Darcy have been best friends since early childhood.The rest of the movie is tennis game of rationalization and guilt with a few smatterings of clever witty one liners. and in the end Darcy and Rachel's relation ship is completely ruined and Rachel and Dex live happily ever after. In the final scene after Dacry has discovered the affair and not seen Rachel for two months they meet on a city street, and you think that maybe there is going to be some kind of redemption, but Darcy says to Rachel ""I bought him that shirt"" and you notice the dry cleaning held over Rachel's shoulder, a few more words are traded about how Darcy is truly happy now, and Rachel goes into the arms of Dex.The movie was a rationalization for sleeping with your best friends fiancé, and forbidden love prevailing. I was very disappointed this movie, purely on content, acting was pretty good otherwise....",Something Borrowed
176,rklein78,Good movie - give it a chance!,8,7 May 2011,"I'm not sure why everyone is giving this such bad reviews. It may not be the very best film I've ever seen, but it was entertaining and well acted. I didn't actually know that it was based on a book, but I'm interested in reading it now because I enjoyed the movie a lot.I think it was a good film precisely because there really was no clear-cut ""good"" character other than Ethan (John Krasinski) whose real role was to be the voice of reason. The rest all had flaws and were involved in various parts of the deception, which made it interesting. It moves you to think more about the characters when they aren't perfect and question their motivations.From the start, you can tell that Darcy and Dex aren't a good match, and that Darcy's antics are really too much for any of them to handle over time. The fact that Rachel turns 30 and starts to reevaluate her life and choices is pretty spot on - it's that whole quarter-life crisis thing. Then you add in Dex who is actually in love with Rachel, but faces a lot of outside pressure by his parents to fit into their perfect life for him, and you have a recipe for disaster in the triangle.The movie made me laugh and cry and stare in disbelief. The fact that evoked such different emotions was more than I was expecting for this film. I think you have to go into it thinking that it's more than just a love story, and know that you're not going to love everything that the characters do because their lives are messy and interesting. It's really a story about how people end up going down one path in life to suddenly figure out that they have missed the boat and want to get on board before it's too late.",Something Borrowed
177,drh5252,Sold my soul...,1,9 May 2011,"I sold my soul to see this movie. She asked me out to see a ""chick flick"" and I thought to myself, "" how bad can this be?"". Besides, think of the points I'm gonna make by agreeing to go! This movie was BAD..very, very BAD. The fact that it was opening night and sold out for several showings was somewhat promising; I mean, how many people could be this wrong about a movie? Next, after getting my second row seat, I surveyed the room...only 10 guys, maybe. While watching the dreaded ABC television previews, the noise in the room was unbelievable...the girl talk was so loud I could hardly hear my regret. And then the movie started. 15 minutes into it, I was feeling the walls close in...was already planning my imagined escape and counting down the minutes. Then the Title credit came on...it was just still beginning!! After hearing several oohs, aaaaws, and aaahs when the title man did something sweet, I was ready to chew my leg off to get outta this trap. This movie was so horrible that I actually tried to go to sleep, to no avail. This just couldn't be happening. Why...how did I subject myself to this? Even John Krasinski could not save this movie. I'm not sure what was worse, the dialogue or the acting. Be warned, this movie is not for the faint of heart...",Something Borrowed
178,alimacsd,Great Adaptation of the Book,9,10 May 2011,"Love Emily Giffin, her characters are always so intriguing, and this movie is a great adaptation of her book. And while Dex's is character is somewhat blah in the movie, he is fantastic eye candy. John Krasinski steals the movie with his portrayal of Ethan (the beach scene is laugh out loud hilarious). And for all the girls (and women) who have always taken a back seat because they think they don't deserve better, there is actually a lesson to be learned in this movie. The books, and the movie, are morally conflicting but that does not take away from the enjoyment factor. This is a great girls night out kind of movie and it could be a good date night movie if your guy is okay with the romantic comedy genre (it is certainly does not follow the typical romcom structure).",Something Borrowed
179,jjorgenson01,Worth It?,7,13 May 2011,"I read the book when it was first out, related with the characters. All in all, I thought it was a good movie as far as interpreting the book. I have read all the books and was sure to read them one more time before going to the movie so that I had a refreshed comparison in my head.Yet, I still couldn't help do what I tend to do after a movie and think about how I would have done it. Like have Rachel narrate, or cut out the part of Dex crying...he looked so awkward and constipated, at least make it look like he was really hurt. I wouldn't have made Claire that bad.The friendship between Rachel and Darcy was true, but I wasn't impressed with Kate Hudson's performance. It seemed like she had a hard time getting in touch with her character. She wasn't real until the end of the movie. The beach scene with just Darcy and Dex was awkward for people who were getting married, but when they are playing badminton was great. Ethan totally stole that scene and many others. He seemed to be one of the only ones that could make himself the actual character. I would have introduced Dex and Rachel's relationship by elaborating on them, it was about them anyway.I loved that Emily Giffin was actually in the scene where Rachel and Marcus were in the park, with the book 'Something Blue'. I do think it would be great to keep going because as much as I loved the booked 'Something Borrowed', I think that the transition into 'Something Blue' will give you unexpected.So I did enjoy the movie, even going into it with no expectations from being disappointed so many times after I read a book turned movie. I laughed, I cried, I related to the characters. I walked out of the theatre feeling good and refreshed. It's more of a drama than romantic comedy and I think it is worth watching. I will buy the DVD. It will be my feel good movie.",Something Borrowed

I wouldn't take my husband but I would take a friend bottom line :) I have to say upfront that I am a HUGE Emily Giffin fan and was a little nervous when the reviews of this movie were far less than fantastic...but I was not disappointed and neither will any fans of the book. It was a great adaptation. Definitely a must-see if you love the book!",Something Borrowed
181,carolcampedelli,did THEY read the book?,3,14 May 2011,"So, I'm a huge fan of the book. HUGE! I loved the book, but unlike most (weird) readers, I didn't like Rachel. At all. I truly believe that being a loser doesn't give you a reason to sleep with your best friend's fiancé. Period. But I'm not here to write a review on the book. The main thing I can think about is: did the producers read the book AT ALL? Or did they just get the names of the characters and some points of the story and turned it into a movie? From the beginning to the ending of the movie, I can only think of a handful of scenes that actually are in the book. Where was Hilary? What was Ethan doing in the country AND why was he doing Hilary's job? Where was Dex's WATCH? Darcy sees his WATCH, and he's NAKED IN A CLOSET when she catches them together. Like, WTF? I could go on and on and on about how much I hated this movie and how it has nothing to do with the book. Plus the fact that they make Rachel look like she always loved Dex so much, when in the book she says more than one time how she didn't feel a thing for him. Rachel is a loser who was always jealous of Darcy and couldn't do a thing to turn her life around. That's one of the best things about friends: you can choose them. In the book, Rachel talks non-stop about how much she thinks Darcy is an idiot and how much she didn't want to be friends with her, while in the movie Rachel feels so bad about what she did. They made Rachel look like she's the hero of all the losers, the average girl that gets the hot guy, the poor little girl who was always there for Darcy and Darcy was never there for her. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the actor that played Ethan was HILARIOUS and did a great job. It's not his fault that the producers are idiots. If it wasn't for Ethan's character (and Marcus's character too, actually), this movie would get negative 3847 stars from me. Just awful.",Something Borrowed

I mean it's about this guy who can't decide if he wants to marry his longtime fiancée or break it off and be with the one he truly loves. But, come on, isn't this what the majority of us would do? Plus, he was concerned about his mother's health. I don't know, maybe I liked it because I can relate to Rachel's character(my best friend too has the ""charisma"" of always having everything working out for her and gets all the attention, but love her nonetheless). I admit the ending was a bit weird. It was quite dramatic but I didn't expect a comedy. I mean it doesn't look like a movie with many laughs from the trailer.(although John krasinski was really funny) So people who complain about this don't really have a say on the matter. The trailer says it all. Also, there was this moment where Rachel tells her true feelings to Dex and I personally felt really awkward imagining me being in her shoes. True, Colin Egglesfield's acting was a bit bland but I think it worked out fine for the movie! I would watch it again, I really would. Especially on a rainy night, eating pasta and drinking wine. Loved it.",Something Borrowed
183,hadskunwar,Close. But no dice.,3,22 May 2011,"I don't mind chick flicks. I don't love them, but I also don't mind them. They're often light- hearted and make for a good evening out. However, I also don't like it when a relatively good story with strong potential is wasted by making it into a bad movie. The book wasn't great, I'll give you that. But the movie was worse. Kate Hudson was too over the top as Darcy (and blonde) and overall, the movie tried too hard to fit in all the ingredients of a ""standard"" chick flick: The great, good-looking amazing guy. The clumsy, not-so-obviously great looking girl whom everyone loves. The sympathetic, funny, sense-making friend. The gregarious, loud-mouthed party girl. The one who always gets left behind and of course, the gross-but-somehow-gets- the-girl through cheesy lines guy. They could've done so much better than that. It was a very unglamorous movie made from a very glamorous book. What a waste. That said, Ethan was absolutely adorable in this movie! His dialog was nice and he was spot on with his character. Bravo! Goodwin (Rachel) needs to stop taking these kinda roles. She is going to get completely branded.",Something Borrowed
184,geekgirl-66-635322,Written by someone who doesn't understand human decency,3,28 May 2011,"This movie (which I only just discovered is based on a book) was clearly written from the POV of someone who has never been betrayed, never been hurt by a trusted friend and/or lover, someone who thinks you should do what feels good, without any consequences.I don't need to reiterate the whole storyline, as that has been done in previous reviews, but let's look at a few key points. Rachel loved Dex in college. Dex may have had feelings in return, but as soon as the beautiful, vivacious Darcy shows up, he's like ""bye-bye""to Rachel with nary a backward glance. Considering Darcy and Rachel are longtime best friends, we know Rachel and Dex have seen one another many times in the ensuing years, and yet it isn't until Rachel's birthday that they suddenly realize they really love each other? Come on! Ridiculous.Rachel and Dex sleep together. Okay, I can buy making a mistake, even at the cost of hurting a friend. But then, a normal person, who's as sympathetic as we're told Rachel is, would certainly back off and make it right, not continue down the path that will destroy her friend.Finally, Rachel realizes she loves Darcy, and can't hurt her, after offering herself (stupidly) to the cowardly, cheating pig Dex. She goes to London, and is told by her male best friend Ethan that he loves her, that she is ""home"" to him. Who wouldn't at least give a guy like that a chance? And lets keep in mind that he's the only person who has always been honest with her, unlike the rest of her ""friends"".So what does she do? Leaves London, and when Dex shows up to tell her he called the wedding off, jumps into his arms. Really? So she learned NOTHING during the whole drama? At the end, when she runs into Darcy, we don't get the resolution needed between them, and when her phone rings, I just knew it was Ethan. Then she rounds the corner, and it's...Dex??? Just how brainless is this woman? I'm pretty sure a guy who cheated on his fiancé with her best friend will be loyal and true to Rachel. That's realistic, right? If you have even the vaguest of morals, or the slightest conscience, avoid this travesty. Seriously. Up until the ending, I actually enjoyed the movie pretty well, because I kept hoping for her to learn and grow. Instead, she took a huge leap backwards. Any sympathy I had garnered for her during her dilemma dissipated faster than mist in the desert.As for the acting, John Kraszinski stole the movie. Charming and charismatic, his was the only character at the end I still liked. Ginnifer Goodwin was fantastic in the role (not her fault the storyline is idiotic). Kate Hudson is annoying and almost unwatchable, nothing much there to relate to, until her last two scenes (discovering Dex's jacket, and seeing Rachel on the street). In those, the is immensely watchable, luminous and sympathetic. Colin Egglesfield is beautiful, though a bit stiff, and perfect to play the part of the swine Dex. Steve Howey and Ashley Williams as Marcus and Claire are hilarious, and though they didn't fit in with the drama of the movie, they were the only things slightly resembling the ""com"" part of romcom that this is being touted as.Just a side note, I went with my mom (age 70), my daughter (age 16) and myself (age 43) and we ALL agreed about this movie.",Something Borrowed

Each character has something special or a secret that shares with us or reveals at the end,a secret that can change many peoples lives in that story.We see that true love never dies and that friendship is difficult but if it has a strong bond based on love it could last even if things get a bit out of order.I loved each actor/actress performance.It is sure one of my favorite movies!I recommend it for people that want to watch a romantic movie with a meaning.",Something Borrowed

I mean come on, what is this 1989, where we need stupid films and ending? I wasted whatever amount of time in my day to watch three messed up people, 2 wafflers and 1 self-absorbed so-called set of 'close' friends, try and figure out what the hell they were doing in life. Which was essentially three people with really low self-esteem acting out and manipulating, either passively or aggressively, their ""so-called friends."" The only intelligent component to this silly film was John K's character. My room of youth rooted for ""Jim"" (The Office) to save the day which he attempted to do, but no, that silly female lead had to compromise her self-worth and choose that bastard of a coward and Tom-Cruise-but-taller look alike. I am eternally grateful that my child and her friends' snobbish private school education allowed her to recognize what a stupid and foolish girl the lead character was and to take it as a lesson of how to ""not be"" in life. They hated the two female leads for being cowardly and slutty and good on them for doing so.

The movie starts off with the characters cheating and continues that snowball effect throughout the entire plot. I love Ginnifer Goodwin and she is bearable in this role, but I've seen her out act this character in other projects and I hope she ventures out of the Rom com genre because I think she is capable of more. Kate Hudson on the other hand, I'm not the biggest fan of and it seems like she's played the blonde, controlling, mega beast friend one too many times ( Bride wars anyone?). John Kransinski was the only saving grace of this film, even though he was channeling Jim Halpert, he was the only one who made sense and spoke the truth! It annoyed me that Ginnifer Goodwin's character was running around letting the guy drag her along, one minute he wants her, the next he doesn't. And she was totally OK with being treated like a yo-yo. Get a grip, is this what successful women in their mid 30s actually put up with? I know it's based on a book, which no i didn't read...but come on. This love triangle formula has been done so many times, and this film really didn't add anything new to the table.

The supporting cast are strong and amusing, but not enough to save this movie from the skin crawling undertone of the story. I spent the first half of this film annoyed and hoping that the Rachel character may redeem herself and turn around this film.

Each actor contributes in their own unique style. I would have loved to have been on the set while this was being made. I have watched it several times and something stirs emotions and leaves me feeling good. Give yourself the opportunity to decide for yourself if this movie strikes a cord.

I wish they showed it how it was written on the book where in Dex and Rachelle are making love when Darcy knocked on the door. Dex hid on the closet shirtless. Rachelle let Darcy in, then after Darcy said that she's pregnant, she saw Dex's wrist watch(not jacket); the watch with an engraved ""DARCY"" at the back.

They are so good to watch because they make you feel good even when you know that happy ending is coming so sure as tomorrow. But this movie still made me wonder, why on earth did I waste so much time to see it. The disappointment grew as the end drew nearer. In my opinion it is mentally humiliating to watch a movie when the main character makes every effort so that she would remain single, at the same time considered to be an intelligent woman, and wanting this man so badly. She seems to be ignorant understanding the meaning and consequence of her words. Lets don't forget that she studied to be a lawyer. In the end she comes to her senses again. But not completely. The leading man character on the other hand lets to be dragged along. His actions would in the normal life almost with no fail suggest that he will remain this guy who marries his current girlfriend just because she wants it and because this is convenient.

And being mad at Dex for not making up his mind and being an ass even though you want him to be with Rachel! Its part of the movie to feel like that or else they wouldn't be portraying the emotions correct right? I don't see how that's a problem and that is how the characters were written. I think they adapted the book very well for being a book made into a movie. Yes a few things were left out, I wish they had mentioned the original time they met Ethan and Darcy tried to take him away from Rachel in middle school. I really hope that they do make Something Blue. It will add more to the story of Darcy and see her side of life.

That being said, most of the movie was pretty good and sucked me in pretty quickly. But then the end happened and I hated Rachel as a character and everyone involved in making this movie for giving it such a cliché ending. She let everyone push her around the whole movie. I thought that maybe there was just a glimpse of hope at the end, but no. Dex had toyed with Rachel for months and cheated on her best friend whom he was engaged to at the time. If he had already been having these thoughts and was a decent man, he would have broken it off before anything happened. I hated him almost immediately. But Rachel on the other hand, I actually kind of liked. I thought maybe, just maybe she would finally realize that she was too good for Dex and didn't need him to be happy. But no. She apparently was completely okay with the fact that he had been cheating with her for months. Of course he's not going to cheat again because they're meant for each other, right? Whatever. I've always found it really funny how this behavior is looked completely down upon in the real world (as it should be) but is practically praised in Hollywood because everyone just knew that they were soulmates. The end of this movie was utter and complete crap, and I use that word because there is just not another one that will accurately and intelligently describe my feelings.",Something Borrowed
198,spyguy-48966,Writers wanted to be edgy,2,3 January 2021,"Clearly the screenwriters and writers didn't want to create a romance movie to prove their morality but to ""tell a story of people with bad morals"". Evan (Ethan, because I called him Evan numerous times to my wife) was the only redeeming and leveled-headed character in this entire story. I can imagine the people pitching this and a board of directors saying ""oooo this is so off-kilter and edgy, I love it!"" without thinking to themselves if anyone would actually enjoy a story as terrible as this one. Not to mention they probably thought ""we are totally going to trick people into thinking she's going to get with Ethan"", only to find out that the trickery is a shallow attempt at a revolutionary romantic story based in a reality that can only be written by day drinkers who ran out of ideas.Sure I'm upset Ethan didn't get a chance but the writers clearly wanted to tick someone off, guess I'm their guy! (clearly Ethan wasn't anyone's guy)",Something Borrowed
199,kayrawnsley,Thoughtful,8,16 January 2017,"This was a thoughtful evocative movie. I thought it was psychologically correct - there are people like Darcy (narcissistic, selfish and fragile) and also people who, like Rachel, put others' needs before their own. Both characters appear to be protecting their fragile egos, the only way they know how. Their methods differ but they seem to need each other. Rachel's realization that she needed to 'step up' and say, and do, what she wanted showed growth and maturity. I note that many reviewers highlight the 'unpunished' infidelity as a reason to dislike the movie. In my humble opinion I thought that this is what made it more realistic. Realism, however, is not what makes a great movie. It is more likely the ability to identify with the characters and whether they effectively tell our stories. Nonetheless, when the movie is very realistic it may evoke a defensive reaction in the viewer. This movie appeared to have that ability given some of the reviews I have read. Darcy had been unfaithful to Rachel for many years by pursuing her suitors. Rachel was unfaithful to herself and then to her friend Darcy by having sex with Dex, Darcy's fiancé. Dex was unfaithful to Darcy and to Rachel. Ethan was the only faithful, truthful character...and he ended up alone. Yeah, it's not moralistic this film. It presents us as we truly are...complicated, flawed, vulnerable. I'm going to watch it again.",Something Borrowed
200,sakshirahurikar,Horrible movie.,1,5 October 2021,Disgusting. What is the movie trying to normalize here? That it's okay to hurt your childhood best friend and cheat with her fiancé? That's okay all because Marcus keeps saying if roles were reversed Darcy wouldn't hesitate? In my opinion I don't think she would ever do this to Rachel. The first half of the starting was okayish but the later half is absolutely trash.,Something Borrowed
201,shadehalbznes,VERYYY ANNOYING,1,16 June 2018,"WHERE DO I START?? *takes a deep breath*
i don't know how some people enjoyed this movie,not funny not fun just annoying. first lets talk about darcy, "" the villain"" who ""takes"" what other people want 
we gather that she was always in the spotlight and she always ""won"" according to our beloved main character rachel, and apparently also very dumb since rachel had to correct her grammar in some occasions, NOBODY cares if you say ""him and i"" or ""him and me"" its not like she said "" i goed to the party and there was a lot of peoples"" .
oh my god they tried to make her look so crazy and bad so we can sympathise with her fiancé ""dex"" cheating on her and her best friend betraying her
and let me tell you i did sympathise with them because they (the characters) are so stupid.
first of all ""Dex"" or should we call him ""dek"",who has a crush on his friend, entered a relationship not to mention PROPOSED to ANOTHER woman he doesn't even like that much. then he proceeded to cheat on her with said crush and have loud intercourse with the fiancé while her best friend is downstairs who IS BY THE WAY HIS CRUSH. still he has the audacity to be jealous that rachel (his crush) is with another man i mean?? why would you put yourself through all of that? i know were CLEARLY supposed to hate darcy and root for rachel but rachel makes it hard for me, she's so unlikable i mean yes i guess she's nice but its kind of part of her problem,she's a complete pushover and does nothing to help herself 
for example: she quietly puts up with her friend that bosses her around all the time,well honey you can have a conversation with her or cut it off ,there problem solved.she could've avoided this whole situation by telling her friend she likes this guy. she is so weak and thinks if she just stands there doing nothing and ""suffering"" she's gonna someday god knows when be satisfied and happy
lets not forget they're all 30 ( i think) full grown adults i mean haven't you guys matured but at all since you were 14?
AND WHATS THE POINT OF ETHAN SUDDENLY HAVING A CRUSH ON HER?
but at least the actor who plays kev in shameless was in this movie",Something Borrowed

204,kalash-39081,Horrible,2,28 January 2019,"In the beginning you find it a nice story until you get to the middle or after the middle, simply it was a horrible ending breaking 3 hearts to combine two hearts together. Darsy, ithan and clair are left heart broken , the senario was very awoful and darsy is pregnant come on he should not end it like that and ithan vanished himself to london what a funny ending.",Something Borrowed
