0,TheLittleSongbird,A night of fright and fun with Fright Night is a true delight!,10,17 September 2011,"I love movies of all genres, and Fright Night was an example of a movie that I watched many times as a 14 year old and loved every minute of it. At 19 I revisited it once hearing of its remake, and it is every bit as good as I remembered, in fact it is one fangtastic(pardon the pun) movie. The film still looks great, with atmospheric costumes(great authentic fashions!), sets and lighting with skilled cinematography, cool make-up and impressive(even for now) effects. The score gives its film its perfect sense of quirkiness and creepiness. The story is straightforward admittedly, but also very well paced and compelling, and the script has the odd scary moment but is very wickedly funny. The acting is great, William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse appeal, and Roddy McDowell is magnificent but it is Chris Sarandon's funny, creepy and very sexy performance that makes Fright Night such a delight. All in all, a true delight. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Fright Night
1,Leofwine_draca,Fun vampire spoof ably mixes the laughs and gore,7,19 July 2016,"FRIGHT NIGHT, one of the essential vampire horror films of the '80s, succeeds in being a far better spoof of the vampire genre than Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS. Whereas Polanski's film tried too hard to be funny, FRIGHT NIGHT lets the horror and comedy flow in equal amounts, and often the two feed off each other to produce this enjoyable and campy tribute to the vampire film. Horror film addicts (like myself) will enjoy the many references to other vampire films of the past. McDowall has a portrait of Bela Lugosi on his wall, and there are many clips of horror films playing on television sets, from THE PREMATURE BURIAL to THE SCARS OF Dracula. Even the theme of vampires not being destroyed unless the protagonist has absolute faith, explored in Dracula HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE, turns up again here.The cast all do good jobs in their roles, and happily this time the female heroine (who looks strangely like Stockard Channing in GREASE) has more to do than sit around in a flimsy negligee and scream (although, unsurprisingly, she does both during the course of the film). William Ragsdale is likable as the hero who nobody believes and whom everyone thinks is merely paranoid, a theme resurfacing these days in the world of conspiracies. Chris Sarandon is a cool and suave vampire, and acquits himself well with the role, putting across a sense of raw power and hypnotism, just like Christopher Lee did before him.Stephen Geoffreys is memorably nerve-wracked as Evil Ed, however it is Roddy McDowall who is the real star of the film, as fading star Peter Vincent (obviously reference to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price here). He looks the role perfectly, and is great as the rather timid hero who doesn't actually believe in vampires and turns white at the thought. While the plot of the film is nothing particularly new (and a lot like that of THE 'BURBS), it stays fresh and frantic enough to never delve into the clichéd territory of THE LOST BOYS.The makeup is also remarkable, with the spiky fangs and coloured contact lenses being very similar to the makeup job done in the two Italian DEMONS films. In some instances the vampires even look quite scary, which is no mean feat. There are also two excellent disintegration scenes which are worth tuning in for. The shots of a skeleton burning and melting against a wall look very strange and different, I'm not sure if these were animated or not but they certainly stand out from the other rubbery offerings we have come to expect from '80s horror films.With a wry nod to the horror genre in general (McDowall remarks that nobody wants to see vampire films anymore, instead preferring ski-masked killers murdering virgins) and a tongue definitely in cheek, FRIGHT NIGHT is a fun film which deserves the status it has as a minor classic. Well worth seeking out if you're a vampire fan. A sequel, imaginatively titled FRIGHT NIGHT 2, followed a couple of years later.",Fright Night
2,SnoopyStyle,loving treatment of B-movie vampire horror,8,9 October 2014,"Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a hardcore horror fan. One night while with girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse), he notices two men carrying a coffin into the house next door. Later, he hears a scream from a prostitute next door who is reported dead the next day. After witnessing Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) with fangs killing another girl, Charlie is convinced that he's a vampire. Neither his mother nor Amy believe him. Police detective Lennox (Art Evans) investigates but Dandridge's human companion Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) covers it all up and Lennox quickly dismisses Charlie's vampire rant. Not even his best friend jokester Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) or the horror host and actor Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) believe him. In desperation, Amy hires the recently fired Vincent to end Charlie's delusion.This is a loving homage to all the B-movie horrors. Amanda Bearse gives this a couple of funny moments. Roddy McDowall is nothing less than perfect. Chris Sarandon has just the right creepiness without being the cliché Dracula. William Ragsdale is fine as the harrowed teenager although I do wish he was younger. This movie takes the old vampire horror genre and give it an adoring suburban treatment.",Fright Night
3,Prismark10,Crossing the neighbour,6,20 April 2015,"Fright Night is a film that moved away from the exploitation horror excess which seemed to populate the early 1980s with the advent of home video to a genre of campy horror which mixed laughs with chills.It also has the genre tropes of teenage horror including a slightly dorky boy trying to make out wit a hot girlfriend you know will fall prey to the vampire.Charley Brewster notices that there is something unusual with his new neighbour, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon.) There is that coffin being dragged into the house and the man trying to take a bite out of a woman late at night. Charley has seen it all but nobody believes him that Dandridge might be a vampire.Now Dandridge is after him and means to silence him forever. Charley enlists the help of school friend Billy Cole and later renowned vampire hunter Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) but Vincent is a bit of a fraud and Dandridge has set his sights on Charley's girlfriend.Sarandon is actually rather chilling as the vampire and also oozes sexual charisma. Although I saw the remake of Fright Night first and I felt that Colin Farrell adds more layers to his vampire, he initially wants to be Charley's friend in the remake and help him out. In this film the villain is antagonistic almost straightaway.McDowall has a hoot of a time as Vincent, the man who is exposed as a ham and fraud but finds the strength of character to fight back. Jonathan Stark also puts on a good turn as Billy Coles the friend who succumbs to Dandridge's bite.The film has a mixture of good and cheesy special effects. The film is not very frightening but does provide a few chills, some violence and gore with plenty of camp.",Fright Night
4,claudio_carvalho,One of My Favorite Vampire Movies Ever,9,6 December 2004,"While with his girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) in his bedroom, the teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) sees a coffin being transported to the house on the next door. A couple of days later, he concludes that his neighbor Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, who is committing some recent unsolved murders. Charley decides to look for help first his friend Evil Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys), since the policemen do not believe on his accusation. Jerry is upset and promises to kill Charley. Later, he meets Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), a middle aged man, who is a vampire killer in a television show but does not believe on vampires in the real life. Amy and Ed seek out Peter Vincent, and the group tries to prove to Charley that Jerry is not a vampire. 'Fright Night' is one of my favorite vampire movies, indeed a cult-movie in Brazil. I do not know how many times I have seen this film in my life, but yesterday I saw it on DVD for the first time and I was not disappointed, since the Brazilian DVD offers two choices (widescreen and fullscreen). There is just a trailer in the extras, but it suffices. Chris Sarandon is incredibly funny and sexy in this role; the movie has a perfect combination and timing of the genres of horror and comedy; the 'Van Helsing' of the story, Peter Vincent, is a fantastic joke with the names of the great Peter Cushing and Vincent Price; the special effects were state of art in 1985. My vote is nine.Title ('Brazil'): ' A Hora do Espanto' ('The Fright Hour')Note: on 14 January 2012, I saw this wonderful film again.",Fright Night
5,mark.waltz,Stands the bloody test of time.,7,30 July 2021,"Coming before ""The Lost Boys"", this vampire movie deals with a group of teenagers (led by William Ragsdale) who contact aging horror star Roddy McDowall (now a syndicated TV movie host) to help them deal with the vampire next door (Chris Sarandon in probably his most famous role) who is obsessed with young Amanda Bearse (not my first ideal choice for a modern version of Minna) and prevent him from turning their neighborhood into a bloody mess. This is probably one of the best horror films of the 1980's because it pays tribute to the Dracula legend without completely copying it, and everyone in the cast seems to be having a great time playing it out while taking it all seriously.One of the teens turns into the equivalent of Renfro while McDowall emulates Van Helsing as if it was a combination of ""Lost in Space's"" Jonathan Harris, Peter Cushing, Vincent Price and even Karloff, his fey character delightfully campy yet never a caricature. Stephen Geoffrey as the unfortunate teen who becomes a vampire chews up everything here (including what is nailed down) and is
deliciously funny although his final scene is very sad. You can't have a non-bloody vampire movie, but this never becomes disgusting. In fact, you can watch this before you go to bed and probably not have nightmares. This is one few 1980's horror films that had a sequel that was nearly as good. The suspense is over-powering, and while I snobbishly rated it a 5 after my first viewing, I rank it much higher now.",Fright Night
6,kosmasp,Comedy Night,7,24 January 2012,"This movie might not have invented horror comedy, but is sure did a great job with that ""sub-genre"". Chris Sarandon perfected a role that would make people remember him for it a long time after that. The movie stands the test of time (though it may seem a little bit dated to some I guess) and was recently remade with Colin Farell taking on the Sarandon role (and he was pretty good doing so).While the comedy factor is pretty high, there is still some horror elements in it though. That being said, I urge you to watch this before you watch the remake. It might feel a tad weaker in hindsight, because you know what is going to happen (more or less).",Fright Night
7,gavin6942,One of Those 80s Horror Films You Will Love,7,21 August 2007,"When a teenager (William Ragsdale) learns that his next door neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, no one will believe him.What do you do when a vampire moves in next door and starts killing people? Well, if you are Charlie, you get your friends and a local B-movie actor to help you stop the vampire. But of course it is not going to be easy, because your parents and the police are not going to believe you. Such is life...""Fright Night"" is an 80s horror film, not unlike ""Monster Squad"" and ""The Lost Boys"". It has that feel where kids (or teenagers) are capable of fighting monsters while parents look the other way. Heck, throw ""The Gate"" in there, too. Similarities exist between this and ""Lost Boys"" -- the vampires, the mother's involvement with the local vampire leader, a close friend or family member turning evil...And we get this from Tom Holland, who has a sketchy record. Sure, he has got this and ""Child's Play"" (both excellent). But ""The Langoliers""? And ""We All Scream For Ice Cream""? Holland has a strong connection to Stephen King, and for some reason seems to bring out the worst of King's work. Luckily, this is a notable exception -- one of the defining films of the 1980s horror scene. And that is how Holland became a ""master of horror"" (a title he earned, but is quickly losing).This film is full of odd things. Christopher Sarandon (an amazing actor) is constantly changing clothes, and in one occasion wears a very metrosexual turtleneck. He keeps eating apples (although I do not know why). One of the main characters, Evil Ed, looks like Beavis (from ""Beavis and Butt-Head""). And there is a hero named Peter Vincent (an obvious homage to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price).There is a lengthy dance club scene, with a really cool mirror effect. Dance clubs are so 1980s. Think ""Adventures in Babysitting"" or even ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II"" (early 1990s, when the fad was still wearing off). It was the thing to do -- have the action move into a musical environment to showcase a band. And I love it every time a film does this, so thank you ""Fright Night"" (although the scene does run a bit long).The effects in general are good, and I have o give a lot of credit to the person who designed the monsters. The werewolf creature (actually a vampire in wolf form) is great, the vampire bat is pretty good, and just the regular vampire makeup is better than average. I did not find it scary, but I certainly did not think it was cheesy.If I had to say anything negative, I would concede the running time is a bit long and some scenes could be trimmed a few seconds or a minute to pick up the pace. The music and clothing also dates the film, but that may not necessarily be a bad thing.The 1980s were the time for horror. Watch this one. Get this and ""Monster Squad"", put in some butter lovers' popcorn, grab some A&W root beer. Maybe invite your significant other or a group of friends over. This is a casual party movie, and one I think the whole family can love if that is your preference. Another 1980s horror trait -- good horror without the excessive nudity or violence. I dare any film maker today to make such a film.",Fright Night
8,lee_eisenberg,now this is entertainment!,10,22 May 2005,"How wonderful! A cross between the old-fashioned vampire flicks and '80s teen movies! In this case, Southern California teen Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) suspects that his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a member of the undead. Naturally, nobody believes this. So, Charley's friends Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) and ""Evil"" Edward Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys) convince horror star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) to acquaint Charley with Jerry. Needless to say, Jerry doesn't do anything vampire-like during the meeting, but Charley isn't convinced. As you may have guessed, Jerry has a few ""bites"" throughout the movie.It's just silly entertainment for the most part, but it doesn't pretend to be anything else.I suppose that ""Fright Night"" can also lay claim to being the movie where Cornelius from ""Planet of the Apes"" met Prince Humperdinck from ""The Princess Bride"".",Fright Night
9,jboothmillard,Fright Night,8,6 September 2005,"This is a film with a very clever idea for both horrifying and slight comedic moments. Basically teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) notices the house next door to be for sale, and then it is bought by a mysterious man. After a little while, looking through the window and sneaking into his house this teen believes he is living next door to a vampire, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon), and he is! No-one believes him, not the police, his friend 'Evil' Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys), not even girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse), but don't worry, they will. The only person that might be able to help Charley is the famous ""Vampire Killer"" from TV's Fright Night, Peter Vincent (Planet of the Apes' Roddy McDowall). With great special effects and gory moments, it is a good idea for a horror story. A sequel followed two years later. Very good!",Fright Night
10,ccthemovieman-1,'Campy' Fright Night Fun To Watch,9,23 June 2006,"I incorrectly assumed this might be some dumb teen vampire flick when it came out about 20 years ago, but that wasn't the case. It was simply a very entertaining horror flick with a good mixture of suspense, comedy and good special- effects. The kids - William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys - are all excellent but the two adults - Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell - steal the show.Sarandon is very cool as the vampire; cocky, arrogant and smooth. He is easily the best character in the movie. McDowell does a nice job as the reluctant vampire slayer.The special-effects are good and the film is played strictly for fun, even with the suspenseful scenes. In fact, it reminds me of the word ""camp"" because it's so hokey in spots. Yet the film definitely has its scary moments. Note: I watched this 3-4 times on the tape so I am familiar with most of the film and after seeing the DVD, I swear several short scenes are missing (such as Bearse's quick shower scene). I've never come across something like this before.",Fright Night
11,Tweekums,A classic '80s horror,8,6 December 2017,"As this film opens seventeen year old Charley Brewster is kissing his girlfriend Amy while a horror movie plays in the background. He complains that she won't go as far as he would like then she offers to sleep with him but now he is watching the new neighbours taking what appears to be a coffin into their house. She is not impressed with his behaviour. The next night he thinks he sees the neighbour murdering a woman; biting her in the neck with his obvious fangs. He reports a vampire attack but understandably the police don't believe his story of modern day vampires. The neighbour Jerry Dandrige soon pays Charley a visit and it is clear that he really is a vampire. Wanting help Charley seeks out Peter Vincent, an actor who starred in many vampire films and presents 'Fright Night', a late night horror show. He is not interested but later, after being approached by Amy and Charley's friend 'Evil Ed' who persuade him to show Charley that Dandrige is human he has quite a shock when he sees that Dandrige has no reflection in a mirror. Initially he just wants to get away but ultimately he and Charley will confront Dandrige in order to save Amy, who he has bitten.I enjoyed this film more than I expected; it has some good scary moments and plenty of tongue in cheek humour. The physical effects are pretty impressive and can be quite gruesome at times. The story is entertaining; I liked that nobody, including the 'vampire hunter' believed Charley until they saw concrete proof that Dandrige is a vampire. William Ragsdale does a solid job as protagonist Charley and Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys are fun as Amy and Evil Ed. Chris Sarandon is impressive as the suave Dandridge; both menacing and seductive. It is Roddy McDowall however who is most memorable; he is great as Peter Vincent the cowardly TV vampire killer who ends up doing it for real. The tension increases nicely towards the end, but not at the expense of humour, giving us an enjoyable final confrontation. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of '80s horror; it isn't the scariest horror film but it is a lot of fun.",Fright Night
12,BA_Harrison,Frightfully good 80s teen horror.,9,28 January 2007,"Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) discovers that his new neighbour, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), is a vampire and suspects he is responsible for the recent spate of murders that have been occurring locally. Neither Charley's girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Bearse), nor local weirdo, Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys), believe him, so Charlie turns to washed-up horror star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) for help.A likable cast, a great script and a load of cutting-edge (for the 80s) special effects make Tom Holland's Fright Night an extremely successful attempt at mixing humour and horror, whilst also nicely illustrating the sexual power and erotic lure of the vampire.Sarandon is great as the nasty vampire who exudes, in equal quantities, both menace and sexual magnetism (even over the same sexhis relationship with both his assistant, Billy Cole, and Evil Ed suggests that Dandridge isn't that fussy about who he seduces) while Ragsdale, Bearse and Stephens all give good performances as the youngsters pitted against him. Best of all is McDowell, whose appearance as the somewhat cowardly 'vampire slayer' Peter Vincent is a joy to behold, as he affectionately sends up the greats of horror after whom his character is named (Peter Vincent is an amalgam of Peter Cushing and Vincent Price).Writer/director Holland keeps a tight rein on affairs, lovingly mocking the genre but never insulting its films or its fans. Faithfully adhering to the recognised rules of vampire movies, he squeezes genuine laughs from the absurdity of Charley's plight and yet still manages to throw in plenty of scares.Both the make-up and visual effects are very good, and include some nicely realised vampire make-up for Sarandon, Bearse and Geoffrys, a great bat-monster and a wonderful scene where Evil Ed, impaled on a balustrade, slowly reverts from wolf shape back to human form (ironically, this would not be the last time Stephen Geoffreys would appear on film naked and impaled on something long and hardhe would later go on to become a gay porn star!).Spectacularly 80s in style (check out the cheesy pop/rock soundtrack and those awful clothes), and incredible fun, Fright Night is the perfect antidote to the endless remakes and soulless gore-fests of today. I award it a score of 8.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 9 for IMDb).",Fright Night
13,moonspinner55,Long-in-the-tooth teenagers tangle with an equal-opportunity bloodsucker...,3,22 June 2008,"Suburban kid, living with his single mom, thinks the new next-door neighbor is a genuine vampire, but can't get any of his friends to believe him. Tom Holland wrote and directed this low-rent, yukked-up horror movie, but his handling of the genre is depressingly straightforward; he invests nothing new in the scenario, sees no fresh comic possibilities in the modern-day-Dracula milieu, and fails to provide the characters (especially the younger ones) with witty repartee or personality. The dated make-up effects are of the ""Thriller"" era, which can be excused, though they offer nothing truly exciting, at least not until the finale (Amanda Bearse's transformation is well done). The over-the-hill teens seem to have no agenda, very little back story, and no connection with each other (particularly the goof-off, odiously played by Stephen Geoffreys). Chris Sarandon's vampire has presence, but his googly-eyed, overacting male roommate--who comes and goes--is funny for all the wrong reasons (he purses his lips while sizing up passers-by, like someone out of ""Sunset Blvd.""). Holland doesn't have the delicious, nasty streak in him to reinvent the bloodsucking monster movie and, while this film was a sleeper hit and spawned a Holland-less sequel in 1988, it never aspires to be anything other than a cheap entertainment for its time. *1/2 from ****",Fright Night
14,paul_haakonsen,Sink your teeth into this classic 1985 vampire movie...,7,28 August 2011,"I watched this movie back in the mid-80's, when I was a mere teenager, and I watched it again several years later, and now in 2011, I find myself watching it yet again. Why? Well, because it is a classic horror movie, and also because it is quite good. But also as a freshening up on the movies (part 1 and 2) before watching the 2011 remake, even if it has Colin Ferrell in it.The story, for a typical 80's horror movie, is pretty straight forward, centered around teenagers. Charley suspects his new neighbor to be more than they appear, when he sees them dragging in a coffin in the middle of the night, and when people start disappearing only to end up murdered. Charley believes his neighbor to be a vampire, but no one believes him, not even Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer from TV. It becomes a race against the coming of dawn, as lives are at stake.Now, the acting in the movie was great back in the day, and actually still is good even today. I had a blast revisiting the movie here in 2011. It was especially funny to see Amanda Bearse in the role, now that we later grew up with her shining in her role in the TV sitcom ""Married With Children"". The one pulling the load of the movie was Roddy McDowall (playing Peter Vincent, a tribute to Peter Cushing and Vincent Price, I assume). He was just phenomenal.For a mid-80's horror movie, the effects were actually quite good. And I still liked them today. They look good and they are straight to the point, no fancy CGI with radiant colors and dazzling effects, just pure and simple effects showing what needs to be shown.Immediately after finishing this review I will sit down and watch ""Fright Night 2"", and hopefully it will prove as good as I remembered it to be from back in my teenage years.""Fright Night"" is a great vampire movie, especially since there are no glistening vampires with big hair and sparkling skin. The vampires in this movie are portrayed as they should be, vicious creatures with a taste for blood, not a taste for awkward teenagers in a town no one's ever heard about.This movie will appeal to us old fans but also to newcomers to the movie, because it has a good, classic story to tell, and it does so in a good pace, and you are never left bored at any time. For fans of vampire movies, thumbs up! Check out ""Fright Night"" if you aren't already familiar with it.",Fright Night
15,BandSAboutMovies,Perfection!,10,28 October 2018,"Fright Night was the first modern horror film I ever watched. I remember painting in my parent's kitchen and my father telling me not to be afraid and just watch it with him. It's a great start -- combining the Hammer films that I loved that didn't scare me with new school special effects and metacommentary.The very first film in the series, this one really speaks to me as I was part of the last generation to grow up with horror movie hosts on UHF channels. Sure, there's Svengoolie today and some internet shows, but it's not the same. Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) is one such host, a washed-up actor who was in a few great movies decades ago and now goes from town to town, playing the same old 1960's Z list horror films, saying the same lines.The defining moment for him is that Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale, Mannequin 2: Mannequin on the Move) believes in all his bull. And when Jerry Dandrige (the untrustable Chris Sarandon) moves in next door and shows all the signs of being a vampire, Charley finds he needs Peter Vincent more than ever before.Plus, you get a pre-Married with Children Amanda Bearse as Charley's love interest and a pre-gay pornography/976-EVIL Stephen Geoffreys as Charley's best friend/worst nemesis Evil Ed. And I just love Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark, House II) as Jerry's thrall.This is a movie made for those who love horror movies. After all, Peter Vincent is named after horror icons Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. Creator Tom Holland wrote the part for Price, but the acting great had stopped appearing in horror movies at this time in his career. As they made the film -- and the sequel together -- Holland and McDowall became life-long friends, with McDowall introducing the young director to Price, who was flattered that the part was written to honor him and thought that Fright Night ""was wonderful and he thought Roddy did a wonderful job.""He's right -- this is a movie that taps into the mind and heart of horror fans, as so many of us have wondered, ""What if the monster -- and the monster hunter -- was real?"" The lighthearted yet dangerous tone of the film is letter perfect. That scene in the nightclub, where Jerry takes on the security guard? As good as it gets.",Fright Night
16,Coventry,Children of the Night...what 80's music they make!,6,5 January 2006,"""Fright Night"" is a truly campy but nevertheless respectable 80's horror comedy, made by one of the most talented guys active in the genre back then; Tom Holland, who was also responsible for other modest classics such as ""Child's Play"", ""The Beast Within"" and even the belated sequel ""Psycho 2"". It's pretty much Holland's surefooted directing, along with some nice make-up effects and Roddy McDowall's vivid performance, what makes this film so enjoyable as the storyline is pure & silly nonsense. Charley Brewster is a typical teenager who's convinced that his new neighbor is a vampire responsible for the death of several young women. After being laughed at by his friends, Charley turns to TV's fearless vampire killer Peter Vincent but apparently he's not as heroic as his shows and movies imply. ""Fright Night"" couldn't possibly be more eighties-like, with a terrible choice in music, grotesque gore, odd-looking teenagers and the typical casting of a washed-up star for one last glorious role (Roddy McDowall was in ""Planet of the Apes"", for God's sake!). It's a fun movie, though, with some memorable sequences, like the vampire-variation on the famous ""American Werewolf in London"" transformation and of course the meltdown-scene. The weirdo kid who plays Charley's best friend, Stephen Geoffreys, is genuinely creepy with his squeaky voice and bizarre reactions. He went on to star in gay porno movies and has delightful sounding titles on his repertoire, such as ""Gay Men in Uniform"", ""Latin Crotch Rockets"" and ""Butt Blazer"". That's horror for ya!",Fright Night

18,hitchcockthelegend,"Feeling like a time warp now, but oh so much fun and frights.",8,4 March 2008,"Viewing this for the first time in 20 years really put a smile on my face, now I know that for after having just watched a horror film that may not be the best guideline you will ever read, but the film has it's tongue firmly in cheek and it doesn't come up short on the thrill factor.You will read other reviews stating that the film is a little cheesy and a little dated, and sure, in this day and age of gorno and ultimate slash kill death murder movies, the film can be judged as tame alongside the big box office ghoul movies. But from a personal point of view I got such a kick out of watching a good honest genre piece that shows love, care, and entertainment rolled into one movie. Perhaps I'm the old fart who is so desensitised to blood horror these days? Perhaps I live in the past too much? So what? It matters not because as long as there are delightful genre pieces like this to remind me that the 80s horror crowd had some knowing style, then I'm a happy bunny.Cute teens embroiled in Vampire next door plot is about the make up of the film. No one believes the central guy of the piece (William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster), but he convinces TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) to join his quest to rid the neighbourhood of the murdering menace living next door. The film has the love interest in peril (Amanda Bearse), it has the grossly annoying best friend (Stephen Geoffreys) - and boy is he annoying! And it has all the homages to the horror classics gone by you could wish to have.Such guts and gusto went into making this film I felt like clapping at the end. It's aware of the horror competition when you catch some of the dialogue, so it should never be allowed to become a perceived cheesy relic, because this is 1985 and it rocks for those that remember when horror had a glint in its eye instead of a sabre through its head. 8/10",Fright Night
19,Hey_Sweden,Welcome to Fright Night...for real.,8,21 August 2019,"Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is an ordinary teenager who comes to realize that Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon), the handsome, suave man who's moved in next door, is actually a vampire. Naturally, he can't get anybody to believe this, but he ultimately receives some unexpected help from TV horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), ""the great vampire killer of the movies"".Screenwriter Tom Holland, who'd given us the much-better-than-expected belated sequel to ""Psycho"", began his filmmaking career with a flourish, writing and directing this energetic and entertaining, very 80s horror film. It's chock full of great effects (by Richard Edlund), good music (by Brad Fiedel), stifling atmosphere, and ingratiating performances. McDowall in particular is a delight as the bitter old horror star who bemoans the age of the slasher film; he would seem to be in over his head in a real-life horror situation, but he does rise to the occasion. And Sarandon successfully walks the line between charming and menacing in his portrayal of the cunning blood sucker. Amanda Bearse of 'Married...with Children' fame is an interesting choice for the role of the imperilled love interest. Stephen Geoffreys is a constant hoot in his memorably quirky interpretation of ""Evil"" Ed Thompson, seemingly the closest thing that Charley has to a friend. Ragsdale himself is a personable hero. Jonathan Stark (as Jerry's housemate / daytime protector Billy Cole), Dorothy Fielding (as Charley's mom), and Art Evans (as an exasperated detective) co-star; look for Nick Savage from ""Friday the 13th Part III"" in a small part as a bouncer.Holland clearly has great respect for not just the great vampire films of the past, but the whole horror genre in general, and his film is quite fun. It never drags (even at an hour and 47 minutes), and builds steadily towards the inevitable big showdown, which pulls out all the stops. It's also quite sexy, but not as violent as more squeamish viewers might fear. Hollands' script does have some good dialogue along the way, as well, and ends up sending viewers away with a smile.Followed by a sequel and a remake (with the remake getting a sequel of its own).Eight out of 10.",Fright Night
20,Doylenf,Good horror flick with standout vampire work from Sarandon...,6,19 October 2006,"Any fan of '80s horror films has got to love this one. It starts with a hook that grabs you into the story immediately--a vampire moving next door to a boy who spies a casket being carried into the cellar--and a vampire kiss turning into a bite right before his peering eyes (from his bedroom window).As soon as WILLIAM RAGSDALE spies CHRIS SARANDON and realizes he's a vampire, the heat is on--because Sarandon knows his neighbor has seen him. Sarandon plays his role with a sexual edge, cocky and arrogantly handsome, but as menacing as all get out.Fortunately, between the fright scenes, there's a good abundance of humor and gags to keep the blood flowing smoothly and to remind you you're only watching a horror flick that turns out to be very entertaining as it delivers the shivers along with the laughs.RODDY McDOWALL excels as a veteran host of a program called FRIGHT NIGHT who gets talked into reluctantly checking out Ragsdale's story about having a vampire for a neighbor. A number of scary and sometimes shocking scenes of bloodlust do take place and sometimes the director has gone overboard in his use of special effects that tend to be more disgusting than frightening. That's the main flaw of the film once it veers fully into horror territory. This, I'm afraid, is typical of the taste prevalent in the '80s when audiences wanted their horror effects to be as graphic as possible.Performances are excellent with STEPHEN GEOFFREYS and his whining voice standing out as the neurotic best friend of the hero.Summing up: Not for those easily disturbed by grotesque effects for the sake of cheap thrills. Interesting to note AMANDA BEARSE from ""Married With Children"" (she was Marcy) in the female lead.",Fright Night
21,preppy-3,"""Fright Night"" is fangtastic (sorry--I couldn't resist)",9,19 September 2009,"Teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) discovers that a vampire (Chris Sarandon) and his helper (Jonathan Stark) have moved next door to him. He unwittingly puts his best friend Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) and girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) in danger. It's up to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) vampire hunter to help.Sharp, funny and just great vampire film. It was made to reintroduce the vampire to 1980s audiences and was a HUGE hit. The direction and writing by Tom Holland are just excellent and coupled with a great music score. The vampire himself is never played for laughs but he DOES have a huge sense of humor (Sarandon plays him to perfection). Also the story sticks to the original version of a vampire and his weaknesses (I especially like it when it's made clear that a vampire can NOT enter a house unless welcomed in by its rightful owner). The special effects, even by todays standards, are VERY impressive and they're wisely confined to the last half hour when the kids and Vincent are fighting for their lives. Also I loved the 80s fashions worn by Bearse, the J. Geils Band sings the title song and Sarandon and McDowell are fantastic in their roles. My only complaints--Ragsdale and Bearse are way too old to play teenagers (he was 24--she was 27!) and what the hell WAS Billy Cole (the vampire's helper)? Those are small complaints though. This is a strong, funny and scary vampire flick. Highly recommended.",Fright Night
22,poolandrews,"Fun 80's Vampire horror, Fright Night is alright!",7,17 May 2005,"Fright Night begins late one night with a teenager named Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) having trouble with his girlfriend Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) in his bedroom, I'll say no more... Annoyed he turns away & looks out of the window& sees two men carrying what appears to be a coffin into the empty house next door. Since Charley is a huge horror film fan Amy doesn't believe him & leaves. It turns out that the house has been sold to a man named Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) who has just moved in with his supposed roommate Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark). The next day Charley bumps into a hooker named Cheryl Lane (Heidi Sorensen) who he remembers because she's a bit of a stunner, going into Dandridge's house. Soon after he hears on the news that she has been found dead & the police are appealing for witnesses. That night Charley also sees Dandridge with another teenage girl (Irina Irvine) & grow a set of fangs & sharp fingernails with which to kill her with, Charley becomes convinced that Dandridge is a Vampire. Charley goes to the police but Lieutenant Lennox (Art J. Evans) isn't interested in stories about Vampires & warns Charley not to waste anymore of their time. Charley then seeks the help of his idol, a washed up horror film star named Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) who hosts a cheap cable programme called 'Fright Night Theatre' which shows his old horror films. Peter refuses to help & Charley decides to act on his own. However, Amy & a friend named Evil Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys) convince Charley not to do anything on his own, they then contact & pay Peter to visit Dandridge with them & prove to Charley that he isn't a Vampire. Peter agrees & the four head round to Dandridge's house where the thrill's & chill's really start...Written & directed by Tom Holland I thought Fright Night was an entertaining little Vampire film that has just enough about it to make it stand out, Fright Night reminds me greatly of another Vampire film made around the same time Vamp (1986) in both tone & execution, if you liked Vamp I'm fairly positive you'll like this. The script is fairly light in tone throughout, although I don't know why the IMDb lists this as a comedy as there just isn't any here or if there was it went over my head. All the Vampire elements are here that we want & expect, stakes through the heart, the Vampire's are unable to be exposed to sunlight, holy water & crucifix's, they have no reflection in a mirror, the coffin in which they sleep, the obligatory fangs & biting people on the neck therefore turning them into Vampire's. Having said that Fright Night tries to incorporate a few new ideas of it's own like the water & crucifix's only work against the Vampire if the person using them has faith, one vampire turns into a wolf & as he turns back it looks like something out of a Werewolf film & the strange Vampire helper who is neither human nor Vampire. It generally works well & is entertaining to watch but I found Fright Night dragged a little during the middle third when not much happens, in particular the unnecessarily long & drawn out 80's disco dancing scene & for a Vampire Dandridge was far too brazen & public, I mean having a hooker catch a cab to his house in broad daylight who is then found dead a few hours later, hardly conspicuous is it? I also felt the climax went on for a little too long with various creatures & a drawn out final confrontation all set in the confines of one house. There are some good make up effects even if the puppetry & animatronics looked a little stiff & unconvincing on a few occasions, the filmmakers seemed to mostly concentrate on the creature & Vampire effects rather than blood & gore of which there is surprisingly little. There's a melting man, a pencil through a hand, & the Werewolf & bat type creatures. The acting is OK with Sarandon making a decent villain & Ragsdale a likable hero, McDowall is alright too but given little to do. Technically Fright Night is well made with a definite polish throughout, by horror film standards anyway & director Holland manages to create some decent sequences with a bit of style about them. Overall I liked Fright Night, it's good fun & kept me entertained for an hour & forty odd minutes. Definitely worth a watch & pretty much essential viewing for horror & Vampire fans alike.",Fright Night

Sure, there are some, but not enough to please the elites. In my opinion, it was a phenomenal decade for movies that were just damn entertaining, whether they be comedy, action, horror, sci-fi, or whatever else. Fright Night is one of these '80s greats. Smooth direction, fun special effects, smart script, good score, and a wonderful cast. William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, and Amanda Bearse are all terrific here. However, the scene stealers are Roddy McDowall as actor Peter Vincent and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed, the lead character's best friend with many of the movie's most memorable lines. It's a classic horror-comedy that's been highly influential on many movies and television shows since, not the least of which is Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Definitely should be on any list of ""must see"" '80s movies. Followed by a sequel and a watchable but pedestrian remake.",Fright Night

William Ragsdale plays teenager Charley Brewster who believes that his next door neighbor is a vampire. Chris Sarandon plays charming Jerry Dandridge who threatens Charley's life until an even bigger counter arrives in the form of TV star Peter Vincent, Vampire Slayer. Roddy McDowell adds humour and exploits the clichés. He is approached by Charley for help but doesn't believe him until a visit to prove Dandridge human goes wrong when he fails to cast a reflection in Vincent's mirror. Director Tom Holland highlights the film with ominous lighting and seductive music. Well written screenplay that isn't too complicated but has witty characters. Ragsdale plays off the nervous determination of Charley. Sarandon is a dominating presence as Dandridge. McDowell as Vincent must face the reality of TV props verses the rules of vampire lore. He must face his greatest fear without it being staged. Amanda Bearse plays Charley's frustrated girlfriend Amy who is targeted by Dandridge.

This one here gets a lot right with the first half built up of the big revelation here, as not only is there a lot of mileage generated from the actual convincing to get people to believe him. There's a lot of fun here with the vampire toying with him as he's moving in, the gradual news of those disappearing around the town and the way he corrupts others right in front of him to keep the secret, while there's a lot more to be had here from how it handles the action. From the first session peeking at him taking the prostitute and then witnessing the disposal of the body later, there's some good times to be had as this gets rather fun doing the bedroom tormenting throwing him around in his true form only for a last-minute save, the testing sequence at the vampires' house with his friends is really good as the way it's hidden makes this good until the final revelation at the end which is a wholly fantastic idea, and that it leads into the suspenseful alleyway talking as well as chasing through the nightclub afterwards makes this one all the better. The individual confrontations between the newly-turned vampires provides the final nail here that gives the truth to this once and for all. These here are made all the more fun with the action here in the finale where there's a whole slew of great confrontations and stalking here, featuring encounters with both henchmen as well as utilizing the different houses for some additional fun in the brawl with the vampire shapeshifting around the house while he's busy dealing with the vampire over in the second house where they get into some utterly enjoyable fighting against the deformed main vampire in a variety of locations throughout here. While there's more good stuff elsewhere in here, from the sensual seduction scene after he kidnaps her and the slew of impressive make-up utilized, the finale is the start of the film's problems here where it really drags out far longer than it really should. Being based on encounters throughout the house is a great way to up the action but it feels drawn-out instead of the epic battle it's clearly going for. It's an obvious attempt to rectify the main problem leading up to this, that by basing the majority of the film around trying to get people to believe him doesn't leave this with a whole lot of action as his claims are pretty logical but aren't laid out in a way that generates the desired suspense from them, leading to the over-compensation. With the finale. The cheese might also derail some, but it's the others issues here being more prevalent.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",Fright Night

32,The_Void,Cool and fun 80's kitsch,8,21 August 2005,"The 1980's is the decade responsible for some of the silliest films ever made - like this one, Fright Night. Despite being camp and silly, Fright Night still manages to be a great success in the low budget end of the horror genre thanks to it's great humour and surprising amount of originality. The film follows a young man named Charlie who, after seeing several strange things happening next door, starts to believe that his neighbour is a vampire. Of course, nobody believes him, which prompts Charlie to enlist the help of the only man he knows that knows anything about vampires - Peter Vincent, star of a late night horror show known as 'Fright Night'. Of course, it isn't long before Charlie turns out to be right and the good guys find themselves in serious trouble! Movies like this are rarely - if ever - taken seriously, but the fact of the matter is that a B-movie like this one is infinitely more enjoyable than most of the latest 'A' class films that the critics are raving about. Fright Night is not a great movie - and it never tries to be; it's just a damn good time! The acting isn't really a big part of Fright Night, but the one performance that really does stand out is Roddy McDowall in the role of Peter Vincent. This great actor steps into the role of the washed up TV star brilliantly, and it's his comedic take on the over the top horror stars of yesteryear that provides this movie with some of it's best laughs. Chris Sarandon is slightly annoying as the kid at the centre of the story, but he does a good job and actually manages to convince as someone who believes that his neighbour is a vampire. In the 1980's, special effects were a big thing as movies that showed 'everything' were very much in vogue. This movie actually features some impressive effects, which while no match for some of the effects in latter day movies, were good for the time and help the film to achieve it's ""80's"" vibe. This is the sort of film that I can't understand why anyone would dislike it. Fair enough, it has hardly any substance and it's very difficult to take it seriously, but it's great fun and the originality and humour make it ever easier to like.",Fright Night

It had a perfect combination of horror, comedy, action, and sigh, romance. The cast looked like they had so much fun putting this film together, it's hard not to love it. Now I admit that this film has the 80's cliché's written all over it, so it is a bit dated with it's big hair, clothing, and style, but it's all good. The story of Fright Night is an entertaining one.Charley has a new next door neighbor who's quite the mysterious guy, he has beautiful ladies come over but then they end up missing afterwards. One night Charley spies on his new neighbor, Jerry, while it looks like he's about to have a hot date, but Charley sees Jerry's fangs and knows he's a vampire. Problem is that no one believes him, not his girlfriend, Amy, his best friend, Evil Ed, or his TV icon Peter Vincent. But Charley is determined to fry this blood sucking fiend before it's too late.Fright Night is just a fun midnight pic that I'm sure any horror fan could enjoy. I'm sorry that I came across it so late, but considering that it was made the year I was born, better late then never, right? So for horror fans, I would recommend this if you have never seen it.

A good combination of horror n comedy. Some scenes were intense n atmospheric while some were lol. The effects were top notch for those days.
We have a vampire, a monster bat, a werewolf, a ghoul (it is never revealed about Billy Cole, the vampire's roommate), some nudity but less body count.
It is about a teen who suspects that his new neighbor is a vampire responsible for the disappearances of several victims.
Both the girls who played the hookers r much attractive than the lead actress.Chris Sarandon n Roddy McDowall's performances r noteworthy.
Sarandon walking in the dark, foggy alleys with his trenchcoat is a solid n different demeanor compared to the earlier vampires.Some trivia : The first bouncer is Nick Savage, he played the hooligan in FT13 part 3.
There were two unofficial remakes in India 1)Wohi Bhayanak Raat and 2) Kalpana House aka bungalow no 666.

Time made justice to ""Fright Night"", one of the best vampire movies ever and probably the best of the 80's. When it came out in 1985 the Slasher genre was on it's highest peak and as Peter Vincent said to Charlie, ""his generation prefers movies where a masked looney kills virgin innocents"" (or something like that). When nobody cared about Vampires ""Fright Night"" came out with a tremendous potential on it's story, actors, and make up; the basic elements that a Slasher movie needs. The result is an entertaining, chilling, and very well done horror movie better than expected.*SPOILERS* Charlie Brewster an average boy finds out that his neighbor is a vampire. He has doubts until Jerry Dandridge his vampire neighbor appears on his bedroom and threatens him to death. Nobody believes Charlie and after a series of events not only his life is in danger but also his girlfriend's. Charlie finds in Peter Vincent, t.v.'s popular ""Vampire Killer"" character his only hope to save his girlfriend. In order to accomplish what he wants, Charlie and Peter Vincent will face the deadly Jerry Dandridge, his guardian Billy Cole, and their attacks.ACTING. You can't go wrong when a great actor like Mr. Chris Sarandon carries the entire movie on his back with his performance. His character, Jerry Dandridge completely steals the show. Sarandon made the character. Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent is a pleasure to watch. His character has an admirable quick evolution in the movie. First he's the vampire killer t.v. character that after meeting a REAL vampire knows what fear is like. Then after dealing with fear, he recovers faith and that makes him stronger in every aspect. William Ragsdale is good as Charlie Brewster, the teen main character in the movie. The boy that discovers that his neighbor is a real vampire but nobody believes him. Good character. Special mention to Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed for being one of the weirdest but likable characters ever to appear in a horror movie. His performance is truly evil and humorist. A nice touch. Amanda Bearse (from Married with Children fame) is also a good addition to the cast, she delivers an o.k. performance. Jonathan Stark as Billie Cole, Jerry's guardian, delivers a solid performance. This is one of the best casts that you can get from an 80's horror movie.DIRECTION. The 80's craziness was never this creepy. Tom Holland makes a terrific job this time. This man is behind key horror movies from the 80's like ""Child's Play"" and the surprisingly good ""Psycho II"" among others. His camera work in ""Fright Night"" is great. He knew how to combine perfectly the 80's feeling (something that nobody has ever described for it's madness) with the Vampire movies basic rules.The idea of watching a Vampire movie from the 80's could make you think the worst but luckily it's a great idea. Excellent job Mr. Holland.F/X/SCORE/CINEMATOGRAPHY. The f/x and make-up are very ahead of it's time. You can't get better gore effects! The scene of Evil Ed's death (when he's a werewolf) is amazing. On it's time I'm sure that it shocked more than once. Also, Billy Cole's death and the ending are great scenes that will please the horror audience's eyes. Great use of gore and f/x. Enough said. The score is great. The 80's pop metal and club music fits perfect with the feeling of the movie. The club scene is something you haven't seen. In the tense and thrilling scenes the music works perfect. The cinematography is pretty good. The use of lightning on dark settings is very good. Watch the DVD version for a different experience. I love the lines from the movie. I can assure that ""Fright Night"" is something you haven't seen. Don't get fooled by the 80's big hair, laughable fashion, and clichÃ©s. The movie stands alone.

Humor is used to balance the heavier moments, and to give you more of a feeling of realism within the character base.While this is not a movie to be taken seriously, there are some good horror elements and even some tense and freakish moments. There are even some seriously frightening scenes here.The story is not new, but this class of characters renders a new life to the old vehicle, giving it a much more endearing quality which has brought this movie into My personal collection.This endeavor, while a bit campy at times, follows all the basic rules of the sub-genre, and still manages to deliver a delightfully thrilling finished product, which I highly recommend.Evil Ed. He is the boy everyone picks on. He is the horror fan, the computer nerd, the gamer of the bunch. His portrayal here was heart-wrenching, funny, dramatic, and completely professional. He was the greatest casting asset to this entire endeavor.Roddy McDowell of stage and screen was believable as he gave an entirely convincing portrayal of the television vampire hunter playing a role. So often, fans tend to fasten the personalities of the characters these stars portray, onto the persona of the actors themselves, as Charlie Brewster and his friends, do to Mr. Peter Vincent (McDowell). He is brilliant as the reluctant hero here giving, as always, his very best-regardless of the role, the budget, or the project.But again, it was Evil Ed who stole this show.It rates a 9.8/10 on the ""B"" scale.That translates roughly to a 8.2/10 on the ""A"" Scale, from...the Fiend :.",Fright Night

It explores the homosexual themes without being very explicit or stereotypical. True two of the co-stars are openly gay (but not at the time) and Chris Sarandon makes an excellent bi-sexual vampire. Fright Night is also the last hurrah for the great Roddy Mc Dowell, his role as the ""legendary"" Peter Vincent was superb. A true 80's classic. Followed by a lesser sequel Fright Night II.

Massively cool classic, love it!",9,30 January 2015,"Even if you've merely got a passing fancy for horror, how could you ever read that title and *not* want to watch this movie? More than anything else, it's all about the fun, and I just find it as great and entertaining a watch as it's always been. That's the true test of a classic horror flick, if you can see it over so many times and still it seems fresh, still it offers new insights, still it lends itself to bold and exciting new interpretations! And, you can still go to the bathroom in the middle of it without missing a thing! It's very straightforward and dead easy to get into. I mean, what an angle: A teenage boy who's a big horror fan, he's seen all the movies, read all the stories, and he suddenly finds himself faced with a real monster who's moved in right next door and who soon knows that the boy knows about his true nature - what does he do? It's such a novel concept and one that plays out in such a satisfying way. The atmosphere is amazing, it doesn't ever drag and it doesn't take itself too seriously, not to say there are no scary moments or anything. It's helped a lot by a good cast. William Ragsdale as Charlie was fine, but he was kind of neurotic and boring for me, I thought he was overshadowed even by most of the smaller characters. He played the lead well, I just thought that the role could've been done a lot better and memorable by someone like Zach Galligan, say.. I loved his ditzy mother, she was a hoot! She kept coming out with such funny lines. I absolutely bloody adore Roddy McDowall in this, what a class act. He's simply priceless in his role as Peter Vincent, a meek and unlikely cowardly aged actor who becomes the hero he has played in a string of classic B-movie vampire pictures in his glory days after a graceful character arc in which he gains the courage and ""faith!"" to face his fear. And Chris Sarandon, he just played his vampiric character to perfection. I love the way he's got the whole charm and seduction thing down, but at the same time he has a certain little odd quirkiness to some of his lines and actions. And he was also perfectly intimidating and wrathful when he had to be. And although you understand how he's gotta go, you never really hate the guy, he's a very likable villain that I could 'dig', and that's half the battle right there at winning the audience of a horror movie over, if the bad guy's interesting and charismatic. I love all of the nifty and gruesome special effects, like the awesomely foreboding mist that swirls around Dandridge's humble abode and sets such a fabulous tone. There's the prosthetics and models of the prolonged sequence where poor strange Evil Ed slowly transforms back into a regular human following an impaling while in wolf form and dies.(Or does he?) I also love the brief but superb animation of the bat, and the little but effective gag of when Amy's dancing and sees a reflection that shows her dancing with thin air. I love that sequence, it's so vibrant and so of its time, it's like someone felt like indulging themselves by incorporating a glitzy music video into their movie and it's really 80s, really corny, and really epic!!! There is also the impressively gooey disintegration of the sexy and mysterious(Demon? Zombie?) Billy Cole, and the spectacular demise of Jerry Dandridge in which he kind of explodes to death. Some of the effects hold up a little better than others, but so what? There's such a charm there sometimes when you know that they had to put it all together themselves, and they clearly had a lot of love for the old vampire movies and the horror genre here, and you just very rarely get that anymore. Still brilliant fun, couldn't have asked for anything better! I wonder if any real vampires ever come to see these films....",Fright Night
54,drownnnsoda,Classic vampire premise meets the glory of the '80s,9,4 September 2014,"Poor Charley Brewster— he's got a problem. See, the tall, dark, and handsome Jerry Dandridge has just moved into the rundown Victorian house next door; beautiful women come to the house, and are found decapitated by the river shortly after. Oh, and Jerry has fangs. And claws. But nobody believes Charley, not even his goodhearted girlfriend, Amy. And why should they?""Fright Night"" is a film that very quietly lurked underneath my radar for years— as an ardent horror fan, it was one film that, when asked about, I'd always say I hadn't seen. People were often surprised, or appalled, even friends who were non-horror fans who had seen it. What took me so long? This is a great flick. The plot is relatively straightforward and takes its cues from classic vampire stories, but its injection with '80s charm lends the film an unusual retro feel that seems both modern and timeless. Writer/director Tom Holland's script is tight and engaging, following the vampire routine while still working toward surprises along the way. Quirky humor is scattered throughout the film, most prevalent in Charley and Amy's lover's spat and Charley's loudmouth single mom who assumes that new neighbor Jerry is ""probably gay, with her luck."" ""Fright Night"" is still a horror film by all means, though these unusually charming moments of humor— as well Charley's struggle to convince those around him that he's dealing with a vampire— give the film a lightness that is reminiscent of '80s and early '90s Halloween television films (though it's considerably gorier, showing off some ""Evil Dead""-esque special effects in the finale).One of the film's greatest strengths lies its lively performances: William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are quintessential '80s teenagers and make one of the most charming pairs in a horror film, while hunky Chris Sarandon lights the screen up as the slick and handsome man next- door who's killing local prostitutes and apparently sleeps in a coffin in the cellar. Roddy McDowall is another great asset to the film, playing the kooky horror television host whom Charley seeks out to help slay a real-life vampire. Overall, ""Fright Night"" is one of the more delightful '80s vampire romps that is both lightly amusing as well as suspenseful and substantially gory in the decade's fashion. The film's reliance on the textbook components of the vampire film provide it a timeless feel that is charming and engaging. Is it scary? No, not really; but it's got all the makings of a well- rounded teen horror flick with splashes of black humor and a memorable cast that do a remarkable job bringing the script to life (or maybe death). 9/10.",Fright Night

Charlie finds out that the house next door to him has a new owner, the mysterious Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) and his roommate Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark). But one night, when Charlie was studying. He was looking on his next door neighbor's window and what it seems to be his neighbor is about to have sex with a beautiful woman. Then suddenly, while Charlie is still looking... he realized that his neighbor has fangs and growing long finger nails. Charlie believes that Jerry is a vampire and his roommate is his guard during daylight. Now Charlie tries to tell his mother, his friends and even a police detective (Art Evens) the truth but no one believes him. Charlie turns to his idol, once B Movie Hammer-type Actor and TV Horror Host Peter Vincent (The late Roddy McDowall) for help but convincing Peter and his friends is a tough thing to do while Jerry is planning to kill Charlie.Written and Directed by Tom Holland (Child's Play, The Langoliers, The Temp) made an enjoyable horror vampire film with game cast and an sharp sense of humour. This is certainly one of the better horror movies of the 1980's and this went on to be instant classic with the fans of the genre. Sarandon is one of the sexier vampires to be seen on the screen and his performance is fun as well. McDowall nearly steals the show as the cowardly yet brave hero, who's faces reality by destroying vampires for the first time. This was a sleeper hit at the box office, when it was first release. A sequel was also produced with Ragsdale and McDowall returning in the second film but it was entirely not totally successful movie. This is probably Holland's sharpest film to date (although I really loved the film, he directed ""Thinner""). This has crisp visual style, thanks to Jan Kiesser's (Bad Moon, Dad, Fido) cinematography and Brad Fiedel's (The Terminator, Terminator 2:Judgment Day, Blink) good jazzy electronic score. Make-Up effects, Special Visual Effects and the Production Designs are first-rate as well. Do not miss this one of a kind picture that become an major Cult Classic. Panavision.

Suddenly, Charlie begins to notice from his window that his new neighbor across the way, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) seems to be involved in some shady goings-on. Charlie soon spots him unloading coffins, and romancing a nubile female guest before shockingly biting her throat. Then, Dandrige is seen with his live-in assistant carting away what appears to be a body in a bag. In no time at all, Charlie deduces that his next door neighbor is a real vampire, but nobody will believe him, including his girlfriend and his nerdy buddy ""Evil"" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys). It isn't very long before Dandrige becomes aware of Charlie's discovery and sets his sights on silencing him. With nowhere to turn, Charlie decides to contact elder film scholar Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) who has been hosting the local ""Fright Night"" TV broadcasts in the area and used to be a cinematic celebrity himself in bygone days, having played a Peter Cushing-like vampire hunter in movies before he became a has-been. It's then up to Charlie and ""Peter Vincent, Vampire Hunter"" to translate film fantasy into reality by attempting to do battle with Jerry Dandrige, who is the real deal.This is easily one of the best of the ""modernized"" vampire films. It's an old fashioned scary story set against a 1980s backdrop, and it works wonderfully. As the new vampire in the neighborhood, Chris Sarandon is outstanding. He can be suave and charming one moment and deadly fearsome the next. It's an extra special treat to get to see Roddy McDowall here making a strong impression in one of his last iconic parts as the frazzled Peter Vincent. In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is that, unlike today, it was filmed at a time where you could still get away with casting actors who were not currently ""box office sensations"". So Amanda Bearse (before she became popular from MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) is a refreshing choice as an unconventional leading girl; these days we'd probably have to deal with a Jessica Simpson. As Ed, Stephen Geoffreys can be a little irritating, but at least his character has a sympathetic side to him. It's nice to sense a sort of homage to the Universal and Hammer horror movies of yore, and the whole ""late night TV horror host"" craze that's lost today. One minor quibble of mine may perhaps be a slight over-reliance on extravagant makeups later in the film, but what the hell --- this is a fun horror movie. ***1/2 out of ****",Fright Night
57,aidanratesmovies,"Unmemorable 80's flick has its moments, but too few to succeed",3,5 October 2020,"Ah Fright Night an homage to vampire films before its time, that not only ends up being anything but scary, but also dreadfully dull and anything but amusing. The film is directed and written by Tom Holland, a horror director at the time, not the Spider-Man star. Holland would later move to directing and writing the horror classic Child's Play in 1988, which is actually quite surprising in my opinion. It isn't that Child's Play is some great horror film, no, it's actually more funny than scary- but what was so enjoyable about that film is superbly the opposite of this one, that being, it was fun to watch. Not only that, but it was entertaining, and this film clearly has no intention of trying to be so, or frankly, trying at all. It's a mess, the actors are rather mediocre, and besides a few moments where a supporting cast member or to actually try to put effort into this lazy script, it stays that way all the way throughout. The worst performances the film has to offer is that of Stephen Geoffreys who plays Evil Ed, which is the weirdest and most out of play sidekick character I have ever seen on film. The other performance that is absolutely horrendous is Jonathan Stark, who is so bad, its honestly quite funny at times. Besides the incredibly plot holes filled script, and lack of any consistent tone whatsoever, the film also has trouble keeping its pacing in tact, as well as deciding what it even wants to be. It spends half of its time pretending to be this 80's campy teen comedy about sex and relationships or whatever, and then moves on to this weird dull horror, which can be I guess dark at times, but is honestly quite hard to take seriously. It has a good look throughout I suppose, and some cool special effects, but they are often masked by the dullness of the direction or the odd amount of generic 80's music blaring through the speakers. In the end, Fright Night is not worth the effort, nor your time. Its an overrated vampire flick that hasn't aged well, and honestly, if you're looking for something somehow more worth your time, try Teen Wolf. At least it was entertaining.

No depressing, sparkly, romantic crap here. Here we see Ragsdale discover his neighbor is a vampire. Of course nobody believes him and he's soon driven mad. Luckily he forms an alliance with a reluctant TV vampire hunter. As I said, Fright Night is a fun movie, which always raises a chuckle, but it also has some disgusting effects. I'm talking real practical stuff, with some of the most painful deaths and transformations you can imagine. This stuff is so much more creative with prosthetics and the like. Computers can easily make a body melt, or turn a wolf into a man, here some truly creative visuals make these things a reality. Sarandon is excellent as the charming vampire, and it's nice to see him go along with trying to prove he isn't a vampire. It shows him as a man that would rather keep his secret than enter a battle to the death. Ragsdale does the usual not-believed-kid routine, but he makes it work. McDowall stole the movie for me. He plays an out of date TV star given a chance to live out his pretend life. The threats are real, and the climax steadily grows. You do have to suspend some belief in terms of how the characters respond, but if you love the 80's, vampires, and movies that knew how to be fun no matter what their subject, you need to see Fright Night.",Fright Night
62,aimless-46,Scary and Funny In Equal Doses,8,26 September 2007,"Vampire movies are almost by definition parodies, the only variable being the degree and the quality of the parody elements vs the scare elements. ""Fright Night"" (1985) is neither the best parody nor the scariest thriller, but it has the distinction of being the all-time best mix of the two. Both its parody and its scare elements work extremely well and their juxtaposition really makes the film worth seeing. ""Fright Night's"" production design will remind you of ""Gremlins"", a contemporary film, but the spirit of the film is more along the lines of Polanski's ""Fearless Vampire Killers"". Average suburban teen Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) accidentally discovers that his new neighbor is an evil vampire. The vampire is not particularly discrete, not bothering to pull the window shades and disposing of a victim in a plastic garbage bag. Charley unwisely goes public with his accusations. This tips off the vampire that his teenage neighbor may be a threat. But he is still safe because nobody believes vampires are real. Not only does no one believe Charley but the vampire discovers that Charley's girlfriend Amy resembles his lost love, which makes her a target. Amy is played by a young Amanda Bearse (""Married With Children""), which you will probably find a bit disconcerting for several reasons but it is kind of interesting to see her as a hot teen love interest. In desperation Charley goes Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of the local television show called ""Creature Features"". The special effects are excellent and not overdone. Dorothy Fielding who plays Charley's airhead mother should get special mention for her excellent performance. One of the running gags during the first half of the film is her failure to find anything suspicious about her new neighbor or his nighttime activities. Then again, what do I know? I'm only an inner child.",Fright Night
63,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Definitely creepy,...but not scary",8,12 June 2012,"Director Tom Holland has been known to make some wicked horror films. He is best known for producing Child's Play (1988) but Fright Night is no different. It has its freaky and creepy moments too. However there are parts to this movie that could have been tweaked. And it's not like they're totally bad choices because it is a good movie. But those parts could have been replaced with something better if the producers were given the chance to.Fright Night is your typical teenage horror genre movie. A boy notices something supernatural and tries to tell the public about it and no one believes him. Worst of all, now that supernatural force is out to get him so no one will know the truth at all. In this case, the supernatural something that this boy notices is a vampire living next to his house. That plot line is creepy enough as it is. I don't think anyone would feel comfortable if that were to happen to him or her. The teenage boy, Charlie Brewster, is played by William Ragsdale and he's one of the flaws in this film. Ragsdale is good as the kid that he is, but I can't help but not feel any pity for him. Why? Because it was he who got himself into trouble with the vampire. He was spying on the vampire while feasting on his prey. Sorry but you don't go spying on others and expect to get away with it. Besides I really didn't care for his character either because of the nasally voice that he had. However, the vampire played by Chris Sarandon gives a redeeming performance for this movie. Sarandon's acting is so good that it really is hard to tell sometimes whether the vampire he's playing, is mean-spirited or just misunderstood.Getting help for Brewster is not easy until he decides to call upon a renowned Vampire slayer, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall). Funny enough, even for him, Vincent has to confront with himself that Brewster's case is serious. The special effects are good too. It is fairly surprising for a 1985 film. The only other drawback this movie has, is that it never frightened me and it's not because the visuals weren't scary. It's that the movie never reached the psychological level where things can become truly terrifying and I never felt it. But nonetheless, this film is very creepy.The scares may not be all there but it will definitely evoke some good chills. Much of which the credit goes to Sarandon for his believable execution as a vampire.",Fright Night
64,p-stepien,Unfriendly neighbourhood vampire...,6,13 January 2013,"Geekish teenager Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) lives his charmed suburban life, befriended to the wacky Evid Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) and squeamishly dating Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse). His idyllic youthful existence collides with the grim realisation that his next door neighbour Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is in fact a man with distinguished tastes in human blood. Unable to convince anyone about this revelation. Charly seeks the aide of Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), the host of late night C-class horror movies ""Fright Night"", whose owes his limited fame to being a vampire killer.With a script that didn't invite much in terms of plot-hole afterthought, Tom Holland grapples his basic premise by the next and delivers a disgustingly funny vampire movie with some memorable quotes, wicked charm and three star quirky characters in the form of neurotic whiny Evil Ed, timid self-absorbed Peter Vincent and the vintage Jerry Dandridge. Despite the painstakingly obvious flaws somewhat reminiscent Roger Corman-like disregard to logic, ""Fright Night"" has grown somewhat of the cult status, imprinting various quotes and scenes into mainstream pop-culture. Whatever your tastes the 1980s had a peculiar ability of delivering rare treats, which worked not only despite its flaws, but to some extent thanks to them. Nowadays movies seem so polished, that they avert the potential for creative disaster, thus no longer being able to deliver the kind of fractured horror gems. Verging somewhere in 'so-bad-its-good' territory, enhanced by some chilling visual effects (the disgusting morphing of the period is just so much more effective then CGI).",Fright Night
65,raulfaust,Decent vampire flick,7,29 February 2012,"Well, since movies involving vampires are usually quite lame, I find this one to be a good one. It is interesting to notice how different horror movies used to be in the eighties; nowadays horror movies are extremely scary and are supposed to frighten you big time, whilst in the that decade they used to be mixed with fun, in a ""Ghost Busters"" style. William Ragsdale is a good actor and he is unintentionally funny throughout all the movie. One thing I must congratulate is the make-up team; the actors became really ugly when portrayed as vampires. Stephen Geoffreys' character begins normal, but once he becomes a vampire, he turns into a creepy monster that almost scares the spectator. It's impossible to not notice how many homoerotic scenes involving the vampires exist in this film; director really wanted to show that. All in all, I haven't seen the remake yet, but I will surely enjoy if it has the same feeling this version has.",Fright Night
66,Matt_Layden,Classic 80's Horror Flick.,8,20 July 2009,"Fright Night is a classic 80's horror film. It's a shame that it's taken me so long to actually see it, I always passed it off thinking it was a crappy low rent horror movie. Boy was I wrong, here is a film that mixes comedy, horror and great special effects.The film is about a young kid who loves vampires (yet somehow doesn't know about garlic and stakes until someone tells him?) and finds out that his neighbour is exactly that. When no one believes him he takes it upon himself to put a stop to the vampire's vampire ways.Compared to the other classic 80's vampire flick The Lost Boys, Fright Night doesn't stand a chance, it simply doesn't have as strong characters, scenes or entertainment. BUT, Fright Night is still an entertaining cheesy film that should be watched by people who love the genre.The special effects are pretty sweet, specifically when one character is staked and is stuck mid transformation between man and wolf. Although the actor who played this character has an incredibly annoying laugh that will get on your nerves.Chris Sarandon is the vampire in question, you may remember as Humperdinck from The Princess Bride. He does a great job at being seductive and cool all while still being menacing in his looks. Roddy McDowall is the vampire slayer (on TV) and is hilarious in this role, the man is terrified to be in this situation, but gets the job done when he has to.This is Tom Holland's best film, he came close with Child's Play, but Fright Night is a film that you can watch more then once. The camp in Fright Night is perfect and everything works so well. Fright Night may not be as good as Lost Boys, but you will not be disappointed with it, it's just a fun film to watch.",Fright Night
67,Gislef,Still a decent vampire flick 15+ years later,7,23 August 2001,"I managed to re-catch this on AMC and still find Fright Night a decent vampire flick. It doesn't go the easy route of turning its vampire antagonist into a punk-types who's ""with it"" in the latest goth-style (see Lost Boys, Dracula 2000, Dusk til Dawn, etc.), but has Chris Sarandon show why Dracula could have been viewed as a seductive, evil yet believable presence whether Drac is in the 19th century or the 20th. Instead of doing a ""modern"" vampire, Sarandon plays a character who shows why vampires are timeless seductive evil and don't have to be up with today's styles to pull it off.There's also lots of little injokes, from Dandridge whistling ""Strangers in the Night"" to his obsession with apples (harking back to Eden and the serpent and the apple), to his fixation with clocks (wouldn't you?) to the vague kind of bisexual relationship he has with a wacko Jonathan Stark as Billy Cole.Roddy McDowell is the other half of the show, managing to be impressive, petty, egotistical (""What could be more important then an interview?"" - ""Oh, well I could see how a boy's life _might_ be more important.""), desperate (""How _much_ money?""), all too humanly flawed, and heroic. McDowell flashes through all of these emotions sometimes in the space of seconds, and shows why he was always a class act.The rest of the cast is okay. Amanda Bearse must have fun looking back at this, her only attempt that I can remember at being a female romantic lead. A little of Stephen Geoffreys goes a long way, and ditto for William Ragsdale, who I never really have liked. He spends way too much time in full-blown panic mode here to be very sympathetic - you end up wondering what kind of idiot this guy is.It's pretty much those six actors for the most part - everyone else is pretty much forgettable. Sure there's some weird moments (Charley and Amy discussing their aborted sex life 20' away from Charley's mom), and the ""Boy who cried wolf"" thing goes on _way_ too long.Overall, though, I'd still recommend this movie to those who want to see that vampires don't have to be punk to be impressive.",Fright Night
68,Lady_Targaryen,There are good reasons to be afraid of the dark.,8,2 September 2006,"I watched ''Fright Night'' two days ago and I had a surprise : the movie is good! I expected it to be one of those silly movies where I wouldn't give more then 6, but I liked it so much, that now I consider to be one of the best vampire movies from the 80's that I already watched, along with ''Lost Boys''. It's funny to see Amanda Bearse, the famous ''Marcy D'Arcy'' from ''Married with Children'' in the role of the teenager Amy(specially because she was almost in her 30's)and this is the first and only movie I watched with her in a different role from ''Marcy''.The plot: Charley Brewster is a big fan of horror movies, and is always watching ''Fright Night'', one of his favorite TV shows about vampires and other monsters. So, when his new and handsome neighbor Jerry Drandridge arrives, Charley immediately discovers that the guy is a vampire. Things starts to get bad for Charley, when Jerry discovers that Charley knows not only his 'secret', but also that he is killing a lot of women to satisfy his appetite.Charley tries to talk to other people about Jerry, but the problem is that nobody believes in a single word that he says. Now, the poor Jerry needs to find a way to be safe from being killed by Jerry and showing to his girlfriend Amy, his friend Ed and his hero, Peter Vincent (the host of a late-night horror show on TV) that he is in fact, right.",Fright Night

70,Howlin Wolf,'TV myth' has its roots. The truth is far darker...,7,26 June 2007,"What's brave about this (and still holds up today) is its willingness to poke fun at pop-culture obsessed youth while recognising that without such 'historians', the fabled lore of the past would have found itself extinguished long ago. ""Fright Night"" was the inventive precursor to the ironic horror hits of the following decade, such as ""Scream"". It's made by the geeks who love the genre to serve as some sort of justification, implying that one day being a 'geek' might just save your life...It really is great fun for a movie fan to see Roddy McDowell - himself something of an acting legend in the sci-fi arena - taking on the role of a veteran performer forced to use the skills of his craft in a real-life situation. It's vindication for every armchair observer who gets themselves involved in another reality. Like ""Rear Window"" with vampires in it, ""Fright Night"" is a hair raising ride and one of the slickest, most enjoyable horror-comedy efforts that the '80's managed to give us.",Fright Night
71,coltras35,An 80's horror gem,10,5 June 2021,"Teenage B-movie buff William Ragsdale becomes convinced that new neighbour Chris Sarandon is a vampire responsible for a spate of brutal killings. Only when best pal Stephen Geoffreys has become Sarandon's slave and girlfriend Amanda Bearse has also fallen under his spell does Ragsdale succeed in enlisting the help of ""fearless"" TV vampire hunter Roddy McDowall to end Sarandon's reign of terror.There have been quite a few actors playing lead vampire/Dracula, and doing justice to the role - Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee to name a few - but I think Chris Sarandon is up there as a really menacing, cool, and cold blooded, yet suave neck biting fiend, and he basically dominates the film, adding the fright to the night, whilst Roddy MacDowell, in a delicious turn as a Van Helsing-like figure ( but only on TV), lends the humour.Fright Night is a unique mix of horror and comedy as well as a commentary about new neighbours, that you never who is moving in your neighbourhood ( it could be a vampire), the plot is solidly paced, and from the killer opening where our hero ( a horror loving teen) spots Sarandon bite someone's neck the film doesn't falter and it has your whole attention. The appearance of McDowell as the TV horror actor revs up the film a notch, making it even more enjoyable, especially for the fact that he's a coward really and doesn't believe in vampires, let alone can slain one in real life. William Ragsdale is excellent as is Amanda Bearse and Stephen Godfreys.In a decade where slasher films was rife , Fright night, with its mix of genres, is refreshing, has great FX, and is hugely entertaining. It's my favourite horror film, and the soundtrack is deliciously 1980's (AOR/ melodic rock bands like Autograph, Joe Lamont, and White Sister feature). An 80's horror gem.",Fright Night
72,oneguyrambling,A long time ago... when vampires still wore shirts and drank blood.,7,25 April 2011,"Another film with a video cover that looked just a little too much for 12 year old me when released, meaning I missed out on this minor gem until I was too old to appreciate it.For some reason I always mixed up Fright Night with Tales from the Crypt, meaning I expected one of those compendium films with three or four shorter stories instead of the full fledged Vampire film that I ended up with.In extremely familiar circumstances to many other films (The Burbs, House) Fright Night finds a young school student named Charlie – a horror film fan – dealing with the realization that perhaps the new neighbours might just be vampires, not especially good timing seeing as it happens on the same night that his long time girl Amy decides to ""give herself up"" to him.Unlike EVERY OTHER TEENAGE BOY IN HISTORY Charlie takes asks for a rain check from Amy even after she's assumed the position – so to speak – just because he saw people carrying a coffin across the yard next door. Speaking for myself at that age smacking me across the back of the head with a shovel wouldn't have distracted me one iota, I guess Charlie was made of different stuff.Over the next few days Charlie sees and hears things that elevate his threat level, meanwhile corpses start piling up. He decides that the new neighbour is indeed a vampire, only no-one believes him, not his Mum, not the cops, not even dear old Amy.So he does exactly what any lad should do and asks his whiny mate for help and advice. The whiny mate has a nasal high pitched and frankly offputting voice, he also laughs like an idiot and seems to snort at the end of most sentences. For some reason he remains just as annoying and obnoxious and they justify keeping him in for the remainder of the film. There always seems to be the dorky sidekick in these sorts of films – I just can't remember one so clearly abhorrent. The one worthwhile thing this dipsh*t tells Charlie is that vampires can't enter your home unless you invite them into it – Let the Right One In also sees the vampire having to deal with the same issue.All should be sweet but you should always think about the innocence of your Mum, that very night she not only lets the guy in, she invites him to dinner! The neighbour is a suave, smooth talking, good looking man named Jerry Dandridge, at least to Mum and everyone else. But as soon as he and Charlie are alone or if no-one is looking he lets Charlie see the real him, and openly tells him that he is coming to gettim.So the cops, GF, loser mate and even Mum have failed him so Charlie turns to the one guy who surely must come through, a late night host of crappy horror movies called Price Vincent (get it?). ultimately Amy comes back onside – which is important as she must play a key role in the vampire's masterplan, and Charlie, the old hack and Amy must battle the evil undead for control of both Amy and their lives.Aside from one scene this is all reasonably tasteful and even low key in stretches, far from some of the more over the top antics of say From Dusk Til Dawn or other 80s horror films. There was one particular scene though where they obviously went balls-out to make an impact.With minimal gore or massive makeup effects there isn't much to report on that front, but there are a couple of memorable decompositions and a cool – if awkward – transformation sequence. I found Fright Night refreshingly low key and old school, where perhaps many other films of the era might have let things degenerate into a schlockfest they spaced out the early kills and confrontations and allowed things to build up to a short but impactful finale.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Not the best horror movie of the era, but alongside The Gate a solid 80s effort and an ideal non-threatening intro to the genre for a newbie or a movie marathon.",Fright Night
73,ElijahCSkuggs,He must've been a Vampire Fruit Bat.,9,13 January 2008,"Fright Night, Lost Boys and Near Dark are the holy trinity of 80s vampire flicks. And arguably three of the best vampires movies of all-time. Just recently I returned to this piece of 80's horror gold and I have to say, I enjoyed it just as much as the first time I saw it.Fright Night is about a kid named Charlie Brewster who accidentally discovers that his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, is a vampire. The movie is about Charlie and friends setting out to destroy the vampire. But Mr. Dandridge is no slouch and is more of a threat to them, then they are to him.Besides being one of the best 80's horror films, I think it's also one of the best movies of the entire 1980s. The movie is full of great performances, especially Chris Sarandon as Jerry Dandrige and Roddy McDowall as TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent. It has fantastic make-up effects that are sorely, sorely missing from today's horror flicks. And it also combines a great feel of horror with a realistic touch of comedy and drama. The best and funniest aspect to the movie for myself is how they portray the vampire character. I won't spoil it for you, but the guy enjoys wearing very ""tata"" clothes, eats ""fruit"" all the time, and has a live-in roommate. This movie is classic! Fright Night has a sequel that some say is equally as good, but I wouldn't be one to say that. But, I do enjoy the sequel and definitely think it's worth a view. If you're a fan of horror and vampires, this is a must see flick. Welcome to Fright Night baby!",Fright Night
74,SanteeFats,Okay at best,5,22 September 2013,"Soooo stereotypical for this kind of movie in the mid eighties. It is a little hard to picture Amanda Bearse as the teenage love interest after her coming out as a lesbian (I still think she is cute, just not for guys I guess). Roddy McDowall is so good as the campy late night host of horror movies who gets fired, but helps out the young Charlie Brewster when push comes to shove. Brewster is a courageous young teen who steps up to the plate when no else believes him about the bloodsucker living next door to him. Chris Sarandon plays the very chic vampire who plots to suck everyone he can. When Roddy doesn't see any reflection in his cigarette case things start to change. When Roddy hits the turned best friend with the cross, burns his fore head but doesn't kill him, the turned friend threatens revenge by by the Master. The physical display at the disco is not in keeping with the whole staying under the radar of most vampire movies. After all if they know you exist they can come up with a way to kill you. But of course all ends well, kind of maybe, almost.",Fright Night

After viewing it, I apologized to him. The effects are dated. The plot - at least as presented - is not credible. The acting is bargain basement (I sympathize with Roddy MacDowell, having to make something of this dreck).

The plot is simple stuff centred around a vampire moving in next door to a typical suburban family, the teenage son gets suspicious after witnessing some goings on with some late night coffin dealings, so he contacts TV horror host Roddy McDowall to help him out. Its good points involve the likable cast, solid direction, and some great practical effects.

They believe he's crazy.

79,ivo-cobra8,A true classic horror vampire flick better than remake!,10,8 November 2015,"Fright Night (1985) is an awesome true classic vampire horror film that is written and directed by Tom Holland him self. I love the remake, but I just love the original much better. In here you have monsters, a real vampires and werewolves in it. Chris Sarandon did a wonderful job as Jerry Dandridge a vampire by night. I love the make up and I love how they were portraying a vampire in this movie. Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) is a turned werewolves at the end of the film and he is staked by Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall). Fright Night (1985) is one of my favorite vampire horror flicks, I love vampire movies and this film is for me. The remake is a good film, but they aren't portraying real monsters and werewolves like they do in this movie. I am pretty sure if the new movie would portrayed such a monsters, werewolves like in here, I am pretty sure the movie would be better! The end was perfect and awesome how Charley and Peter are fighting Jerry, I love how Vincent and Charley are smashing in all the basement windows, allowing the sunlight to hit Dandridge. Using a mirror, they reflect the sunlight and finally manage to kill Dandridge by blasting him with the rays and he bursts into flames and within seconds his body is reduced to dust and bones. That scene was awesome!I love Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent the great Vampire Killer! Seriously this movie kick ass! Roddy McDowall kicks ass in this slasher vampire film! I love everything about this film, that it is in it! My all time favorite vampire movie ever, a classic, the remake doesn't even come close to matching it. Chris Sarandon was perfect as Jerry Dandridge the next door neighbor vampire, nothing will ever change my mind about this one, no vampire movie since this one has ever matched it, movie or series!! Fright Night is a ultimate classic a classic film that I will always cherish it to death! The special effects are great in this one. This film not only has vampires, werewolves and monsters in it, it also has a virgins, it has Roddy Mcdowell in one of his best performances. It has Prince Humperdink/Jack Skelenton as the baddie. It is quotable, self-aware way before Joss Whedon/Kevin Williamson, and funny as hell. The weakest link, although she still gives a very good performance, is Amanda Bearse AKA Marcy Darcy from Married with Children as the sexpot (could be bonus if you are so inclined), object of desire. It's hard not to look nor listen to her, without waiting for an Al Bundy insult, but there is some consolation when she ""turns"". Watch it and love it, this is what comedy-horror is all about. This is a great movie. I wouldn't say it scared me to death but it's good and creepy, it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. GREAT FILM! Our heroes are a motley group of characters, the straight-laced boy next door who no one believes, the bookish girl crush who is coveted by all, the monster-fan geek, and a most wonderful touch with Roddy McDowall playing a washed-up horror actor similar to character actors such as Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee/Vincent Price. Bottom of line I love this film, it is one of my favorite Vampire horror slasher films, I also love the remake, tough it even can't hold a candle to this film. Meet Jerry Dandridge. He's sweet, sexy, and he likes to sleep in late. You might think he's the perfect neighbor. But before inviting Jerry in for a nightcap, there's just one thing you should know. Jerry prefers his drinks warm, red and straight from the jugular! It's Fright Night, a horrific howl starring Chris Sarandon as the seductive vampire and William Ragsdale as the frantic teenager struggling to keep Jerry's deadly fangs out of his neck. Only 17-year-old Charley Brewster (Ragsdale) knows Jerry's bloodcurdling secret. When Charley can't get anybody to believe him, he turns to TV horror host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who used to be the ""Great Vampire Killer"" of the movies. Can these mortals save Charley and his sweetheart Amy (Amanda Bearse) from the wrathful bloodsucker's toothy embrace? If you love being scared, Fright Night...will give you the nightmare of your life. That is the main plot in the remake they don't even mentioned Jerry's last Surname. Fright Night is a 1985 American horror film written and directed by Tom Holland and produced by Herb Jaffe. It stars William Ragsdale, Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowall, and Amanda Bearse. I love this film to death! It is my favorite best horror slasher film, the rating I am giving tot his film is 10/10. This film deserves it! Tom Holland thank you for so beautiful wonderful horror vampire film, big cheers and thank you!",Fright Night
80,The_Movie_Cat,"""Back, spawn of Satan!""",6,26 November 2000,"Eighties youth movies... don't you just hate 'em? Surely one of the worst things in society; a cultural glitch that will return to visit you in Hell, along with Country music and corduroy trousers.Fright Night is typical of the period, and contains all the requisite elements: A club scene with eighties music and fashions - (hello braces!) - check; Some sub-soft porn titillation, including a gratuitous breast shot set to a drum machine - check; Excessive gore and ropey make-up effects - check; Irritating ugly nerd sidekick - check; Wit and understatement - sorry, you're not on the list.Fright Night is a spoof of horror movies, with Roddy McDowall (a fun performance, but can't save the film) as a TV host who is scared of vampires in real life. So that when William Ragsdale finds his neighbours are vamps, McDowall is too terrified to help. There are some brief mentions of other genre films, though Roddy having a justified pop at Friday the 13th does not a satire make. And while it predates The Lost Boys by two years and sort of inspired Buffy et al., this is hardly worthy of praise. Not very funny, not very scary, and not very good, Fright Night is a weakly directed, bog-standard ""youth"" pic that drags on too long at just 105 minutes.There was a sequel (imaginatively titled ""Fright Night Part 2"") three years later, though you don't really expect me to see that as well do you? 4/10.Post-Script, 11/9/2008: Happened to catch this film again forgetting that I'd seen it, much less commented on it.

82,fernandoschiavi,Respecting all vampire conventions that Tom Holland made one of the coolest movies of the '80s,7,2 October 2021,"The 70s and especially the 80s were rich moments for Hollywood horror cinema. In addition to the two masterpieces of the genre, The Exorcist (1973) and The Shining (1980), famous franchises took their first steps and some of the most revered villains were born: Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Jason Vorhees are some whose names terrified young teenagers of yore. Such is the importance of this period that, nowadays, we are attacked with a flurry of remakes and reboots of those same villains of yesteryear.The first scene in the film is brilliant: a huge moon and a wolf howl already show that nothing good is coming; we then see a typical suburban neighborhood in the United States and the camera in a very well executed traveling focuses on the house of Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale), who is currently making out with his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) - he doesn't seem to be enjoying it much anymore. Who prefers to draw her boyfriend's attention to the program that is on TV. But Charley proves to be even more stupid because the girl is semi-naked, but he prefers to keep investigating with binoculars the new residents of the house next door. It's even understandable since there are two men carrying a coffin into the house! Meanwhile, several murder cases are advertised on TV, and the situation is further complicated when Charley realizes that one of the murdered people was in the house next door the day before! It would be a simple suspense plot if the killer wasn't a vampire!Playing James Stewart in Rear Window, Charley starts to watch over everything going on in the house next door and its owner Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon), who has just moved in along with his friend Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark). One night, he realizes that Dandrige has fangs and is about to bite a girl. Charley is even more terrified when he realizes that Dandrige has seen him! Charley's fight now is to prove that his neighbor is a vampire, which obviously no one believes! His mother, his girlfriend and even his best friend Ed Thompson, or Evil Ed.Director Tom Holland brings to the viewer a horror film different from those that permeated the 1980s. Seeking inspiration in Hitchcock, using the voyeuristic aspect present in 'Rear Window' (1954), and in films of the 1930s genre, Holland delivers to its viewers a beautiful film, without, however, losing the trash aura present in the best decade of horror in cinemas. The Hour of Amazement (Fright Night, 1985) is the type of film that, in addition to establishing the view of the world through the eyes of a young protagonist, manages to transform all that horror plot into an analogy to the fears and questions that run through his mind. With that, he rescues a peculiar atmosphere, of nostalgia, present in several productions belonging to that decade, evidenced by always garish scenarios and a still naive action. Among other genres, horror became a means for directors and screenwriters to leave heroism and courage to the teenager; it was increasingly common to see them as protagonists, destined to face evil with the weapons and fearlessness they had at their disposal.Certainly, it's a somewhat corny concept, even though it was precisely that which gave some 1980s films a charming aura of nostalgia. In A Hora do Amazto, there was already a charm for the old-fashioned (even for the time), denounced both in dialogues and in the characterization of certain characters. Whether in the known artifices to annihilate a vampire (from crucifixes to wooden stakes) to the scenic construction of their dwellings, the fascination for the infamous mythology of nocturnal entities was evident, at a time when it was undergoing major changes. It is possible to visualize in Jerry Dandrige clear allusions to Count Dracula, from the sad and passionate face to a remarkable elegance in his gestures; but the visit to the literary work of Bram Stoker is felt not only through his antagonist, but also through the curious figure of the decadent television host Peter Vincent, an amusing mixture of Van Helsing and Bela Lugosi.According to rookie director Tom Holland (who would come to direct another classic ""Killer Toy""), the desire was to make The Boy Who Cried Wolf updated for the 80s. And as he still liked vampire stories, he decided to mix it all up in a great script. But in the '80s, vampire movies weren't all that hot. In a funny but tragic scene, Peter Vincent, being fired from the command of the TV show, vents to Charley: Do you know why I was fired? Why young people today no longer believe in vampires. All they want to know is killers in hockey masks chasing innocent girls. The reason for all of this, Tom Holland explains in interviews that one of the reasons the genre has declined is that there were a lot of vampire movies made in the 1950s, but that no one could modernize them. For this movie, he was determined to respect all the conventions of a traditional vampire story - coffins, no reflections in the mirror, vampire being invited by the owner and all the rest - but always putting them in a contemporary context.And it was respecting all vampire conventions that Holland made one of the coolest movies of the '80s, which taught a whole new generation the rules of how to identify and kill a vampire. The film also has great special effects and makeup all in charge of Richard Edlund's Film Corporation, the same as Ghostbusters. The producer created extensions for Dandrige's fingers as well as masks that made the actors downright scary. One of the best sequels is when Evil Ed reverts to his human form shortly after turning into a wolf and being defeated by a very lucky Peter Vincent. This is all without any CGI, just makeup effects interspersed with camera cuts.There are two reasons for the success of Fright Night: the first is the setting in the suburb where Charlie Brewster (Ragsdale) discovers that his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige (Sarandon) is a vampire. From the howl of a wolf in the opening to the predominance of shadows and fog in Jan Kiesser's photography, director and screenwriter Tom Holland manages to balance the tone of disbelief nicely with the discovery that there is a menacing and dangerous leech next door. From the opening minutes, Holland surprises with a safe and vigorous debut in the direction. The references from horror television shows work, and art direction John DeCuir Jr. Succeeds in recreating the sanctuary of passionate vampire hunter Peter Vincent (McDowall), in Bella Lugosi's scattered posters, crucifixes and scattered ornaments throughout the house. Furthermore, the direction gradually confirms the monstrous nature of Jerry discovered by Charlie's appalled voyeuristic gaze. The signs are clear: neighbors carry a coffin to the basement, the newspaper reports the death of two people, one Charlie had seen the day before, and one of the neighbors, Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) is seen painting the windows of the house.Looking at Fright Night these days, you can see that the film has hardly aged. Aside from the horrible fashion of the 80s and a sequence that takes place in a disco where an amusing (but dated) song by Devo is heard - making a point of showing all the power of the synthesizers of the time - almost nothing has aged. The effects are still very good and oddly enough, better than many current movies. The performances are also memorable, Roddy McDowall is perfect as an apparently arrogant and cowardly ex-star who when he sees that vampires exist even chicken out not to mention that he always makes a point of reliving the glories of the past by commenting on the films in which he participated. And don't belittle of course, McDowall's work would be even more interesting if they were actually chosen a veteran horror actor to play himself. Have you ever thought how interesting it would be to have a Peter Cushing cast? At the other end we have Chris Sarandon shining as the seductive vampire Jerry Dandrige, who at times even has the grimaces of Hammer actors doing a delicious tribute.Everything here evokes the spirit of a decade lost in time, of an innocence that was still patent, whether through the immense difficulty of the leading couple in having their first night of love (since today's teen films have long since surpassed this range), or even the clear conflicts between credibility and skepticism. It is common for every child to immerse themselves in fantasy, in the belief in everything that adults are not able to see; this is how Charley's adventure takes place, in the confidence in his own eyes and in the challenge of convincing others of the veracity of that situation. In this way, the spectator was able to arouse empathy for the trajectory of that boy, since there, above all, there was no more than a teenager wanting to be heard and taken seriously.Its considerable success would break, if only momentarily, the public's excitement towards slasher movies, which left aside the massacres committed by serial killers to focus its attention on the maddening battle of a young man against strange creatures. Fright Night is an open film, which ends with reticence, whether because of the opportunity to make a sequel (which would be released three years later) or even because of the evidence that there is still more to tell after that. The point is that, in one way or another, the red eyes that peek into the darkness right at the end betray the same as the mysterious opening scene, because the full moon that appears in the symphony of howls makes the message clear: we will have a long night ahead.",Fright Night
83,cchase,"""'And Like A 'GHOUL' Neighbor, 'STAKE' Farm Is There!""",8,5 December 2008,"Part of the ""vampire renaissance"" that took place in the '80's, FRIGHT NIGHT was one of three films that made vampires hip and chic with the teen set, (THE LOST BOYS and NEAR DARK were the other two.) It was also the brainchild of ingenious writer/director Tom Holland, who would also give the horror world a demented little ""Good Guys"" doll named Chucky...Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a typical horny teen with two passions in life: getting to third base with his girlfriend Amy (future MARRIED WITH CHILDREN star Amanda Bearse) and watching the late night spook show FRIGHT NIGHT, hosted by former horror legend Peter Vincent, (Roddy McDowall in top form). Wellll...make that THREE passions. A recent series of brutal murders involving young women has Charley convinced that his 'playa' of a neighbor, the handsome and charming Jerry Dandrige (Chris 'PRINCESS BRIDE' Sarandon) is in fact a 'creature of the night.' The problem for both Charley and his night-prowling neighbor is...Charley's RIGHT.Holland and the entire cast have fun taking all of the conventions of a John Hughes saga and taking a Dracula-sized bite out of them: teens dealing with hormones, relationships, their favorite quirky habits and hobbies, and of course, with your single mom having a romantic interest in a new guy. Who just so happens to be a vampire.Charley tries at first to convince his late-night horror hero Peter Vincent that there's more afoot in the house next door than the usual hanky-panky. After he's persuaded with a little monetary 'consideration', Vincent relents and decides to prove to Charley once and for all that there are no such things as vampires. That's when Peter suddenly finds that, to his own surprise and horror, some things do have basis in both 'reel' AND real life after all, and must make a decision whether or not confronting them is possible...or even worth it!This is one of those horror movies that still plays well even now. McDowall's schtick is dead-on as he simultaneously satirizes and salutes the work of old horror stand-bys like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Ragsdale and Bearse are engaging leads, but the real scene-stealers here are Jonathan Stark as Jerry's ""best bud"" and familiar, Billy Cole, and Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil Ed"" Thompson, Charley's best friend/sidekick, whose role as a teen outcast leads him to a painful and tragic end. Or does it?But a vampire movie is only as good as its lead monster, and Sarandon is more than up to the challenge, giving a career-making performance. (Holland would have him back in a more 'subdued' role in CHILD'S PLAY.)The visual effects (Richard Edlund) and makeup (everyone from Steve Johnson to Greg Cannom pitching in) were state-of-the-art at the time, and though some of the ""boo!""- worthy scares haven't dated very well, since most movies have used them a trillion times by now, there's still one or two sequences guaranteed to make you wet yourself a little.FRIGHT NIGHT makes a great springboard for a ""triple-night"" at the movies, should you team it up with THE LOST BOYS and NEAR DARK.",Fright Night

Ragsdale and love interest Amanda Bearse are saddled with stock juvenile characters, but Sarandon relishes his role as the vampiric predator, and McDowall is superb as a faded horror star whose old-fashioned values are shaken to the core by his confrontation with modern evil.Some observers have discerned a homoerotic subtext in Ragsdale's obsession with his handsome, vampiric neighbor, and also in Sarandon's pursuit of Ragsdale's high school buddy (Stephen Geoffreys, later known as 'Sam Ritter', star of gay adult movies like VIRTUAL STUD and SEX ON THE BEACH), but homophobes are reassured that this particular subtext isn't allowed to interfere with the slam-bang pyrotechnics. Geoffreys employs a range of tics and mannerisms which will infuriate some viewers and endear him to others, but his final sequence - one of the best in the entire movie - is charged with genuine emotion (rendered even moreso by McDowall's extraordinary, wordless performance on the sidelines), and the 'death rattle' which accompanies his departure is one of the creepiest sound effects this reviewer has ever heard!

87,deatman9,So much better then the remake.,7,27 October 2012,This is another one of those examples where the classic is way better then the original. The remake completely changed the story line I would not even really call it a remake.The acting in this one is good and the special effects are actually creepy instead of that CGI crap. Really is a great classic horror.This movie is about a young guy named Charlie Brewster. While spying on his neighbours one day he sees things to lead him to the suspicion that his new neighbour is a vampire. He is scared for his life while everyone else is scared for his sanity.I have loved this movie since I was a kid it used to be scary then but now its just funny and enjoyable.

88,Prichards12345,Decent teen vampire flick with excellent make-up effects.,7,10 November 2016,"Ah, the 80s, more blow-waves and bubble-perms than in the entire history of the human race! Fright Night has its fair share of these but it's a nicely played vampire movie that sticks to vampire lore (i.e. doesn't turn them into cgi superheroes) and has an engaging teen cast much aided and abetted by Roddy McDowell and Chris Sarandon.Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) discovers that his new next door neighbour Jerry Dandrige, is, in fact, a real life vampire. Nobody believes him, including his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) and friend Evil Ed (Stephen Jeffries). Inspite of a couple of murders the police chase him too, so Charlie, in desperation, seeks out famous t.v. vampire killer Peter Vincent. Peter too is sceptical, until he sees in one of his movie props that Jerry casts no reflection...Roddy Mcdowell is always welcome - a superb character actor in everything from Planet of The Apes to How Green Was My Valley. Sarandon also is an excellent vampire. And the film gets surprisingly serious as the story develops. It's easy to sit through the opening 20 minutes and expect the rest of it to be a jokey Gremlins-style movie. But it becomes a deadly straight affair. And the vampire make up effects are remarkable for their time. No surprise that Richard Edlund was involved! If the film has a major flaw, it's that the audience is shown way too early that Charlie is right about Jerry - he really is a vampire! More ambiguity until at least Vincent spots he has no reflection would have worked a treat. So it becomes a movie that for a long time the audience is way ahead of everybody else in the cast except Charlie.The disco moves Jerry puts on Amy are pretty daft, too. This whole scene could have been lost without harming things in my opinion.Peter Vincent. Great tribute to messieurs Cushing and Price of that ilk! On the whole this is a good mixture of old style vampire film and the then trendy 80s approach. Who needs remakes?",Fright Night

90,tomimt,"A fun horror comedy, with good special effects.",7,31 March 2007,"'Fright Night' is, when you look at it, a horror comedy with every cliché of the genre in it. And that's the whole idea I guess.The story begins as a kind of a 'Rear Window' take, when young Charley (William Ragsdale) notices his new neighbor is carrying a coffin in his cellar. Soon after that he learns, that a woman he saw going into the mans apartment has been found dead. He starts to believe, that the man is a vampire, but of course no-one believes him, so Charley has to ask a horror specialist, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) to help him before it's too late.Out of the cast MacDowall does the best job. After him comes, of course, the vampire, Chris Sarandon, though in the end it's pretty much the cause of the good special effects. Young Amanda Bearse does a nice role as a mandatory virgin girlfriend. The most annoying cast member has to be Stephen Geoffreys as ""Evil"" Ed, as he does his bit a bit too extreme.The special effects of the film are great and have been taken the stand of time relatively well. The transformations are very fluent and gruesome. Surprisingly enough the movie isn't, even though it's made in the heart of the 80's, in your face screaming ""look this is the 80's"". Of course there are the clothes and the music and the hairdo's, but somehow they aren't in your face, like they were in 'The Lost Boys' for example.'Fright Night' is perfectly good way to spend a couple of hours, if you want to see some horror and some comedy.

92,Min111,I think it's the best vampire movie,7,3 December 2017,"Fright Night is a cult classic! It's one of the greatest vampires films ever. Personally, it's my favourite vampire film. There are plenty of others, but the one that stands out is Fright Night. Even though Fright Night is a horror film, it isn't really scary. Yes, it's called 'Fright' Night, but it isn't really 'frightening' either. In this movie, Charlie Brewster has new next door neighbours moving in, but they're not who they seem to be. Charlie suspects that his new neighbours are in fact vampires, but nobody believes in him. He desperately tells his friends, Amy Peterson and Ed Thompson, but they seem reluctant to believe in him at first. So, he takes matter into his own hands, and prove that they're in fact vampires while Charlie is still scared. He asks a man called Peter Vincent - someone who is an 'expert' in vampires for help. Will his friends believe he's telling the truth? Can they defeat the vampires? You need to see it in order to find out. The main vampire name is Jerry Dandrige by the way. I liked Fright Night right from the start, and all the way to the end. It was entertaining. What I liked the most about Fright Night was the music. The songs were amazing. You could listen to them again. I liked the house Jerry Dandrige was living in. It looked very haunted. It looked like a fitting home for vampires. If you're a fan of horror films and/or vampires, I would advise you to see the 'original' Fright Night film. You won't feel disappointed. I don't know how many other vampire films, or even horror films that can compare. Fright Night is an instant horror classic! There's also a sequel called Fright Night Part II. That's also a good vampire film, but I wouldn't say it's as good as Fright Night Part I. There was also suppose to have been a third film, Fright Night Part III, but that didn't happen in the end. I think Fright Night is the best film about vampires.",Fright Night

94,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,12 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Welcome to Fright Night ... for real.""""Fright Night"" is an outstanding debut for director, Tom Holland, also serving as the film's writer. Released in 1985, this film stands up surprisingly well, especially considering the advancements made in special effects and CG since then. I first saw this back in the day when I was a teenager first discovering the fun of a good horror movie, and this one didn't let me down.When the new neighbor moves in next to Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) and his Mom, things take a drastic turn for the worse. Charley's suspicions are peaked when he sees them carrying in a coffin in the dead of night, people go inside the house never to be seen alive again, and a piercing scream shatters the silent night air from next door. Could his new neighbor, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon), actually be a vampire? Charley is convinced that he is, and he recruits the aid of his girlfriend, Amy and his best friend, Ed (whom he affectionately calls Evil). But when his Mom invites Jerry into their home one evening, Charley knows he is a dead man. Out of desperation, he reaches out to the host of the television show, Fright Night - a self-professed vampire killer named Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), for help. When Jerry takes an unusual interest in Amy, Charley knows that he needs to drive a stake through his heart before it's too late.This is by far, one of the best vampire movies to not only come out of the 80's, but of all-time. It was perfectly cast with each actor playing their part just right. Chris Sarandon embodied the vampire so well which translated not only to how he spoke, but in his body movement - even in the smallest moments and gestures. It wasn't overly dramatic, as some vampire movies tend to be, but simple and effective. In fact, there were a lot of tongue-in-cheek moments that just made this one of the most fun vampire movies I've ever seen.""Fright Night"" comes at a high recommend. The remake that came out in 2011 pales in comparison. Watch the original article instead. It always delivers and is a staple to the horror movie fan. I watch this one at least once a year, usually around Halloween time and I'm proud to have it in my own collection.",Fright Night
95,doctorsmoothlove,Fright Night,6,11 September 2011,"While it is inconceivable to imagine a time when vampires weren't smothering pop culture, when Fright Night was released in 1985 audiences were more interested in slasher sequels. The Exorcist had brought horror out of castles and into the suburbs where no vampire had been seen. The film's director, Tom Holland, being a fan of Hammer's and Universal's films, decided to make his own vampire movie as the genre had fallen into self-parody with Love at First Bite (1979). Holland was very familiar with Hitchcock from writing the screenplay for Psycho II, so he adapted Rear Window for contemporary preferences, adding a vampire as the antagonist. He was given a modern name in Jerry Dandridge, wore fashionable clothing, and even knew how to dance! Clearly, this was a novel idea that seems less impacting today than it actually was. Coming two years before The Lost Boys, Fright Night laid the groundwork for the revitalization of vampire cinema as it is today.Other than 80's-specific elements that are quite dated, Fright Night is nearly as pleasant today as it was a quarter-century ago. Holland isn't a great director and knows it, so his nostalgia and opportunism were stymied into making a genre horror film. And being such, the movie's adequacy denies its cult supporters from proclaiming it the classic they would like it to be while stylistically shielding it from being remade. The film's formula resonates as well today as it has since Nosferatu. A young man must save his lover from the clutches of a seductive vampire. Charlie Brewster of course manages to save his girlfriend Amy from Jerry, and he does it without our having to know too much about anyone involved in the process. Holland instead devotes a lot of the screenplay to various types of humor that vary in their effectiveness. Charlie is stuck between being a boy and a man and lets his curiosity deny him the sex he so much desires from Amy while making him susceptible to wasting his money warding off Jerry with every anti-vampire trinket his friend Ed sales him. Holland seems to have written the part of Charlie's assistant Peter Vincent for Roddy McDowell who literally echoes his anger at slasher films by saying, ""Today audiences only want to watch madmen chopping up young virgins."" Unfortunately, Vincent's dialog is mostly just an explicit in-joke for fans, but McDowell's aptness for physical comedy redeems the character in the film's second half. His television program, another in-joke, could actually be made relevant in the remake were it tied more appropriately to a character. Holland chooses to focus on what he perceives as a funny screenplay to make up for his pedestrian direction. His skills sure are obvious and in need of a re-write.Though, the enduring legacy of Fright Night has everything to do with Jerry Dandridge. His turtlenecks, affinity for art, physical closeness to his manservant, and the pet name ""Jer"" he likes using, all point to the metrosexual identity that has come to define the modern vampire. He never has to reaffirm his masculine identity, thus allowing the humor to actually be effective. Chris Sarandon plays the role to its fullest with his perpetually smug facial expressions, beyond what Holland probably intended. Even today there aren't actually that many notable gay vampires, but Louis and Edward can trace their family history distinctly to Jerry Dandridge.Recommended",Fright Night

Chris Sarandon is everything you could expect from a vamp - charming, menacing, and drop-dead sexy. Young William Ragsdale is quirky as our unlikely teen-hero. The late-great Roddy McDowall shines as a veteran horror movie actor who must face real horrors now!

The music wasn't very good either - way too eighties. I'm not a big fan of vampire movies but this was kinda fun.

100,DavidSim240183,An effective blend of comedy and horror,9,6 January 2008,"The 1980s brought about an upsurge of vampire films. But ones that were drastically different from they're predecessors. The whole vampire mythos was something that seemed decidedly passé in the 80s what with flowing cloaks and hammy dialogue.So the films of this decade solved the problem by smartly bringing vampires into the present day. The best example being the extremely underrated Near Dark, one of the greatest vampire films ever made. And while I feel Near Dark has a slight edge over Fright Night, this is yet another superior film of the genre.Fright Night is a hip, witty and enterprising attempt to bring vampires up to date. It doesn't so much deconstruct the genre the way Scream did with slasher movies. Rather it reconstructs itself for a whole new day and age while still remaining true to its origins.Director Tom Holland is clearly a horror film aficionado. After all the heroes of the piece are a horror movie fan and a former horror movie star. And Holland who also wrote the script has made sure they're well versed in everything there is to know about vampires.All the traditional aspects are there. Vampires suck blood. They sleep in coffins. They turn into bats and wolves. Sunlight and stakes are deadly to them. And they can't stand crosses and holy water. The only difference is instead of living in gloomy mansions and Gothic castles, they now live in suburbia.Its a neat reversal on what we've always believed about vampires. And it turns out to be a surprisingly effective setting. The first half of Fright Night borrows a few tricks from Rear Window when our hero, Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) spots his next door neighbour necking a girl. Only with fangs!Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is the vamp in question. And he soon gets wise to Charlie's Peeping Tom routine. Despite Charlie's best efforts, nobody believes his story. And when it becomes clear Charlie won't let this go, Dandridge pays him a visit. Either he forgets what he saw, or Dandridge will kill Charlie.So Charlie must turn to his hero, TV's Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), vampire killer (and ham actor) extraordinaire. With Charlie's girlfriend and best pal both vamped by Dandridge, Peter becomes Charlie's only ally. They must kill Dandridge before he kills them.Fright Night is a rather appealing attempt to update vampire mythology, and achieves it with a remarkable degree of success and certainty. I'm sure that's in no small part to Tom Holland's confident and assured direction, but the astutely observed performances by the cast also goes some way towards making Fright Night a winner.Holland's witty and intelligent screenplay frames its idea in very inspired dimensions. Its a knowing and very self-aware film, and that extends to the characters too. In particular Jerry Dandridge.He finds the classic vampire films of yesteryear to be more amusing than shocking. And he probably assumes the same of other people. Nobody is taking the vampire mythos seriously anymore, making it that much easier for genuine vampires like himself to go about their nightly hunting unopposed. And he never has to leave home either. It's a clever and borderline scary observation.But Fright Night is more than just a postmodern take on the genre. It's also an excellent horror film in its own right. Holland achieves a tremendous amount of atmosphere from half-lit camera angles and a reasonably effective soundtrack. Some of the selections admittedly do date the film, but some of the more subtler rhythms pulse through the background to unsettling effect.The film is also quite a tour de force of special effects work. There are FX that are staggering for 1985. Scenes that spring to mind are a vampire turning into a wolf and back again. A decomposing corpse. And Dandridge's death sequence. They're as impressive as anything you've seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London.But more importantly, Holland never allows the effects to blunt the horror, or the humour. Yes Fright Night is an involving scare show, but its a darkly humorous film at the same time. That's especially true of Roddy McDowall's hilarious turn as Peter Vincent. Sometimes Roddy McDowall was an annoyingly hammy actor, but with Peter Vincent he's found a character that allows him to flex his theatricality, but with the benefit of a tight script that forces him to toughen up.Also Chris Sarandon is an impressive villain. He cuts a striking figure in a long, sweeping coat. Fright Night's substitution for a cloak. And he hisses and sneers his way through the role with entertaining regard. He makes Jerry Dandridge a very charismatic, modern day vampire (with a curious taste for apples!).Fright Night is a film that set out to make a defining mark on the vampire genre, and it succeeded. Its a film that walks a fine line between horror and comedy, without ever indulging one at the expense of another. A fine and amusing redefinition of the vampire mythology that just gets better and better with age.",Fright Night
101,domino1003,The not-so-fearless Vampire Killers! (Spoilers Ahead),10,28 May 2004,"""Fright Night"" is one of my favorite vampire movies (And I have seen MANY!), which takes the ""boy who cried wolf"" theme to a new extreme.Charlie (Cute William Ragsdale)is your typical teen:having problems with high school, has an embarrassing mother (Who tells her son about a nightmare where she's naked and offers him a Valium!),and trying to get into the pants of his virginal girlfriend, Amy (Also cute Amanda Bearse). His life takes an interesting turn when Jerry Dandridge (Sexy Chris Sarandon) moves next door. Soon Charlie finds out that Jerry is a vampire and tries to convince his mother, girl and friend, Evil Ed (Jack Nicholson lookalike Stephen Geoffreys, who steals the film). He then enlists the help of Fright Night host, Peter Vincent (Wonderfully played by the late, great Roddy McDowall). Soon, the group of friends are drawn into a chain of events that have them running for their lives.Best parts: ALL OF IT!There are so many parts of the film that are great. This is not your typical group of vampire hunters: Charlie goes about the wrong ways to convince his friends about what he sees (And if he's such a horror fan, why does he ask Evil Ed what to do?). Peter is flawed: he battled imaginary vampires and now his fears are made flesh, which terrifies him. Amy is the typical damsel in distress (And a reincarnation of a girl that Jerry knew a long time ago). They have to face not only Jerry, but Billy, his servant (Jonathan Stark, looking a bit like Norman Bates).The film is a bit dated (It's a 80's movie after all), but it is STILL a good movie to watch over and over again.",Fright Night
102,Rautus,A Classic 80's Vampire movie,10,28 March 2008,"Fright Night is a horror/comedy written and directed by Tom Holland (The Beast Within, Psycho II, Child's Play), one thing that makes Fright Night such a great movie is it's horror make up effects, it's all puppetry and latex. None of that CGI stuff today, this was all hand made which I find makes a film feel more real. That said there are some good films that use CGI effects like Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Pan's Labyrinth, The Matrix, etc. The Werewolf transformation scene is very effective since it's disturbing and upsetting. The Vampire effects is great and the Bat form may just be a rubber creature but it looks good. The acting in Fright Night is great, Roddy MacDowel does a great performance as the iconic horror actor Peter Vincent (Peter Cushin and Vincent Price's first names combined.), the music score is also cool. The Come to Me score is a very catchy theme that really sets the tone, especially with the love scene.The plot of the film sees teenager Charlie Bruster and his girlfriend Amy one night making out in hid bedroom, as they get ready to go all the way Charlie notices something strange outside. Two people are carrying a coffin into the basement of the house, Charlie discovers that someone's just moved in to that house a while ago. The next day Charlie meets a young woman who goes into the house and that night while he's in his room he hears a scream coming from next door, Charlie goes to investigate and sees the two people carrying a bag with what seems to be a body inside. On the news Charlie sees a report about another murdered body and discovers that it was the woman that went into the house, at night Charlie decides to spy on the house and soon finds the owner getting ready to bite another young woman he invited to his home. Charlie becomes convinced that his neighbour is a Vampire, he asks for the Leuitentant to check the houser for anything but when Charlie mentions he's a Vampire he leaves thinking he's making this all up. Charile asks for help off his friend Ed, he tells him to put garlic on the windows and use crosses. Ed tells him that has long as the owner of the house doesn't invite the Vampire he's safe. That night in his room Charlie nails the windows shut, he's asked by his mother to meet someone and that person happens to be the Vampire neighbour Jerry, after being attacker in his room by him Charlie seeks help and the he feels the only man who can do it is horror icon Peter Vincent. He tells Peter what's going on but he doesn't believe him and leaves, his girlfriend Amy and Ed go to see Charlie and find that he's been up all night trying to make his room safe so the Vampire can't enter, he tells them that he plans to sneak into Jerry's house and ram a stake through his heart. Amy insists that before he tries to kill him that they get Peter Vincent around to prove it, Ed and Amy go to Peter's apartment and pay him to prove that Charlie's neighbour is human. They go to Jerry's home and make him drink pretend holy water. As they go to leave Peter looks at his mirror to see that Jerry has no reflection meaning he really is a Vampire. That night has Ed is walking home Jerry chases him into an alley and persuades him to become a creature of the night like him, Charlie and Amy hear Ed scream and think that he's fooling around with them again but soon find themselves being pursued by Jerry. They hideout in a Nightclub but soon find Jerry inside where he takes Amy away, the only way he'll see her again is if he and Peter Vincent come to his house.

104,supertom-3,"Tongue in cheek horror, very fun movie!",8,7 June 2002,"I'm not a fan of the horror genre, there are few, particularly slasher flicks and monster flicks. The ones I prefer are the more pyschological horrors such as the Sixth sense, that aren't so in your face from minute one. This however I did enjoy, I wasn't expecting to but since it had a good rating in my TV guide I thought I would watch it anyway. Where this differs from similar flicks based on boogy men type characters, this being basedd a vampire, is that the acting is actually quite good. I mean looking at for instance the Nightmare on Elm streets you see that the acting is terrible in them, but this was surprisingly good from a teen horror film. William Ragsdale is good as Charlie Brewster the boy who becomes obsessed with his next door neighbour because he thinks he's a Vampire, he is of course right but initially no one believes him including his girlfriend played by Married with Childrens very own Amanda Bearse. She is good in this and looks very nice in a cute sort of a way. She is following a typical horror trend where a woman in her late 20's plays a teen. The film never takes itself seriously, which a film of this type really shouldn't. It is funny but manages to chill at the same time mainly thanks to the incredble performance by Chris Sarandon, he is excellent as Jerry Dandridge the Vampire, he is sauve, and devilishly evil it really is a scene stealing performance. Overall the film is an enjoyable horrer, sure theres little plot to right home about but its fun and has your classic 80's monster and gore effects. Certainly it beats most of the genre and unsurprisingly is somewhat of a cult hit. 8/10",Fright Night

What makes Fright Night spectacular is the six main characters who were terrifically written and portrayed fantastically by the actors and actress.

The overall story is original for the time and provides a really nice blend of horror, comedy and drama. With an average run-time of slightly under two hours, all these great aspects of Fright Night really made the movie go by very quickly.

106,jayjaycee,"""Rear Window"" meets ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf""",8,24 October 2020,"""Fright Night"" is a 1985 horror film directed by Tom Holland starring William Ragsdale and Chris Sarandon.
⚪
All in all, this cult classic excellently blends the Hitchcockesque brilliance and voyeurism idea of ""Rear Window"" with the charm and nostalgia of old school vampire flicks, and by furthermore adjusting those values to the technologies and narrative possibilities of the mid-eighties, it becomes a moody vampire film with a distinct ambience and iconic flair that will please lovers of blood-suckers, and it's all perfectly rounded up by the memorable performance of Chris Sarandon as the suave, fruit loving next door neighbour Jerry Dandridge.
⚪
On day twenty-three I continued my personal walk down memory lane, as, who would have guessed it, this film is also one of the first horror films I have seen roughly five years ago. From a time where the Tom Holland wasn't automatically associated with a certain arachnid superhero, a man of the same created an iconic vampire flick with his directorial debut. And I gotta say, I almost love it as much as I did back in the day. Frankly, even if the idea of mixing Aesop's fable ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" with vampires located in the suburbs sounds admittedly silly, the execution makes it so utterly interesting. Against my expectations it was reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ""Rear Window"" - and this is a great thing. I mean, how often do we think that something is terribly off in our own neighbourhood and we are told that it is probably nonsense? Well, even if it is not that likely in real life, it still can happen anywhere, and this basic curiosity is what this film uses as its basic premise. Charley Brewster believes that his new neighbour is a vampire and ultimately decides to prove it to those who doubt him, but what I noticed only this time around is that our protagonist behaves like a jerk most of the time. Aside from the fact that he is a voyeur who spies on the affairs of others, he treats his girlfriend like dirt and urges her to do things she is obviously not ready for, and calls his alleged friend by a name he dislikes a lot. And I am supposed to find a connection with such a nimrod? Well, fortunately, this effect recedes after a time, but in general, the characters are all weird in some way. Stephen Geoffrey's ""Evil"" Ed Thompson is utterly eccentric, loud and most of the time, annoying as hell, Amanda Bearse' role as the girlfriend Amy is shallow as well, but then there are two great characters as that equate it in some way. Legendary actor Roddy McDowall portrays Peter Vincent, a faded actor and host of a late night show with the same name as this film (what a coincidence!), and Chris Sarandon play the suave, fruit loving vampire from next door, Jerry Dandridge. Oh, and those two are downright iconic. The latter didn't only play the role that somewhat carried the whole film, reportedly, he did so many other things and details for the film as well, that the production wouldn't have been as great as it is today, if it wasn't for him. Let us be honest, he steals the show in whatever scene he is in. And it is a rare thing that the vampire, the actual antagonist, is more well developed than the protagonist who, in this case, appears like an irrelevant character. Nevertheless, the story didn't suffer from that much, as it still delivers some decent genre fun. Regardless of the excessive use of fog, the film still offers a lot of horror joy that is mostly based on the classic vampire flicks from Hammer Studios with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, and it is palpable that it is an homage to this era. A vampire killer and his protégé set out to kill the vampire who kidnapped the woman. Sounds really old school to me, and I love it. The thing is, the movie furthermore managed to capture the essence of the old times and still add the flair of the modern age as well. Pop music, casual clothing and club dancing are only the best of it (besides the obvious knocks towards the rising slasher genre). Oh, and have I mentioned the sexual undertones in everything that are implying both homosexuality and heterosexuality? It is full of them, and I love this progressiveness. After three quarters are literally spent on building up the final showdown, the last bit of the film is still the best. From an utterly devastating werewolf transformation that in fact makes me feels sad every time I watch it, to mysterious servant entities solubilizing into whatever and puppet horror action, there is everything the vampire nerd in everyone needs. Oh, and the effects are just lovely and a joy to watch every time. However, there are always those few questions that I still cannot answer. What creature was Billy if not a human? How did Evil Ed survive and was able to show his red eyes? Those kinds of questions make the film's nature even more mysterious, and I love it. In the end, this film is a film by vampire fans for vampire fans, it is definitely one of the more memorable films from that genre, and despite some underdeveloped characters, a joy to rewatch. It is been a while since I have seen it last, and that is why I am so happy to have revisited again.",Fright Night
107,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest Vampire Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Suspenseful And Funny Horror/Comedy Cult Classic.",10,22 January 2015,"Fright Night is one of the greatest Vampire films ever made,an excellent,suspenseful and funny Horror/Comedy that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a fine script,a wonderful score and soundtrack and memorable special effects. All of those elements make Fright Night not only a Cult Classic but also one of the best Horror films of the 1980s.Fright Night tells the story of Charley Brewster(William Ragsdale),a teenager who discovers that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandridge(Chris Sarandon)is a vampire that's killing people but Charley can't prove it because no one believes him. Running out of options,Charley turns to Horror actor and Television host Peter Vincent(Roddy McDowall)for help and to take down Jerry Dandridge.During the big and successful Horror movie boom of the 1980s the Vampire genre was making a comeback and during the comeback they're were three Vampire films that were true standouts and in my opinion The Big Three Vampire films of the 1980s such as Joel Shmumacher's excellent and thrilling The Lost Boys(1987),Kathryn Bigelow's brilliant and unforgettable Near Dark(also in 1987)and last but not least Tom Holland's Fright Night(1985),an outstanding and entertaining Horror/Comedy that was a Box office success,but also became a Cult Classic and is one of the most memorable Horror movies of the 1980s. From beginning to end Fright Night is an amazing Horror film that is the true definition of a thrill ride and is a movie that strikes a wonderful balance between suspense and laughs giving viewers a fun movie that is gripping and funny but doesn't take itself to seriously and where everything just works. Where as The Lost Boys and Near Dark were films that took Vampire movies into new directions Writer-Director Tom Holland gives Fright Night a classic,old school tone taking the style and influences of the Universal Horror movies of the 1930s and 40s as well as the Hammer films of the 1950s and 60s and puts the style into a modern day setting(circa 1985)that makes the movie feel fresh and creative while still giving viewers all of the known and familiar trademarks of the Vampire genre(crosses,sunlight etc.). What I also enjoy about Fright Night is that despite being set in the 1980s there is a timeless feeling to the movie where it feels like the story could've taken place in any decade or anytime. Another thing that makes Fright Night so great is that the movie never says where in what City,Town or state this movie takes place in. Is it in the big cities of Los Angeles or New York or in a small town in the Midwest? It's a question that will never be answered and one of the best things about the film. The main characters in Fright Night(Charley Brewster,Jerry Dandridge,Peter Vincent,Amy,Evil Ed)in Fright Night are all memorable and fascinating and are given enough screen time to make the movie more intense,wild and funny with a lot of over the top moments. The Comedy and Humor in Fright Night is funny and smart thanks to Holland's great screenplay which is filled with clever dialog and moments as well as nods to Horror films and actors of the past(the character Peter Vincent is named after genre icons Vincent Price and Peter Cushing). While Fright Night isn't a serious Horror film there are plenty of moments of atmosphere and terror thanks to the Vampire moments and the atmosphere with the smoke and lighting that is around long enough to put viewers on the edge of their seats. Horror and Humor go together well in this film. While Fright Night isn't very gory or bloody there are a few moments in the movie where blood and goo comes out and it is effective. The ending of Fright Night is sensational and intense with tons of special effects and moments of insanity and mayhem that just never stops. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Chris Sarandon is excellent and unforgettable as Jerry Dandridge,one of the greatest Vampire characters in the history of Horror films. Sarandon is charismatic,mysterious and suave commands the film every time he's on screen. William Ragsdale is terrific as Charley Brewster,the hero of the film. Roddy McDowall is brilliant and at his best as Peter Vincent,a Horror actor and television host. Amanda Bearse(of Married...With Children fame)is amusing and cute as Amy,Charley's girlfriend. Stephen Geoffreys is fantastic and hilarious as Evil Ed,Charley's quirky best friend. Jonathan Stark is great as Billy Cole,Jerry's assistant. Dorothy Fielding(Judy Brewster)and Art Evans(Detective Lennox)give good performances as well.The direction by Tom Holland is outstanding,with Holland always moving the camera and giving the movie a haunting and beautiful style and look to the film. Great direction,Holland.The score by Brad Fiedel is sensational,haunting,memorable and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Amazing score,Fiedel. There is also a wonderful soundtrack that includes songs by J. Geils Band(Fright Night),Devo(Let's Talk),Sparks(Armies Of The Night),Ian Hunter(Good Man In A Bad Time),Evelyn 'Champagne' King(Give It Up),Brad Fiedel(Come To Me)and more.The Special Make-up and Practical Effects are fantastic,realistic and at times gory and truly add to the film. Wonderful effects.In final word,if you love Horror Films or Vampire Movies,I highly suggest you see Fright Night,one of the greatest Vampire films ever made and a Cult Classic you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Fright Night

110,mnpollio,Mediocre horror-comedy with an outsize reputation,5,10 June 2011,"Dorky teenager William Ragsdale discovers that his new next-door neighbor Chris Sarandon is actually a vampire and tries to enlist the aide of hammy former horror film actor/late night TV host Roddy McDowell to help him vanquish the bloodsucker.The plot is a thinly veiled reworking of the reliable Boy Who Cries Wolf theme wherein the main character knows something to be true, but cannot convince his friends and family until it becomes too late. This horror/comedy has a loyal cadre of fans, which is somewhat surprising considering its chronic mediocrity. The shifts between horror and comedy are not effortless resulting in a rather jarring experience. Sadly, the film is never especially scary and what comedy there is stems almost completely from McDowell's performance. There is a distinct lack of surprise to anything that happens in the film. Every plot development is almost painfully predictable to anyone who is even marginally familiar with horror film clichés, and the execution is never clever enough to add enough flourishes to make the conventions seem fresh.Part of the problem is that the main character of the piece, the teenager next door, is a completely uninteresting character. Despite all of the screen time, he constantly seems to fade into the background beside the vampire and horror host characters. This prevents the viewer from becoming too involved in what unfolds on screen.The acting is a real mixed bag as well. Sarandon is a charming and seductive vampire, if not particularly menacing. McDowell has a field day as the hammy actor distressed to find his real life taking on the guise of one of his old films. These two actors are the main reasons to see the film and, if fans of the film were honest, probably the only reasons. By contrast, Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse, as his girlfriend and predictably the amour whom the vampire sets his sights on, are painfully dull characters with all the entertainment value of wallpaper paste. It is difficult to have any rooting interest or concern for either one of them. Stephen Geoffreys, as Ragsdale's best friend nicknamed Evil Ed for some unknown reason, easily contributes one of the worst performances I have seen...ever. His every on screen moment is a torture, with him shrieking his lines inappropriately and bouncing off walls. Was director-writer Tom Holland afraid to restrain him or something? The finale devolves into the typical confrontation with a variety of visual effects thrown at the camera to sustain interest, but the whole production seems a bit underwhelming given its reputation among horror film fans. In the end, the film's successes (Sarandon's and McDowell's performances) are nearly outmatched by its negatives (uneven tone, bland hero and heroine, the dreadful Geoffreys).",Fright Night

Tom Holland's ""Fright Night"" isn't about a wimpy teen who is dealing with a mad slasher, instead of a slasher, a vampire is the opposing force.The story starts out like any other bad horror movie, and one night where Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) overhears a scream next door. He knows that someone has been killed not to far away from his house. The next day, he sees that two men, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) and Billy Cole (Jonathon Stark) have moved into the house right next to his place. Charley gets the thought that one of the two new neighbors is a vampire and he calls the cops, but they don't believe him. Now Charley gets a threat from the vampire and it's for real. His girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Beasre) and his best friend, ""Evil"" Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) also think Charley has lost his mind. So Charley has one last option, try Peter Vincent, who claims to be a great vampire killer in the movies.We first see Peter Vincent (portrayed fairly well by the late Roddy McDowall), who was a B-movie actor and now is fired as host of the last night creature features. When Charley tells Peter that he needs his help, Peter tells Charley that people don't believe in vampires anymore and that they want to see a slasher hacking up teenagers. That line is the film's main point. Charley fails to convince Peter, but Ed and Amy don't. That moment sets up the movie's second half, which is better than the first as Charley and Peter come into the house and the showdown that the duo with Jerry and Billy, who are both vampires is great. I have to give some credit to Richard Edlund, who also did the visual effects for ""Ghostbusters"" and the effects here are astounding. Brad Fiedel composes a very good musical score. The performances by Saradon and McDowall are fairly good, but Ragsdale and Stephen Geoffreys are spectacular here.

This is the situation protagonist Charley Brewster finds himself in when his suspicions about his new neighbor, Jerry Dandridge, turns out to an actual bloodsucker. In the lead role of Charley is a pretty neurotic William Ragsdale who is relatively convincing as a teenager. You feel bad for him as Charley goes through normal teenage drama with a pesky friend who belittles him constantly, relationship issues with his girlfriend and a distant relationship with his single mother. When his suspicions are laughed at, we feel that maybe Charley is being ridiculous until he is confronted by Jerry and we know the vampire accusation is no joke. As the film's vampire we are treated to an equally charming and sinister performance by Chris Sarandon. He oozes charm when Jerry is formally introduced to the main character and us, the viewers, after Charley has made his accusation to his friends and mother. Sarandon ups his ante when Jerry threatens Charley to stay silent that we the viewers are as terrified as Charley is. There are various scenes throughout the film that make us both fear Jerry, but are also seduced by his sex appeal. Yet we cheer for the vampire to meet his maker in the end like a traditional horror fan.The film's score lends the atmosphere a creepy vibe as the viewer feels stalked by an unseen presence, our hearts feel adrenaline rush during a tense scene or we are drawn into an odd sense of contentment. The makeup effects are put to good limited use to make the film's vampires look unappealing. They are not attractive creatures in their true form, but rather hideous creatures of the night. With piercing glowing yellow eyes (contacts worn by the actors), sharp yellowing fangs, monstrous facial expressions and the shape-shifting ability to transform into a bat.

It has not many ""80ish music video clips "" moments like the sequel and it is a true classic of juvenile comedies (although more serious than the sequel ) turned to horror so typical of the ""golden 80s"". Ragsdale as Charlie does a better acting job than in the sequel; McDowall delivers solid acting and even Sarandon is good in his bizarre portrayal of the vampire. Geoffreys as ""Evil"" comes distant second and I think I can act better than Amanda Bearse as Amy and other characters, EG the ""zombie guardian"" supposed to be intimidating but looking a bit queer to me. It is an ""in jest"" movie, often taking over the top motives from vampire movies, such as church items, prosthetics etc.",Fright Night
118,freaky_dave,Fright Night Was a Fun 80s horror film,8,20 February 2006,"Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) is a teenager who has just learned that his newest next door neighbor is a vampire. And worse, the vampire (Chris Sarandon) knows it. With help from and aging actor who once starred in vampire movies as a vampire killer (Roddy McDowall) Charlie must kill the vampire before the vampire kills him and his friends.I enjoyed Fright Night. It was a horror movie that had humor that actually worked an added to the film. The acting was pretty good too. I actually didn't dislike the characters like I do with lesser horror films. In fact in this movie, the acting made the movie even more worthwhile.The visuals were incredible for 1985 before computer graphics. One of the best transformations scenes was when one of the vampires transforms from a wolf back to a human. It was definitely astonishing for a movie that only cost a mere 9 million dollars to make.THis movie was definitely 80s, and it still holds up pretty good today. I definitely recommend it.",Fright Night
119,cshep,The PERFECT Halloween Movie !!!,10,19 October 2004,"Perfection is a word I use sparingly, but Fright Night is the Perfect Halloween movie to watch !!! Tom Holland does an outstanding job of directing, drawing you into the everyday lives of Charlie Brewster, and his girlfriend Amy..and then into the darkness of the Supernatural . Hyper teens, vampires, and Roddy McDowell are the Quintessential Mix, in this SUPER natural thriller . where a vampire moves next door to the average American teen, and there it begins...... The story takes place in a small town in Iowa. People start showing up dead !The Director spares NO expense showing us the many different shapes and shadows of EVIL . Roddy McDowall is EXCELLENT in any role he chooses, but his Tour DE Force performance will be ONE of his most memorable and enduring ..... Feeling the pages of life turning without him , the aging Peter Vincent(Roddy McDowall} becomes a TV ratings victim as host of ""Fright Night "", and is summoned by Charlie Brewsters friends to perform a debunking of the new next door neighbor of Charlie, where weird events have been taking place...and this is where the fun begins...Club Radio is a Great scene , really well done !!! Evil Ed Thompson, a friend of Charlies, is transformed ,and becomes a protégé of Jerry Dandrige(Chris Sarandon)and an integral part of the plot. William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are outstanding as the Star crossed lovers, whose fate is reshaped by the mysterious Jerry Dandridge ! PERFECTLY CAST.....

120,tequila101,Pure Greatness from Tom Holland,9,3 April 2011,"After watching this film just Friday, I have already found this film to be a very memorable piece of work by Tom Holland who did Psycho II and of coarse Child's Play.The story is about a kid who believes that there's a Vampire living next to him. He tries to notify that people are being murdered by the blood thirsty Jerry but nobody will believe him. He then looks up to the famous horror vampire killer on TV, Peter Vincent who he believes will help him stop Jerry and his buddy.First watching Child's Play and now Fright Night (Another horror film I should have watched ages ago..) Tom Holland does a top notch job on creating the right amount of humour, scares and disturbance for us to feast on. I believe like Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper or even John Carpentar, Tom Holland is a legend in the horror business as in this film he can create the right mood like he created the right scares for Child's Play.Chris Sarandon does an excellent job as the charming but sinister Jerry Dandrige who takes people in and posses them with his evil love. I just could not get over how great Chris Sarandon was in this vampire role. I usually hate vampires and vampire films but with Tom Holland's great direction and once again memorable scenes and Chris Sarandon's perfect-o acting, I believe that now I like vampires (well only Sarandon's for now).The other actors where casted perfectly for their roles and the special vampire and wolf effects and even the concept are all done well.They say they are going to release a remake of Fright Night this year. All I can say is that I've looked at the trailer and it looks fail. The new actor playing Jerry Dandrige doesn't look like he'll be able to pull it off, he just can't do it and the whole remaking of the story looks like a complete mess. I have no hopes for the remake.The original from me gets 9 bloody vampires out of 10.",Fright Night

123,Chromium_5,Another gem from the 80's,8,4 April 2005,"The 1980's was, as far as I'm concerned, the best decade for movies the world has ever seen. It seems like 99% of the movies that came out were not at all intended to be taken seriously, but were made just for the sake of pure entertainment. ""Fright Night"" is a perfect example. It's a lighthearted, peculiarly sexual horror flick with some very memorable characters, especially Chris Sarandon as the seductive vampire, Roddy MacDowall as the skeptical Vampire Hunter, and of course Evil Ed Thompson, who is not the best actor of all time (either that or he was on crack) but unforgettable all the same. Plus it is packed with homages for fans of this sort of thing (check out the stuff playing on Charlie's TV screen). It's a funny, cool, and sometimes genuinely scary film that any fan of classic 80's silliness should own.",Fright Night
124,spacemonkey_fg,Perfectly spooky vampire film with excellent make up effects!,10,3 March 2005,"Title: Fright Night Director: Tom Holland Stars: Roddy McDowell, Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys Released: 1985 Review: (very few minor spoilers) I'm sure many of you here know this movie by heart and have seen it countless hundreds of times, but this here review is for those newer schmoes who still haven't had the pleasure of seeing this masterpiece. So here it goes.This movie has a special place in my horror loving heart, for many reasons. Among them the fact that its just so fun to watch. Over and over again I find myself revisiting this flick, simply because I love the characters so much and because all those horror clichés I love are all over the place.The story revolves around a teenager named Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) who loves to watch his favorite horror show called ""Fright Night"". This show which is hosted by Peter Vincent (played by Roddy Mc Dowell) plays old horror movies every night and Charlie watches them all the time.One problem though. Charlie suspects his new neighbor Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire, and therefore decides he has to destroy him. No one believes him, not his girlfriend Amy or his buddy ""Evil"". So he decides to take matters into his own hands. Once Dandridge realizes what a threat Charlie could be to him well, lets just say things get complicated. And for us horror fans, in a good way.This film pays homage to many horror films of old. If your a horror fan you'll get all the cool inside jokes...like Peter Vincent who is obviously named after Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. If you watch closely you'll catch a Hammer film playing on Charlies TV. Hell at one moment Charlie is even watching Children Shouldn't Play with dead things! This films taken inspiration from many other vampire films before it, like for example hammer films Horror of Dracula. Check out Evil Ed getting that cross burned onto his forehead to see what I mean! It also has some hints of 1979s Dracula adaptation by Jhon Badham. But thats not to say that Fright Night is not at all original, its taken inspiration by these films, and is paying homage to them, but it has its own thing going on.All the characters in this film are memorable, if not arch typical. Yeah, you get your teenage nerd/goody little two shoes with Charlie Brewster, Amanda Bearse as the virgin girl who's to scared to do it with her boyfriend and your get your clown act with ""Evil"", but they are so endearing and innocent that you cant help but feel sorry for what they are about to hurl themselves into.Then there's Roddy McDowells great Peter Vincent who plays a father figure to Charlie. The situations and scenes with them together are great. Specially that scene where Charlies begging Peter to help him.Then there's the main baddie, Jerry Dandridge a vampire who's lived for many thousands of years and now just wants to settle down in this quiet little town and suck it dry! Many female horror fans refer to Dandridge as the ""sexiest male vampire ever"" so there you go. He delivers many memorable lines and is a formidable character for Peter and Charlie to go up against.Cool make up fx, even by todays standards the make up fx seen on Fright Night stand on their own as being very well achieved, vampire transformations, werewolf's, giant vampire bats you name it, its in there and done well. One particularly good moments is ""Evils"" transformation...enough said.One minor set back, is that maybe some younger viewers might not like the 80s soundtrack which the movie has. All the songs on it are as 80s as you can get. This is very evident in a scene that takes place inside of a disco called ""Club Radio"". To me and many others that might come of as nostalgic and a trip down memory lane but to others (specially the younger viewers) it might prove to be distracting. But thats about the only set back I can see in watching this film.Fright Nights success at the box office was followed by an also entertaining sequel aptly titled Fright Night II. Not as good as the first but still highly enjoyable.Check this flick out...its a horror film done right. And one of the best vampire flicks ever if you ask me! Rating: 5 out of 5",Fright Night
125,Lucabrasisleeps,"Sexy, creepy, funny at the same time",8,16 January 2015,"Frankly this is not a genre that I am such a fan of (Horror comedy). I generally have not liked any movies from this genre that much. I decided to check out this one since I always give the classics a chance no matter what. There are certain aspects that elevate this movie about 80s cheesy mediocrity. One thing is of course Chris Sarandon. He is an absolutely smoldering hot man. OK that sounded gay but I don't care. Every time he is on screen, he is able to pierce through your soul. Nobody could do this role better than him. I heard of the remake and there is no way Colin farrell (who I don't like that much anyway) could be that sexy. There are many sexy scenes in this one. But don't expect too much nudity, it is no Jess Franco vampire movie. But it is sexy without showing too much, which is quite an achievement.Another point is the soundtrack. I just discovered that Brad fiedel did the soundtrack which stunned me because it seems a few of my favourite soundtracks of the 80s were by him (Terminator, Just before dawn and others). He doesn't disappoint here. The music is absolutely perfect for the sexy scenes and is appropriate for the creepier scenes as well. Just for your reference, there is a club scene and a sex scene (well not entirely) which show how perfect the music is. Another thing I liked is the level of comedy in the movie. It is more of a smart horror movie with clever lines (not the Joss whedon type) than a slapstick horror comedy. The comedy gets lesser towards the end and becomes more of a serious horror movie. Even with some dark humor, it doesn't seem distracting enough. Roddy mcdowall excels as the actor who is suddenly thrust into this situation. His lines were quite funny especially his line about slashers. An additional point which many ignore when it comes to this movie is the performance of Jonathan Stark who is quite creepy in his role as Billy, the assistant. This character, even when being overshadowed by Dandridge, presents a silent menace. One of the creepier elements of this movie. Even with all the comedic elements, it doesn't skimp on the atmosphere and there are certain scenes which are quite impressive, like the scene with the wolf and the scene when Dandridge comes to warn Charley.Overall I loved it and to be honest, it is maybe only the second comedy horror that I like after Scream.8/10",Fright Night
126,yonhope,"Take her, stake her, Studebaker",7,20 March 2005,"Hi, Everyone, This is a good Vampire movie, but not the best. Of the movies I have seen, I would say the best Vampire movie would be Night Stalker with Darren McGavin.Roddy McDowall performs well and my guess is he actually owned the Studebaker he drove. He was able to start it and shift and maneuver it very well in his scene where he was getting away from his bothersome fan. That fan was the teen (more or less) lead in the movie.Where this movie falls short is in its use of special effects. It overdoes the fog swirling around the spooky house and the use of morphlike changes from men to monsters and back. The director should have trusted his cast. They were capable of doing a better film.I was somewhat reminded of Rebel Without a Cause with a Vampire added and stirred with a funny bone.I think the best scene was Roddy McDowall getting his faith. It comes on a staircase. Not quite as good as the staircase scene in Sunset Blvd. but still good.I think the Vampire should have driven a Nash Metro or Henry J. Roddy could have chased them with the Studebaker. Lose the disco scene and add a road chase and you would have a better movie.I highly recommend Night Stalker with Darren McGavin and Love at First Bite. Also Vamp with Christopher Makepeace is fun.Tom Willett",Fright Night

Each character is great the effects are great the soundtrack is unbelievably sexy.

130,80sHorror,A great 80's vampire movie with lots of action and humour,10,25 March 2012,"Considering 'Fright Night' is a film now over 25 years old it's still a great vampire flick, mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously and also due to a great cast which are hugley engaging. The real star though is Roddy MacDowall, he brings just the right amount of hamminess, nobility and cowardice to 'TV vampire hunter Peter Vincent'. The film is filled with subtle references to past classic vampire movies, and does a great job of integrating vampire folklore into a world where everyone thinks vampires only exist in the movies. Overall, 'Fright Night' is a great film helped along by a witty and intelligent script, a classic 80's soundtrack and visual effects that still hold up well by today's standards, and to top it off a finale that'll knocks your socks off!

The plot is simple yet original: A teenager start to believe that his neighbor is a vampire, and is, he is set out to prove himself right. What makes this movie work is the fact that this teen enlists the help of a TV personality vampire killer, played by Roddy McDowall, to help him capture the vampire. Roddy's performance works for the most part as being the washed up TV host looking for away to redeem him.The scares are there and Tom Holland rethought the design for a vampire, as well as the bat that comes with it. It had a great blend of sexual pleasure, which vampires often do, and humor that drove this film. It had a very memorable dance club scene and a great theme song by the J. Geils Band simply titled, Fright Night.The few bad things are very minor. The acting could have been better given the situation and the makeup, though good, was sort of funny. The special effects were great on the other hand.Overall, this movie deserves a change. If you like new and interesting vampire movies, than this movie is for you.",Fright Night
135,CountVladDracula,Far superior to it's remake!,10,5 July 2011,"After I finished reading the truly horrible script for the 2011 remake of Fright Night I found myself with a new appreciation of the original movie.Peter Vincent is probably the most enjoyable character in this film. Roddy McDowall stole the show as the slightly cowardly TV horror host who grows a spine and rises to be the heroic vampire killer he had always pretended to be. The soundtrack is incredible. The acting is brilliant. I have always loved Gothic Horror, particularly the old Hammer horror films such as what Peter Vincent shows on his TV show. Not only do I not see a purpose in the Fright Night remake but I feel it fails on my many levels where the original excels. The vampires of the original Fright night had the powers of Dracula, himself. They could turn into horrible little bats, or wolves, or mist. They could enthrall human wills and could show up on film as a human might. In the remake they have no such abilities and this is not so-well compensated by an excess of explosions. The writer of the remake claims that horror movie hosts don't exist anymore. Not only is this not true but there are more horror movie hosts on TV AND Internet today than there ever were on TV in 1985. Elvira's Movie Macabre, Mystery science theater 3000, Nostalgia Critic, just to name a few... I think they made a huge mistake in changing Peter Vincent to a nearly unrecognizable stage magician in the remake. If anything the movie host is more relatable now than ever before. Skip the remake, stick with the original. It makes more sense. It has more accessible characters. Peter Vincent actually has depth rather than the show pretense of depth with the added backstory given in the remake. Charlie is a lot nicer and a lot more sympathetic in the original. And this one had memorable and catchy songs on the soundtrack. The vampires are more frightening while at the same time more charming and strangely sympathetic while also terrifying and deadly. The humor isn't forced and there's no obnoxious product placement. The remake... has none of these qualities. This is by far the superior film. Skip the remake, kids. Stick with the original!",Fright Night
136,Harhaluulo54,"Best way to start off a vampire movie is the sound of a howling wolf - A look into 80's horror, part 8",5,21 October 2016,"My mission to watch 30 horror movies from the 80's continues with Fright Night (1985). This vampire movie is the best I yet saw, but not as memorable as 'An American Werewolf in London (1981)'.The build up, direction, pacing, audiovisual execution and the horror side itself are simply said well done. By no means perfect, original nor even impressive. Still solid and doesn't have flaws that stand out and effect the immersion. There is no useless minute of airing time. No filler material that is there just to add to running time. The build up is done in a very simple mystery manner that soon turns into a full time vampire hunting adventure. There is quite big differences when comparing this to the first 7 movies I saw during my marathon. The biggest being that this actually feels like a horror movie and not a costume/special feature showcase. Second notable difference is the existence of music and bgm. It stands out and the score has even some famous songs that work as standalone too. I would even go as far as saying this movie is ahead of its time as it doesn't yell ""look, I am from the 80's.""

137,mitchell5954,"Forgettable, In My Opinion",3,29 August 2014,"Fright Night in a nutshell is essentially a horror/comedy about vampires. If you want a cheesy fun horror movie to watch with your friends you might like this. However, I was not too fond of this flick to be honest. There are better horror/comedies out there like Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. There are certainly better vampire movies out there. If you want a fun vampire movie then watch John Carpenter's Vampires or Blade 1 & 2.The story is very simple. A high school kid named Charlie Brewster soon learns that his new neighbor is a vampire. He tries to get help but no one believes him. The vampire realizes he's on to him and threatens to kill him. He is then forced to get the help of ""vampire hunter"" Vincent from the TV series Fright Night.The film does some things right. It has some good-up effects and the effects when the vampires die is good also. The score is decent. Also, the acting isn't that bad.However, the film has many issues. The biggest problem is the character. I didn't find myself caring about a single one. The main character, Brewster is so bland. The rest of the cast are just assholes and on the whole not interesting at all. The only character I slightly like is the so-called exterminator Vincent, but even took a while for me to warm-up to. The interaction between the characters, I thought, was very poor. There is nothing to the villain either. If I don't care about the character than I don't care what's happening ultimately.I also thought the film was a bit too long. There are many scenes that I thought were unnecessary and just dragged out particularly the final battle. That final confrontation could've ended like three times but they kept dragging it out. I didn't really care anyway so I just wanted it to end.Overall, I found fright Night a forgettable movie. Like I said earlier, if you want a fun time waster to watch with your friends then you might enjoy this. Maybe I'm alone in this because there are many people who enjoy this film. You can decide for yourself.",Fright Night
138,thelastblogontheleft,The Best,10,13 July 2017,"Oh man, guys. GUYS. This is one of my FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL-TIME so you're about to get quite an earful. I grew up watching this movie and it still gives me the warm fuzzies. The first time I re-watched it as an adult was like zooming right back to being 10 and watching it at my parents' old house with my brother. I have since re- watched it maybe 4 more times.Fright Night was director Tom Holland's directorial debut inspired by a thought he had about a kid who was a horror movie/TV fan becoming obsessed with the idea that his neighbor was a vampire. He fleshed it out a bit more and then went to work on casting and getting his team together. Part of what I love about the back story behind this movie is how many people weren't initially super intrigued (including Chris Sarandon, one of the leads), but once they saw just how enthusiastic Holland was and how solid the story was in his mind, they jumped on board and ended up loving the process and the finished product. He couldn't get Vincent Price to agree to star, though. The Peter Vincent character was supposed to be a mash-up of Vincent Price and Peter Cushing, but Price had stopped acting in horror movies at that point, unfortunately (though he apparently saw Fright Night and told Holland at one point that he loved it and thought Roddy McDowall did ""a wonderful job"").ANYWAYS, the basic plot follows a teenage Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) as he becomes convinced that his new neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), is a vampire. His girlfriend, Amy (Amanda Bearse), and friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) think he's nuts, so he contacts the host of a local series entitled Fright Night, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), former ""vampire hunter"" who has been demoted to nighttime TV host for help. But soon everyone starts to realize that Charley was right all along** SPOILERS! **This isn't so much a critique as just an all-around praise because THIS MOVIE CAN DO NO WRONG but here goes.Firstly, Jerry Dandridge is the coolest vampire ever. He's so smooth with his super smart sweaters and his perfectly coiffed hair, his calm demeanor and his dry sense of humor. Seeing him in Fright Night was a huge sexual awakening for me — I remember having a MASSIVE crush on Jerry Dandridge (still do), especially in the night club scene when he dances with Amy, or the final seduction scene with him LITERALLY shirtless on a furry rug in front of a fire. Just be still my heart. I've never wanted to be bitten by a vampire so badly.Jerry's seduction of Amy in the club in particular is just oof. So much chemistry. I think they made his desire for her slightly less of just a sexual drive or even a drive for vampiric feeding and more of an almost heartbroken, romantic yearning by showing the painting of his past love (girlfriend? wife?) who looked just like her. There's a few moments in the movie where we see how wistful he is, so while you don't condone him capturing Amy, you see that it's a deeper drive than simple passion.The soundtrack is just perfect, particularly the instrumental version of ""Come to Me"" by Brad Fiedel, ""Good Man in a Bad Time"" by Ian Hunter, and ""Give It Up"" by Evelyn ""Champagne"" King.The entire movie is just such a perfect combination of that classic 80's kids on an adventure that is over their heads vibe with some genuinely scary horror aspects mashed up with some pretty hilarious comedy and satire. It pays homage to horror and vampire movies without making a mockery of them. The whole movie just feels GOOD.I loved Peter Vincent as a character. He's so sad and washed up — he makes a comment about how he had been fired from his show because kids don't want to see vampire killers anymore: ""apparently all they want to see are demented madmen running around in ski-masks, hacking up young virgins"". He's desperate for attention — ""what could be more important than my autograph?"", he incredulously asks when Amy and Evil Ed show up at his apartment. He's desperate for money — he only agrees to help Charley when Amy finally offers him a $500 savings bond. He's desperate to make one last show of himself — he shows up to Dandridge's house fully equipped in his vampire hunting outfit with his kit full of crucifixes and holy water. But when he starts seeing evidence that Jerry may be a real live vampire, he panics. He runs. He tearfully refuses when Charley begs him to come back and help them. But right before Charley goes into Jerry's house to kill him, Peter shows up, ready to go — though he never gives up that air of nervousness, that hesitation. He's broken in many ways but he craves this humanity.Again, while it's meant to be a satire of sorts, it is also scary and quite gory at times. They show Billy (Jonathan Stark) melting into a puddle of green goo on the staircase in great detail. And the scene with Evil Ed transforming back from his wolfen state is intense, emphasized even more by Peter Vincent's amazing facial expressions.I just can't get enough, really. This movie is clever, it's well-acted, it's funny, it's scary, it's consistently interesting and engaging it is just THE BEST. If you've missed out on it for this long, do yourself a favor and GO WATCH IT TODAY. Seriously.",Fright Night

Of the three movies I wasted an evening watching, this was easily the most entertaining.We have Charlie, plucky teenage hero, of the film who just happens to live next door to what he believes is a vampire (Chris Sarandon--that detective from Child's Play). Sexy women (only two of which we actually get to see) are mysteriously vanishing around the area and our young hero is out to stop the evil vampire. He attempts to enlist Roddy McDowell, who plays a ""vampire hunter"" movie & television star to help. And Charlie's girlfriend is Amanda Bearse. Marcy Darcy from ""Married with Children.""Here's the breakdown:The Good:--Very simply, this movie is a lot of fun. From the characters to the action sequences to the cinematography--pretty much everything, this movie is just a good time.--For the most part, the acting was actually pretty good, and the characters were believable and generally enjoyable.--Good dialog and conversations.--Nice pacing.--Entertaining action sequences and gore. Some good (though not exactly great all the time) suspense, as well.--Strong atmosphere and really nice cinematography.--During the climax of the movie, Amanda Bearse is fvcking hot. Who knew she could look that good? Too bad she's a lesbian, am I right guys? Ha!Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The special effects, and vampire make-up, were at times pretty laughable. Generally, the effects were pretty good, but about average for the time. Sometimes, the attempt to make scary make-up ended up looking cheesy or rubbery.--Wacky ""totally radical 80's"" music. That part New Wave, part Rock, part Pop music that was often creamily spread over movies from the 80's also permeates this movie. But hell, I'll take cheesy 80's Rock over Rap or Hip-Hop in a horror movie any day!--Somewhat ""loose"" writing here and there. Generally, very enjoyable and entertaining, but occasionally you'll have moments of head scratching where you'll be wondering ""why not just do this or that?"" Watch it, you'll see what I mean.The Bad:--Charlie's best friend is one of the 80's most obnoxious teenage characters. On a plus side, he's actually played by a teenager and not some 29-year old nimrod desperate to hold on to his youth. Occasionally, the kid is also very amusing--which creates kind of a love/hate relationship between him and the viewer. And that laugh is just awful.--The term ""Fright Night"" is said about a million times.The Ugly:--Roddy McDowell's ""Joe Bob Briggs"" type TV show--""Frrrrrrright Niiiiiiiiiiiight."" Still funny, though.Memorable Scene:--Roddy versus the wolf.Acting: 8/10 Story: 8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Character Development: 8/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 6/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (prostitutes and quick breasts) Violence/Gore: 7/10 (average for the time) Dialogue: 9/10 Music: 8/10 (zany 80's Rock!) Direction: 8/10 Cheesiness: 3/10 Crappiness: 0/10 Overall: 8/10 I was originally going to give this a ""7,"" but realized just how much fun the movie actually was. So it gets an ""8."" Bear in mind, though, this won't be for everyone--what with the teenagers, sometimes silly special effects, and radical 80's tunes. But, it is a great guilty pleasure--and it's for people that enjoy horror films of this nature. A rare horror film that manages to actually be fun without forgetting that it is a horror film.www.ResidentHazard.com",Fright Night

142,Sunsphxsuns,A BLOODY GOOD FILM!,9,22 September 2021,"Comedy/Horror describes Fright Night (1985), mainly because there are numerous comedic moments intertwined with pure horror. Fright Night is neither Trick R' Treat nor Shaun of the Dead, but it is the original Fright Night film in a series of dubious remakes.One important running theme in this version of Fright Night is the obvious homage to many of the classic horror gems released in the '60s and '70s, but without the benefit of more sophisticated special effects like CGI, which, for better or worse, would later dominate the movie industry.So,, what we have here is an original comedy/horror gem, with great writing and an excellent cast which allows the film to appear creepy, funny, and very entertaining. And although this 1985 film spawned a few reboots (some better than others), I think none of them match the excellent vibe of this one.",Fright Night

145,tstudstrup,Weird movie.,3,30 November 2018,"Not that good.
Just like From Dusk Till Dawn, Fright Night can be divided into two movies. The first part of From Dusk Till Dawn, is a roadtrip with a crime element. The second part is vampire movie. In Fright Night the first part is comedy. The second part is a vampiremovie.The first part is, in my opinion bad comedy. Its not funny, just annoying. The three teenagers are not likeable. And the girl is ugly and unattractive. And the 27 year old actress at the time, looks nothing like a teenager. Charlie the lead character is mostly annoying, because he looks like a dork. And because he is more interested in his new neighbor,s than he is in having sex with his girlfriend. Which is dumb and unrealistic as teenage-boys are extremely horny. He is then same annoying type as the lead in Gremlins.The new neighbor who could be a vampire, protected by an undead dayguardiandoes strange things. Charlie sees the two men, carry out, what seems to be a corpse. And because he watches a crappy tv-show called Fright Night about vampires, with a washed up actor as the host, while it happens he concludes that his neighbors must be vampires.Of course nobody, believes Charlie. Including his girlfriend and his buddy nicknamed Evil Ed. Why he has that nickname remains a mystery. This bad and boring comedy is allowed to go on for more than an hour, before the second part happens and it becomes a vampiremovie. And that last part is pretty good. Mostly because the special effects are very good. And still holds up today. The second part made me think of both Evil Dead and From Dusk Till Dawn.But overall, apart from Roddy McDowall as the washed up actor/ tv host (he is really good) the acting is pretty bad. Chris Sarandon is in my opinion mis-cast as the main vampire. Sure he is goodlooking, but he is just a terrible actor. Ive only ever seen him in this movie and in Child's Play. Probably, because he is not a good actor. I would have preferred to see Bruce Campbell as the vampire. He has much more charisma and he is goodlooking without being a smug and he does comedy and physical acting much better than Sarandon.For some reason this movie had a pretty big budget for first time director: Tom Holland. 9 million dollars. 1 million went to special effects. A much better movie: The Terminator had a budget of only 6 million dollars. Imagine what James Cameron could have done with 9 million dollars as far as special effects goes. Actually its shown in Aliens.I give this movie 3 stars, because the last part is okay and the special effects are great.",Fright Night

I have to snicker when watching this movie now after reading on here that Stephen Geoffreys, the actor who plays 'Evil', went on to be a porn star!!

147,CaressofSteel75,Great Horror/Comedy from the 1980s,8,29 June 2014,"The mid 1980s was not a classic era for vampire stories, but Fright Night came along just in time with a perfect response to the Jason & Freddy Krueger movies that dominated the decade.It's the usual tale of the teenager who knows that vampires are in town, but everyone thinks he's crazy until the very end. They kidnap his girlfriend as well and try to turn her into the vampire queen. Can't forget that part. Roddy McDowell in particular is terrific as the used up TV vampire killer who goes into real battle with the undead for the first time. Chris Sarandon adds a real air of malevolence to the evil Jerry Dandridge.Even though this movie is really a horror/comedy, there is a significant level of violence and a small amount of nudity, male and female. Fright Night spawned a sequel and a remake, but anyone who's interested should stick to the original.",Fright Night
148,jbar19,Surprisingly fun. A few laughs and a few scares.,8,31 January 2004,"Although some of my friends disagree with me on his, I really think highly of 'Fright Night'. Now, it has it's flaws.... Firstly, it has Amanda Bearse, an openly gay actress, as the romantic interest of the lead character. We know Amanda best as Marcy Rhoades D'Arcy in Married with Children. She doesn't do a bad job here, it's just kinda weird. Also, there are a lot of very predictable plot points...But, William Ragsdale and especially, Roddy McDowell are Excellent!Chris Sarandon turns in a great performance also. He is even more creepy than seeing Amanda Bearse as a hetero love interest.This is not a classic vampire movie nor is it one of the more recent hardcore, blood-running-out-of-shower-heads type of movie. Rather, it is a funny, silly little confection that has some surprisingly scary and graphic moments.My favorite scene is the moment when Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) accidentally sees that Jerry Dandrige doesn't reflect in a mirror and thus really IS a vampire. William Ragsdale gives a very real and believable performance.Roddy McDowell has a lot of fun in his role and really steals this movie.
This one is a sleeper.",Fright Night
149,Insomniac_moviefan,A real Fright Night!,10,4 May 2002,"The best about ""Fright Night"" :-Great acting : Roddy Mc Dowall is one of the best actors to appear in a horror movie. His character is the wise Peter Vincent ""the vampire killer"". Mc Dowall's performance steals the movie. Then we have Academy Award nominee Chris Sarandon. Sarandon's character (Jerry Dandridge) is the spinal cord of the movie, because he's the vamprie that stalks Charlie Brewster (William Ragsddale), his friend Evil Ed, and his girlfriend (played by young Amanda Bearse). Another but less important character, Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) does a nice job as Dandridge's vampire bodyguard.  -Kick ass special effects! : The F/X in this are incredible, can be compared with actual F/X in any movie. The make-up is great too, Sarandon and Bearse look scary while being caracterized.
-An effective score. The music is pure 80's! Cool stuff!-A creepy atmosphere : Dandridge's house looks very creepy, specially the basement and the stairway.IN OVERALL, ""Fright Night"" is one of the best vampire movies EVER made. Watch it only if you wanna be scared, and get into vampire stuff.A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE.",Fright Night
150,RachelLone,An amusing teen vampire flick,6,11 November 1999,"Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale), a high school boy who was a huge fan of the vampire TV show ""Fright Night"", noticed that something was wrong with his new neighbors...and later he even saw one of the guys was trying to suck a woman's blood... Charlie felt that he must have stopped the vampire from killing more people, he contacted the police, and he told his mother and friends about it, but nobody believed him. So he went to Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who hosted ""Fright Night"", ""the great vampire killer""...This is a special vampire movie because the story happened in the modern time instead of centuries ago. It looked rather old-fashioned to me the first time I saw it on television, but the more times I watched the film, the more I loved it. Two memorable scenes: when the vampire ""Jerry Dandrige"" (Chris Sarandon) was dancing with Amy (Charlie's girlfriend, played by Amanda Bearse) and later when Jerry was about to vampirize Amy. Both of the scenes were highly seductive.One big difference between this movie and other vampire films-  crosses don't necessarily work on vampires, unless you have total faith- said Jerry and Evil Ed.",Fright Night
151,Muldwych,Hardly a fright in sight nor a laugh and a half,4,11 September 2007,"Wonderful! Clever! Funny! Original! Yes, these are just some of the words I can't apply to ""Fright Night"", a very lame attempt to fuse horror and comedy together, that has all the suspense and chills of 'The Flintstones Meet Rockula And Frankenstone', and humour silly enough to impress Elvira.It doesn't help that the film contains all the standard vampire clichés - wooden stakes, crosses, the seductive power of vampires, etc. You're almost led to believe these are being satirised, yet at other times they are taken seriously when it's time to dispatch the undead. I've never been entirely successful at taking vampires seriously, and throwing the clichés at me is more likely to elicit a groan than a gasp. To be fair on 'Fright Night', I would imagine that a lot of its fans saw it when they were kids, which no doubt left a strong imprint that paints it in shades of rose. Trying to watch it once you're beyond the age when McDonalds is considered gourmet food is only going to have less impact. I can certainly list off personal favorites that fall into this category. Ironically, I did watch 'Fright Night' as a kid, but somehow, whatever effect it had on me didn't stay along for the ride two decades later.I will give a thumbs up though to the special effects. Good creative practical wizardry beats cgi any day, and 'Fright Night' delivers the best 1985 had to offer. I also enjoyed seeing Amanda Bearse in something other than 'Married...With Children', giving a wonderfully 'earnest' performance. Indeed, all the acting was competent enough, although Stephen Geoffreys' 'Ed' made me realise Dustin Diamond's 'Screech' *isn't* as irritating as you can get. Chris Sarandon is no Christopher Lee, but he does know how to combine 'evil dead' and seductiveness effectively.Overall, while I certainly wouldn't call 'Fright Night' a dead loss, it fails to sufficiently amuse or frighten. However, the production values are excellent for the time.",Fright Night
152,acdc_mp3,An underrated horror flick.,10,25 April 2020,"I saw this movie when it came out in '85 and loved it. It has truly creepy and scary moments along with just the right amount of humor. Chris Sarandon is a perfect choice as a personable, yet evil, vampire. The great Roddy McDowell added so much to this movie as well. All the characters were so well written and cast that it made this movie succeed when it could just as easily have failed.I just watched the movie again, probably for the 10th time and 35 years later it totally holds up, never gets old. If you are 30 or younger, watch it. You may not get the CGI overkill you are used to, but you will also see practical effects can add a huge amount of feel to the movie.",Fright Night

It's a somewhat original story and with special effects that are of course dated.Basically, the premise is that a horror movie lover teenager, Charley has a vampire (Sarandon move in next door but nobody believes him. As bodies start turning up all over town, he knows what is going on and starts to spy on the vampire. The vampire sees him and begins to terrorize Charley.Charley seeks help from his friend ""Evil"" and eventually from a B-movie TV actor named Peter Vincent played by Roddy McDowall. Vincent has a series on TV where he hunts vampires and so Charley thinks that this washed up actor will believe him.Finally, after a staged test, Vincent does believe Charley but is too afraid to help. The Vampire then begins his attacks on Charley and his friends.The end is a long fight between Charley and Vincent against the Vampire. They ultimately succeed and save Charley's girlfriend and the town from this menace.It's an entertaining movie, not one you'd rush out to buy on DVD though. I suppose they enlisted Roddy McDowall as a way to give this film more respect much how Halloween had Donald Pleasence. Not that Fright Night and Halloween are in the same league.If you like vampire movies or campy 80's movies, then you'll enjoy this.",Fright Night
154,richard-wheeler,The 80 effects are more effective than today's.,8,24 September 2005,"A comedy horror about two teenagers: Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) and Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse) who were in love. One night, saw caught sight of a coffin being taken into the basement of the house next door. Anything to do with death freaks me out!!!! My friend Jacque told me that was the most beautiful coffin he ever saw!A couple of days later when things started to look mysterious, late at night; Charlie heard a scream that came from next door and when he looked out from his window, the light in the room went off. The prostitute that entered that house has now died. THAT WAS THE SECOND MURDER IN THE LAST TWO DAYS!!!!! The next evening, Charlie watched the guy from next door who was Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon) kiss his girlfriend and then, JERRY BIT HER AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF CHARLIE. Ooh! Spooky. Now Charlie knows that Dandrige is a vampire and nobody believes that he is.On the following evening, Charlie got some advice from his class mate Evil Ed/ Ed Thomson (Stephen Geoffreys)in connection with keeping vampires away because, Charlie knew that Dandrige was going to visit him.Later that night, Dandrige appeared in Charlie's mom's room, Judy Brewster's room (Dorothy Fielding)and then he entered Charlie's room and there Dandrige tried to kill him due to telling everyone that he is a vampire. It was a cool scene, Dandrige picks Charlie up by the neck and throws him into his cupboard. It was so funny when Charlie's mom called while they were having fight! Ha!Ha!And when morning came, Charlie got a call from Dandrige saying that he will see him the next evening.When Charlie tried to convince Amy and Evil that Dandige was a vampire,they believed him.There is one thing that will amaze you in this motion picture, and that is the inside of the house YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!! And plus, this is where the freakiest parts begin like, when Dandrige saw the cross, he walked backwards and the vampire hunter who was hired from the ""Fright Night"" t.v. series Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall)looked into a mirror and noticed that Dandrige did not have a reflection! Dandrige was found everywhere! And when Evil went into an alley, he attacked him, and he also put a spell on Amy in a nightclub called "" Club Break"". And when Dandrige bites, that is something else. It's very painful especially when he bit Amy! On the same evening, when Vincent was checking out Carlie's house, A HUSKEY APPEARED and it tried to attack him and when Vince killed it GUESS WHAT???!!! It was Evil. Back at Dandige's house, it was freaky to see his house mate Billy Cole (Jonathan Stark) melt!The hissing of the vampires were good and when Amy turned into that hideous monster THAT WAS WHEN THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!! And also when the light broke through the windows of the basement and Dandrige turned into a half human half bat-like creature.The movie ends with Amy and Charlie back together in his room and with Peter Vincent no longer staring in the Fright Night t.v. series and, with Evil watching them kiss from Dandrige's window with a pair of binoculars.

155,Krackoon,A Tom Holland Classic.,8,14 July 2015,"I've never been a fan of Vampire films, but 'Fright Night' is one of a kind.'Fright Night' isn't my favorite Vampire film of all time, that title belongs to 'Let The Right One In,' but it's not too far off. It's adds just enough comedy to go along with the creepiness - which mainly comes from the star of the show - Chris Sarandon. I'm sure Chris didn't make it to be as big as he had hoped, but he'll always be remembered for being one of the creepiest, hippest blood suckers ever put on film. As for the rest of the cast - all passable, somewhat forgettable, other than Roddy McDowell, who did his best to hang with the main star... and did a rather fine job. The plot? Who really gives a damn? It's a Vampire flick. If you're watching a horror film for it's plot, you're not doing it right. Although, 'Fright Night's' plot is certainly better than most horror films.Random Ramblings of a Madman: It's Chris Sarandon's show - everyone else is just along for the ride. If you like your horror mixed with a little comedy, you won't get much better than 'Fright Night.' It still holds up very well. Tom Holland and Chris Sarandon should be very proud for creating and starring in, what will always be a classic.",Fright Night
156,Blazehgehg,A little more than your typical creature feature,8,1 November 2020,"My circle was always more of a ""Lost Boys"" group, so I didn't see Fright Night for the first time until just this year, and this movie is great.Now, you could be cynical and say that there's nothing this movie does that's new. It's the typical tale -- a kid gets menaced by a vampire and nobody believes him until it's too late. We've seen it before. Even in 1985, it probably wasn't a new idea.But what sets it apart is Fright Night's reverence for classic horror; this is from the peak ""horror host"" era dominated by characters like Elvira, Svengoolie and Grampa Munster's Super Scary Saturday. It pays much lip service to these types of shows, with their own fake horror host ""Peter Vincent"", a self-proclaimed vampire hunter who is mainly just an old, washed up actor.There are subtle hints that Fright Night understands more about vampire mythos than it lets on. Classically, vampires represented a fear of the wealthy (I mean, what's scarier to a poor person than a rich dude moving in and sucking the neighborhood dry?)Fright Night's interpretation sidesteps the wealth angle and presents a vampire that lures an ostracized youth with the promise of power and a sense of belonging. Only a few minutes later, that same vampire assaults two African American bouncers at a night club. Outside of the core cast, these two men are the only on-screen victims of the vampire we get to see. It's not quite as overt as I make it sound, and it's not necessarily the point of the movie, but it's the sort of thing that when you really stop and think about it, it means something.By the end of Fright Night, all of the tributes fade away and the movie straight up becomes classic Hammer Horror. Suitcases full of wooden stakes and mallets to pound them in, grey haired men with long faces in corduroy, and plenty of hissing theatrics.The existence of Fright Night (2011) and its differences makes me realize there's a whole generation of people that will probably have a hard time connecting to this movie. But I had a good time.",Fright Night
157,mrspasm,I'm A Lover Not A Frighter,10,30 November 2009,"Fright Night contains Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Corey McCrory, and Vincent Price. In this performance they all act as people in a situation involving scary bits and laughings. Most of the time I tend to often call these things 'hilarious screamers' because they mix the two most famous emoticons- fear and funny. Now let me say this (I'll say it anyway, if you'll let me): If you were being chased by a maniac with a knife- would it be funny? What if he caught you, and dove into your flesh with his blade- would you start laughing like it was Christmas? Even if you were running and he slipped on an apple skin, you would stop and start slapping your thigh at this slapstick marvel- nein, you would get out of there like a monkey from a box. Hilarious screamers really began in the 80s, with films such as Friday the 13th part 3 and The Exorcist. Featuring lots of gags and gores these provided popularity and box offices ticked to the sound of ticking tills. Fight Night (the first part of a trilogy and a loose remake of Night Of The Lovely Dead) was calamitous success, the biggest of the three, bigger than it's sequel (Fight Me) though not as big as the final part (Fight Club). I don't like these films- I always have and I never will. I like my horrors to be horrific and my comedies to be comific. However, as a person it is my duty to watch all screens, even ones I don't like want to want to.A young boy moves into a house in a city with his older brother, mum and dog- Wolfie. He is bullied at the new school by all the bigger boys for having stupid hair. He goes to his brother but he has started disappearing at night with local biker gang members- sleeping all day and partying all night. He tries to get his mum to help, but she is too busy having adult relations with a funny looking man. His grandpa is senile so he resorts to sitting at a park at night time. He meets a young girl, roughly the same age as himself who is very pale and doesn't talk much. He likes her but she always disappears off into the night. Soon they form a friendship, meeting every night in the snow, but she never tells him how old she is or anything else about herself. They notice a new neighbour moving in- an old evil looking man and imagine that he is a monster, an assassin, a lonely old prostitute etc. They are in bed one night when it collapses and he breaks his leg, confining him to his bedroom. He becomes obsessed with this new neighbour, watching his every move from his wheelchair. He believes he is a vampire. The girl thinks he is losing his mind, but can't help too much because she in fact IS a vampire. Soon all the secrets come out and it turns out everyone is a vampire apart from the mum who is a mummy. It becomes quite messy with all these twisting story lines, the best bit being when the girl climbs up the wall of the hospital and sets fire to the woman who likes cats. That was quite funny, but I don't think it was meant to be. A big fight ensues with the boy and his other friends the Fog Brothers and soon they rid the town of vampires. The boy hides the girl in his suitcase though as she is a good vampire, and the four of them leave on a train, the Fog Brothers not knowing there is a blood sucking fiend of the night nestled in amongst their underwear.Best Scene: When the 4 go to where the creepy old neighbour works- in a TV studio where he presents a monster programmathon.

159,A_Roode,"""You're so COOL, Brewster!""",7,18 March 2006,"'Fright Night' is a movie that has stuck with me for years. Recently I was able to get it on DVD and have been watching it and trying to convince my friends to watch it ever since. It has it's flaws but time has been kinder, I think, to 'Fright Night' than it has been to either 'Near Dark' or 'The Lost Boys.'Chris Sarandon is great and charismatic in his role as the new next-door neighbor. He gives a deep performance and it seems like he's having a lot of fun in every scene. William Ragsdale isn't bad either as he tries with greater desperation and anxiety to convince people that the vampire exists and win allies to help him destroy it. My favourite performance comes from Roddy McDowall. Like Donald Pleasance later in his career, Roddy McDowell could reasonably be accused of acting in anything if there was a paycheck involved; this has damaged his reputation somewhat. I think 'Fright Night' and his performance as Peter Vincent definitely falls in the plus category rather than negative. He is great at hiding behind masks and is constantly performing for the other characters. As an actor, the part required versatility, compassion and depth. Had they been able, Peter Cushing or Vincent Price would have also played the part splendidly -- McDowell's character is of course a tribute to both these actors and I think that he was simply fantastic.So many of the moments in 'Fright Night' compete to be my favourite but I think it comes in the final third of the film. Peter Vincent has run out of masks to hide behind and becomes a very tired, very frightened and very old man. Redemption isn't out of reach -- but he's going to have to work for it.I mentioned earlier that 'Fright Night' has aged fairly well. There is decent gore and make-up so anyone looking for that will likely be satisfied. Music can kill films and age them more quickly than anything else. It works here where it might fail in other films.The strength of 'Fright Night' though are it's performances and the sense of fun that it has. Definitive vampire film? No, but a lot better than many, many, many of the pretenders to that title. Rewarding, fun, and worth a look.",Fright Night

164,logicproreviews,1980's American suburbia meets classic vampire flick.,8,24 March 2020,"When Fright Night hit theaters on August 2, 1985, it was surrounded by the current craze; the slasher subgenre. The Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise machines were dropping sequels - this, along with imitations, some meek - others worthy - proved that audiences craved this recurring formula.Vampire hunter Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall) even adds weight to this argument; announcing that, ""nobody wants to see vampire killers anymore, or vampires either. Apparently, all they want to see are demented madmen running around in ski-masks, hacking up young virgins"".With the slasher film set aside, Fright Night resurrected classic plot devices from the golden age of horror - infusing it with a quiet American neighborhood.The film is very much a product of it's time and it has aged like a fine bottle of Bordeaux. Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) is the teenager who's convinced that his new next door neighbor Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon), is a vampire.
Jerry proves to be a worthy villain, he's both suave and evil and when he turns full vampire, it's scarily effective.The added touch of Jerry having a fruit bowl in his house is a clever one, it was Sarandon's idea that Jerry is blood related to fruit bats which is why we occasionally see him chomping apples and peaches.While Charley tries to convince his friends and his Mother as to Jerry's true nature, he is soon in hunter mode - turning his bedroom into some sort of protective shrine. His friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) is the comic relief, his love interest Amy Peterson (Amanda Bearse), is more concerned about Charley's mental health.Help does come from in the from of vampire hunter Peter Vincent who hosts the TV show within the film; ""Fright Night"". Peter Vincent is aptly named, paying homage to classic horror icons, Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. The joke is that Vincent is merely a faux vampire hunter, something which causes him genuine discomfort when he is called upon to hunt an actual vampire.Vincent's apartment is a collector's dream - there's movie memorabilia and vampire hunter weaponry on the walls. A painting of Bela Lugosi's Dracula hangs near the door, a mask of Nosferatu is displayed in a glass box, a few knives here and there, one or two crucifixes.This scene in particular, really does like you are in the middle of a Hammer Horror. In keeping with tradition, we see some classic vampire rules being adhered to. Garlic, crucifixes, holy water, no reflection in the mirror and stake through the heart are all mentioned and demonstrated to differing effects.The juicy, techno driven score provided by Brad Fiedel helps to remind us that we are back in 1985. While the punchy soundtrack belts out soft hair metal and synth.With respectful nods to classic horror tropes, a healthy mix of horror and humor, Fright Night is a pure gem of eighties horror.8/10",Fright Night

But, then again, it has to be judged against its own idea. For this, I have to say that this movie still plays great 35 years later. McDowell and Sarandon are perfectly cast. McDowell has the wimpy panache, Sarandon smoldering evil.
Stephen Geoffreys (Evil Ed) is perfect with his crazy face and laugh. The effects with the crazy teeth still resonate. I've seen this movie countless times over 35 years and it still plays great. It gets a 9 because it is at the top of its game for its own idea. A Yorkie is not a Great Dane, but each gets judged against its own idea of perfection.",Fright Night
166,michellelocke007,a riot and a half,8,14 September 2010,"loved this movie and have caught it several times on television late at night. i never tired of watching this wildly imaginative and entertaining film from the eighties starring herman's head star William rags dale and Chris saran don. the basic plot tells the story of teenager Charley Brewster who thinks his neighbour across the street is a living and breathing vampire, jerry dandrige, played by saran don. Charley has a difficult task in proving to everyone that jerry is a vampire and soon enlists the help of an ageing horror television host played by Roddy McDowell. the two than embark on an adventure to vanquish jerry and save Charley's girlfriend Amy who soon falls under the vampire's seductive spell. what i enjoyed most about this film is that they don't rely primarily on heavy gore effects but a solid story line that goes at a steady pace and keeps the viewer's interest. and considering that back than, they didn't have the multi-million dollars special effects studio like they do is awesome. just relying on prosthetics and make-up is way cooler. i don't know how the planned re-make is going to fare in theatres. we will just have to wait and see.",Fright Night

Well, it made me laugh and didn't scare me (I guess I just can't be frightened by a movie), but for different reasons. It's not pointless and stupid like many other horrors of that time and is funny not for its stupidity, but for really witty jokes and moments due to good script. All these dialogues are pretty good, as well as the elaborate story. Actors make decent performances, especially Roddy McDowall, Stephen Geoffreys and Chris Sarandon. Their characters are quite interesting comparing to others from the other vampire films. So are the special effects - they look awesome for 1985 horror.Thus, if you want to watch quite an original and witty vampire movie, be free to spend an evening with Fright Night.",Fright Night

So i put it on for my partner she had never seen this film before.I could see as we started watching it, she was not interested she was on and off her phone like a fly around S***, She started watching around the scene where charlie is looking over to Dandridge house at the hooker, she started enjoying it more then.As we watched more i felt like a kid, the music the tension between Dandridge and Amy and most importantly evil ed, only problem watching this film now was his death scene, my god just die already, the effects are good for the time but come on just die.The film finished and i asked if she enjoyed it, she replied ""it was okay"", gutted i was never mind you cant please everyone, i hope you enjoy the film, a pinnacle of my childhood.",Fright Night
170,Cube_TX,A real horror movie,7,19 July 2004,"I just finished watching this movie again for the first time in years. I remember loving it as a junior high student who didn't know much about film and being able to watch it much more deeply today than I did back then did not kill the movie at all. This was before CGI took over so the effects were outdated, but somehow this made the movie even better. Evil Ed's wolf was much more realistic than the terrible modern CGI wolves of the blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow released just this year. The scene where he is stabbed and reverts back to human form was fantastic. Yes, the bat was cheesy but the transformation was well done. I also liked the makeup used on Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys for their characters as vampires.The real strength of this movie, however, is the ability of the actors themselves. William Ragsdale carries the movie well. He's what most people picture when they think of a young b-movie fan. Stephen Geoffreys is hilarious and the perfect choice for the annoying sidekick. Amanda Bearse was great as the shy, virginal girlfriend. Chris Sarandon was the best 80s update of a vampire I'd seen. He was manly, making it obvious why women would fall for him, and very ominous. His character of Jerry was funny, but still dark and mysterious enough to be intimidating. I especially liked his use of the trenchcoat as a modern vampire cape. Finally, the late Roddy McDowell fit the movie perfectly as well. Not many will remember this film as part of his legacy, which is sad. He was the transformation character who goes from non-believer to scared believer to strong ally.The movie did have a plothole or two, but don't let this detract from the timelessness of this film. This film was TRUE horror. It was in no way like the MTV-generation junk that is spewed out today and called ""horror"" like the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Urban Legend, and the like. I especially liked how the film briefly poked fun at the typical ""horror"" films of the 80s that featured ""men in hockey masks hacking young virgins.""This film is for fans of true horror and worth another look. The amount of humor was perfect and never detracted from the horror. The gore was present, but never overdone or glorified. This was easily the best horror of the 80s and among the best all-time vampire films ever.",Fright Night
171,akoaytao1234,Quintessential 80's vampire,10,25 October 2017,"When Charley Brewster, a young dweeb of an idiot who for unknown reason cannot kiss and make-out with his girlfriend, accidentally saw his suave 'bisexual' neighbor slash vampire, Jerry, devour one of his hapless victim, Charley tries to caught him in the act once again against the discouragement of his disbelieving family and friends. This ultimately fails and in turn he and every person his closed with is pursued to be the vampire's next victim. I would not lie this film has a lot of problems to begin with. Its universe is oddly inconsistent in its lore and story-wise, it does not really offer anything new. But it oddly worked for me. Its lack of ambition and overall conviction of its characters gave it a enjoyable self-serious melodramatic camp that had been lost in a lot of film nowadays. It is also inventively successful in integrating vampire tropes and styles to fit in a kitschy eighties. A true surprise, Fright Night tells you that it does not need perfect to be likable. Its just need to be true to itself to be great [4.5/5]",Fright Night

174,sjwest,One of the best vampire movies of the 80's.,7,18 May 2003,"For me the top vampire movie of the 80's was 'The Lost Boys', but this one is up there with the best of them. The 80's saw a deluge of vampire movies, so for these to stand out amongst them was no mean feat.According to Tom Holland, the writer/director of this movie, he wanted to do a movie with 'the boy who cried wolf' as a theme. He also had an interest in vampire stories and so he combined these two elements to create a very enjoyable and original script. Although not entirely true to 'the boy who cried wolf' since Charley did not make up the story before it happened for real, the concept of the movie, that is, a teenager with an interest in B grade horror movies see's a vampire claim a victim and cannot convince his friends of this, holds it's audience throughout the movie.Jerry Dandridge is a prime example of the type of vampire audiences saw in the 80's. He is suave, good - looking and has an eye for beautiful women - thus captilising on the sexual allure of being at the mercy of a being more powerful than yourself who needed your lifeblood to sustain his existence. His bloodlust was satiated by attacking the victim's neck, biting into it and sucking their blood. This also has strong sexual overtones since the neck can be an intimate area and giving or having someone take your blood is the ultimate submissive act since blood is the life. The vampire of the 80's has is own distinct personality and is able to interact as an ordinary citizen in everyday life. This is most unlike the vampire in Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' and FW Murnau's 'Nosferatu' who were more like the vampires of folklore, that is, they had repulsive features and were not much unlike scavenging rodents since they were perceived in past centuries as pests who were plague carriers. Some folklore is still evident in the 80's vampire - a vampire cannot enter your house unless invited, it cannot be seen in mirror's and is fearful of Christian symbols thus showing it for the malignant evil that it is. I believe that Holland has created a sound balance here by not introducing too much human personality traits into Dandridge that is so evident in today's vampires. This may be because he was influenced by the B grade movies since these movies are a strong part of the story. Further evidence of this is the character of Peter Vincent. Chris Sarandon is perfect for the role of Jerry. He has a commanding presence which makes him a powerful adversary for the heroes.Peter Vincent has proved to be the most endearing character and it would be hard to imagine anyone other than Roddy Mcdowall playing the role - Cushing of the 80's. His passing will mean that another sequel will quite rightly have a gaping hole in it which only he could fill. Part of why this is so is because he makes it so believable that he is an actor passionate about his B grade vampire hunter roles. He is the vampire hunter determined to rid the world of these vermin and holds high credibility within that world. This is in stark contrast to the real Peter Vincent who is financially struggling and finds that he is petrified when faced by the real vampire. Although he manages to gather enough courage to face Dandridge, he has to be saved by Charley. He fails to truly overcome his fear, but the audience is drawn to the failed hero who gave it his best shot. He is the underdog that we cheer for.The special effects of this movie also deserve special mention. They add to the B grade feel of the movie since the shape shifting of the vampire is overly grotesque and exaggerated. This is no criticism since this is what Holland wanted to create and thus it blends in rather than overawes.Also of note is the variety of different characters within the movie. You have Evil Ed who is interested in the occult and being a social misfit thus making him easy to seduce for Dandridge. There is Amy who is sexually prudent which makes her a viable victim for the predatory vampire. Charley is the average American teenager who has to grow up quickly if he is to overcome his ancient foe. Finally there is Billy Cole, the ghoul or zombie wholly dedicated to serving his master.The soundtrack is most notable within this movie since it adds to the fun we have at watching the not too serious B grade movie influenced 'Fright Night'. Each track is suited to the scene and accentuates the emotion that Holland is trying to brew. This is particularly well done in the nightclub scene.'Fright Night' is a great popcorn movie and never takes itself seriously. Part of the appeal of this movie is the fact that it has  a strong 80's feel to it - catchy soundtrack, hip teenagers, exaggerated special effects much like the exaggerated dress of the 80's such as shoulder pads, wild hairstyles and cheesy one - liners. Having said this, although it is obvious that the cast had fun playing their characters, they acting is of a high enough quality to ensure that this movie did not fall into the B grade abyss.",Fright Night
175,grkamerican1984,my favorite vampire movie...,9,31 October 2007,"...next to ""Dracula"" (1931). I only know four films Chris sarandon has done, (this, nightmare before Christmas, child's play, and princess bride) and this is my favorite of those films. Roddy McDowall did a really good job in this movie, as well as Sarandon, Ragsdale and Bearse. ""Evil"" Ed was kind of weird, but funny. Had they brought him back in the sequel, ""FRIGHT NIGHT PART 2"" would've been great. i'm not saying the sequel was bad, but it was inferior to the original. it didn't really take me as a surprise when i found out that Stephen geoffreys was gay (his character seemed kind of queer), but Amanda bearse?! i have two favorite parts in this movie. the scene where jerry seducts Amy, and the part where peter Vincent tries to fend of ""Evil"" Ed with the crucifix. if you like vampire movies that have a dark blend of humor, i recommend this movie. and ""The Lost Boys"" (1987) lol.10/10",Fright Night
176,ikizdevran-882-254684,There are good reasons to be afraid of the dark.,8,1 July 2018,"Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), a B-class actor performing in the cheap TV show Fright Night, mentions that ""the kids today, don't have the patience for vampires. They want to see some mad slasher running around and chopping off heads."" This explains the fate of the vampire films in the 80s. Even though ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" saved them a little bit in 1996, they have outlived themselves. Throughout the history you can see a lot of vampire films. If I am not mistaken the first vampire film ""Nosferatu"" was made in 1922, and after that, vampires conquered cinema and became a trend in horror genre, but gradually lost their territory and replaced by some sick people with masks running around killing people. Directed by Tom Holland, ""Fright Night"" is a cult film in this genre. It has a runtime of 106 minutes, and promises you an action-packed horror film. ""Fright Night"" is also the directorial debut of Tom Holland who is mostly known for his directing career in Tv series. ""Fright Night"" is about a teenager who thinks his neighbor is a vampire and starts to follow him around until he gets himself into trouble.I have seen ""Fright Night"" and it's Sequel ""Fright Night 2"" several times because as I mentioned above, it is a cult film in its genre and always a pleasure to fill a rainy night with. Perception of a horror, of course, depends on a good story, location, soundtracks, effects and makeup. However, I have always believed, it also depends on the external factors like what time you are watching it or how is the weather outside. Even though you are watching the best horror film at a beach in the mid-summer day, most probably you are not going to get what the film is trying to give you. If you like to get the full picture of a horror film, you should watch it in late hours and possibly with a storm outside. External conditions are as important as the horror film itself. The last time I have seen ""Fright Night"" it was after midnight, and there was storm outside and I have enjoyed it like the first time. This is a film I would never get bored of. Because from the acting to the soundtracks, from makeups to costumes, ""Fright Night"" carries all the symptoms of 80s. Its sincerity is the film's best feature. You can find the sincerity principle in a lot of films that were made in 80s, and those films have heavily affected cinema today. This kind of films really want to give you something. They want you to share their story. Watching this kind of cult films are going to give you strong ideas about how cinema is shaped based on 80s. The same thing applies for 80s films as well, they have been shaped by earlier ages of cinema. This is an unavoidable circle and influence.Vampires are undead, they sleep during the day and hunt during the night, and if they suck your blood you also turn out to be a vampire. They don't like garlic, holy water or crosses if you hold them with faith and they don't cast a shadow in the mirror. Other than these, they are elegant creatures. They know how to dress and walk, they know how to smile and talk, they are charming and highly educated. These features make them perfect hunters because human beings are generally attracted to these virtues. Most of these distinctive marks are references from Bram Stoker's Dracula, and some of them have been developed by cinema and literature. Thanks to that brilliant novel, Vampires are born. It is important to have a general knowledge about vampires before having a look at the main vampire in the film, Jerry Dandrige (Chris Sarandon). I am sure his assistant is not human, but he is not vampire either. Chris Sarandon has all those features I have mentioned above. His charm as an actor makes him very suitable for the job. The way he looks, talks and dresses are all matching with the original description of vampires. I have enjoyed his acting, and I am very happy to see that director respects all the classic features of the vampires and doesn't do a thing to change them. The supporting roles have a way of completing the main character. Even though William Ragsdale, as Charley, has more scenes, Sarandon leads the film.Director tries hard to make a good horror film. He partially manages to achieve this by showing the transformation of the vampires or their death, with acceptable makeup, but I believe that could have been done better. ""Fright Night"" is also rich with soundtracks made by Brad Fiedel. It is a classic vampire film and one of the best of its own genre. To track the progress of vampire films, Fright Night is a must watch.",Fright Night

I think she was trying to make it up to me a year later when she got ET, and Fright Night and the Howling. Fright Night is a great movie regardless. The acting was superb and the soundtrack (even the dreary synths) were all great in telling the tale of modern vampiric horror. Chris Sarandon was an excellent creep/gentleman in this movie. I even like Amanda Bearse's spunky attitude when Charlie ignores her (all the girl wants is a little love) and it goes to show that you have to treat your women right because you'll never know when you'll have a vampire for a neighbor. This movie stands by itself for it's genre because even though it was made in the heart of the 80's (which most of us miss and is a corny era compared to today's mindset) because all the parts were executed well to piece together this movie.I've read somewhere the question of why does Dandridge eats the apple, and even was asked this myself a couple of times.No one knows for sure but I'd like to think that it's just a little tasty habit he picked up to compliment his smugness.",Fright Night

Unfortunately no one believes Charley's story about the undead murderer next door, not even his girlfriend Amy Peteron (Amanda Bearse) or his best friend ""Evil"" Ed Thompson (Stephen Geoffreys). After being laughed at by the police, the troubled teen tries to enlist the help of former actor and TV show host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who doesn't believe him at first until he sees that Jerry Dandrige has no reflection in a mirror. After Jerry turns Evil Ed into a vampire and kidnaps Amy, Charley and Peter Vincent grab some wooden stakes and team up to stop the evil bloodsucker once and for all! Not only is this my favorite vampire movie but is also in my top five favorite horror films of all time! This highly entertaining 80's frightfest offers pretty much everything you could want from a scary movie featuring vampires. All the actors here are excellent in their roles. Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed steals every scene he's in with his over the top performance (especially after he becomes one of the undead) and Chris Sarandon as Jerry Dandrige is a very suave and charming villain who can be extremely frightening at the same time. In addition to the perfect casting, this film has just the right blend of suspense, scares, and humor to make for a very amusing and captivating watch. The only minor complaint I have about this movie involves a scene where Charley asks Evil Ed for advice on how to defeat a vampire, which makes no sense seeing as it was established earlier in the film that Charley is already an expert on the undead himself! That doesn't take any points off of this awesome movie however, which gets the perfect score of 10 out of 10!",Fright Night

181,thirdi,An absolutely awesome 80's horror movie,10,24 June 2004,"""Fright Night"" has definitely earned a cult-like status over the years but I still think it's widely unseen and unsung. Man, this movie is just so under-rated. I saw it in a theater when I was 12 and at that time it scared me pretty good. But what a rush. A couple of years later it was one of those movies that you could see on HBO ten times a month, and it was at that point that I watched it several times and it became one of my all time favorite movies. Maybe it was just one of those things, where you have that certain window of time at a particular age, or a particular mood, and something registers. Whatever it was, ""Fright Night"" just hit me as one incredibly awesome horror flick. Like Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"" did in book form, ""Fright Night"" was a classic American vampire story. All of the trademark folklore was there: the creepy house, mysterious neighbors, missing local girls, crosses, garlic, holy water, wooden stakes, and a general chill in the air. Chris Sarandon was terrific as Jerry Dandrige, the modern day Dracula who moves into the house next door to high-schooler Charley Brewster (excellently played by William Ragsdale). Roddy McDowell, in one of his ultimate performances, was also perfectly-cast as Peter Vincent, the reluctant vampire killer.The thing that made ""Fright Night"" different from a lot of the typical 80's horror movies was that perfect balance between horror, comedy and drama. Scary scenes all over, comedy from Ragsdale's fumbling, awkward high-school student and his best friend Ed. Drama in the night club scene, and when Charley begs a frightened Peter Vincent for help. Much like ""American Werewolf in London"", the other great 80's horror-comedy, this one has it all. Make no mistake, if you're the type of person that gets scared or can let yourself get scared at vampire movies, you will be. But there are sweet, tongue-in-cheek moments laced throughout the film that let you know it never takes itself too seriously. The music is killer and the make-up effects are way better, and more terrifying, than you expect. From top to bottom this is really a very well-made film. There are just too many great things to say about ""Fright Night"" and almost nothing bad. If you have never seen it, you are missing out on a classic. I practically had to force the DVD on my brother, but of course he loved it when he watched it.

183,BornKnight,A classic that never gets old,8,24 March 2012,"Fright Night is a classic horror (comedy?) movie of the 80's (1985), in which a teenager, addicted to horror series (particularly a TV show called Fright Night, which has a vampire hunter named Peter Vincent) who discovers that his neighbor is actually a vampire, and after the neighbor notes that he knows the secret, he tries to prove to everyone this, together with his friend and girlfriend. The film has the visual you expect from a movie of that decade, of course, with clothes and strange haircuts. The performances in the film are somewhat exaggerated, and in some cases, it makes it kind of funny, particularly the performances of William Ragsdale (Charley Brewster) and his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) that are bad enough to be funny. We have Chris Sarandon in the role of Dandridge (the vampire), that is very well interpreted, better than the modern version of this classic remake. The film ends up arresting our attention, and has a story that appeals and is neither long nor too short, just right: the movie goes from a comedy one to a horror, in the end. More than recommended, for the entertainment: My Score 8.3 / 10.0.",Fright Night
184,gbrumburgh-1,"A vampire flick with real bite, fang you very much!",7,22 September 2001,"Silent ghoul Max Schreck and, of course, the incomparable Bela Lugosi were the earliest creatures of the night to nail down the vampire image successfully on film.  Then the infinite (and mostly inferior) sequels rolled in, together with Hammer Studios' gruesome, yet anemic British series courtesy of Christopher Lee.  In fact, over the years everybody's pretty much gotten into the act, including Drac's 'extended' family (`Dracula's Widow,' `Dracula's Daughter,' even `Dracula's Dog'!).  In the 70s, Hollywood offered some fresh new blood:  Frank Langella gave the Count smouldering sex appeal, Jack Palance added new dimension and insight, and George Hamilton went for laughs.Ready to sink your teeth into something different?  Welcome to `Fright Night,' a 1985 version, and the very charismatic Chris Sarandon, who casts an altogether new reflection (sorry) on this centuries-old fly-by-night. Sarandon (yes, actress Susan's ex-) manages to combine the best of Langella and Hamilton, making his vampire not only entertaining, but charming, sexy and downright lethal.  It's a tasty Drac he's packaged and it's his interp that highlights (as it should) this alternately scary and amusing spoof. Adeptly written and directed by Tom Holland (`Child's Play'), Holland tones down on the gore and instead hooks us in with a twisty, tongue-in-cheek plot, an assured style and point of view, and plenty of character interest.
Set in a typical folksy town, fresh-faced William Ragsdale plays a teenage horror film enthusiast who begins to suspect the new male couple on the other side of the fence are not your standard neighborly types.  Firmly convinced that beautiful young victims are entering the house at night but leaving in trash bags by dawn and that other insidious, paranormal happenings are occurring in and about the house, it's another thing to try to persuade those closest to him that a cross and necklace of garlic would not be a bad thing to carry around in a fanny pack.  His girlfriend (Amanda Bearse), buddy (Stephen Geoffreys), mom (Dorothy Fielding) and even the police (led by Art Evans) believe his sightings are the product of an overactive imagination.  In the meantime, the body count starts to rise.In a last ditch effort to find a true believer, Ragsdale prevails upon the expertise of his idol, Peter Vincent, the Fearless Vampire Killer, played with broad temerity by the late Roddy McDowell.  A one-time popular `B' film actor, Vincent has been reduced to parodying himself in full regalia (not unlike Elvira) as a TV horror host.  And here's where the REAL fun begins...Ragsdale as Charley (the Jonathan Harker role) possesses the right mixture of earnestness and angst for this amateur vampire slayer.  Proving once and for all that 'curiosity killed the bat' (sorry, again), we're with our young hero all the way.  And will everybody please stop bashing Amanda Bearse as Ragdale's gal pal?   Her Amy is nice and natural compared to the innocuous Tiffany-Amber Thiessen all-boobs-and-no-brains types were used to being force-fed.  She has a feisty, tomboyish appeal at the beginning which provides a fine contrast in later scenes when our Mina succumbs to Drac and starts to primp up provocatively.  Nobody ever complained about her fine work here and in `All My Children' until AFTER she came out of the closet. Give her a break, people.Geoffrey's Evil Ed, the school's prime weirdo, is appropriately outrageous and irksome as the pal who goads Charley on and derides him rather cruelly for his suspicions.  Eventually he evokes a bit of sympathy as he 'lives' to eat his words.  McDowell, at his most effete and harried, is given a prime featured assignment after scads of rather colorless roles.  As the reticent, timorous Van Helsing counterpart who is forced to deal with his dauntless celluloid image, McDowell lets it all hang out in fun, superficial fashion.But it's still Sarandon's show -- his sleek gestures and toying, glib remarks anxiously awaited for.  We miss him whenever he's off screen.  His transformation scenes are quite effective, yet he has the confidence to embellish even those with a mock sense of humor.  And dig that coy relationship with his very un-Renfield-like `partner' Billy (Jonathan Stark), which has a vague, teasing sexual charge to it.
One minor flaw: the 'disco' flavored musical score tends to date it.  But, in every other way, it holds up.  A real sleeper in my book, this runs neck-and-neck with my other favorite of the period ""The Lost Boys"".",Fright Night
185,imad_jafar,An absolute delight!,7,9 February 2010,"This brilliant film is a masterful mixture of sidesplitting laughs and hip, Hammer-style horror. When Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) discovers that his mysterious neighbor is a bloodsucking fiend, he immediately gets on the case and hires the help of a hapless horror TV show host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall in a scene-stealing performance) with often hilarious results. The film is made all the better with Ken Diaz's superb ""Evil Dead""-style creature make-up effects and a wonderful turn from Chris Sarandon as the prince of darkness. Bursting with energy, wit and love for the genre (there is a poster of ""House Of Dracula"" in Vincent's house), this is one film that is an absolute must-see for any true vampire fan.",Fright Night
186,med-01081,Protect ya Neck!,9,25 October 2020,"A classic 80s vampire neighbour horror film that has it all from a scared virgin teenager next door to the cool calm chick magnet head vampire. The music is awesome and composed by the same guy that did the first terminator. The setting is exactly what you want from an 80s horror movie with the creepy decrepit house next door in the middle of suburbia. The acting is vintage 80s, over the top and campy but dark and serious when it needs to be. Roddy Mcdowel is excellent as the old school vincent price esque horror tv presenter turned vampire hunter.

188,lone-wolf-007,A true classic,8,6 July 2007,It is rare for a movie to do everything right from the get go. Fright Night is a old fashioned vampire movie brought up to date. From the set up of the story to the introduction of characters...everything just works perfectly. Chris Sarandon is hypnotic as the vamp. William Ragsdale is believable as the teen trying to get anybody to believe he has a vampire living next door to him. The real star though is Roddy Mcdowall as Peter Vincent. He turns in a fine performance and is a benefit to the movie. The effects are good(in a 80's way) and there is humor here and there. Anybody who likes vampire movies or horror movies from the 80's should check this out. This is a great movie that still holds up today. They just don't make movies like this anymore.,Fright Night
189,seanahalpin,"Creepy, freaky and VERY 80s",8,19 February 2002,"I loved this rehash of the old vampire stories. The movie gives a good mix of chills and thrills as well as a chuckle now and then. Evil Ed is a good comic break, and keep an eye out for Amanda Bearse (Marcie Darcy on Married With Children).While yes, the film is dated, is that such a bad thing? I like to put it up there with other 80s vamp classics like The Lost Boys and Vamp.""Velcome to Frrrright Night.... nya nya nya"".",Fright Night
190,Pelagia,Hip 80's Horror,8,19 August 2000,"Fright Night is a film that tries hard to be cool.Main character Charlie lives as an only child with a mother that turns a blind eye to his sexual and social development, and holds a similar treatment to his room-- that kind that every teenagers dreams of having but is denied by his parents, with the horror film nostalgia covering every bare inch of both wall and table.Dracula here loses the cape, the white makeup, and takes on a hip, older-man personage that will naturally drive the young girls wild.  Looking like he just stepped off of poster that some girl pinned above her bed, Dandridge carries a strong aura of sexuality and mystique, as is required of such a dark character.  Despite the subtle homosexual nature of his relationship with his human accomplice in crime, which is debatable as imagined or not, he is quite a lady's man, in essence, the complete opposite of inexperienced, high-pitched Charlie.Essentially, the setup is that this film was intended for teens,  and although the fashions (as with almost all things 80's) have quickly become outdated, the ideas still remain the same.  Instead of the pretentious Gothic hue that most vampire movies fall into, this one just tries to be a hip, fun movie to watch.Peter Vincent, the over-the-hill horror movie star, states in one scene that nobody cared anymore about vampires, that people only wanted to see serial killers in ski masks chopping up campers.  He was right on, as many of the 80's horror films had become mindless slash fests that took themselves too seriously with the ""teens get laid, then teens get slashed"" formula that was recycled throughout those countless sequels.  Fright Night just tries to be hip, have a little fun, and thumb its nose at those other horror flicks.Overlook the bad laughs that 80's trends can induce, mind the annoyance that is Charlie Brewster (do all of his lines have to end in exclamation points? ""I hate exclamation points!""-Elaine Benes) and enjoy some particularly good special effects.",Fright Night

192,fireworksness,Chris Sarandon is a treasure,5,6 August 2020,"Not frightening by today's standards.Chris Sarandon stands out in his portrayal of the vampire Jerry. His acting is above everyone else's. The costume designer I have questions for based on Jerry's outfit choices alone.Overall felt like I was rooting more for Jerry than the teen protagonist. Charley came off as a manipulative boyfriend, having his girlfriend apologize for not wanting to have sex with him yet and then ignoring her when she offers herself to him.Sarandon is charming and intriguing as the villain and the last 15 minutes or so are stunning in terms of the story moving at a more reasonable pace and the make up department really shining with Amy and Chris's monster makeup.
The beginning half was much slower than I would have liked. Why no one around Charley would even believe him a little bit is baffling. He has no close friends who trust him at all? Strange.",Fright Night
193,jimbofletch,"Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!",8,4 January 2001,"This is a very enjoyable film. Maybe not as scary as its tagline (""If you love being scared it'll be the night of your life"") or the spooky poster (the one with the vampire's face floating above the Dandridge house) would suggest, Fright Night is far more successful as easy-going entertainment. The 18 certificate it got in the UK is ridiculous, as the tone of the film is lighthearted and only occasionally dark and eerie, like The Lost Boys. Even though The Lost Boys is more ambitious, imaginative and original, Fright Night is probably a more consistent film with a better script. The acting is pretty good, the contemporary soundtrack ranges from the amusingly dated to the admittedly brilliant, the special effects are decent (from the GhostBusters crew:not surprising since the vampire bat looks a little like the terrordog from that film)and the balancing of horror and comedy is very well judged. The story premise is an absolute peach, and the scriptwriters have done it justice, building up the suspenseful plot to a spectacular climax. William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys make for a sympathetic bunch of victims, while Roddy McDowall is very funny in a well written part. Of course the most important character is the vampire, and the talented Chris Sarandon from Dog Day Afternoon is the perfect bloodsucker: the film moves into top gear whenever he's around. For those who loved The Lost Boys and GhostBusters this is highly reccomended.",Fright Night
194,jacobconnelly-47681,Funny with Great Special Effects,9,14 November 2021,"There's something about 80's horror. There's so much imagination and a great sense of fun. Fright Night doesn't take itself seriously like a lot of other vampire movies and has fun with its Real Window-inspired story about a teenage boy who believes the man who just moved in next door is a vampire.The comedy comes from the poor kid trying to convince everyone around him that he's right but everyone from his mother, his girlfriend, his best friend, and a washed up horror host refuse to believe him.The script by Tom Holland is sharp and funny, taking the classic vampire legends and dropping them into the real world, asking ""what would it be like if you found out your neighbor was a vampire? Would anyone believe you?"" The performances are excellent with everyone doing fantastic work but Chris Sarandon's effortless charming vampire and Roddy McDowell's befuddled horror host are the most memorable.",Fright Night

Long before Scream launched two awful sequels and a legion of funny horror imitations in the 90s, there was Fright Night.  A simple, classic horror story, which was among the first to really bring the vampire legend into the modern American suburbia, in the same tradition as such great modern vampire tales as Stephen King's remarkable novel ""Salem's Lot.""  Roddy McDowall is never better than he is here as the yellow-spined ""vampire killer"", and Herman's Head star William Ragsdale is really terrific. An underappreciated classic.",Fright Night
196,tomjeffrey2001,Lots of Fun!,10,16 August 2009,"What would you do if you found out that your new next-door neighbor was a blood-sucking creature of the night? That's Charley Brewster's dilemma in this highly entertaining mix of horror and comedy. Charley tries calling the police. That doesn't work out so well. None of his friends believe him. Out of desperation, Charley finally solicits the aid of Peter Vincent, the washed-up host of a local horror television show who, unfortunately, doesn't believe in real-life vampires.This is one of those rare mixes of horror and comedy that really works. The comedy bits are funny and the horror is, at times, truly horrific. Much of its success is due to the actors who play the lead roles -- Chris Sarandon as the super cool vampire Jerry Dandridge; William Ragsdale as the hapless Charley; Roddy McDowell as the skeptical Peter Vincent; and Stephen Geoffreys as the aptly named Evil Ed. Add to the fine acting a literate script and excellent special effects and the result is a funny, frightening masterpiece.Highly recommended for all fans of vampire movies.",Fright Night

198,mr. sardonicus,Fright Night is a great mix of horror and humor,9,13 September 2000,"Fright Night is a great mix of horror and humor. By 1985, I thought I would never again see a horror movie that was not completely predicated on violence and gore. But Tom Holland came through like gangbusters with Fright Night. This movie is a throwback--a creepy horror flick with minimal gore, great performances, and effective chills. William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowell are fantastic as Charley, the boy living next door to a vampire, and Peter Vincent, the third-rate actor pretending to be a vampire killer. The supporting cast is excellent as well, especially Sarandon as the long-toothed neighbor. There are just too many good scenes to pick a favorite, and the ending is a good as I have ever scene in a vampire movie. If you like a little scare, but don't like being grossed out by gratuitous gore, this is a sure bet.

It was. Fright Night is full of memorable moments, characters, music, lines, everything. There´s one vital thing in this movie which I think is missing from recent movies: the feel that the characters are in danger. You really get the feeling that Charlie and Peter Vincent are scared out of their minds and that translates into the viewer. There´s lots of great lines but they don´t feel glued-on like in 99% of modern action/horror movies. The scenes toward the end are pretty gory and very atmospheric, just look at scene where the wolf/vampire is impaled: the swinging light, the bloody werewolf body, the unsettling howling.. very powerful stuff.

The real stars though are MacDowall, Sarandon, and Stark. Roddy brings just the right amount of hamminess and nobility to Peter Vincent while Sarandon and Stark make for one of the creepiest couples in movies.The movie is filled with subtle touches recognizing all the vampire movies that came before and does a great job of integrating vampire ""lore"" into a world where everyone thinks vampires only exist in the movies.The movie is nicely filmed and the special effects don't seem at all dated.
All in all, a great pic. Excellent acting, a witty, intelligent script, good music and visual effects, and a finale that knocks your socks off. I'd give this flick 8 out of 10 stars and I rarely give any movie made in the last 30 years more than 5 or 6.",Fright Night

There plenty of frightening moments in the movie which made me feel uneasy. Chris Sarandon played an excellent vampire. The acting was not top notch by any means but it was somewhat believable and it didn't take you away from the movie. The transformations were excellent which the wolf to teenager transformation was extremely creepy. There were plenty of funny moments along with the right amount of horror. This was a completely fresh movie which was professionally executed. I was quite pleased with watching this at my age and enjoying it quite a bit. Not a bad reaction for an 80's film.

It delivers a solid story line and you'll enjoy the characters personalities throughout the film. Director Tom Holland truly had a sense of passion and sincerity for this movie and for the vampire concept. He opens the door for the modern day vampire and produces a humorous script. This is a good one to watch over and over. Worth the time for any horror movie buff and by far one of my personal favorites. Holland also directed Child's Play which is his more known work. However it is evident that his labor of love was in Fright Night. While Child's Play is extremely original Fright Night ultimately packs more punch.,Fright Night

Vincent doesn't really believe that vampires exist, but does it for the money...Fond, fond memories of my childhood. Well more like my teenagerhood.

214,HorrorFIlmReviews,Ted Munns Horror Film Reviews - Fright Night (1985),9,27 April 2011,"When I first watched Fright Night as a kid I instantly feel in love with the film. It is a movie that has a fun yet creepy feeling towards it. It has kept me coming back for more and more year after year.Plot:Charlie (William Ragsdale) believes that his next door neighbour (Chris Sarandon) is more than just a little odd, after a number of strange events and the disappearance of a women. Charlie turns to his family and friends for help and when all else fails, he asks for the help from TV show host and horror movie star Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall).Hot or Not:Fright Night is defiantly Hot a film that is there to entertain and is made by a director who clearly has an affection for the genre. While scary in places (especially the scene in Charlie's room) the film is very fun and has comical aspects to it and generally sums up 80s movies (fun music, cheesy effects, not to say they are bad for the time and full of colour). The film gives homages to many of its fellow Vampire sub genre films, including the Hammer and Universal, the scenes on the staircase resemble universals Dracula a great deal.Fright night tries not to steer to far away from the original principles of the vampire movie and it works perfectly. There are no guns and heavy weaponry like some modern vampire films and it doesn't dry and take away from the original principles. Chris Sarandon doesn't no kung fu and doesn't have an army of vampire ninjas.Sarandon you feel could play Dracula perfectly and you feel Gerard Butler may have based his Dracula portrayal on Sarandon's character in Dracula 2000. Peter Vincent is clearly a homage to peter Cushing and Vincet Price and portrays his role well as the Van Helsing character.Birds and the Bees:We get a pair of breasts from Jerry's first victim, however the ladies get the best deal in this film seeing Chris Sarandon shirtless and just being dam sexy.Acting:Chris Sarandon (Jerry) steels every scene he is in, the guy is very sexy and that is coming from a straight guy. He clearly appreciates the genre and knows how to play the role to perfection, cocky and argent but at the same time charming. Roddy McDowall (Peter Vincent) is comical and very funny you instantly warm to him. William Ragsdale (Charlie) handles his whiny part well, although did become slightly irritating. Amanda Bearse (Amy) as the innocent girlfriend didn't feel right, she seemed out of place and was one possible let down, one of very few that the film had. She seemed to old for the role, perhaps that was so her and Jerry's relationship was weird.Overall:Fright Night is possibly one of the best Vampire films around, it doesn't get much better. Horror fans, vampire fans and even fans of just 80s films will appreciate this movie. It has all the feel of a traditional Vampire film but at the same time has a splash of 80's flavor. I especially loved the nightclub scene great music and the dance scene was great.",Fright Night
215,ReganH14,My favourite Vampire film,9,14 January 2019,"Fright night is one of those movies that just enforces my opinion that older horror movies are better than new so called horror (hell I'm 15 and I don't think that most horror movies are cheap jump scares or lame remakes of classics).Charley Brewster is convinced that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire and after getting nowhere with the cops he decides to turn to horror host Peter Vincent to try and help him kill his vampire neighbor.The movie has got quite a good story with the first half being mostly Charley trying to convince the people around him of Jerry's real nature and then the second half is Charley and Peter teaming up to kill him. Overall the movie also has got more interest than the common slasher film that were still coming out at around this time and makes you really care about the characters.The performances are also great with William Ragsdale doing well as the main lead though I do find his first decisions after realizing Jerry is a vampire to be a bit unrealistic. I mean he expects everyone to believe that his new neighbor is some mythical killer and then gets upset when no one believes him.
Roddy McDowall is great as the struggling actor Peter Vincent who has to fight a vampire for real. I found him to be my favorite character in the film.
Chris Sarandon turns in a great performance as Jerry, he's able to act both charming and likeable as well as playing the viscous vampire. See a vampire can be both charming and dangerous (someone should have probably given Stephanie Myers a copy of this film).
Whilst Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys do well as Charlies friends.The affects work for this movie is great and the music also works well with the movie. Overall the film is brilliant and close to perfect.",Fright Night

He has to get the help of an older vampire movie star to help him defeat the beast. The film does have a sense of humor, but also has a great,creepy atmosphere; especially in the scenes in the house towards the end.

A very good vampire story. Jerry is my favorite character. I saw the film on the computer at night and i enjoyed it. Very good effects, nice looking vampires and a sense of fun. I think this is one of the best films i have ever seen in my life. It's better than Dracula. This is an all-time classic. I wan't to see it's sequel Fright Night Part II.

But it had nearly a 7 of 10 on IMDb so what the hell.What I think was the best parts of this movie is the special effects. Real good ones for a 26y old movie. The story is good but it could have been better ""played out"", but neither the less, i enjoyed this movie, and that i think, is what watching a movie is all about.I saw ""The thing (-82 version)"" yesterday, i gave the movie an 8 for one reason, this 8 is for the ""surprising"" i got when i watched it.This is my first review by the way.",Fright Night
220,asmushar,My favorite Vampire movie!,10,6 October 2010,"This flick is my favorite vamp movie of all time and IMO one of the best horror movies as well. The movie stands out as having a sense of fun to it despite being a full fledged monster/action film. All the characters are perfectly cast with the exception of ""Marcy"" (she is supposed to be a teen? she is supposed to be hot?) who is badly miscast here. This is probably why she does not appear in the second installment. The film moves at a brisk pace and is both comedic and horrific. This film has also stood the test of time well- even my son loves it! An all time horror classic ! The film stays true to the vampire genre while charting a course of its own. I thought the concept of having to have total faith in utilizing the cross against a vampire was ingenious and made sense. There really is not a boring stretch in the movie. When there is a pause in the action the characters/plot are being developed. Rent or buy it and you will not be disappointed if you are a horror fan.",Fright Night

223,machocabrio,My proper introduction into horror films was so elegant and campy!,9,1 October 2018,"I was 10 years old when Fright Night hit theaters in 1985. I recall reading some Fangoria magazines at a local restaurant in Mexico City called Sanborns, where they used to bring a lot of American titles back in the 80s (Starlog, Fangoria, GoreZone). I came across a picture of Amy with her big fangs and big mouth make up and was instantly traumatized by her insane and scary look. Then I saw the poster when the film was finally released, a somewhat similar image, striking, enticing and scary in unison. That vampire face stuck with me for years to come, though I couldn't watch the film because I was so young.
Then Fright Night II came along and I was 14. I got hooked on the hype and went to see it alone, my mom and my brother waited for me at the mall. I came out of the film fully convinced horror was something I've been missing. I was truly scared to see any horror film, and my first one was A Nightmare on Elm Street II at a rerun theater. That one got me excited about the genre, but it was Fright Night II the one that really did the trick for me. Then I saw the original film in Beta cassette and became fully devoted to Fright Night. It was a mixture of comedy and horror that reminded me of Ghostbusters in a way, with these two common men fighting the forces of evil in a SFX extravaganza that allowed itself to be serious, funny, terrifying and seductive.The make up effects were impressive, balancing the grotesque with the coolness of an era full of innovation. It felt so real you almost wanted to be a vampire yourself. I was much more in love with Fright Night than I was with The Lost Boys, as the cool factor on that one is different, feels like kids wanting to play adults, something I couldn't relate to. Fright Night was more naive and felt like it payed homage to those black and white films you could watch on TV at night. Don't get me wrong, both films are amazing and the still hold up after al these years, it's just this one spoke a little bit more to my geeky side, it had this classic vampire sleekness while sporting a modern take on old myths. It felt familiar and at the same time totally fresh.
I think this is one of those films that deserve more praise than it actually does. I recently saw it with my wife and a close friend, they're both 25, and they became truly fascinated with the characters and the way everything fell into place. It's till an impressive film.",Fright Night
224,voumeguy,"A great blend of ""old"" and ""new"" horror",8,14 March 2006,"Tom Holland's ""Fright Night"" combines the best elements of old and new horror films into a picture well worth watching. The story juxtaposes mythological figures of fright (vampire, wolfman, and familiar) with the real-world realities of high school and sexual awakening. Brewster's advances with his girlfriend Amy open the film with the awkwardness they share in coming closer to the 'final act.' Charley is diverted from his and Amy's moment by his new neighbors' transportation of a coffin into their home's basement. Charley can't cope with the approaching little death, and focuses on the real thing. A whirlwind follows with Charley and Amy constantly running from their fears of the unknown, represented by Dandridge (Chris Sarandon.) In keeping with the old, Holland characterized Peter Vincent as a generic meld of Peter Cushing and Vincent Price (often playing opposites as antagonist and protagonist in the same films.)To avoid spoilers, I recommend this film as a remarkable work of modern horror.",Fright Night

228,alex54ruiz,Fright night still frightens the hell out of me.,8,25 January 2011,"Before playing Marci Darci in Married with Children, Amanda Bearse terrified the hell out of me when I first watched this movie. In fact, I just watched Fright Night a couple of months ago and I chuckled nervously after seeing certain scenes thinking, ""damn, this is still pretty scary."" It's more of a parody of vampire movies, a campy horror flick that has some comedy but with Chris Sarandon as a Dracula-esque vampire, Roddy McDowall as a not-so-famous TV vampire killer, and the special effects, this is a must-see horror movie at any age. Charly (William Ragsdale) suspects his new neighbor (Sarandon) of being a vampire but, naturally, no one believes him so he takes it upon himself to take him down before he steals his girlfriend (Bearse) away from him and turns her into his bride. Sarandon effortlessly delivers as the vampire and McDowall's comedic turned terrified performance are enough to make me watch this but two things deliver and make this movie so good that there's obviously a remake on the way (August 12, 2011 starring Colin Farrell and David Tennant) because of it. Aside from the story and acting and blah blah blah, the special effects and Stephen Geoffreys' performance are awesome to watch. The way they made the vampires is extremely scary. It's not just the typical black eyes, white make-up, and long teeth. No, it's Julia Roberts-sized mouths with shark-type teeth that threaten to rip a chunk off your neck rather than leave two small holes. That and their movements. Fantastic. It might be better than Twilight. ;) The other thing is Stephen Geoffreys. He gives such an eerie and energetic performance that he definitely stands out more than his acting counterparts. His character is an enigma and when he's turned into a vampire he embraces it as much as any top notch actor can. He's phenomenal. Kinda makes you sad that he turned to making gay porn instead of an actual movie career. Oh well, c'est la vie.",Fright Night

What follows is a great romp through everyone's disbelief, punctuated by the seriously scary moves of Jerry Dandridge, the vampire. Peter Vincent, the broken-down vampire-movie actor, is nailed by veteran Roddy McDowell. He almost steals the show (and well he could), but instead he plays his part as a major member of the ensemble, just as he should.

235,pjspeight_2k,"offbeat, cool, sexy and very 80s vampire tale (my favourite yet)",8,3 March 2000,"Before I first watched Fright Night, I admit I was unsure about what to think about it. All I knew about it was from what I had been told from my Dad (though his likes/dislikes are generally on par with mine, they sometimes border on plain stupid). But when I saw it to the end, I was almost totally converted.Although the beginning is a bit cheesy and reminiscent of stereotypical horror B-movies, it soon becomes clear that this is part of what makes Fright Night so original. All the typical horror film genres are there: horror, romance, comedy (well maybe comedy isn't a typical horror element); but what makes this horror flick stand out a mile-and-a-half from the rest is that it's a very offbeat tale. It's creepily cheesy but gets away with it because it's atmosphere is so good.All this and I haven't mentioned the acting or special effects yet. Sarandon seems to give such an effortless performance as the vampire and as a result is almost perfect. I had thought of what a modern day vampire would be like before I saw Fright Night; but Jerry Dandridge just blew all these ideas away and has to be the coolest (and I don't often use that word) and sexiest vampire ever, and is one of my favourite movie villains. Roddy McDowall can't hold a candle to Sarandon but is still very good, and Stephen Geoffreys is one of the funniest and memorable movie characters ever to grace a film screen too.The special effects are good for 1985 and unlike where in modern films the SFX are the main point in the movie, here they add to the already present chilling atmosphere. And although on the one hand, Fright Night is quite dated, it also captures the atmosphere and the essence of the 80s. The soundtrack is excellent for the film, but paradoxically not very memorable (apart from one or two good songs).[I wish I'd been born before 1981 (maybe 1961) so that I could have lived in the late-70s and 80s, and would have memories of the best music from that time, and not the boybands/Beatles clones/dance ditties (not decent tunes mind) we have now.]All in all an (almost) perfect film: watch it and you'll (most likely) enjoy it and watch it again and again.",Fright Night

237,nerethel1200,One Of the Best of the 80's Horror,9,24 August 2011,"Fright Night......without a doubt one my favorites from the 80's. The story of teenage boy dealing with an insufferable bloodsucker recently moved in next door. There are certain points where it dates itself, the music, the clothing, the hair, but nevertheless a classic in my opinion. I was about 11 when I first saw it on one of the movies channels and it enthralled me and I don't necessarily mean scaring me. It was an enjoyable film, with a good storyline, simple...but good. The acting is good for the time, and has some quirks, but not in a sense of filling like, ""Man..that dude can't act!"" The setting for the house that Jerry Dandridge lives in, casts a good, hauntingly chilled appearance and Chris Sarandon provides the smooth and calm, yet sly and sadistic performance as Dandridge and when you've spent a few scenes watching him you begin to realize this guy's no Grandpa Munster. William Ragsdale convinces you of his role as Charlie Brewster, the slightly paranoid horror movie fan with a bit too much curiosity flowing through his adolescent mind.....though they did a good job with the scenes of the first two of Dandridge's victims. When you see those long distorted fingernails, it makes me think of Nosferatu and his creepy Ole self. Roddy McDowall proves himself and his acting ability in the role of the Vampire Hunter, Peter Vincent, who in the beginning is put aside by Charlie and his newfound desires to kill the supposed vampire neighbor, but once convinced when being attacked by Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys of 976-Evil)is ready to take down the bloodsucker of the neighborhood. I will not go into more of the film, because I recommend the viewing of this classic 80's vampire movie, neither will I judge the remake that is currently out. The Con's of this film I have is probably the presence of the character Amy, who is also Charlie's girlfriend. I am still not fond of the character, nor the actress portraying it. So go to your video store, and rent it just might give you a Fright!!",Fright Night

When I was a kid I happened to see this movie on Cable and I was a bit scared of it back then, but for some reason it became our favorite movie between my best friend and I (I miss you Rob if your out there).  That says a lot seeing as how I'm am not, generally, a fan of horror films.  This movie, however, has a humorous flavor and that keeps me coming back to it.  It pokes fun at it's horror roots while at the same time managing to convey it plot seriously.This movie still could have fallen on it's face without the right casting, luckily, it has it.  William Ragsdale does a good job with the ""typical teenager"" against the non-believing world role.  The real stars of this movie are Chris Sarandon, the suave vampire next door, Stephen Geofferys, as the main character's oddball outcast friend, and Roddy McDowall as the out of work B-movie ""vampire killer"" whose old role has become a bit too much his persona.  McDowall deserves a special mention because he makes his character so human and real, while Geofferys does a fantastic job in his creepingly funny off the wall role. On the whole, the chemistry between the actors is very strong and noticeable, and most importantly, you get the sense that everyone is having fun in their role , which is what really pulls this movie off. This is a well executed movie that both young and old can enjoy, and I urge almost anyone to look past it's genre and give it a chance.",Fright Night

242,SoroushX,Welcome tooo Frrright Night .... for real!,6,7 May 2017,"""Fright Night"" starts with an absorbing and rather fantastic plot idea. A vampire, that triggers a pleasant association with historical tales of Count Dracula and his dark, creepy castle in the heart of Transylvania, here in the middle of an urban area undoubtedly leads to a fantasy undertone and manages to add a touch of humor every once in a while.The first scene unconsciously brings to mind Roman Polanski's much underrated masterpiece ""The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967)"" and with Roddy McDowall's remarkable resemblance to Alfred (Roman Polanski's character in the aforementioned movie), this comparison is further intensified. the movie begins with a comedy scene where two high school sweethearts are making love in the middle of watching a late-night horror movie. This scene is immediately followed by a horror one in which two men are seen carrying a coffin into the basement of the next-door house. This subtle shift of tones between comedy and horror has proved to be quite effective and as said before has a strong resemblance to Polanski's cinematic tour de force.however, it goes without saying that ""Fright Night"" is hardly comparable to Polanski's flick in terms of the plot, humor and the incredible Transylvanian mood that the latter has to offer. But watching it at 2 o'clock after midnight was an enjoyable experience thanks to the spirit of America's 80's movies that never lets you down.",Fright Night
243,JBStanden,Frighteningly good!,8,14 January 2012,"Original story based on traditional vampire rules... Excellent cast includes Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowall, Amanda Bearse and Steven Geoffreys.Sarandon's portrayal of Jerry Dandrige is the most debonaire, sophisticated and articulate vampire-next-door ever seen on film, in my opinion. Dandrige is an impeccably dressed, highly civilised apple eating vampire (in the early evening at least) who is dead keen to secretly ""suck his way through the entire town"".Frustrated teen, Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) stumbles across his neighbour's nocturnal activities by chance and although his friends refuse to believe it, his eventual all- too-close encounter with undead Dandrige puts him on a mission to protect himself in any way he can. Brewster soon transforms his bedroom into a holy shrine with crucifixes, candles and sharpened stakes.Failing late night TV host and very B movie actor Peter Vincent (who thankfully has managed to retain a huge number of his old movie props) thinks he's crazy too. Persuaded by Charlie's friends to use these props, Vincent attempts to prove to him that Dandrige is not a vampire, but all does not go exactly to the plan.An atmospheric score by Brad Fiedel, and true 1980s soundtrack including memorable nightclub beats from Evelyn ""Champagne"" King, Sparks and Ian Hunter help add credence to the in-the-now scenario.A fun and sometimes funny vampire film with reasonable special effects, enjoyable to watch throughout. And yes it's brim full of minor goofs, but they don't actually spoil it at all and maybe even add to its appeal!",Fright Night
244,BloodyTentPegs,This is just a big budget,2,17 August 2014,"OK, the film is ""well crafted"" ""well acted"" ""witty."" So what. To me this movie is just the product of a large budget and there is nothing brilliant about it. There is no play on conventional structure or genre, rather, the play and humor that is employed is only a conventional play with structure, genre, humor. Then again I'm not one for main stream high budget comedy horror movies that offer the same old wit and humor. Charlie is obviously an easy to identify with protagonist for a lot of people. A sensitive, softy, genuine guy. But he severely sucks in my honest opinion. His girlfriend is even more annoying, her cotton ball hair makes me cringe and her blind devotion to him is appalling. Her character is so undeveloped, she's not even a funny parody of person. Evil is also the most irritating little twerp ever. Probably as annoying as Chop Top in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. He should be gagged and stuffed in a body bag. So basically I hate all of the characters. The movie is just lacks any flesh, life, heat energy. What a waste of my time.",Fright Night
245,marydrippingblood,Why Fright Night is worth many words,10,1 September 2004,"Why is Fright Night my all time favorite horror movie within the vampire content? Well, simply because of the films actors and the story line itself. In the past month or so I have had the chance to reminisce on the fact that I had always adored this movie. Sitting down and taking the time to watch it through again as I had once done years ago when Fright Night was my inspiration to dive into the horror writing area with great vampire characters with memorable appearance and expression. From the villainous immortal to the pathetic immortal. Remembering my youth, not that long about, about close to twenty years ago I was introduced to Fright Night on a cable movie channel. The part I remembered the most was Evil Ed's transformation from wolf to man. Why that stuck out, probably played on my fear of werewolves (funny I know). As I got older I found that I was madly in love with the character Jerry Dandridge, just by the fact of Chris Sarandon's wonderful portrayal of the creature of the night. Just is seduction and sexiness. But also the fact that he was pure evil with all the vampire cunningness. Having the movie given as a birthday present at the age of twelve made my life peachy. Watching as much as I can. Now as a adult I understand more about the movie. It's contents, the story line and the effort that was put into making it a graphic film with horror and terror. Fright Night is a perfect example of the greatest of special effects for the 80's. It was battling against movies like Nightmare On Elm Street and others that played on fears. This is a classical story because it creates a modernized vampire and also shows what happens when a young teen gets nosey. With that, you think of what you might do when if a vampire lived nextdoor to you! But with all the actors and actresses, only one stood out from the rest. Chris Sarandon is a talented actor who deserves praise for his performance, which many seem to appreciate. I think any person with a horror taste should take the time to watch this classic movie and see what is definitely the most original and breath taking movie of its time. I can go on and on about this movie, but I am limited. But the time is ended. Please, take the time and watch the movie if you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a along time. Thanks",Fright Night
246,marydrippingblood,Welcome to Fright Night!,10,25 August 2004,"I will start off by saying that I am a gigantic fan of Fright Night. It all started when the film made its premiere on HBO. The one part that stuck in my head (besides Sarandon's looks) was ""Evil Ed's"" transformation from wolf to human. Scared the crap out of me. Well, a couple years later, hitting sixth grade, I found the video at a video store and fell in love with it all over again. A friend and I began huge fans, buying Fangoria magazines and collecting the comic series. I remembering making my parents rent the movie for me so I could watch from evening till seven in the morning! Phew! Now, some girls would have crushes on things like, New Kids On the Block. Not me! I was infatuated with Chris Sarandon's seductive performance as Jerry Dandridge. Hey, any woman would be nuts not to find this man hot. Definition of tall, dark, and handsome. He could of bit me in a neck and I would of never cared.As I am at the age of 27, I still have my first and only copy of the film that was boughten for me on my 12th birthday, a tad worn but still plays. I have more of a appreciation for the movie. For all the actors and actresses.I have the movie memorized, word for ward, even if I go like a year without watching it again. But recently I began to realize that the 20th anniversary for this great horror classic is coming around the bend. I had started a script myself, which I know will fail to be noticed, for such a special occasion. Bringing back all the characters from part one and two, except Peter Vicent since no one but Roddy MacDowall could do the part.I just want everyone to know that Fright Night is the definition of the perfect eighties Horror film. It is original with it's characters, setting, and the all around story itself. But it also shows the hard work that had gone into it to create those undoubtedly, scarier then crap Dandridge, Evil, Amy, and Billy Coal transformations. Chris Sarandon himself stated it was hell to do the make up for the movie but his character was worth it. I would rather see a film with special make up effects then with the modern computer animation special effects. More work and artistic, hands on talent went into movies like Fright Night. That's why Fright Night stands out as a eighties classic vampire flick. I personally would like to thank all the actors for the gift of entertainment when making the film. Also the brilliant minds and talented men and women who worked on the film. Fright Night is a movie that has fond memories for me in my child hood. Chris Sarandon will always be my first movie star crush. Dang, he is still hot today! I can't help but still imagine Jerry Dandridge as my perfect, eye candy neighbor. I would recommend anyone to view this movie. Appreciate it as a art form of entertainment with the taste of horror mixed in there. Enjoy it and love it!One final statement.....LONG LIVE FRIGHT NIGHT!!!!!!!!!",Fright Night
247,purplexvi,One of the top vampire movies of all time.,10,20 August 2011,"This movie is glorious, everything about it is perfect. The effects are better than modern CGI, the actors are glorious, the plot and writing are beautiful.There's not a moment of this movie you won't love if you enjoy classic vampires and don't mind a dash of comedy in your horror, but the comedy never turns the whole thing into silliness. It just points out the natural goofiness of supernatural situations, and the exaggerations that come to the fore.The movie is not exactly scary as such, though. There are no crappy jump scares and it won't leave you quivering in bed at night afraid of being bitten. It's more about the characters' terror than terrifying the viewer. Whether this is good or not may be up to the individual.It's also a movie somewhat laden with tropes, you can predict 90% of the scenes as they come, but at the same time, every last one of those clichés are so well-executed that you can't help but love them anyway.",Fright Night
248,Kish-5,Could have been much better with more development.,7,29 December 1998,"In all, this movie is worth seeing.  Unfortunately, the villain comes off as far more sympathetic than the hero.  It would have been far better with more exploration of Jerry Dandridge's motivations and plans (it's actually unclear whether he wants Amy, the heroine, as his consort or just wants her to help him kill the hero), and more character development for every character.  Much was touched on that should have been explored. Also, the gruesome special effects were unnecessary and way overused.  In summary, I will recommend this movie to anyone who's not squeamish, with a slight sigh of regret for what it *could* have been.",Fright Night

Why does it succeed when really, it's kinda cheesy and seems to be geared toward high schoolers?  Again, I don't know.

The films sets, tone, music, and overall feel is perfect for the mid-'80's and it's old horror roots are also very enjoyable and nostalgic.

I hardly see the effects done like that anymore, because they do computer special effects.",Fright Night
254,axelfoley1234,Cult Horror Vampire Classic,8,12 September 2010,"Not all 80's movies were that bad. This vampire movie was very chilling and exciting. It begins with a teenage boy named Charley Brewster who finds that he is expecting a new neighbor in his town. It just so happens that his neighbor is a vampire. It turns out that this neighbor is also the murderer of several people that recently appeared on the news. Unfortunately, the vampire has a friend that can back him up during the daytime. So when Charley called the police, they of coarse don't believe him. Charley then seeks help from his horror icon Peter Vincent the expert on vampires. Roddy McDowell did an excellent job playing his role as Peter Vincent. He had just of a great personality as the typical Van Helsing in other vampire flicks. This guy is fun, loving, and very intelligent. Overall, the action is fun, the story is pretty sweet, and the special effects and make up are fun to look at. My only regret is looking at those fake teeth. I mean, that is not what charming vampires have. The turned vampires in this film looked more monstrous than human and that just gives too much away. Probably just as bad as Edward Cullen's cover up in the Twilight series. In conclusion, this film is fun to watch and I recommend it to any horror fan. You won't be disappointed.",Fright Night
255,Anasuya,I watched it 5 times in one week,10,9 January 2005,"I would consider myself a film fan with somewhat intellectual preferences and I have a passion for European art house pretentious stuff, so when Fright Night was recommended to me I dismissed it in a snobby ""80s special effects vampire horror movie? A title that rhymes? No, thank you!"" kind of way.HOWEVER, I have a feeling it may be the single best film I have ever seen, of any genre or time period. It has a witty script, fabulous special effects and some of the best acting I have seen, particularly Evil Ed later on in the film. There are moments of suspense, hilarity, tenderness (for example with Peter Vincent and the dying wolf) and believable every day life. This film didn't actually scare me but it did make me laugh very very hard.A special mention must be made of Chris Sarandon as I think his performance really stood out. Evil is not as easy to portray in stories as people think, but Sarandon does the most believable evilness I think I have ever seen, coupled irresistibly with the sexiest seduction scene ever (is it wrong that I wanted him to win in the end because he was so gorgeous?). If vampires really did exist, I think they would be exactly like Jerry Dandridge, except maybe without the same scary 80s vampire mask and claws.My advice is SEE THIS FILM, and don't have any preconceptions about it.",Fright Night
256,wa-sl-675-379063,Fright Night!,9,30 July 2012,"One of the first vampire movies I've ever seen and if I have to be honest one of the best! The storyline in this movie is great, a lot of vampire movies are boring at best. It takes Charley a lot of effort to convince his friends, and Mr. Vincent (the great vampire killer!), that his neighbor is indeed a vampire. One of the great things about this movie is that there is one main story, the hunt for Jerry Dandridge, and at least 4 different stories. The story of Charley and his obsession to kill Jerry, 'Evil' Ed, who's always the outsider, Amy, she reminds Jerry of his girlfriend, and last but not least Mr. Vincent, he lost his job and is losing his house and on top of that vampires are real! Every character has his own 'mission' to accomplish and that is the strongest part of this movie. And don't forget 'Evil' Ed's perfect punch line: ""You're so cool Brewster!"" Another great thing is the music from Brad Fiedel! That man deserve a medal! His song 'Come to me' is still rocking me, and it fits so good in the scene when Jerry bites, and turns, Amy. This is one the classic horror/vampire movies, you have to see it!",Fright Night
257,TheDoctorfromOz,Drawing parallels...,9,1 February 2011,"In an age of Twilight, it's very interesting to see a film with vampires where they're portrayed as scary rather than your average soap opera character. In the Bela Lugosi Dracula, Dracula was portrayed with an almost Bond like stature. However, whether it was Lugosi or just the film making of the times, Dracula lacked just the the charisma to sell it. Now that's just my opinion, but in stating that, it makes my point clearer when I say the Sarandon's performance of the vampire Jerry Dandrige has that charisma so that you buy it when he seduces someone.I compare Dandrige and Dracula because that's what Fright Night is. It's a contemporary (well, in the eighties it was) take on the classic vampire. It doesn't try to create new rules or reboot classic Universal vampire lore. It simply elaborates on it. We never saw what would have happened in Dracula when Dr. Van Helsing holds up the cross. We just saw Lugosi's over the top reaction to its presence. In Fright Night, it's the equivalent of jabbing someone with a red hot brand.Speaking of Van Helsing, Roddy McDowall turns in a very fun turn as Fright Night's interpretation of the character, Peter Vincent. He's a washed up film star who's been reduced to hosting a horror movie show that shows. He has the know how and yet is crippled by his cowardice and greed. In the role of the brave boy, willing to risk life and limb to protect his neighborhood and girlfriend, is young Charley Brewster, played by William Ragsdale. He's the main character, after all, and plays the role with naivety and yet an undying persistence to stop this creature that threatens him and his community. In an all to common parallel is Charley's girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) and his best friend, Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys.) They don't believe Charley, but are concerned for him and enlist Vincent's help (with Amy's college fund.) The design of the vampire is the least faithful thing to the classic idea of the vampire. Well, the Universal vampire, anyways. When the vampires become hungry, they turn into more ravenous takes on Nosferatu (which is technically Dracula, the film studio just couldn't afford the rights to the name.) Anyway, the vampires also can transform (as did Dracula.) These effects are pretty good. One of the best involves just a quick effect with a wolves' eyes. The way the scenery blends with the film is also very well done, if not slightly exaggerated.As much as I've been praising this film, however, it's definitely not perfect. A lot of the acting is exaggerated. This problem is easily forgivable, although, because the overacting actually leads to some of the more memorable characters and moments in the film. Second, the screenplay is pretty weak at points and under mines itself when it's trying to be serious and scary and that's leading to my last complaint, which is, coincidentally, my complaint with Dracula, and that is that to me, this film just isn't scary. I mean sure, it's creepy, but if you're like me (a 14 year old boy), there's a strong possibility that this film won't scare you. However, I don't really count this as a strike against it, as it's not as much a flaw with the movie as it is with modern movie goers such as myself.The more I think about this movie, the more I realize how much this film is a contemporary re-telling of Dracula and it's a well made one, too. It's a refreshing break to see a vampire movie that doesn't try to be particularly special with it's portrayal of vampires and in not being special, it BECOMES special. And that's the beauty of Fright Night. And yet, it makes me sad, as it shows just how pathetic vampires have gotten that watching a movie where vampires do what they're supposed to do is such a rare and glorious occurrence. Oh well. In the end Fright Night is a fun, campy, and creepy vampire flick that would be ideal to watch on Halloween.",Fright Night

Also the vampire's cords were overwhelmingly visible too.The sound (like when the vampire gets thrown back (and you can see the cords there too) and hits a closet) was awful.My friends and I had a wonderful time watching this movie -- at how bad it was.

Any dog you have ever owned could write a better script and - most importantly- blow the Fright Night ""actors""'s (more like casual passers by devoid of any acting talent WHATSOEVER), into the middle of next week. This is, arguably, THE single most horrible movie of all times in any category. Vampires have surely never ever sucked this much. Vampires here call you on the phone, eat fruits, and have utterly disgusting dressing codes. The music score is a cacophony. This movie is so bad I'd sooner eat the TV than watch it all. If you watch this movie for more than 20 minutes straight under a full moon, you'll turn into a Democrat. Now, that's a scary thought. Count Quacula made for a spookier villain than this yuppie.

This is probably why the remake failed -- what was once original became decidedly cliché. Merging the genres of teen movie with that of the vampire flick was an inspired touch -- as was the tongue-in-cheek plot and dialog.

Ha! for me its a priceless scene! the look on his face...!And also i like the fact that the computer generated effects where not yet there. i prefer the make up effects. of course, some monsters look really fake like that (ex : ed when transforming back from wolf to human), but at least they were there during the filming, not only an effect added after the filming. for me, the effects not always so realistic are not spoiling the fun i have to watch that movie.of course, i don't hide anymore and now i can watch all the scenes! i remember the first time i watched it, in the scene with the bitten amy, where she is hiding her face in her hand, and all of a sudden, she lifts her face up and she has this horrible mouth full of theet, covering like 3/4 of her face...even though i was like 13, i was traumatized! for many years, i had to hide my face during that scene.well i guess thats it. i just got the DVD recently, and i am happy to be able to watch any time now. if you like movies with handsome bad guys, good actors, scary story and a lot of humor, thats exactly the movie for you! good viewing, i recommend to everybody!",Fright Night
