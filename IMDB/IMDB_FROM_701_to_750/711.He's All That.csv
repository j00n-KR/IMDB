0,kosmasp,All that and more,5,29 August 2021,"Can you smell what Rachel is cooking? Name puns aside, it was nice to see her again. And if I may say she has aged beautiful. Doesn't seem to have had any work done on her - which I'm glad she didn't. But it is not her movie - it was her movie in the 90s when it was about her in ""She's all that"".Now I don't remember much of it, but I reckon it was silly and light fun. Just as this is. This is not awards season fodder. This is also not meant to excite any acting or story driven fans. I would expect that people who are looking forward to see this, would be aware of this. If you weren't I hope you are now.Does this have flaws and does the ugly duckling story have issues all over the place? Yes but the charisma of the actors involved may make that obsolete. Or at least make it dissapear to a degree. Predictable, but I have seen worse.",He's All That
1,Calicodreamin,Painfull,3,30 August 2021,"As an adult I should not have watched this movie, to a young person it might have been tolerable and relevant. However, in my opinion it was painful. The acting was stiff and the actors had no chemistry. The storyline was expected, but some really laughable moments - prom dance off? Is that even a thing?",He's All That
2,lisafordeay,It's all about Tik Tok meets Can't Buy Me Love on this 2021 remake of an underrated teen flick,5,27 August 2021,"He's All That is a gender blended romantic teen comedy directed by Mark Waters(Just Like Heaven,Mean Girls)and stars Addison Rae(in her movie debut as she is famous for Tik Tok),Tanner Buchanan,Rachel Leigh Cook,Matthew Lillard and Madison Pettis.Almost a shot for shot of the 1999 version this one centres on a popular girl named Padgett Sawyer(Addison Rae) who just got dumped by her boyfriend after she caught him cheating on her with another woman. Heartbroken she gets her own back at him with help from her friend Aiden(Madison Pettis) by making a bet that she can transform any nerdy guy into a prom king. She decides to place her bet on an antisocial photographer named Cameron Kweller(Tanner Buchanan) who isn't all that popular. At first she is enjoying her little bet,but she later finds herself falling for Cameron (after he got a makeover).Will Cameron and Padgett end up being together in the end?. Well you betcha they do.Overall I thought it was OK. The original one was way better in my opinion as this seems like a product placement for Tik Tok.Also stars 2 of the original She's All That actors as different characters Rachel Leigh Cook as Addison's mom(she was the nerdy girl in the original one) and Matthew Lillard as Principal Bosch(who played the douchbag Freddie Prinze Jr's ex girlfriend dated). And a surprise cameo by Kourntey Kardashian as Jessica.Shame Freddie Prinze Jr didn't make a cameo.",He's All That
3,JoBloTheMovieCritic,He's All That,4,27 August 2021,4/10 - unbelievably poor acting and a weak influencer-driven storyline will make you yearn for the original and wish this remake never happened.,He's All That
4,yusufpiskin,Why?,3,1 September 2021,This movie is an insult to 'She's All That'.The movie is so bad that it's ridiculous to even call it a 'movie'.It's ironic that the actors and actresses in the movie represent in their real lives everything the movie criticizes.I have to watch the 'She's All That' DVD this weekend.,He's All That
5,m-47826,The soundtrack was fine...,3,10 September 2021,"That's the only good thing I can say about this new Netflix movie. Which pretty much says it all. Why don't these streaming services just stick to buying movies and TV shows that already exist? That's all we ask of them. I liked the little nods at the original movie, and returning cast. As well as some of the new one. And see locations that were used in things I grew up watching. But it wasn't necessary. One thing it did right though, was making me want to rewatch the OG version.",He's All That
6,juanmuscle,this popped up after watching something on Netflix!,10,27 August 2021,"And I went for it! Lol, but then when I saw Rachel Leigh I was like oh, wait, he's all that, then I remembered she was in She's all that! And although the first one didn't agree with me too well , so I guess I had terrible misgivings about moving forward with this one I stayed with it anyway and gave it a chance and I'm so glad I did! This is the writing I wanted for the first one! It was sweet and witty and funny and clever and smart and brilliant and thoughtful and sincere and above all honest and it made for a fun barn burner! I really do feel this way! I loved it! And I think everyone did a great job , who knows perhaps this handsome lead might be the next Batman or something, lots of great up and coming talent but for me, the writing on this one was superlative, not a single complaint something didn't flow right or something terrible jarring and disgusting (meaning something that tramps all over the incipient stages of it's own writing) there was none of that, it built on itself , it worked through the characters, it handled the whole modern content very well which is not easy owing to all of the extra intel flying all around , it seems like the world is hauling major ass sitting on top of a major wave dashing against all sorts of different ways of distracting ourselves , and this captured this zeitgeist and ran with and made something I believe to be truly special! Great job. I really want to see another one of these! I really do! How about They're all that, but all Asian people or something, throw in a dragon! Who knows! This was very cool though!",He's All That
7,Sir_AmirSyarif,Serviceable Netflix rom-com,5,29 August 2021,"Not brilliant filmmaking by any means - the writing is cringe-worthy, it's cliché, and some of it doesn't even make sense. But Mark Waters' 'He's All That' is a perfectly serviceable Netflix rom-com that fits the needs of the film. Addison Rae gives a competent performance, but she falls short of her more experienced costars and contemporaries.",He's All That
8,Movi3DO,It's just all that,5,27 August 2021,"Hmm I guess a hipster weirdo can know the lyrics to Teenage Dream?Alright, from the look of the poster and the first scene of this movie, I already didn't want to watch it. This was clearly just going to be another surface-level, fake and cringe teen drama that tried to be all noble about not being fake. On most count, it didn't stray away too much from its kind.However, it was actually not completely unbearable. I was surprised that I found some sweet and funny moments. Addison Rae was like alright and not completely cringe, even though her character, and also her character's friends were just normally fake people.When the premises started, I found some enjoyment, but of course at the end, the movie reverted completely back to normal.But I talked a bit too much about this movie. Overall, it's just all that. 4.5/10.",He's All That
9,apryla-58795,Not great but a bit twee,5,29 August 2021,"Was this good? No but was it the worst thing I have ever seen? Not by a long shot (people giving these low reviews have obviously never seen Lifetime movies or low budget horror films-now THOSE are truly bad) it was more that it was disappointing. They had a chance with this one but they botched it.I think it's safe to say that this is a product of the generation coming up now and the times. People don't have attention spans anymore due to social media. It's all been boiled down to seconds long clips and emojis. I haven't been able to find a truly decent movie in awhile now because audiences only seem to want to watch Marvel movies. If someone takes a risk and makes an intelligent movie - it doesn't do well because people can't get into anything unless it's non-stop in your face action. As a result we have one dumbed down movie after another and people wonder why. That is why this film didn't surprise me. I knew it wasn't gonna be great and I knew it'd be dumbed down because an Instagram star is the lead. Although honestly I didn't think AR did that bad of a job. She's not Kate Winslet but this wasn't what they were looking for.I'm usually a very harsh critic but as far as teen movies go you could do a lot worse. If you are comparing it to She's All That well then yes this is terrible. That's a classic and frankly you can't have lightening in a bottle a second time. There's only one Freddie Prinze Jr.I didn't think this was that bad. The lead guy and the lesbian Asian friend were standouts to me. Rachel Leigh Cook is usually great but she wasn't given much to work with and so she was basically phoning it in. Matthew Lillard was in this for a cup of coffee and he has gotten old which threw me for a loop. Also the thing that made me roll my eyes is - the lead is NEVER shown working out. He doesn't play sports nor do they show any weights in his house and yet...when the obligatory makeover scene happens he takes off his shirt and he's movie star ripped! I'm not talking a little bit of definition...I'm talking he looks like he did a 10 month strict regimen of eating and working out like it's his job ripped and that's just soooo unrealistic. My son worked out and followed a strict eating regimen from the time he was 15 until now (he's 24)...I'm talking working out EVERY DAY on a specialized program with NO steroids and he doesn't even have a stomach like that kid. You only get that way from working out all day and only eating chicken and fish every couple of hours. It's a full-time job. It's ridiculous when they show stuff like that like ""He's just a normal HS kid and just naturally built like that."" So unrealistic.This was very cutesy and generic and cliche which is what I had a problem with. Also I thought we were moving away from all white movies but nope here it is 2021 and we are still putting out movies with all the leads being white. They had different races represented but they were only tertiary characters. I thought the industry was trying to do better with that but you'd never know it by this film.I swear if aliens came down and watched these teen films they would think all the high schools on earth are the same but honestly where does this kind of H. S. exist? Yes kids are cruel and bullies etc...but the way things are portrayed in movies you'd think things were like this everywhere and really it's just not that way.This movie is a representation of everything that is wrong with the world. Our society has turned into something that quite frankly can't sustain itself for very long. We are churning out a bunch of mindless individuals who don't know what it means to make a commitment to anything (quit at the slightest bit of pushback), care about holding down a job, learning proper grammar or holding up anything more than good looks or likes on social media as the measure of success. Many people today are shallow, uncaring and unfeeling and that will come back to bite us at some point. Watching this just made me frustrated more than anything.If you want to watch a good movie go back and watch She's All That.",He's All That
10,gab-67599,That Is A Lot Of Hate!,10,30 August 2021,"So much hate out there for a pretty great movie that is really sad! Was this movie worthy of any awards? Possibly not! But it sure as hell was not worth a 5 or below! The two leads had great chemistry and now a days with movies and Covid it is like actors are afraid to get close to one another, with good reason! You do not find that here. It was like they were unafraid to feel how they really felt.I will say this, I hate the Kardashians and when I saw Kim I rolled my eyes but in this movie she was exactly who I expected her to be so it all worked out. I miss these kind of feel good movies. This would be more for teenagers then grown adults so that is why so much hate. This is a clue, if you read the story of the movie and it ain't you cup of tea, then MOVE ON! For me it was like mean girls, she's all that and a few other high school drama movies all in one.The leads were beautiful to watch the whole time and the drama kept me in my seat. Never a dull moment, and could they dance! I would not say this was a rom-com it was more like a rom-dram! Lol And for me I loved it. Imagine that, an adult enjoyed this movie. Some ppl have placed the bar way to high now a days when it comes to movies!",He's All That
11,Dark_Lord_Mark,"Not All That! Everything is the Same, but MUCH WORSE",3,27 August 2021,"Yeah, it's suppossed to be a remake, sequel, re-quel? Of a good 90's teen romance comedy movie.This is not as good, not as entertaining, the music sucks, the acting is awful and the plot while the same, but worse.It's terrible. They actually bought 2-3 characters from the original, but it's bad. There is now a gay girl bc reasons, and did I mentioned everything is the same but worse?Guy is a ""geek,"" now that I think about it, it's more like a mash between 'She;s All That,' and 'Drive Me Crazy,' at least the main character is.I am done, I can't any more, it was bad all around. While the original 'SHE's All That' was made for older teens and young adults, 'He's NOT All That' feeling like it was made for Disney Teens and kids who have no idea what makes a good movie.It's Awful, 2 out of 10.",He's All That

director: Mark Waters
starring: Addison Rae, Tanner Buchanan, Madison Pettis, Rachel Leigh Cook, Mathew Lillard, Peyton Meyer, Isabella Crovetti, Annie Jacob, Myra Molloy etcA teenage girl sets out to give a nebbish classmate the ultimate high school makeover. An updated remake of the 1999 film, She's All That. This film really wasn't that bad at all, people are being way too harsh. I think certain people who review it need to realise the target audience for the film.My first few positives would be the performances, likeable characters, and humour. As well as the chemistry between the cast and the fun cameo. The performances in this film were pretty good. Tanner Buchanan did a great job here, his performance was charming and the character he portrayed was relatable and funny and he stole the show. And I have to say Addison Rae did a good job here. She has got unnecessary hate. For her first big acting role she showed a lot of charm and promise, there are obviously a few things to work on, but respect to her for doing a solid job. The film was also funny, at least in my case it was occasionally for the wrong reasons. But the film was funny due to its extreme self-awareness, and the chemistry between the cast members. There were also some pretty funny lines from Tanner's character. The cast also had fantastic chemistry here. Addison and Tanner had great chemistry with each other. They worked together well, and their romance was sweet and charming as they grew as characters. I also liked the chemistry between Addison and Rachel Cook, their mother and daughter relationship was sweet. The cameo from Kourtney Kardashian was also funny as well, it was very cringy, but I found it entertaining that she used a different name for the film.My first few negatives would be the script and dialogue. As well as how generic and predictable the film is. Also, the odd main concept. The script was extremely poorly written, adding absolutely nothing new to genre and following every genre trope you can think of it was very generic, formulaic, and safe which is fine as long as you know what to expect. The film was also painfully predictable. You could tell how the film was going to play out and predict the different plot points before they even happened, it's a shame as they could have tried something a little out of the box. But once again this was expected, but it was still poorly handled. The Dialogue was also extremely corny and eye rolling. There were certain lines that have been used in countless other teen rom coms and it made me want to vomit slightly in parts. I also found the main concept strange. Tanner was already attractive before he had his makeover for the film, all they did was cut his hair and make him dress smarter. However, the bare minimum was done in the original film as well.My next few positives would be the decent set up for the main plot point, as well as the great set locations and character development. As well as the charming tone and fun scenes. I thought the set up for Padgett and Cameron meeting was a decent way to set up the main plot point of the bet for prom king and to have Padgett develop as a character. I thought the film had great set locations. The films sets were beautiful and set the mood for some fun scenes with the different events and parties and it helped with the films visual appeal. The film had decent character development. Padgett really grew as a character as her relationship with Cameron grew. She became a lot less self-obsessed and a lot more thoughtful and started living her life as herself instead of a fake personality for social media. And Cameron really grew and came out of his shell, Padgett made him be himself more. And the development about his family and his mum was sweet and gave him some decent character depth. I also thought the film had a harmless and fun charming tone, it didn't take itself too seriously, it knew what kind of movie it was, and the cast had good chemistry, so I found it very charming a lot of the time. There were some fun and entertaining scenes with the different parties that despite being very cheesy were sweet and fun to watch.My final few negatives would be the corny set up, lack of character background and unlikeable character decisions. The whole set up with Padgett losing her followers and popularity was extremely corny and just lazily set up. The set up for her redemption was good enough but this was poor. I also thought there was a lack of character depth and background to most of the characters. The supporting cast was likeable, but they were all very one dimensional and didn't deliver too much to the story. I also thought there was some unlikeable character decisions. It just felt a bit strange that Padgett was still going with the bet with Cameron for so long even when she grew feelings for him. I get the needed conflict, but it was oddly structured for me, and it made her character unlikeable for parts of the film.My final few positives would be the villains, good LGBT representation. As well as the fun final act, good themes, and uplifting ending. I thought the film did a good job with its villains. Both villains were very unlikeable and did their roles well. And when they eventually got what they deserved it was satisfying. I also liked the good LGBT representation. The film didn't shy away from having LGBT supporting characters which is great to see, Annie Jacob and Myra Molloy actually got their own storyline in the film, and it was a nice little bit of representation. The final act was also fun. It was entertaining and completely harmless. I was smiling so it did its job at having solid character arcs and good themes on accepting yourself, and not being fake on social media. The ending was also uplifting, due to being party invested in the main characters relationship them getting together was satisfying and very corny but it was a good cheesy ending.Overall, He's all that is far from a masterpiece. But nowhere near as bad as what people are saying. Despite being painfully predictable and generic, and adding nothing new to the genre. It is surprisingly watchable. Due to the films charm, chemistry between the leads and its self-awareness. I watched the film knowing exactly what it was going to be and who its target audience was, so I enjoyed it a lot more.Overall score 58/100.",He's All That
13,jakethesnake-42007,The absolute worst,1,29 August 2021,Words cannot describe how bad this film is. It shows you how awful movies are made now. The acting is down right awful but the leads are not really actors there tik tok stars. Overall it's a long tik tok commercial. Stick with the original.,He's All That
14,CriticsVoiceVideo,Heinous.,1,30 August 2021,Completely terrible from beginning to end. In every way possible.,He's All That
15,RealLiveClaude,Out of respect for Cook and Lilliard... please avoid if you have enough of cell cams,3,29 August 2021,"Though was pleased to see Rachael Leigh Cook (as a mom) and Matthew Lilliard (as a principal), the latters from the original ""She's all That!"" which I will always enjoy, unfortunately, seeing too much exposure from a teen girl from her cell phone to get popularity, until she makes this infamous bet to transform this stable boy into a cool guy, well, not my genre.Stick with the original, at least a rich guy gets out of his snooty entourage and get some life...(should have given one star, but seeing some nostalgia from Rachael and Matthew, as well as the red dress and the song Kiss Me in a different interpretation, boosted 2 more stars but that's how it goes...)",He's All That
16,supermaggie,"Not perfect, but entertaining",8,30 September 2021,"Yes, it is a teenie romance. Yes, it is less good than the original. Yes, Matthew Lillard is (as always) the best thing about it. Yes, it repeats the mistake of the original by (still) focussing on the looks. And Yes, yes, yes, Cameron never looked bad/looked a lot better with his long hair/long hair and glasses etc. Don't make you a loser. But they all do a solid job, it is nice entertainment for 90 minutes/I have seen much worse. And Addison/Padget is not so bad at all, I thought Rachael Leigh Cook was okay in the original and I liked the mother in the remake, but I did not recognize that it was Racheal playing the mother, this is how unique her looks/performances were/are in my eyes, therefore: you can not expect too much from teenie romances and their actors, just that you are having a good time watching it, and this movie fulfills this. No more, no less.",He's All That
17,Zedyeti,Dumpster fire,1,29 August 2021,Terrible acting and the whole social media reality show feel bs makes it worse. She's all that wasn't a good movie but compared to this it's Oscar worthy.,He's All That
18,funnycommentor,It's not that bad..,8,7 September 2021,"The plot of the movie was ok, the characters were basic, the casting was ok, the filming locations were basic. I have to admit that my expectations for the movie were low. Eventually it was good. Also, in my opinion Addison's acting was good. I agree that sometimes it was cringy and predictable.",He's All That
19,isaacochoterena,Too cliche,3,30 September 2021,"With a clichéd story this movie is bad, but it does have a few things to highlight.Although it develops a very predictable storyline, it manages to be attractive in the first half of the film, but as it progresses, it becomes tired and desperate. The remarkable things are the message you want to give about social networks and the falsehood that is in them, the good performance of Isabella Crovetti, how entertaining it can be at first, that shows the superficiality of people by pretending something they are not. There are many script holes, there is no chemistry between the protagonists, there is no explanation of why things happen, there are scenes that do not contribute anything to the story, just as there are characters that do not contribute much to the plot.The message can be contradicted at the end of the film and the main female character does not have a personal growth, which the male character does have but is more inclined towards his growth than how he shows himself to the world. It's just very predictable but at a certain point entertaining.",He's All That
20,ssvfolder-1,Watch the original,1,2 September 2021,"Awful main female lead acting and even more so, Awful modern teen culture. Main male lead is prettier than main female lead.This movie feels forced. Everything is off.Main lead is unattractive and can't act. At all. I think Paris Hilton was a better actress. The guy looks better even in his ""antisocial"" condition than her in her ""hot"" condition.There is a forced same sex love story that they put into the mix, but I guess it's just rolling with the ""woke"" times.Do yourself a favor and watch the original. Much better.Another flop by Netflix.",He's All That
21,witra_as,Failed gender-swaps remake,5,28 August 2021,Had low expectations but still disappointed with Mark Waters' gender-swaps remake. It tried to modernize everything into these whole 'gen Z' situations. Rae & Buchanan only got few decent moments to share their honest thoughts and awkward chemistry together.Watch it for Leigh Cook & Lillard's cameo here.,He's All That

23,ryanpersaud-59415,A 2021 Movie where a dance off to Macklemore's Dance Off happens.,2,2 October 2021,"The Good: Look, the worst movies are mediocre ones. Ones where they go into your eyes and out your brain almost immediately after you see them. Netflix has a lot of those. This is not one of them.The Bad: This may legitimately be a list of every aspect of film and filmmaking. I'm not joking. This movie is competently made; it's a movie with a plot that goes from A to B, it conveys information adequately and it looks (kinda) like a movie. Aside from that baseline, pretty much everything - the acting, writing, editing, cinematography, costumes, set design, dialog - is absolutely awful. I'll mention two things: Addison Rae is REALLY trying here, but for most of the movie she sounds like she's pitching an ad, not speaking to actual people. To be fair, most of the actors here are REALLY, REALLY bad. The other thing I'll note is how poorly the writers understand youth, and particularly,
internet, culture. Why would you even make this movie, if not to take the original story, but modify it for a new audience? They think they're doing it, but there's no explanation or representation for how this generation is different from the kids of the original. To me, that's such a missed opportunity.The Ugly: This movie is so insanely stuffed with brands, I almost couldn't believe it. Then I realized that maybe, just maybe, it was an inadvertent reflection of how seemingly half of all kids nowadays are intent in building a future via sponsorship by large corporations. Oh and Courtney Kardashian is in this. She's terrible. TRULY.",He's All That
24,boggie4758,Very Painful,2,1 September 2021,Oh goodness this was a painful watch. Where did these actors get their acting lessons out of a cereal box?..the best acting in this whole movie was Matthew Lillard and he was on for about 5min..Like some have said this was a major cringe movie. I cringed so hard my eyes went all wonky...terrible Netflix just terrible.,He's All That

26,benjamin-ensor,This generation is doomed.,3,4 September 2021,Rom com? Nope. The social media angle was a good idea but she tells everyone how 'fake' it all is at the end while she purposely films it for... social media.Guess it was never really going to point out how evil social media is with Addison Rae in the lead.

27,arod_85,Cheesey but the original wasn't any better,5,5 September 2021,"This movie is everything everyone is saying it is: cheesy, bad acting, poor plot, and lacking in comedy. I will say that Addison was surprisingly the strongest actor.

I know and God knows I do,1,31 August 2021,"Hundreds of drama school graduates struggle to find jobs during their first years in the industry and it's quite exhausting for them.Netflix, a goddamn huge streaming platforms could use their platform to help people who struggle BUT they don't. Instead they give huge roles to people like Addison Rae and the Damelio family.NO ONE CARES ABOUT THEM. They are NOT actors! Their acting skills are INADEQUATE!I'm sick of Netflix putting tiktok stars on upcoming movies/series such us the Hype House where they ACTUALLY CANCELLED GOOD TITLES, and this addison rae mockery moviethat's it. I'm done!",He's All That

30,risbyceonna,Alright,7,27 August 2021,I'll admit this movie did get a bit cliche at times but it wasn't bad. It felt like I was watching a Disney movie.

31,Healing_Process,"Sorry, I couldn't even stomach enough of it to give a good review",2,27 August 2021,"I personally could not even stomach more than maybe 10 mins of this to even give an in-depth review on what I saw. What I did see was weird camera angles, camcorder like saturation, over the top stereotype to the point of being uncanny and unrealistic, and an over saturation of Gen-Z Rebecca Black ""Friday"" type Preppy style that I could not swallow. Instead of watching a character that was that lifestyle, it felt more like an unnatural interpretation attempt at being Polly Pocket.I hope Netflix knows what this is or I am completely wrong and there is a demographic out there that I will never understand that will like stuff like this. Because this can't be good for business.",He's All That
32,CrazyCockatoo2003,"Just, obnoxiously unwatchable. Need I say more?",1,27 August 2021,"He's All That is the gender bent remake to the 1999 teen romance film film She's All That. While I personally thought the original was bad, this is so much worse to the point where it makes the original look like the Mona Lisa of cinematic masterpieces.To get the main point out of the way, everything this movie does differently from the original makes it a lot worse than it has any right to be, and anything this movie does to stay true to the original is made heavily inferior.I've also heard claims that it takes the sexism problem from the original and does a full on gender reversal of it, meaning the whole ""gender-swapped"" advertising from Netflix was mainly to pull a ""Ghostbusters 2016"" with it.What I hate about this movie is that it tries way too desperately to be hip with the youth, everything this movie tries to do feels so much more forced compared to the original, the acting is mediocre, the music choices are...eh, the whole gender-bent marketing thing feels more like false advertising as it is pretty much unnoticeable, there is so much product placement, none of the characters are even worth mentioning as they are all either unlikable or incredibly boring, and it just feels even more of a paint by number high school movie than the original to the point where it almost rivals ""F the Prom"".Oh, and one more thing. This feels like a MASSIVE 90 minute commercial for TikTok, considering they mention the app once, show off the app many times, Addison Rae (a famous TikToker), plays the leading role, and they do TikTok dances in the credits.The only redeeming qualities I can give for this is that there are a few decent throwbacks to the original, some of which require viewers to really think about it. Also, it at least does try to follow the main plot points present in the original, but that's not saying much. Also, even two of the actors present in the original reprise their roles as other characters throughout the film. Unfortunately, all this can't even save the movie, but it does save me from giving it a flat out 0/10.Overall, this has to be one of the worst Netflix movies I have seen since Thunder Force, and one of the worst remakes I have ever seen. It's so bad I tapped out about 30 minutes in and started fast forwarding it to find anything else I can find and rip apart. Just watch the original instead of this, I beg of you.",He's All That

However, other than the males best friend and sister whom I found annoying ; and the ending was rushed big time I liked it! I think it had the same charm as the original and prolly a even bigger point to make about life and how everyone is tied up in the social media aspect of it.I would say I think some was expecting this to be more PC and are upset that abcdefg wasn't represented in the movie and there was no Trump bashing like every other movie even horror ones in this.The main two characters did their jobs and Rachell and Mathew was awesome in what little time they had on screen. Characters from the original are represented in one format or another . There are a few extra and that is fine as well.",He's All That
35,lynansaysingle,That's all that.,5,3 September 2021,"I didn't expect much when I watched this except for knowing that it is a remake of ""She's All That"". So because of that I enjoyed it for what it was, a light entertainment. It is predictable I admit. You've seen one you've seen them all. I watched it because of Tanner as I am a fan of Cobra Kai series. I had no idea who Addison was. She acted like a typical influencer, all giddy. I appreciate the dance routine thrown in the movie. Adding a Kardashian in the movie is fitted as the main character is an influencer. It could have done with at least a couple known actors to help the movie. I agree with the others that Rachel should have played herself to associate that in the story, same goes for Matthew Lillard. They just wasted the potential of linking this to the original as a sequel instead of a remake. It might have made a better story. It is an average movie, one time watch only if you have nothing else to see.",He's All That

I liked all the teens except the main girl, very poor acting and her character was beyond ridiculous, nothing endearing or at least, she didn't sell it well. And I know they were trying to make her stand out and pay homage to the little red dress in the original film but why would they put her in red while everyone else is ""under the sea"" lol. The ending was the only good part, I enjoyed Matthew Lillard and the runner up prom queen but otherwise, movie was trash. Rachael leigh cook and Matthew Lillard deserved better.",He's All That
39,WhenAmyMetSalad,Could have been better easily could have been worse.,4,28 August 2021,So they had a huge missed opportunity bringing in TWO Alumni from the original into this remake. They could have easily made this a sequel and keep the characters from the original as cameos.This movie is not great nor is it terrible although one thing is that they made Addison the Star where she was easily the worst actor on stage.As a standalone movie this is decent but as something of a remake not so much. It should not have been a copy of the original twisted into this generation. We really didn't need a hot duckling being remade into a slightly more hot duckling just for social media presence. I feel like the main girl didn't really learn her lesson as things sort of fell in place for her. She still felt spoiled at the end just not with a lot of popular girl privilege to be stapled onto her life anymore.Watchable if you've run out of things to watch but the original is better even with its flaws and probably should be picked for movie night over this one.,He's All That

This is what I would like to call ""fake acting"" where the actors act as if they know they are 10/10 actors. Instead of actually practicing to become a 10/10 actor. Writing was atrocious.

44,DVK1234,Bad,4,30 August 2021,"This was bad. ""My mother died in a plane crash"". Cameron rides in to prom on a horse and just prior you hear the horse whinny. The dance off. Cameron's friend looks like a middle-aged housewife. The premise of Padgett wanting to make a nobody a star....a little tired. We've seen it before, and the original was a whole lot better. Worst of the worst acting by Addison Rae. I guess she only takes names that are a disease (get it? Addison, Paget)?",He's All That
45,S_dot_M_dot,It's All Just OK,5,5 November 2021,"In the days where social media influencers control everything, Padgett Sawyer (Addison Rae) is at the top of the food chain. After an untimely live feed, Padgett's life starts to spiral out of control. To help get her back on top, she decides to turn the school's social outcast, Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan), into prom king.Since this is a remake, the story isn't that original. The writing team did a good job of updating it and making it relevant for today's audience. The use of social media connects well with viewers. The sets throughout the film are what stand out the most in the production. The wardrobes, specifically for Buchanan, were another area of success for the film.The acting is bearable with some performances that stand above others. Buchanan and Rae have good chemistry throughout. Some bit parts worked well and moved the plot along as they were intended to. It was a nice touch to add Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard to the cast, even though they did not reprise their roles for the original film. As Principal Bosch, Lillard stole the show.This film could have worked under a different name if some tweaks were made. Some marks were missed throughout and minor adjustments could have helped this film. Nothing production wise really stood out. Unfortunately, this film feels like everyone was running through the motions to complete a film with no originality to it. Doing the social media framing device was clever, but it has also become redundant in today's films.He's All That doesn't bring anything new to the table, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it. There are well timed jokes, a sense of nostalgia, and some characters you can get behind. While it may not linger in your mind for days after viewing, you will have a good time watching it.",He's All That
46,JoelAlexanderr,A soulless cringe-fest created for rich white influencers,1,10 September 2021,"Auditions exist for a reason. We all know of them -- they're the process where the creators of a movie check to see if an actor actually has talent before casting them in a role. This is exactly what the creators of HE'S ALL THAT, a new Netflix high school rom-com, should have done before casting TikTok influencer Addison Rae in the lead role of their film. To be fair, Rae's casting in this film is the least of its problems, but it is still confounding that such a popular movie has such an uncharismatic and bland lead performance anchoring the story. With that being said, HE'S ALL THAT is a failure in almost every possible way. If a person above the age of 50 viewed this movie without any context, they would want to purge the entirety of Gen Z from the Earth after viewing. Not only is it awkward, cringe-worthy and painfully predictable, but it promotes a privileged, rich and LA-centric version of life that I wish would only be documented in a negative connotation.The film is a remake of the 1999 rom-com She's All That, except this film is gender-swapped and centers around a social-media influencer. Essentially, Padgett Sawyer (Addison Rae playing herself) must regain her social media fame when an embarrassing incident causes her to lose followers. In order to do this, she places a bet with her friend that she can make the biggest loser in the school to win prom king with her. After she chooses Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan), an old-fashioned guy with no social media presence who likes Bad Religion and Kubrick, thus begins a romance that everyone has seen a million times before except far better. I understand that rom-coms like this aren't supposed to be judged based on their predictability, but when during any point in the movie I found myself being able to predict beat-for-beat how the next few scenes would play out, I'd say there's a problem.The only things that weren't contributing to the mediocrity in this movie are Tanner Buchanan, Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard. The latter two are only present because they were in the original 1999 film, so it's only natural they're far better than the rest of the cast. Tanner Buchanan attempts to pull his own weight here (he was very good in Cobra Kai, the Karate Kid sequel show), but neither him nor anyone else can really do anything with the atrocious material they are given to work with. The dialogue here sounds like the wealthy L. A. screenwriter wrote it half asleep without knowing anything about public schooling and sent it to production without proofreading it. On top of that, the acting, for the most part, seems like a middle school play where the students are reading their lines straight from a piece of paper. The scenes near the end where characters have to get emotional are so badly acted that I laughed about ten times more than when the movie was actually trying to make me laugh.What bothers me about many high school movies that get greenlit recently is the focus on rich, white and affluent neighborhoods and an ignorance of the high school stories that are actually interesting. HE'S ALL THAT is that trend on steroids, to the point where the message of the movie involving influencers on social media is only relatable to those who have the time and money to indulge in this culture. The film seems like it was made for and by rich white people in Los Angeles, and seems to be a symptom of people like Addison Rae being able to do literally whatever they want with no consequences. The ultimate irony of HE'S ALL THAT is the fact that the message involves how influencers are more interesting and personable than the fake pictures they post online, yet this film is the most soulless and fake product from Netflix all year. Way to prove the haters right.HE'S ALL THAT is worth watching if you and friends want something to ruthlessly roast while eating snacks or doing something else that will require more of your attention. Other than that, I'd say this film is one to avoid unless you enjoy cringing for an hour and thirty minutes straight. Supposedly Addison Rae has a deal with Netflix to executive produce and star in at least three more projects, which sounds like the worst idea since producing a live-action version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats. Giving this movie money by watching it is the cinematic equivalent of driving an SUV and contributing to the destruction of the environment. For the love of God, buy an electric car instead.D-",He's All That

The inclusion of some obvious individuals were pointless and served no purpose And the one thing probably worse than the acting was the product advertising/placement, it was consistent all throughout. Oh yea and seriously the scene of her singing made my ears hurt.",He's All That

79,EdwardNashtonReeves,Exactly what one would expect for an updated remake of She's All That.,5,27 August 2021,"I do have some fond memories of She's All That, but I won't pretend like that film wasn't full of 90s cliches. Heck, it actually popularizes some of them. So, for a remake to be full of 2020 cliches, cheesy, and predictable wasn't exactly a big issue. The ''big difference'' is only a gender-swap between the leads. Now we have Padget (played by Tik-Toker Addison Rae), a popular girl who makes a bet that she could turn a nerdy guy Cameron (Tanner Buchanan) into a next prom king. If you've seen not only the original, but basically any rom-com in the last 30 years, you'll guess 85% of where this is going. Still, this sub-genre isn't exactly known for its creativity, no? It serves to shut your brain off for awhile and have fun. So, if you enjoy stuff like The Kissing Booth Trilogy, Tall Girl, or any of the Noah Centineo Netflix films, this will do. It's okay that it uses the social media concepts to update the plot, but it went too far in relying on it for my taste. The actors did fine for what they had to, and there is a nice moment or a funny joke now and then. It is still a predictable teen rom-com, so don't set your expectations too high, but it's not a godawful film either.",He's All That
80,mcgill_j,Not a zero flick.. But a real disgrace to the original.,3,28 August 2021,"I have no idea who this TikTok person is. But every single review mentioned her. And as someone who didn't know her? She's a horrible horrible actress. But beyond that? We really have a very shallow character that actually works hard to try and make her likable.. Or a real relatable person and succeeds at neither.I actually watched it for Tanner Buchanan who I really liked on ""Cobra Kai"". He's not a great actor either. But definitely better than this.I am not even a huge fan of the original. But the plot worried at least even though I still find the slam poetry scene cringy as hell. Unfortunately this film basically starts with that and never isn't cringy. Packed full of advertisments for everything under the sun.It's not even a bad idea over all.. but the other characters are just so dumb and even the progression is awful. It just stickers around. The main character should be shallow and even a bit unlikable but the film goes to lengths to make her like super awesome. Which is wrong and she can't pull it off anyway. They should have made her warm up and it never works.The one bright spot for me was the original cast members. It's just a brief appearance but still more acting than anyone else in this ""production"" put in.A real shame because the original wasn't spectacularly original but had such sweet and even genuine performances from actors who seemed like real people. Unfortunately none of the teen cast in this can make that claim.",He's All That

Every movie like this is corny and predictable lol. I feel like everyone really needs to lighten up and stop being such angry critics. If you're going into this expecting an Oscar winning film then that is your mistake right there. It's a fluff move just meant to make you smile. I thought it was adorable. None of these types of movies have the best or deepest acting skills but it was entertaining and really nicely updated to fit today's social media world. I'm a huge fan of the original and I was anticipating really hating this remake but I have to be honest I totally loved it. Good job on the story! My only critique could possibly be that everything felt a little sped up to fit into the short runtime of the film, but other than that a very cute movie.

94,whineycracker2000,Not All That,4,3 September 2021,"""He's All That"" had the ingredients and resources to be a good movie: a talented and vibrant cast, some catchy dialogue, moments of passable insight, and some relevant commentary about young people's unhealthy infatuation with documenting everything in real-time. But the film seems like it was edited by somebody with a serious case of ADHD and a million red bulls in their system.Why do studios do this? The movie clocks in at a scant 83 minutes, and it feels like it. Why couldn't they have taken another 10 to 15 minutes to allow our leads' romance to blossom a little more gradually? Or afforded these two charming actors an opportunity to establish a more graceful and organic budding romance? Or fleshed out a few of the supporting characters (there's a cute romantic subplot between Myra Molloy and Annie Jacob's characters, that thankfully doesn't beat the audience over the head with political correctness, that could have been given a little more screen time)? For a film whose theme is about ""being in the moment"", it could have at least followed its own advice.It's a major credit to stars Addison Raw and Tanner Buchanan (who reminded me a little of Ellar Coltrane's character in Boyhood) that they manage to create some semblance of chemistry in a film that gives them all of about 8 minutes to establish affection for each other. Raw and Buchanan are talented young actors who, like many, deserve projects worthier of their abilities.There's no arguing that ""He's All That"" is a terrible movie (along with the editing, the cinematography is also surprisingly sloppy and made for tv-ish). But it's terrible by design not accident. Director Mark Waters is no hack. The man responsible for directing 2003's remake of ""Freaky Friday"", ""Mean Girls"" and producing several quality films like ""500 Days of Summer"" has the rom-com formula down to a science, so my only guess is that studios don't have enough faith in the attention span of audiences anymore to let him see it through.This film needs a makeover more than our leading man did, but I enjoyed it anyway. I found the cameos by Mathew Lilliard and Rachel Leigh Cooke to be a nice touch and the prom dance sequence was equally as over the top, amusing, and as fun as in the original.I can't imagine that anybody is going into this film expecting a great, or even a good movie. Viewing the film is the equivalent of picking up a trashy tabloid magazine while waiting in line at the grocery store checkout line. It's a nice distraction, you get to look and scoff at a bunch of pretty vapid people and escape into some guilt-free indulgence after a hard day's work.

I picture my 14 year old actual teen in there trying to explain the audience to a bunch of old guys clapping themselves on the back and howling as they come up with such clever ideas as the bf turned ex getting caught in the act. NOBODY WILL SEE THAT COMING.However, seeing the turning of the tables of the beyond stale makeover trope had the potential to be refreshing. Lead guy being actually good at things rather than a ""loser"" was a good play. Him being pretty confident but uninterested in the superficial school atmosphere was less cringe than other standard plots.The idea that it was actually her that needed the makeover was well done.

The Bad: The product endorsements which obviously paid for the movie were so over-the-top that it takes you right out of the story and into one food commercial or another. Why after all these years some filmmakers can't figure out how to be a little subtle is baffling, or just tell their bankrollers that less is more when it comes to product placement.

Well, Addison as your lead role was already a complete failure of a movie even though she wasn't the worst thing of this movie, although that would be just about everything in it. I really thought Alden was gonna be a nice friend but they instead made her the bad guy which was horrifying and kind of poetic in the worst way possible . Don't even get me started on the terrible pacing and dialogue of this movie. Right after something happened it jumped right into another scene. People were talking 24/7, and I get its a movie, but the amount of dialogue is ridiculous. If your going to include tons of talking at least make it good writing and interactions. The acting was subpar at best and the plot of a girl betting on a guy to ""transform him"" feels like it's been reused so many times it's tiring. Matthew Lillard was easily the best part of this movie and he only had like 15 minutes of screen time. Quinn and Padgett's mom were the only other somewhat tolerable character's in this movie. Don't even get me started in that horrific what, 2 minute dance-off between the ""bad"" and ""good"" guys. There's also no one in their right mind who would forgive someone who only had romantic interest in them because of a bet in less than a day and act like nothing ever happened. Also riding in on a horse on school grounds doesn't seem like something that could happen . . . Ever. Not even in a damn movie if you want said movie to be good and not be considered a joke. Even the great Tanner Buchanan from Cobra Kai couldn't elevate this movie in any way, shape or form. The writing was just too awful and unbearable to work from the get go. This movie is so bad that it's funny, and that's the only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1/10 stars. Oh, and Addison, please just stick to your TikTok dances, it's whats in your best interests.",He's All That

160,tn-15978,I mean...I laughed...I guess.,4,17 September 2021,"Oh boy, there's a lot to unpack here. Let's lay our cards on the table, shall we? This movie was for me. I loved She's All That and know every line. We thought we were so cool and enlightened in our Williamson bubble of snappy and precocious teen dialogue. She's All That subverted expectations and convention with a no nonsense protagonist, sympathetic villains, a friggin awesome dance number, and our leading lady did NOT win the crown. Yes!I'm not saying the original is good, I'm just saying it's why I watched this movie, obviously. I put off watching this movie for a while. Look at the user reviews, the ratings, and the people involved, this was going to be a trainwreck, and to be fair, I'm not calling it a 'Little' trainwrech, but it did go off the rails a few times. I relented for a few reasons, morbid curiosity, nostalgia for RLC, and Lillard. I'm also a fan of Buchanan and his really good work in Cobra Kai, admittedly, that's his only work I'm familiar with. But that was it, otherwise, I only tuned in to validate my suspicions.This movie is bizarre, in the spirit of subverting expectations we went a little beyond gender swaps here in most places, in other places we stuck with it, we moved a couple of aspects around regarding the social economics structure, and have slightly fewer parents that exist in the teen comedy world. The bet is lame and doesn't pivot the action through the first plot point in an organic way, the antagonist is rotten and fails in comparison to an early career Paul friggin Walker!! (may he RIP). I'm sure most of the jarring oddities and forced dialogue was in context to my 1999 comparisons but I tried to watch this movie on it's face, which was just as hard even if it wasn't a a remake.Mark Waters directed this movie, he also directed Mean Girls...What?! How do you get so dispirit results from someone who obviously has an ear for the teenage voice, is this just about the script? The editing is all over the place and I felt like connecting story elements were deleted. Characters were in different places without transition or context and I was confused about the character's motivations a lot while watching this. We know the script is trash but that doesn't explain the direction, editing, production design, world-building, and continuity issues. At one point Buchanan busted out his greatest karate hits as well...for some reason. Why?! I make a mean banana bread but that doesn't mean it should be put into a scene, especially an important plot point scene that drives the homecoming king portion of the bet (that doesn't have nearly enough weight in this movie as it should BTW).But I laughed...I laughed at four places in this movie, I kept track. These were not internal chuckles or chortles as if to say, ""huh, how amusing"". I laughed out loud and couldn't help it. The jokes were all delivered by Buchanan. I know he is still relatively early in his career but I like him. I fear that he will fall into the same trap as Britt Robertson, falling for his own hype. He's not that good but he shines against his costars, which doesn't mean much with projects like this.This movie had all the same trappings as The Duff but not as good of a central underlying theme, which is inexcusable for an almost shot for shot remake. I found myself wanting to watch The Duff instead of this which is never good for the movie in question.If you watch this movie for Buchanan, I think he is doing just fine, if you're watching for an updated version of She's All That, just watch the original, even if you're not of that generation it will be what you're after if you're considering watching this trash. RLC's presence in He's All That is not worth it, Lillard cracks one funny joke, after that I felt like he had worn out his cameo welcome, the only constant underlying theme with respect to the entire cast of this movie...tragic.",He's All That

162,kayla-21836,Things were off,5,24 October 2021,"So based on what I heard, I knew it had its complaints and was apparently a crappy movie. I decided tho to watch it as a joke to see what Addison's character was like, and see how I'd think of the movie like If i'd agree with others or not before getting more spoilers. So I watched it...Watched it and my main issue is that the characters really lacked emotion so it was hard for me to feel bad for the them and you can tell who they're trying to make their character come off as, felt a bit like watching a school play in the front of the class. Then many of the scenes looked like they got filmed in only 3 attempts and this movie didn't remind me of high school at all, the party and prom give off too much rich, famous, modern vibes plus many of the actors looked like they were over 25.I will give it that the movie is still watchable because the scenes do switch up quick enough. The characters at least do move around a lot instead of sitting in the same spot talking to each other back and forth for several minutes in a blank background (which botherd me in many movies/shows.) And the plot doesn't spread any bad messages that I know of.So overal not terrible like I thought but you definitely will see some things off with the characters and plot.",He's All That

And all the product placement was distracting. Well... I actually think I enjoyed spotting all the items vs whatever the heck she was doing (it sure wasn't acting). She needs to stay in her tiktok world. No more tiktok movies please. Buchanan was okay (not exactly likable though) in his other Netflix show Cobra Kai but this just shows he isn't great at range. Or they just gave him cruddy directions and poor script notes. Either way, he never even looked like ugly duckling boy, instead they made him a little dirty but that's it. He mostly just had that deer in headlights expression when standing there. And I'm ashamed of Cook & Lillard who are legitimately good actors. What motivated them? Promises of gold and rubies?? Because after seeing this they've gotta be disappointed too. They aren't even the same characters - TOTAL MISSED OPPORTUNITY that would have made fans of the original at least a little happy.Overall, AVOID THIS ATROCITY!!

180,vmackey777,A shameless mockery of a classic teen rom-com,2,27 August 2021,"Everything for the eyes of a pretty rich girl. This is pretty much what I think when I saw this movie. There is so many talented artists out there, but for the remake of She's All That, executives has chosen privilege over artistic awareness. And by casting Ms. Addison Rae as their lead, they have sent a message: ""If you a rich and pretty, you will be given priority over other poorer artists."" This isn't new but this is also very sad. And that kind of choices have consequences.Here, we are talking about a dull remake with very questionable acting skills from the main actress. The thing with bad acting is this. Watching an actor embracing a character should give to the viewers an immersive experience: We forget that we are watching a character and we start to believe that we are watching real life people being filmed. When a bad actor tries himself in the production a movie, that immersive experience is ruined and instead, we realize that we are watching an actor painfully reading his/her lines. And this is exactly what one will experience by watching Ms. Rae on He's All That. You are not watching a character, you are watching someone 'trying' to be an actor in an average budget movie. And I hate to say that about a (wannabe/would be)actress, but the all thing smell 'fraud'.The silver lining is that the other professional actors did very well (and the difference is noticeable in every scenes) except from a cameo from a famous reality show contestant, that I won't spoil for you here if you are still interested in watching the movie. And it's always a pleasure to see Rachael Leigh Cook on screen, even though she looks way to young to be playing this lady's mother.The story is very typical and you couldn't do more cliché. But usually, with that type of predictable movie, there is always an element of charm to them. You know how it will end, but you appreciate the ride. We sadly do not get that here, apart from a few moments with Tanner Buchanan and especially Isabella Crovetti (the best actor here). The all thing seems a bit un-naturally manufactured, as if an AI had generated a movie by mixing and using all the elements that have been done in every teen rom-coms before it. The movie is also too fancy and clean whereas the original was a bit gritty in a few aspects. The humor also fall flat.I would have loved a good gender swap remake of She's All That as the concept wasn't a bad idea in itself. But I just wish Hollywood would drop the habit of privileging non-talented people to please the rich and beautiful who suddenly feel like they are actors, because they have money in their bank accounts (and because they said so), instead of choosing quality and talent. How many times have we seen privileged people steal the place of poorer better talents? A habit that I wish we would leave behind in 2021. I don't know much about her talents as a dancer though, and maybe she's very good at that, but Addison Rae simply isn't an actress.I am putting a 2/10 for Isabella Crovetti, but there is not much else here.",He's All That

212,juliafotvag,Too much credit given to Addison,6,31 August 2021,"You propably clicked on this review expecting a bitter and harsh review (the six stars give it away never mind). But I'm not gonna give it.I honestly rate movies depending on how entertaining they are and this one was honestly pure caffeine for my soul.Now, the acting wasn't great, I'd say it was Disney Channel level (Kourtney is on a whole nother level tho). Addison was definitely, not bad, but is that enough for such a high production movie? However I feel like even with a different actress, the movie would still be kinda the same.Really I haven't seen anyone say this but the actual problem is the writing. The characters have the emotional depth of a chicken nugget and they pretty much have zero development throughout the movie. It is reminiscent of the good ol' 2000s' but not in a good way.On another note, the soundtrack was good, Addison and Tanners' chemistry was great and some scenes were definitely funny.Lastly, I think many would enjoy this movie going into it just for their monthly cheesy and cringy shot of energy.

And it got worse, when they gave a Kardashian screen time. The plot was sonsense, this Tiktop crap get's shoved down the viewers throat. So many ""followers"" will watch it just for Addison/Kardahian - it's just sad. Comedies/teen movies are just not the same anymore.The movie seemed more like a parody than anything else.

I went into this saying I'd give her a chance, just to see how she did (even though acting isn't just something people can do, let alone do well, without experience, training, and talent).But it is honestly a shame they cast her. She is purely presentational, trying to ""act"", but it's surface and superficial, what a person with no experience believes acting to be.Because of this, and her being the lead, she basically brings down the entire film, and it makes it very difficult to enjoy, despite the rest of the film having all the other elements to be a guilty-pleasure.",He's All That

The amount of smiling and white teeth (nothing wrong with good dental hygiene, it just comes across so unnatural on ALL the smiling she does) that the male female lead does, I'm surprised her jaw/cheeks didn't hurt. It hurt to watch. The supporting characters seemed to carry the story the most, but the unrealistic story line and personalities are troublesome. If anything, this seemed to just be a platform for the lead female to cast a few minutes of fame on the select few talents she does have; note its not acting. Please don't wast time. Its not even the kind of movie that turns into a cult favorite. This turns into the 'wtf were they thinking' pile that is sadly kept in the back of some dusty old closet.",He's All That
225,camille-18008,It started as a movie and ended up as a Lele Pons-type of skit,3,5 September 2021,"Lemme start by saying something crazy : I don't think Addison Rae is a bad actress. Is she at the level of Viola Davis or Julianne Moore ? Absolutely not. But in my opinion, she did alright (not great but alright), the movie was just poorly written. It started off not so bad, but then it just when south. I don't think the makeover was that bad. Yes, the guy was already hot before it, but so was Laney in the original movie, let's not forget about that. The real problem was how terrible the script was : the pacing was terrible, the situations were cringe, the product placements were so obvious, the movie could have just broke into an advertisment, it wouldn't have changed anything and the dance battle was just... diabolical,100% of pure cringe juice. The guy playing the popstar was just....... No ? Tanner Buchanana has no acting range and was monotone and emotionless the whole time. Madison Pettis.... what was she doing here ? She needs to get booked for real movies ASAP. Isabella Cramp was probably the best actress (and a great one) in that movie. She's only 16 but I think she can go far into acting. Addison wasn't so bad but... Maybe she should take acting lessons ? To go from average, to good ? At least she did better than the D*melio sisters.In conclusion, to my very very long review : Don't watch that movie. It's a waste of time. Isabella Cramp could have saved it if she had more screentime than Tanner Budapest. The scriptwriter needs to go to their room and think about what they've done. Netflix ? You need help.",He's All That

But i also think she can do better than this as an actress, but she needs to try harder.The rest of the actors were fine from my opinion.Idk what to say, this movie isn't actually that bad if you think about it.

I'll never understand why he took on this role other than in an attempt to get Gen Z's attention. I hate his character in Cobra Kai but there's no question he's a great actor (and pretty to look at).

265,Movie_isa,Not as bad as some of the reviews claims.,6,27 August 2021,"Let's start with the basics: The acting isn't perfect but it's not that bad, it's even great at times. I've seen a lot of hate towards Addison Rae and her performance but honestly she's doing a solid job through most of the movie, with some weaker moments but what did you expect. The production is smooth as in the story actually makes sense which in and of itself is more than could be said about some movies in this realm and the quality is better than I expected. The writing is solid and more importantly, the dialog actually feels natural for most of the movie. Which, again, is more than can be said about other similar movies.I never liked the original, always finding it too shallow and without any real depth. While this movie isn't the Mariana trench, it's at least a stream and not a puddle. The lead more so learns to embrace herself and falls in love with the guy for his personality and what he brings out in her rather than for the ""makeovered"" version she creates of him. (although, of course she finds the more put together, styled version more physically attractive, which isn't a weird thing. That's true for any and everyone. Humans prefer other humans who look put together, that's just how it is). Also, her qualms about her friends picking him for the bet isn't that he's ugly (as is supposed to be the case in the original) but rather because he is socially undesirable at school, constantly clashing with the popular kids, which will obviously get in the way of the popular vote for prom king.All in all, it's not an amazing movie but it managed to do what the original did not but movies like this should i.e. Make me feel good and as such it's a good update for the original. Now, the original has NOT aged well at all and this one maybe won't do any better in that department but then again it's solid enough now that I can't be mad at it.",He's All That

We know who sponsored this movie and the production. Anyone watching this, they are making money off you.

But only for like 3 or 4 of the actors.To start off, there was WAY too much music used for unnecessary reasons that I can't even begin to imagine why. Like it wasn't even good soundtrack music. If there was music playing in the background of a character doing something, such as a kiss, I would expect not ""in your face"" fast paced music. I would expect slower and I guess quieter paced music. Some made sense but others? Not really.Secondly, I'm a sucker for romcoms, right? The original was a romcom. This one? Not really. There was maybe one funny part about the whole movie. They tried but it was a valiant effort that just came short.Third, I'm so beyond disappointed in the casting. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt at first but I don't like the acting like at all. The only actors that I could really lose myself in were Tanner Buchanan, Madison Pettis, Isabelle Crovetti, and of course the original actors that were present. It was painfully obvious that Addison Rae was acting for one. There were others as well but as the main character, I expected more. I wanted to get lost in it but I just couldn't because you could tell it was scripted.As a remake? This movie was absolutely butchered. However, if you think about it as it's own movie and you go into it expecting a ""Netflix cheesy movie with bad acting"" you might get more what you're looking for. I was so beyond disappointed because the original is one of my favorite movies. I knew going into it that it wasn't going to be the original but I wanted to like it.I'm only leaving it as 3 stars because of the original stars and the fact that Tanner Buchanan really gave me the Laney vibe I wanted so desperately to see in his character. He really did an amazing job and bringing his character to life. I also really liked how Madison Pettis brought the Dean Sampson vibe back. I mean, she truly made me not like her character. Isabelle Crovetti also did a great job as being the little sister. And I truly wish I could've wanted to react the way she did at the end of the movie.",He's All That

The best part of the entire thing was the ending with Matthew Lillard and Rachel Leigh Cook when there was slight references to the superior and iconic original apart from the god awful remix of the song 'Kiss Me'. If anyone hasn't seen that one, I suggest watching it and blocking out any memory of this film ever existing. There are many things to note about this movie but to cut it short, it's another cringey tween Netflix movie. I wasn't planning on watching this film as I could tell from the trailer alone that it wasn't worth my time but I did just to make my review that much more honest and reliable.

I didn't know the main girl was Addison Rae until I googled the cast cause I'm not a fan of tiktok. The first 10 minutes of the movie were somewhat enjoyable cause the main guy in the movie was wearing band T's like the stooges and dressed like a cool guy who was into photography. BUT OH WAIT!!!! In some cultures these days you are apparently a loser if you have long hair, wear beanies, are introverted, listen to ""old music"" and don't have a massive friendship group .

The soundtrack sucks except for one song. What made this movie unforgettable for me was how funny it was. The.....everything, mainly the writing and acting, was the funniest stuff I've ever seen. I had an absolute BLAST. It is a miracle that something can fail so hard in literally EVERY aspect. If you like bad movies like I do, you will enjoy it a lot.

It's a teen romance so I wasn't expecting much but I actually enjoyed the performances and the story development. Even that random TickTock chick gave a pretty solid performance which I wasn't expecting. I don't like tiktok- I think it's pretty cringe but I have to be fair in saying her acting skills are fine. I'm not the most sentimental person but there were a few scenes that actually got me going ""awww that's actually pretty sweet and heartwarming"". And some of the jokes and lines delivered were pretty funny and clever. The script writer was the same writer for the original ""she's all that"" so at least there is some consistency in the quality of storytelling. It was also nice to see Rachel Leigh Cook and Matthew Williard again albeit in different roles. Matthew was pretty funny as always. And Tanner Buchanan gave an impressive performance. Id say the one scene I didn't like was the dance scene at the prom. Honestly, the dance scene from the original was much better.

I was surprised they had a variety of actors and actresses. The acting was good, the script was good - I actually laughed out loud a few times. The characters each had unique personalities. I did cringe at the dance scenes and a moment at the end when Cameron comes riding up to the high school on a horse. At least they showed a truck and horse trailer in the background so it seemed more believable cheesey in that moment.I think the 1 star reviews are incredibly unfair and perhaps only so because of 'tiktok' hate. I'm in my 30's and looking at this objectively I would normally rate it a 6. Pleasing, cutesy, teen rom com. I would even watch it again.

The cast of the original was the only thing it had going for it. The remake suprisingly has a better setting.The post ""family vaule 98"" MTV generation period was a weird backdrop for the original. Making it flat, cynical, mean-spirted, and just kinda lame.Setting the remake in the tik\tok- instragam generation actually made for a more interesting backdrop and plays to being a character itself \story device (and an effective one) for the netflix remake.

People need to understand that 90's have passed. This movie wasn't made for those who liked the original one, but for teens who watch netflix. And, in this days, tiktok and other social medias are what they like, that's simple. I'm a nostalgic too - I watched She's All That because of this, not because it's a masterpiece - but I try to forget nostalgia when I'm watching a high school movie from 2021.I could give it a 7, even an 8, but what did they do with Kiss Me exceeded the limits of my goodwill.

The main character is supposed to seem redeemable but I'm not seeing much improvement. The acting in this movie is absolutely horrible. It makes it hard to even make it through the entire movie. Tiktokers and influencers are not meant to act! Most importantly, the Kardashians are not meant to act! And I'm assuming the karaoke and cringey dance off was only in there to show off Addison's ""talent"" since she is a dancer on TikTok. Skip it.",He's All That

325,ginormousfishstick,Infomercial & Inexperience,1,30 August 2021,The potential for nostalgia fooled me with a couple of actors from the original movie.

With this, i'm not sure if it was because of the movie script or just the acting performances in general.Overall, I'm glad I watched ""He's all That"" to see what it was about, but I probably wouldn't watch again.Please thumbs up!",He's All That

I truly don't understand all the hate this movie is getting! It was a really cute Gen Z retelling of a classic movie! Of course it wasn't like She's All That, things change in 22 years believe it or not! There were awesome cameos (RLC and Matthew Lillard), cute homages to the original (the jerk best friend, the spunky little sister, the dance off, the ""why do I know this song?"", etc.), and typical Gen Z social media material.I really DO NOT understand why everyone is hating on this so bad. Addison Rae was endearing and adorable, Tanner Buchanan was an awesome lead, and all the rest of the characters were believable.In my opinion, if you're a true She's All That fan, you should appreciate this.

I , as sb who hates romcoms and isn't a particular fun of any of the actors who partaken in this one, didn't find it terrible . It was another romcom with its cheesy / ""been there done that"" moments like most Netflix's shows. Addisons acting was not at all bad . It wasn't Oscar worthy , but I didn't cringe , yeah she needs vast improvement if she's gonna follow a career in acting (which I presume she won't) but it's not like I wish it had been anyone else but her, in her place . Lastly , i feel like the hatred is mainly directed and coming from Addison being in it. Say what you want to say about other worthy actors who don't make it far in the industry, despite having talent, cause people like Addison who don't deserve it , take roles just cause of their following and name (and ure valid) , but the girl is succeeding , she's just branching out and making money. Y'all don't have to be happy for her , but it's not her fault she's given so many opportunities because of TikTok fame. What would y'all do if u were in her shoes ? Say nope thanks I don't wanna do acting , even if I find it interesting , cause I'm from TikTok?????

I watched the original, and I must say I loved it, and as for this film, I must say it's in the middle, it's not good nor bad, I appreciate the actors and the crew on this film, they have worked hard for this, as for Addison I think she did pretty well, it's not bad and good, she just portrayed it on what she was given and she did her best to portray her character, and as for Cam, I must say he has the best acting in these.

366,ashdownmason,This film is a mess.,2,5 September 2021,"The film is bad in so many different ways, number one acting is awful on the behalf of Addison Rae, it was so bad to point I was cringing the hole time. There were certain moments where the acting and the editing combined was a complete mess for example, there was a scene where Addison Rae was talking to her friends and she hasn't even moved her mouth but she still spoke. In addition the scene where Addison was handing out leaflets she put her arm in to pick up the leaflets but never actually picked one up and just moved her arm out in motion of handing a leaflet out when she didn't even pick one up and that happened 3 or 4 times within the space of a minute. The second reason this film is awful was because of the editing / camera work, the camera work and editing was unimaginative and simple boring to the point where it kept cutting from person to person in conversation making it very boring and not visually eye appealing and if I'm being honest it looked plain lazy! The third thing was the plot , the plot to the story was so bad and cringy and that's all that need so be said about the plot. So overall I gave this a 2 because although it's awful and I don't like it it isn't fair to give a 0 out of 10 or 1 out of 10. The last thing that needs to be said it that people only watched this either because they knew it was gonna be bad or to watch Addison Rae which in my opinion was the worst part of the film.",He's All That

I don't like the Tik- Toker in the movie, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. Here are my ratings:
1- The actors. 10/10 they are very good at acting.2- The storyline. 8.5/10 it's a good storyline but
confusing.3- The drama. 100/10 amazing there's so much
drama!4- How long the movie is/ the time. 10/10 perfect
normal time for a movie.5- The plot twists. 5/10 not that many but still
remotely good.",He's All That

However this film outraged me enough that I just have to publicize my opinion if I am to survive the cringe I've been afflicted with. Don't waste your time on this so called movie. If you are a nostalgic soul looking for a nice romantic comedy like the ones filmed in the 90's, just skip this move. The movie is so cheesy and at times actually painful to watch. Shallow dialogue, bad storyline, excruciatingly painful acting. Well, that's to be expected when you cast a TikTok star. She is likable but not really good at acting.Pleased I don't want Mention the male actor, who casted him??? It was so painful to watch him on the tv I actually felt a couple of my brain cells dying while watching him ""acting"".in my opinion, you can find better acting in the cheapest Mexican, Turkish or any low badges soap. Why even waste money to make a movie like this one? And please let me mention the final scene. **spoiler alert*** him in the schoolyard on a freaking horse dressed as a semi cowboy.... I felt my stomach turn and had the urge to Vomit. The Most cheesesst, dull scene I've ever watched. I can still feel my eyes burning, lord please let me forget this movie.

I'd probably give it a 7/10 but I don't think the movie deserves a 4.4/10 which is what it's at right now lol so that's why I rated it a 10! Worst part of the movie was the super cringey dancing. Also the part at the end with the horse was super ridiculous as well.

I'm loving the idea of reboots becoming a thing but can we do it right and not make it overly cheesy? The concept is silly enough it doesn't need more cheese. Was I entertained? Somewhat.

The truth is, it didn't have great source material. The original was....not a good movie to begin with. It's a tired storyline which we've seen in different forms from Cinderella to DUFF, ect.Sure, the product placements and celebrity camos are annoying, but that's not what makes this movie mediocre. Still, all these one star reviews are just a bunch of people who want to hate on a TikTok star.Is Addison going to win an Oscar for this? No. Absolutely not. But this is a rom-com, a cheesy, over the top, rom-com.It's a fun watch after a long day, nothing too serious, and has some light-hearted laughs.

And if you watch Cobra Kai, you'll probably be a fan of her male counterpart as well.Overall it was very easy to watch and not too cringe.The fact that this is my first review in my 10+ years of being an IMDB subscriber is a testament to how the film was more average than awful.Normally I'd rate it between a 5&6, but I'm giving it an 8 to boost the average.People love to hate.",He's All That

But, I was thinking why not just make a sequel with all the original actors from the original film (minus Paul Walker RIP). Like Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) and Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) could still be together and maybe be married and have a couple of kids running around.

It was a fine movie, but never one that I held in any particular reverence. This movie was pretty much what it claims to be, in all regards, and if you set your expectations properly before ever hitting play.Cons: Maybe there's no avoiding it, but influencer culture is so depressing, so I hated that aspect of the movie; I hate that aspect of modern society, too, so that was never going to be a win for me.Pros: Tanner Buchanan is really growing as an actor, and I hope that he continues getting roles, and catches the attention of casting directors outside of the scope of Netflix. I liked him in Cobra Kai, but thought his acting there was a little forced, and lacking; I was pleasantly surprised with his performance here! Seriously... a lot of growth, and I will be glad to see him continue to get roles.Also... the addition of Rachael Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard, plus the Sixpence None the Richer song ""Kiss Me,"" was a bit of fun for watchers of the original film. Found myself feeling more nostalgic than I expected, and that's from someone who, as I mentioned before, was not really a huge fan of ""She's All That"".This movie hits the marks/checks the boxes, if you're expecting a teen rom com, and not a Scorsese movie.

Myra Molloy was another gem of an actress, but sadly wasn't given more screen time.The story definitely had potential, but it was hard to watch the leading actress flounder through scenes with no emotion. Very green, lacks acting skills and direction. Then the male antagonist horrible from the costume to the line delivery ick. Shame because I've seen the actor's work and he is definitely talented. The characters weren't developed enough, but given it's target audience is that of teens it sufficed.I absolutely had a soft spot for the original so I had high expectations for this one.

Don't get me wrong it's still a generic bad Netflix rom-com, but it did have it's moments (like basically everything Matthew Lillard's character did in the ending). Cam's character (played by Tanner Buchanan) was actually much better than I thought he'd be, he was surprisingly well written for a movie like this, and I actually related to him at times. Addison's character on the other hand was as generic as you could get in a movie like this, and even though you can tell she tried, she wasn't a very good actor at all, looking out of place in almost every scene she was in. I think one of the main problem of this movie is how cliche and predictable it is. I played a little game where I tried to guess what would happen next, and every single thing I guessed came true, the story is the exact same one we've seen in other Netflix teenage romance movies, and the ""villian"" is about as shallow as you can get. Overall it's a 6/10, and I'm only rating it positively because of a certain character or two that were great to watch.",He's All That

Sure, the acting was pretty bad, the camera angles were a bit wonky, and it all seemed too cringe to handle, but then again, Addison Rae isn't known for her acting skills. She's from Tik Tok, that's all I know her from so it's not like she was meant to have (good) acting experience. Besides, if you were given the opportunity to act in a movie or a TV show, whether you didn't have good acting skills or not, you'd take it, right? Think about that for a minute before hating on Addison. Plus, I bet you couldn't have done any better at acting, so don't even. Of course, the movie could have been way better, especially since the genre was comedy and romance. The awkward teen romance wasn't captured as well as it should have but I did enjoy the movie, if I'm being honest. Definitely not my favourite or close to my favourite movie, but it's its own.... thing. I liked it, won't be watching again though. Sorry not sorry. THIS IS MY OPINION. Now shut up and scroll down.",He's All That

Critically this movie is one of the worst ones I've seen so far. I was cringing at every single line/monologue and the acting wasn't natural at all. The biggest reason that made me dislike this movie was that we NEVER saw a character development! The movie had its ""bad guys"" but we never saw them growing up, which wasn't realistic or instructive.(The movie gave watchers a thought of social media being the inly thing teenagers/influencers love and even when social media is a big part of their lives, it shouldn't have brought up in a shallow way.)But I liked how modern it was, although it wasn't executed well, but we got the idea.

""He's All That"" Review: Addison Rae should stick to dancing, not actingNetflix's new rom-com ""He's All That"" is the gender-bent remake of the classic 1999 hit ""She's All That,"" starring TikTok influencer Addison Rae.Katy Perry karaoke pool parties and ""Drop it like F. Scott"" Great Gatsby birthdays are just the start of the over-the-top elements incorporated in Netflix's new original movie, ""He's All That.""""He's All That"" is the gender-bent remake of the classic 1999 hit ""She's All That,"" and just another example of a cliché teenage rom-com revival that didn't need to be made in the first place.The story follows Padgett Sawyer (Addison Rae), a social media influencer from California, on a mission to regain her followers and sponsorship money after an embarrassing video goes viral of her walking in on her cheating boyfriend. She makes a bet that she can win back her reputation by building a new prom king ""it"" boy, in loner Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan).Essentially, the plot follows the same basic story line of every coming-of-age movie - a popular conceited high school student resolves a problem by giving a makeover to an outcast and uses them for their own personal gain.The two leads fall in love, bonding over the loss of Cameron's mother and his love for photography. Once again, we have another teen movie involving a tragic backstory death of a parent. To no one's surprise they fall in love, but their bliss is derailed when Cameron finds out about the bet. They fight and then inevitably make up once Padgett apologizes with a long speech about her insecurities.The only true difference in this film compared to other rom-coms is that instead of using real actors, TikTok star Addison Rae plays the protagonist. Her performance should be off the charts considering she basically plays her real-life self, however, that isn't the case. In truth, by casting Rae, Netflix has made it clear that anyone with money can be on TV and has taken roles from countless talented actors.Tanner Buchanan's performance is better in his role as the mysterious loner transformed by Rae into a gorgeous pretty boy. However, the ""makeover"" really only consisted of a haircut, which in my opinion didn't need changing in the first place.The magical makeover is a far too common trope for movies and TV shows. While it may be entertaining to watch the characters get spruced up, it reinforces the idea that acceptance from others solely comes from looks.In other un-shocking news, ""He's All That"" incorporates way too many current references, with conversation overloaded with talk of social media followers, duck faces, livestreaming and internet memes. This obliterates the element of a timeless movie feel and can only be enjoyable to a 14-year-old Gen-Zer.This movie chooses to promote spoiled teenage rich kids who live in fancy mansions and wear expensive and frankly unattractive clothing. Even the food consumed is extravagant, from red cherry pop rock mocktails to almond flour croquembouches.On a more positive note, besides Rae, the acting isn't terrible. There are actually a few stars that make an appearance and a few newcomers who had a solid performance. Rachael Leigh Cook from the original film plays Padgett's mother. Matthew Lillard plays the school principal and, with his 10 minutes of screen time, has better acting skills than Rae during the entire movie.Of course, no Netflix film is complete without a guest appearance by a random unneeded celebrity. In this case, Kourtney Kardashian plays Rae's wealthy sponsor.There is also a pretty diverse soundtrack with the songs ""For A Minute"" by WizTheMC and ""Kiss Me"" by Sixpence None the Richer. This song parallels the original ""She's All That,"" as it was used in both ending scenes.I was excited to see some former Disney actress familiar faces, such as Madison Pettis from ""The Game Plan"" and ""Cory In The House"" and Peyton Meyer from ""Girl Meets World"".My expectations for ""He's All That"" were extremely low, and they weren't exceeded. I did, however, find myself laughing out loud at some cringey scenes and enjoyed a few heartfelt moments from the side characters.Hiring Rae inevitably forces viewers to focus solely on her indecent acting, and turns the movie into a joke. The only thing worse than unprofessional acting is an unnecessary and random dance off - even if Rae and Pettis' dance off was pretty solid choreography wise.If you're looking for a movie to watch, I would recommend this film but for all the wrong reasons. The plot is more comical than the actual jokes. Instead of being let down by another failed movie remake, stick to watching the original ""She's All That,"" and enjoy a '90s throwback filled with nostalgia.",He's All That

501,rosemaryapolinario,it's a no,2,27 August 2021,To keep to short and simple it was a no. Addison honestly just played herself and she still couldn't pull it off. The moviewas just shallow and overplayed. The camera work was also bad I'm guessing they tried to do hand held and failed. The soundtrack sounds like it was taken from all the songs on 2020 tiktok they only original song they kept from the original was kiss me and they still managed to ruin that absolute work of art. Only thing good was Matthew Lillard and he barely had any scenes. But hey claps to Addison for trying. I feel like remakes of original movies always turn out badly but this one was just on a whole other level. The 1999 version is wayy better so I encourage people to watch that one instead.,He's All That

Absolutely 150% NOTHING even close to the original, but are we really surprised? Lol. I tried going into this with high spirits considering She's All That is my mom's favorite movie, but sigh. Not worth wasting an hour and a half of your life. Go watch the original.",He's All That
527,aubreyelise-48998,Acting,10,27 August 2021,Good acting especially since a lot of the cast has little to none acting experience.,He's All That
528,filipatlima,do not recommend watching,2,27 August 2021,"Im only giving it 2 stars because Tanner and the cameo actors from the original 1999 movie had a good acting performance. Addison Rae is a girl with many talents but I don't think acting is one of them, at least not for now. The writing was not good, they were trying too hard to be relatable to gen z. Everybody knows that 90's and 00's are making a comeback, so I advise to try and keep it more similar to that kind of style.",He's All That
529,wavyboyyyl,Hold this L,1,27 August 2021,By far one of the worst constructed movies I've seen in 2021. The acting was horrendously terrible it seemed as if there were no real actors and it was this little forced gimmick trying to be pushed off as a romcom. In conclusion easily one of the worst movies of this year but didn't really expect anything from it going into it.,He's All That

The main character girl can't act to save her life. But I guess her friend Kourtney Kardashian pulled some strings and bought her the role. The movie is incredibly predictable and extremely boring. I'd rather be stuck in a room watching all 3 movies of The Kissing Booth on repeat, than ever having to watch ""He's All That"" again. ""She's all that"" was such a good movie but this remake was atrocious.",He's All That

I was seriously hoping this would be good because I loved original one so much. There are only 3 things that made this movie somewhat not totally horrible, so that's why I gave 3 stars. The OGs Rachel Leigh Cook and Matthew Lillard, and Tanner Buchanan because he's a cutie. Addison Rae cannot act. She needs to stick to her tiktok dances! Oh and why in THE HELLO would they ever think Kourtney K can act? I would rather have my entire body sawed off than to watch another Kardashian speak words.",He's All That

Five minutes into the movie I was beyond frustrated; who is this female lead and why do her acting skills remind me of a local waitress auditioning for a milk ad in the 1960s? Then I looked the cast and boom, it all made sense. I should've expected nothing less. This movie had all the aspects of an unrealistic, poorly written, amateurish, predictable, high budget but with untalented casting staff movie. What's the point of saturating a movie with famous actors for views? Unfortunately I'm unable to regain the hour and half I wasted clenching my jaws, awkwardly glancing at my imaginary friends around the room as I react to every minute that passes of this movie.

""He's all that"" is literally the cringiest movie I've ever watched. The acting is also the worst, especially Addison Rae's.

IDK what it was about the movie but something about it felt really cringe to me as well. Overall the movie was sub-par, but it's a shame because I loved the original :/",He's All That
550,alwedalabduljader,IGNORE THE HATERS,10,28 August 2021,I think the movie was great it's more of a fun summer teen type of movie where u can watch w friends/sisters very creative and realistic by generation and I'd say most ppl who hates it are either too old no offense or haters of Addison Rae and tiktokers/tikok. The movie was fun to watch and the acting of Addison is GREAT I really really do see her in more roles in the future and that was only her first movie and she already did amazing.,He's All That
551,miamonique,Cliché Movie That Needs Better Acting,5,28 August 2021,"Addison's acting wasn't spectacular, but for her first role I think she did okay. You can tell she was really trying to embody her character, so I applaud her for that. I think with some proper training she could be decent.Tanner's acting was better than the rest of the cast and in my opinion, I think this movie was a little bit immature for him. I've seen his other performances and he can act pretty well. He pretty much carried the entire movie.Overall it was an alright movie. It was cute, cliché, and definitely guided more towards young teens. If you don't like typical teenage high school movies, then stay away. The predictable storyline combined with the ""eh"" acting would probably make this a rough watch for you. But if you do like clichés, then this movie would be decent for you.",He's All That

Bad acting except for the 2 original actors from She's all that, by the way that was the only reason I watched this movie. Addison Rae doesn't know how to act, honestly they could've hire a real actress. I strongly recommend the original 1999 film, trust me it won't disappoint, one of my favorite 90s films.",He's All That
563,silmizafira,Cringe ft influencers,1,28 August 2021,I feel bad for tanner because he deserved better co-actors.

With Tanner in the cast, I expected the final dance-off would include him, but no, and you'll know why if you watch it! And, the most basic thing that this kind of movie should have is the spark between the couple. There. Is. None. Man! Why did you agree to be in this project, Tanner?",He's All That
569,kittenxannie,Could've been done better,7,28 August 2021,"If anybody had high expectations for this let me start by saying that's probably the reason you've rated it so low.Considering this is supposed to be a comedy/romance for teens around the ages of 13-18 I don't think it's terrible.It's got some unrealistic scenarios that I don't think would ever occur but then again so does every single movie ever (arguably).And especially for young teenagers I think it's a great message
Padgett was lying about herself to her friends and to her fans and she gained popularity and money to support her mother and herself doing so, so even though the outcome of what she was doing wasn't harmful to anybody, it was harmful to her because she wasn't being herself.I do agree that the way this movie was filmed and edited is cringeworthy, and quite predictable but it's aimed at a younger audience, half of them only watching the movie because Addison Rae is in it.To conclude I don't think it's terrible but it could have been way better executed than what it is, but overall I personally enjoyed it.",He's All That

There's a lot of things they did wrong and I feel bad for the actor that plays Cameron who had to try and force chemistry with a lead who has no clue what's she's doing and to have to carry the movie. The scene that displayed acting like I have never ever seen in my life is after the Cameron makeover & before the reveal. Literally the lead ""actress""/not an actress must of read the script's notes: ""Cameron enters room and his handsome face takes Padge's breath away."" In that scene she is literally panting when she see Cameron's newfound hotness. To be fair, my pug pants real hard like that when I come out of the bathroom too. I thought maybe I missed a scene where she was doing aerobics for a bit before he came out of the bathroom but no, that's just how she played it.. Interesting interpretation I guess.Then a Kardashian shows up. Doesn't even matter which one, they are all the literal worst.Like, why Netflix? Why do you hate us?Rachael Leigh Cook and the 2 minutes of Matthew Lillard was Netflix's apology to the viewer's for the rest of the film.I could watch those two in anything.They really should of just done a geriatric remake and brought back Freddy and they could of just read lines from the original movie.

It seemed as if this movie was more for product placement and to sell products. Addison Rae already does this in her daily life, didn't need to make it into a movie! Addison Rae, the acting skills are horrible. I'm not trying to be mean or rude but the only reason why she got a roll to begin with is because she's TikTok famous! It felt as if I was watching a 1 hour and 30 minute TikTok video! Not everyone that becomes famous due to social media should be a senior actor. It seems that everyone is transitioning into that, I believe everybody is good at some thing. But not everybody should go into things like that because it does not work out for them. Overall this movie was so bad and the fact that some actors from the original ""She's All That"" are in this reboot/remake but they had nothing to do with their roles from the original.

596,ellewylie,Disastrous,1,29 August 2021,"He's All That (2021) is a gender-swapped remake of She's All That (1999) that follows social media influencer Padgett (Addison Rae) as she attempts to find her way back into the spotlight by making over the grunge outcast Cameron (Tanner Buchanan) after she is disgraced online during a fight with her cheating boyfriend (Peyton Meyer).I went into this with low expectations and somehow was still disappointed when I finished it. This film is awful in all aspects, from the casting to the plot, to the dialogue to the general characterisation. This is an hour and a half of second-hand cringe, and I question why people like Matthew Lillard and Rachael Leigh Cook wanted to be involved. That said, Matthew Lillard was the only redeeming part of this mess and he gave an excellent performance as expected.It is badly constructed with generally questionable shots and editing that is more reminiscent of a GCSE student film than it is a professional production company, and considering Netflix have put out some real winners prior to this, I am amazed that this went into post-production and no one said a thing about the quality of the work in front of them.As many reviewers have already pointed out, Addison Rae cannot act. She's a mediocre dancer and I'm sure that with her following on TikTok she must have some redeeming and entertaining qualities, but she is painful to watch and I do not understand the thought that went into casting her in a lead role beyond Netflix's desire to cash in on the currently popular clock app. None of the lead cast are particularly good, but she stands out among the worst.Overall a hot mess. 1/10.",He's All That

Tanner buchanan was good, the rest of them were eh and addison rae...well...uh....we're not gonna talk about that. And kourtney kardashian was absolutely HYSTERICAL. She has absolutely zero emotion but that's why it was so funny. Plot was pretty decent, obviously, because its from a 90's movie. I could actually muster some hate and liking towards some of the characters so at least there's that. They definitely could have gotten someone different than addison but come on she's the only reason we watched it lets be real. It wasnt THAT bad. Random? Yes. Cringy? At times. Enjoyable?

Second, the acting is AWFUL. The girl who plays the main character is a terrible actor but the other boy who plays Cameron, the boy who gets a makeover, is a much better actor. Everyone else in the movie are also bad actors but I expected that from this type of movie.Also, there was absolutely NO reason to put in Kourtney Kardashian, that added nothing to the movie and her acting wasn't even good.I'm honestly just disappointed that the director of Mean Girls could make this film. The movie was just a worse version of the first movie She's All That and honestly there was no need to remake it at all with worse actors.

608,katiehorrix,Such cringey moments,1,30 August 2021,"Afew moments that ruined the whole film:1. The karaoke scene where Addison sings and its quite obviously auto tune. Mixed in with odd dance moves whilst everyone watches in awe - just would not happen 🙈
2. The dance off at prom - bizarre moment and terrible dancing.3. Kourtney kardashian - what was her part? Strange and seemed as though Addison just got her friend a random part in the film, could've left her character out completely with no detriment.4. The fight scene - although tanner is good its too cliche with the air kick (made 0 sense why he knew those moves but of course because of Cobra Kai they had to put it in there).5. Tanner riding in on a horse at the end even though he said he was in the room watching her speech.6. The whole ""hiding being poor thing"" - it barely gets mentioned and yet they make out like it's such an issue at the end 🤣 Tanner and Addison don't even have 1 scene where its discussed.7. The constant talk about followers and social media referencing - we get she's a famous tiktok girl but wasn't the point in the film to become an actress who's taken seriously?Overall Tanner definitely did the best he could but my god it was so rushed, so cringey and so...aimed at 10 year olds. Had potential so it's a shame! I really think it would've been good with Tanner still as the main character but they needed to take Addison more seriously and not just focus on social media the whole time.",He's All That

But I truly think it's shameful to take a distinguished ""classic"" romcom and slap a name on it and call it a remake. The only thing that stayed true to the original was the basic plot and the random Laney Boggs tribute that reminded unexpanded upon. That being said, setting aside the god awful on trend writing, the acting wasn't awful. However, Addison is very clearly not an actress and I think that was more than prevalent in her performance. I think by taking this direction they immediately put a target on their back. The TikTok references felt forced but it also kept a very 2018 vibe at the same time. Finally, I counted at least 12 shameless brand drops that really broke the camel's back for me. Sad that this director worked on mean girls and freaky Friday.

All she cares about is those likes which i didn't give the movie because it was honestly so cringe and i felt my bones crackling from cringing.

She can move and she used her tick tock moves throughout the movie if she wants to be taken seriously, Hope she would drop the dance moves and focus on taking her acting to another level.

And especially a brat who thinks she's talented in everything when she ain't???? Poor guy had to force himself to have some nonexistant chemistry with her, and it's like she's reading directly from the script and for info THAT IS NOT ACTING , and don't let me begin on the weird camera angles and sponsorships and the nonsense that a Kardashian had to be in this, we don't want stupid gen Z cliches, we want a real movie with a consistent plot and characters with PERSONALITIES and actors that make us jump in the movie and feel like we're watching real people's lives.

However, the movie wasn't that bad.It's your normal cheesy cliche high school rom com. Very typical and if you don't like it, then obviously it's not the genre for you. It was nice to see the main girl character from the original. There were some funny moments and I loved the side WLW relationship.However, Addisons acting was mediocre at best. Was very stiff and when it wasn't stiff, it felt like a little bit too much, especially with the constant head nodding. The karaoke scene was somewhat nice, however the tiktok dancing completely ruined it and upped the cringe factor. As well as the dance off. It doesn't make sense to me how someone so against people (in this case; the main guy) would just automatically jump in the karaoke to help out someone, and would also allow her to just cut his hair. Wouldn't he have had his hair that long for a reason? It could just be me over thinking though.Overall, it has some good aspects and some bad aspects.

740,beckamc,"Cringy, Scary, Just Too Much",2,1 September 2021,Cringy = Addison Rae is adorable but...geeze she over acted. It didn't once feel natural. Also I was so distracted by how much make-up she had on (seriously for a 20 year old it looked like she had 20 layers on her face) and also one scene where she's wearing a crop top and light jeans and it became obvious that those pants were way too tight that we all could see the shape of eeeevvveeerrryyything...so yea I was more distracted by Addison (in a bad way) then I was by the storyScary=because this world of the Gen Z just seems too fake and narcissistic! And in the end did anyone learn anything? Nope! The character growth here was minimal at bestJust too much = the whole thing felt like a lot... like you gorged yourself on empty carbs.,He's All That

Just kidding, you might need an ambulance halfway into the movie. This movie, if you can even call it that, was really just one really long ad for KFC, Pizza Hut, Huda Beauty, Core water, Bounty paper towels, etc. I felt like I was watching a cheaply made at-home video.That doesn't excuse the fact that the remake itself is a poor excuse for a movie, or course. You can't redo a classic. In fact, I would've given this one star, but I gave one extra star for Rachel Leigh Cook & one extra star for Matthew Lillard. Otherwise, the entire premise is a snooze fest - influencer gets snubbed by boyfriend & loses her sponsorship. And who hired the Kardashian for god's sake? She can't act to save her life, yet she gets multiple cameos. Did she sponsor the movie or something? Or did her mother sponsor it?Overall I give 1 star, but the fact that there are 2 original actors from the actual classic, I gave this abomination 2 additional stars. Stop trying to remake our youth & then proceeding to butcher it. It's pathetic.",He's All That

I know the original wasn't amazing, but it was cute, had heart, and my wife loved it. This was awful. The acting, the plot, and the modernization stank. The cameos and soundtrack nods couldn't even give this movie a pulse. It's time I'll never get back and I actually want it back.

It was perfect for someone like me that grew up with the last movie. It's old school meets new school, and I could stare at that guy's smile lines all day. I watched it this morning, and I'm definitely going to fall asleep to it tonight. Give it a chance. I don't even leave reviews, but I had to here. Watch it. Do it for me, do it for you, do it for the sad few who will never get to enjoy both of these movies. We need this positivity, and I needed to believe kids don't actually act like this in school.

Again, no. But I can think of plenty of other actors who were not great on their first major project either. My one complaint is they did not script Padgett to be Laney and Zach's daughter.
