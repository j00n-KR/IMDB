0,SnoopyStyle,lots of issues,3,15 February 2020,"Sabina Wilson (Kristen Stewart) and Jane Kano (Ella Balinska) are two of Charles Townsend's Angels. Bosley 001 (Patrick Stewart) is the original Bosley and he's retiring. There are many Angels and Bosleys around the world. Elena Houghlin (Naomi Scott) is the lead programmer of an energy device called Calisto. She tries to warn her boss about a deadly flaw in the device but is ignored. She contacts Charlie's Angels for help. Sabina and Jane with Bosley (Elizabeth Banks) must take down a mysterious group bent on stealing Calisto.There are lots of issues here. Most importantly, this franchise does not need a sequel to pull together the various iterations. After a semi-successful movie reboot and a failed TV reboot, this franchise needs a reboot reboot. It needs to think outside the box. It cannot keep repeating the same Jiggle TV action thriller. It's time to inject realism into this tired franchise. I've always thought that recruiting female cadets from the police academy would make sense if intel suggests an unknown male in the academy is planning to do evil. Female recruits would be the only trustworthy ones. That would be my hook into something completely new. It does not help that the opening credits seems to be a tampon commercial. It's going in the wrong direction.There is a problem with the first scene. Kristen Stewart is playing a tomboy playing an innocent ingénue. I didn't buy the ingénue act so her character is not good at acting which is problematic. The scene ends with an unnecessary balcony jump which is the essence of this movie. It's jumping off a balcony and wholly unnecessary. That's not to say that it's all bad. I actually like Stewart as a tomboy trying to be tough. Her banter with the Chinese guy turns out to be funny. Naomi Scott is great as the innocent newbie. Her Krav Maga bit is fun. On the other hand, Elizabeth Banks' age-jokes are not as funny as they should be. She is trying too hard and she is bad for the movie. She's doing a comedic spoof of an action thriller. It may work if the rest of this becomes a complete spoof. There are other issues like the non-sense trying to explain the Calisto McGuffin. There are the ridiculously bad ineffective male villains. Tucker is a fine henchman but he's not the lead. That brings me to the twist. It's set up right but it's staged wrong. The shock should come later in the office but by then, non of that is surprising. At least, McG had the idea to be ridiculous. This is not ridiculous enough to be fun and not real enough to be tense.",Charlie's Angels
1,kosmasp,Missed opportunity,5,4 August 2021,"Unfortunately I see the movie as a missed opportunity. I don't feel it is as fun as it could be (quite silly a lot of times though) and unsure of the mood and tone of the film. It seems all over the place - and therefor feeling quite uneven. Maybe though you don't care and just are here for the fun ... hopefully it works for you, but as I said be wary and aware that it just might not.Very good actors involved, paper characters though. Action is decent enough and there are some extras during the credits - if you are still around.",Charlie's Angels
2,BA_Harrison,"Good morning, Charlie. Bad movie, Elizabeth.",2,27 November 2019,"Boffin Elena Houghlin (Naomi Scott) becomes a whistle-blower when she realises that the product she has been helping to develop has a serious flaw. Angels Sabina (Kristen Stewart) and Jane (Ella Balinska) investigate and learn that the invention -- a revolutionary new power source -- has the potential to be weaponised. Even worse, the prototypes have been stolen and are being offered to the highest bidder.McG's two Charlie's Angels movies embraced the silliness of the whole concept, going for big dumb fun (albeit a bit too dumb in Full Throttle). In contrast, this feminist revision of the franchise attempts to be sassy, sophisticated, smart and stylish, with a massive dose of girl power designed to appeal to a woke #metoo audience.Gender politics aside, it still ends up being dumb, but not much fun, thanks to a terrible script, clumsy execution, and humour that falls flat on its ass.To be fair, I found the three main girls to be both attractive and likeable (even Kristin Stewart wasn't as irritating as I thought she might be), but affable eye-candy only gets you so far when virtually everything else about the film stinks. Writer/director Elizabeth Banks has thrown together a mess of clichés and bad gags for her script and clearly has no idea how to construct a film involving guns, fast cars and martial arts, making the movie a two-hour long exercise in action awfulness.At the end of the film, Elena is recruited and trained as an angel, thereby paving the way for a sequel... one that I imagine will never happen given the general response to this massive misfire.",Charlie's Angels
3,paul_haakonsen,"A watchable, but fully unnecessary movie...",5,20 February 2020,"Initially I had expected this 2019 movie to be worse than it actually turned out to be. Why? Well, first of all, we - as the audience - didn't really need another attempt to put ""Charlie's Angels"" to the big screen, it was done with equally little success back in 2000 and 2003. So this was a completely and wholeheartedly unnecessary movie.Still, I was given the chance to sit down and watch it, so I did. And I must say that it was actually entertaining enough for what it turned out to be - a generic action movie, with a plot and script that had been done so many times before in other movies.Truth be told, then I must admit that Kristen Stewart actually have managed to shed off her Bella-skin. While she is not an actress that I would rush out to the cinema to watch in a new movie, she did perform well enough in this movie.The movie actually had a nice enough cast ensemble, which included the likes of Patrick Stewart, Djimon Hounsou, Elizabeth Banks and Nat Faxon.""Charlie's Angels"" is watchable, sure, but this is not a movie that rocked the movie industry, and I am sure it came and went without leaving as much as a dent in the paint job.I am rating it a very, very mediocre five out of ten stars.",Charlie's Angels
4,studioAT,Charlie's Angels,2,2 July 2021,"The two 'Charlie's Angels' films with Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz from the 00's will never be regarded as the best films ever, but they had a charm about them and are still enjoyed.While you can see why people would want to reboot the franchise, it doesn't mean to say that they should've.This film is fine, it's got it's moments, and a stand out performance from Kristen Stewart, but it's equally too long and a bit dull.It's nice it's trying to be a continuation of everything that's gone before (the TV series, the 00's films), but then it goes and retcons itself by inserting Patrick Stewart in to replace the previous Bosley's, which rather undermines the point.As I say, it's an ok film, but I would rather see the previous two.",Charlie's Angels

6,phd_travel,Fun young and stylish but the story spins out of control,6,14 November 2019,"So nice to see Kristen Stewart in a big budget movie, she's been doing all these indie and Continental flicks. Her pretty face and tomboyish charm carries the show. She looked better with the long wig than the spiky hair. Naomi Scott looks sweeter than in Aladdin. Ella's action is convincing. It's a woman's show for sure and the men are pleasantly wimpy.The story itself gets too complicated. By the end didn't know who was doing what to whom. Still it's a fun watch with nice on location filming in Hamburg and Istanbul.",Charlie's Angels
7,siderite,Just ugh!,4,14 February 2020,"I love Kristen Stewart, I still respect Patrick Stewart and I enjoy tightly clothed female heroes doing action scenes as much as the next man. I didn't expect to like Charlie's Angels, I mean, it' a dumb premise unless you do it right, but I thought I would at least have fun and feast my eyes. And you know, most movies like this start with a appetizer, a scene that makes you want more. This film started with one so bad, so cringe worthy, that I stopped watching. So my rating is based on the starting scene alone, but I believe it has to be accurate. It wasn't empowering women, it wasn't woke, it was simply really really bad.And as a commentary, I don't believe you can make Charlie's Angels in this age. You would have to make the characters play to women's strengths, which now would be perceived sexist. But one has to at least try. I don't believe the filmmakers wanted anything out of this except money.",Charlie's Angels
8,FeastMode,really really bad,2,12 March 2020,"I recently watched two charlie's angels movies from the early 2000's. figured i'd give them a shot after hating them the first time in theaters. i very much enjoyed them for what they were: ridiculous and outrageous fun. with all the reboots these days i checked and found that a new one was coming out so i added it to my watch list.this new version is bad in so many ways. it has very little ridiculousness or outrageousness, while at the same time being completely unrealistic. the story was complete nonsense, yet somehow predictable. the dialogue was bad. there was no semblance of characters. most of the comedy was crickets. and there were numerous cringe-y scenes.it also suffers from what a lot of these female-empowerment movies suffer from lately. the ""girl power"" theme is just too preachy and in your face. make a good movie with good characters. i obviously wanted to see it knowing most of the cast would be female. but the movie has to not be garbage. don't even get me started on ocean's eight. another example where i was excited for this all female version of the movie. and the movie just sucked. and it as very preachy.in conclusion, movies that have an agenda are generally worse for it. stop making movies for the purpose of female empowerment, and start making good movies with good female characters (1 viewing, 3/11/2020)",Charlie's Angels
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Better than most user reviews would have you believe.,6,30 November 2019,"'Charlie's Angels (2019)' is a solid, light-hearted action-adventure film that's undeniably formulaic - predictable, even - but also undeniably fun. It isn't a masterpiece, but it's good enough. There are a few genuinely enjoyable action scenes and the pulpy plot is breezy enough to keep you engaged even throughout its more generic moments. The story isn't anything new - or, even, particularly compelling - but the flick has a certain charm to it, an energy that's essentially all its own. Its major twist is handled with just enough subversion to be considered interesting and most of its sequences include a distinct attempt at 'zest'. Thankfully, the actors all do a good job with their archetypes, often masking some of the affair's less successful humour and been-there-done-that character arcs. Despite a bit of a lull in the second act, the movie is always rather entertaining. It moves at a quick pace and doesn't really make any missteps. Of course, it's not great. The humour rarely works, the narrative is clichéd and the action is sometimes too shaky for its own good. The pop-heavy soundtrack isn't all that cohesive, either. Still, the piece is ultimately entertaining and that's all that really matters. It doesn't come close to the gold standard of recent action cinema, such as 'John Wick' and 'Mission: Impossible', but it's about as good as the 'Fast and Furious' franchise (which its MTV, montage-heavy aesthetic is almost certainly inspired by). Overall, it's a good time. It's also worth mentioning that it does, indeed, celebrate women and that they're probably its target audience. I'd even go so far as to say that it's overtly feminist. Contrary to what most other user reviews would have you believe, that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's brilliant. So, while the piece isn't exactly phenomenal, it definitely deserves a better reception than it's getting. 6/10",Charlie's Angels
10,ThomasDrufke,Did Sony Really Expect This to Succeed?,4,26 November 2019,"In what may be the worst marketing campaign of the year, and certainly close to the top 10 of the last decade, Charlie's Angels was likely never going to succeed the way Sony was hoping. Without a clearly beloved star across the board (Naomi Scott is a few years away from that) to center a campaign around, an unproven director, and an IP that had next to no buzz, what were they really expecting? The movie itself is perfectly okay. It's not a trainwreck but nor is it something worth seeing on the big screen. Maybe they would have been better off rebooting it with another TV series on a streaming service with a couple of big name actresses? A few cool action scenes and a neat post-credit montage helped, but it certainly doesn't save the doomed franchise. I would skip this one.4.8/10",Charlie's Angels
11,cricketbat,A misguided misandric mess,3,24 February 2020,"The Charlie's Angels movies in the early 2000s were a lot of fun. This Charlie's Angels...is not. The plot doesn't make any sense, the humor is lazy, and the action sequences are unbelievable-and by ""unbelievable,"" I mean not believable. This movie also seems to have an underlying tone of misandry, as practically every male is predatory, dumb, or seducible (sometimes all three). As strange as it sounds, Kristen Stewart is the lone bright spot in this mess of an attempted reboot.",Charlie's Angels
12,westsideschl,Cheap,2,30 March 2020,"I had considered four stars.
1. Really weak action scenes. Mostly just flying kicks & takedowns; heavily dependent on camera angle for itsy bitsy believability. Very mundane, seen before, nothing new.
2. Getting really old. The usual car chase that was laughably mundane, and the machine gun - please! Gawd!
3. Usual prop scenes of showing an expensive sports car; club scenes; fashion.
4. Plot nothing new. The same old corporate selling of dangerous device to baddies. Dangerous device could pass as a child's puzzle toy. Dangerous device fails plausibility & middle school science.
5. Acting & dialogue - sad.",Charlie's Angels
13,tabuno,"More Edge, More Youthful Dialogue, More Authentic Vulnerability",8,1 December 2019,"This newest version has the girls more chic, more sharp, and more authentically vulnerable which makes this version somewhat better. The twists in this Charlie's Angels kept coming, some predictable, some not. Perhaps the turn of events were such that some audience members frowned on the outcome making this newest outing the worst box office performance in the franchise history. Maybe the twists became too confusing or disturbing. Or making the Angels more vulnerable might have been off-putting. One of the few weaknesses like using an over-powering 50 caliber Gatling gun that didn't seem to make any real big holes in the Angels getaway vehicle and unable to literally destroying it may have been too damaging to the credibility of the film. Maybe only having two primary Angels carrying the load instead of the three Angels that prior films used may have put a limp in the usual expected action, while a Bosley and a client took slightly different roles. However, the snappy, contemporary humor was finely balanced into a much more edgy Angel version (quite an accomplishment in itself) where deaths seemed to puncture that tonality of earlier Charlie's Angels films. Yet it is this edginess, contemporary updated vernacular, and the more plausible yet well executed action fighting scenes made for a cleaner and more appreciative theatrical experience. Ultimately there is a more human and meaningful feminine touch (even more so than In Like Flint (1967), especially towards the end that help to lift up the qualitative depth of this movie version. Less entertainment, more sophisticated humor and authentic action.",Charlie's Angels

15,slightlymad22,Kristen Stewart Steals The Show,6,29 November 2019,"I just got out of Charlies Angels (2019)I went into this movie (like I do with Steven Seagal movies) with rock bottom expectations, and I have to say I didn't hate it, it's not a good movie, by any standards, its very cringey especially during the first act. The big twist was ridiculously predictable and I never believed the red hearing they tried to throw us. It's very feminist driven dialogue is eye rolling at times, as is how men are portrayed in the movie. But I expected that going in. The violence to men (security guards, just doing their jobs at a research lab) including one who died (which got a laugh in my screening) was a bit jarring. But he came off as a bit of a sexual pest, so it's ok, then!!Of the acting, I hate to say this, but Patrick Stewart over acts awfully here. Naomi Scott (who I like in Aladdin) is guilty of not being totally convincing at times especially early on in the action scenes, Ella Balinska was ok and handled her action scenes ok, although I think if she was punched in the face as much as she was in her final fight, she'd have more than a bust lip lol Elizabeth Banks was fine.Banks direction was fine, I didn't have a problem with how she handled the action scenes, the comedy elements or the more serious ones, although I spotted a couple of goofs, which you should never pick up on a first time viewing.Now, I can't believe I'm going to type this, but I really liked Kristen Stewart in this!! She is not an actress I like (despite my eldest son telling me she is a good actress, if I bother to watch some of her little indie movies) I have always found her bland and unappealing, but here not only does she look good, she is funny and she made me laugh or smile on a few occasions!! She looked like she was having fun and it was kind of contagious.Funny thing, there were 29 people in my screening, only 3 females but unusually there were no ads shown and only two trailers (Cats and Bombshell) before the movie started there were only 5 men all over 50 all sat on their own and two teenage girls!! All the rest came in after it had started. Normally you have half an hour of ads and trailers.Have people being pulling their ads and trailers from being attached to this movie??Overall I don't hate it, Kristen Stewart was the best thing in it and it will probably not make my top 10 worst of 2019 list",Charlie's Angels
16,UniqueParticle,Way better than the 3.7 rating on here!,8,14 November 2019,"A total blast to me and my sister! Beautiful cast, cinematography and great soundtrack. A lot more action than I was expecting but great fight sequences none the less. I'd say Kristen Stewart was the best thing about the movie, I like Naomi Scott too she's precious. I'm not sure whats going on with the ratings/reviews on this adaptation regardless I absolutely loved Charlies's Angels especially for it's women power and mindless fun!",Charlie's Angels
17,cruise01,Entertaining and love the new leading actresses.,6,18 November 2019,"Charlie's Angels (3 out of 5 stars).Charlie's Angels is a decent action comedy which I love the new cast ensemble and its fun direction. But the film falls flat with its cliché and boring plot. This film is kind of like a third installment to McG Charlie's Angels with Cameron Dias, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore. More like a continuation than a reboot. It may lack the energetic and ridiculous action like McG's first two Angel films. This newly fresh cast film is a little more grounded with its action which is not thrilling or fresh in the action genre.The plot follows Bosley (Elizabeth Banks) and her angels Sabina (Kristen Stewart) and Jane (Ella Balinska) who are tasked at following some new EMP device called Callisto. Which Elena (Naomi Scott) was working on and the Angels recruit her to be part of her team. When Callisto is stolen by an assassin Hodak (Jonathan Tucker) which he will be selling to some unknown client.The plot is forgettable. The bad guys are forgettable. Jonathan Tucker does play one creepy assassin. There is a couple of twists and turns which none of it was surprising. The films concept playing like the origins of a brand new Charlie's Angels team forming up and coming together in the end. More like in its mid credit scene when the trio of girls are an official team.Kristen Stewart is great playing Sabina. She is awkward, weird, and funny. Ella Balinska is also great playing Jane, a beautiful and skilled agent. Naomi Scott is also good playing Elena, which she barely partakes in the action while being in the sidelines. Elizabeth Banks is also good playing Bosley. There are some fun cameos that show up in the film.The film has some decent action sequences which can be entertaining. But it is nothing thrilling or exciting. It was fun to see the three leading actresses trying to work as a team in their esponiage of breaking in and getting involved in chases with the bad guys.Overall, Charlie's Angels is a fair film. The action and direction is decent. Which is entertaining and fun. The story is lacking the fun energy like the previous films.",Charlie's Angels

20,lisafordeay,Naomi Scott starred in Aladdin and ended up in this feminist reboot,3,1 August 2020,"Charlie's Angels is a 2019 action remake based off the 1970s show with Farrah Faccett and the 2000 film with Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore of the same name. It stars Kirsten Stewart(Twilight),Naomi Scott(Aladdin) and newcomer Athlete turned actor Ella Ballinaka with Elizabeth Banks who directs,produces and stars in this film.Two spies are on the hunt for a bad guy as well as helping a former computer whiz named Elena to become part of the Angel's owned by the mysterious Charlie.Parts of it was very choppy,the acting was alright(only watched it cause I loved the 2000 film and loved Naomi Scott since the 2019 remake Aladdin). But everything else was all about girl power. In other words the director was like oh let's do a feminist flick where there is no bad women at all as well as hating on men. The beginning was like watching a commercial for a Disney Princess advert. Part of me was like what am I watching? Did the director just added an advert by accident or what.Music is done by Ariana Grande(she has a couple of songs in this as well as singing the godawful theme song). Also there is ALOT of CGI which makes the film appear false. Forgot to add that one of the writers Evan(cant spell his surname) also did the writing for Beauty and the Beast 2017 (Wow and that was better than this).Also stars Me Before You star Sam Claffin,X Men's Patrick Stewart and cameos from the past Angel's in still photographs.Go watch the Cameron Diaz one instead and the 1970s show.",Charlie's Angels
21,subxerogravity,By the thrid act it was becoming the movie I wanted to see but too little too late...,5,10 February 2020,"I did not have any high hopes for this movie at all.
I don't dislike Kristen Stewart but she's definitely not someone I would run to the theatre and see in a movie, and sense none of the other two angels are on my radar no one on that poster made me enthusiastic to see this movie adaption.
I did like the idea of making a new angels movie with some new angels. That was the one thing that I felt they got absolutely right. Each generation should have their own angels. It's just too bad that this generation had these angels. My generation got lucky with Drew Barrymore, Camren Diaz and Lucy Lu who were lovely charming and fun and most importantly, unionized in fighting the bad guys (but to be honest all the traits that seem to make the first movie good made it's sequel god awful).
I was excited by the idea that Elisabeth Banks was going to direct this movie, but I think in my mind that was going to make it an action packed version of Pitched Perfect 2. Now that I would have loved to See! Anna Kendrick, Britney Snow Rebel Wilson, possible replace one of these girls with Hailee Steinfeld (I'm looking at you Snow) With that Beyoncé song ""who run the world? Girls!"" as the theme song. That's the movement I wanted to see. I have this feeling that someone did pitch this movie and it got veto because it was too much Girl power and not enough Woman power, Two separate things that look the same but can make for a garbage movie if know onw can tell the difference.
Patrick Stewart was great. You can tell by how he approached his character that it was all about the origin story of these three angels, a story that actually got in the way of movie. By the third act this movie was starting to become what I was expecting of the film but it was too little too late. Especially considering how successful the first movie adaption was that just told the origins of the girls in a hot open.
Oh, and Djimon Hounsou was in this flick! that's two of the best supporting actors in the game (Hounsou and Stewart) and that was not enough magic to make this movie great.
Oh well. Hopefully the next generation will have a better movie.",Charlie's Angels

The action is alright, nothing too over the top, and all the actress's have amazing chemistry, and you I see that they all had a fun time working together, I just see it in there performances, Elizabeth Banks is solid has the director and starring has Bosley.Some may think it's a reboot, but it's really not, it let's you know that while watching. But it does not quite do the original opening, it pays homage to the original Charlie's Angels, and it does it own thing at the same time.

23,stevendbeard,Ties Them All Together,7,16 November 2019,"I saw ""Charlie's Angels"", starring Kristen Stewart-the Twilight movies, Zathura:A Space Adventure; Naomi Scott-Aladdin_2019, Power Rangers_2017; Ella Balinska-The Athena_tv, A Modern Tale; Patrick Stewart-the X-Men movies, Robin Hood:Men in Tights and Elizabeth Banks-Brightburn, Power Rangers_2017.
This is a reboot/sequel to the Charlie's Angels franchise that ties them all together-the tv series and previous movies. In the new reboot, Elizabeth-who also wrote, produced and directed the whole shebang-and Patrick are some of the many Bosleys. It is like a rank and they guide the Angels on Charlie's orders to help keep the world safe from bad guys. Also, the Townsend Agency is now global. There are branches-and Angels and Bosleys-all over the world and there are some good cameos of the Bosleys and the Angels. The newest team consists of Kristen and Ella who try to stop a scientist' creation from destroying the world as we know it. Naomi is the scientist and her device, in the wrong hands, could do just that. There are lots of fights and gun battles with car chases thrown in for good measure-the Drew Barrymore Angels did not use guns-and the curtain is pulled back a little bit to show a secret concerning Charlie. As the end credits start, you see a few more cameos and the musical soundtrack is by Ariana Grande. There is even a song by her, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey included.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.

A remake of Charlie's Angels but with a twist: Multiple teams of angels and multiple Bosleys: one old, one female, one black.A can't miss idea. Unfortunately someone forgot you need a writer(s) to forge a plot, actors who can first act and second portray characters the audience can like. Someone needed to raise an eyebrow immediately and ask why a reboot was needed. Was there a nascent audience seeking a reboot?And if not then was there a compelling script that would bring in an audience. The 2000 reboot was a nice sort of reminiscence with John Forsythe re-voicing Charlie, and Bill Murray to remind you this was a tongue-in-cheek flick meant to entertain period.

32,aidanratesmovies,"Not perfect, but a hell of a fun time",9,16 November 2019,"Devilishly fun, exciting, and as ever cheeky, the reboot of the female spy franchise has never been better or simply more enjoyable. The acting in the film, for the most part, is surprisingly pretty good, with Kristen Stewart's Sabina as the all together standout character, as well as, although slightly less so, Ella Balinska breakout performance as Jane. Although the action scenes can prove to be a bit choppy as it goes on, for the most part they are cleverly executed and downright exciting. The film also doesn't shy back on the humor, with a surprisingly funny script when it's supposed to be, and for the most part generally satisfying. The film does have a bit of a struggle with pacing after the first third of the film or so, but nothing all in all that truly weighs it down. Where it falters most, however, is its contrived plot and execution of it so, making for more of a head turning experience than it truly needs to be. In the end however, the new Charlie's Angels is exactly what it needs to be, a fun time at the movies, and certainly makes me interested to what will happen to these Angel's next.

33,questl-18592,Charlie's... Not Gonna Like This,3,14 March 2020,"The best thing I can say about this movie is that the primary angels seem to be having fun. Stewart especially is doing a great job and seems to be having a blast.There's no cohesive story here. The movie feels all over the place, over long, bloated with too many characters and cameos. Also, I never watched the show, but it feels like this drastically changes the Charlie's Angels lore as well, and in a way that hurts it.Also, this thing is constantly and obnoxiously over the top with the girl power. It is possible to make an exceptional movie about female empowerment and equality without making it so constantly eye rolling. Little Women, Hustlers, Harriet, Bombshell all handle this subject matter much better in recent time.This is fun for Stewart, that's about it. Naomi Scott especially seems to be treated like her character is an idiot. This was just a rough watch from start to finish. Unless you're a huge fan of some aspect of this movie, it's really not worth going out of your way for.",Charlie's Angels

35,rgkarim,Girl Power Politics And Gimmick Focus Have This Mission Ending In Failure,5,16 November 2019,"Charlie's angels, a lovely band of female agents protecting the world one mission at a time. Long ago, these super skilled beauties showed us that style, beauty, and skills could come together in one of the most memorable series of the golden age of television. The progressive presentation of this series proved you could be fun and still not put too many politics into the mix, something this reviewer likes. Question for tonight is though, can the modern age of politics and representation welcome the same principles, or will it warp it into its own format. That's where I come in to give my thoughts on the latest movie, in hopes of guiding your viewing pleasure. Robbie K coming at you with another review, this time on:Charlie's Angels (2019)

A variety of styles will come into tickle the fancy, and may just get your toes tapping if you appreciate upbeat music like I do. As most won't care about this let's get to some other things then. The comedy has some good moments, a well-timed jab, pun, or insult that made me chuckle at how cute and well versed it was. These moments were far between for me, but several members found the comedy a bit more golden. One thing my audience and I agreed on is that the film does a nice job of keeping the pace, almost like an extended episode of the show meeting modern trends of flashy sequences. It might not be the most original, clever, or even suspenseful, but it works to promote the fun that this movie holds, especially for the key demographic. My bigger surprise though was seeing Kristen Stewart's new emotion in this role and the character that she played. Finally breaking out of the somber, monochromatic Bella Swan, Stewart's dive into the world of the Angels is a plus for me. Her new lifestyle fit well into the film and I seeing her show more emotional range than previous roles. It's her partner in crime played by Ella though I enjoyed. This lovely actress held charm, pizazz, edge, and a deeper side than I expected, bringing good chemistry with her fellow angels and a modern addition that was story and character centric (very smart move). Finally, like Ocean's 8, the style of the dresses and outfits should be more than enough to inspire a shopping spree, as the wardrobe department accomplished great feats of sexy meeting modern, and maybe utility depending on the scene.Yet for the likes I had for this film there was a fair bit of things that were not to my personal liking. For one thing the predictability of the story is not impressive, all the ruses and diversion are obvious tactics and could have been used for better action. Sub plots to build back story were surprisingly one dimensional, dropping in 1-2 lines and never taxing our girls for more than 5 seconds and thus the characters interest were more on their gimmicks and the actresses abilities to bring them to life. Even more forced was the humor, which like most of Banks works does not know when to quit when its ahead and throw timing/cleverness for as many political punches as possible. It leads to a rather spotty plot for me that is more of a comedy than a thriller, which I expected, but wanted so much more out of just fun characters. Despite the political component of the modern age, the characters again were not directed the way I wanted either and though again entertaining and acted decently, I think the direction was not the best.
Plot and character design complete, what about the presentation of the movie itself. Well to be honest, the flash in the pan role approach took the center stage in my eyes. While the outfits may be beautiful, I'll admit that they were a little too much of the focus for this reviewer, with more emphasis of showing off sex appeal than anything else. Various scenes that started to gain mojo were quickly finished or diluted for things like attempts at sexual humor or a dance scene that served merely as a foreshadowing device for something to come (while also being about showing off the outfits). Gadgets, famous for any spy movie and a tool that can elevate the plot were kind of simplistic, lacking the charm and design from other series that knew how to merge things in a more imaginative way. Why go through the eccentric shots of devices if we aren't going to utilize them as much? Poor planning perhaps, or maybe there was something else taking the stage. In regards to fight scenes, they are okay, but this reviewer found many of them to be short bouts of very stiff choreographed fights, that merely repeated movements or held simplistic gunplay. There is nothing amazing about the brawls, and outside of some slight moments that will stick in your mind are quite forgettable. Yet the thing I am not the biggest fan of, is the political focus that comes with most modern movies. You can see it in the trailers, but Charlie's Angels is all about spouting the message of girl power, from the opening dialogue and credits, to the painstakingly planned scenes that are all about showing how much guys suck. Movies are famous for these hyperboles of character, but for the whole film to do this, well you lose the other qualities for me with this in your face approach.The VERDICT:The trailers will not lie to you, at least on some part, that Charlie's Angels is geared towards a certain audience. It's stylish presentation of looks, outfits, and girl power is going to be the main appeal to audience members, with some comedy to help expand to other goers and acting that makes up the rather bland characters. Yet, the movie suffers for me from being too focused on the superficial and not enough on the elements I remember from previous installments. Sure the nostalgia is nice but all the plots are rather truncated, the humor is a little forced on me, action scenes could use a tune up alongside the gadgets, and the political presentation got old after a while. However, it's got enough oomph to check out in the theater, especially if you are part of the key demographics that will enjoy this.This mission gets a score of:Comedy/Action/Adventure/Thriller: 6.0

36,Kamurai25,Angels assemble,8,4 July 2020,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.A significant improvement over the old formula (not that it was bad). We still have the ""men are dumb, horny animals"" theme happening, and yes, this movie still caters to women-interested audience members, but they found a much better presentation to being sexy while doing impressive things instead of doing impressive things sexily. Mostly it was not showing nape to navel for most of the movie.That aside, they did an excellent job opening up the world: while the original 2 movies made the impression that this was one squad that traveled the world on missions, this approach is a world-wide organization of elite agents (kind of like how Marvel's Agents of SHIELD focusing on one squad as SHIELD, but its really an world-wide organization). While the actual story focuses on this team of ladies, the controversy really uses Chekov's gun to incorporate the organization as a whole and insert some somewhat clever twists.Casting was great: Patrick Stewart was great, but I wish he had more on screen time with Elizabeth Banks (Hunger Games: Effie) (he looks amazing for his age, but I'm not sure he could stand an actual fight scene).Djimon Hounsou (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Jonathan Tucker (The Ruins) were downright amazing, such good action out of them alongside Kristen Stewart (a good choice as a veteran actresss), Naomi Scott (Aladdin: Jasmine) and relative newcomer Ella Balinski who really seemed to put the extra effort playing a noted hand to hand combat master.I'm thinking of this as going from ""Batman & Robin"" to ""Batman Begins"", it more serious, it looks better, has better content, but ultimately has the same silly premise and all the fun that comes with it.",Charlie's Angels

Patrick Stewart is fine as Bosley but the casting of the young girls as the angels 😇 is no laughing matter.,Charlie's Angels
38,vengeance20,Sounds like someone needs to get off their high horse & shut up!,1,26 November 2019,"Knew from a mile off that this was going to be one of those Me Too themed, misandrist female propaganda type of films easy. It's no wonder that of all films this one here thrives and takes full advantage of today's corrupted PC views on how men in cinema are treated: made to look bad, cowardly & pathetic against women who are good. strong & independent.Kind of typical that a woman has made this film too, Elizabeth Banks, the little girl who said and I quote: ""men don't want to watch female lead films"". Quote off. Pfft really? It's the same crap with 2018's Oceans 8, film, it didn't do well in cinemas & the female cast members were super quick to lash out at men for the films lukewarm performance, never mind using their tiny brains to think that the film properly didn't do well because it sucked in general? But no, their insecurities of why they made the film in the first place (to hate on men & elevate women) makes them think just that. Typical. Even still it's maybe no wonder why it did get hate for that reason, never mind this film. I mean, imagine how THEY would get if it was men hating & belittling them in the film. They'd be up in arms this lot would never mind feminists who vision of female empowerment is double standards galore.This film was bad, and its corrupted toxic femininity theme did not help at all. It's not about equality, it's about dominance. Women complain about being victims because they get off on being given the ""there, there"" treatment, they know they get it easy in this world yet love playing the so-called victimhood card this is to not only prolong their dominance, but to ensure that their power isn't compromised Fact.Yet the second a strong female lead film like this comes out & it involves hating & exploiting the opposite sex & men complain, its back to the victim card crap again. It's clear they don't want their privilege being revoked away from them, that's why they carry on the victimhood crap.
It's amazing how quick this lot get hysterical & emotional when their man hating film doesn't get the backing, they thought it would. They wonder why. But don't think how they'd feel if the shoe was on the other foot. I also love how the changes in this film also benefit women too like the clothing change, so they won't be objectified, yet they hypocritically make men in this film at the same time are being objectified to look weak, cowardly and overall bad. Unbelievable.Female lead films aren't the problem, but in this world now when Hollywood's concerned, they really try & shove it down your throats & worst of all must exploit it negatively.Honestly, it's just so unnecessary. I can only hope films like this in Hollywood stop or drop the PC trend in propaganda as it's simply not cool in this day & age where we're supposed to be equal. But instead it's dropped for the tit-for-tat route in which women take the piss out of men so they can be empowered. It's just wrong. Alright for women, but wrong for men. Ok, that's very equal isn't it. Yet this lot complain that THEY are the ones being oppressed, it's outrageous and insane it really is.Overall, a very bad film designed to push the female propaganda further & promote hate on men in a world supposedly designed for equality. Elizabeth Banks needs to get off her high horse and shut up. The film got bad reviews because it sucks, simple. If you make a film which exploits men in a bad light with biased/toxic views while promoting toxic femininity, then grow some balls & expect serious negative backlash. Least the previous 2 films & TV Series were done because they were good & not done for the sheer sake of feminism and misandry. Women can be strong, but not anti-male strong that's the issue. This film itself is the very definition of shoe-horning!I guess the only good that can come from this crap is that the more these PC Propaganda get mad then bashed, the more awareness about them gets noticed & then hopefully stopped dead in its tracks.
Also, Elizabeth, don't blame men for your film flopping, it sucked. Plain & simple. And also, don't talk to me about men complaining, because when you say that, that's what you're doing while trying to catch us out. You lot are hypocrites. You make a man hating film & you'll get hate for it. It's amazing how quick your ""strong sisterhood"" turns to ""weak victimhood"" the second someone bruises it with truth. Now go to a quite corner & cry you pathetic snowflake. Mic Drop.",Charlie's Angels
39,denis888,More Serious Tone But Still A Huge Fun,10,25 October 2020,"I have read a lot of negative reviews here and cannot grasp why on earth there is so much blunt hatred. Sure, no movie is perfect, and sure tastes differ but I do say this is a decent fun movie, g=fast-paced, gorgeously shot, with excellent soundtrack to match, great cast, and smart plot twists.
Elizabeth Banks did a great job, and she expressed a certain amount of respect to all the previous Angels films, this is clear and obvious here. Kristen Stewarts once again proved she is an actress of wide scope and awesome zeal. She shows great gusto and virtually cuts all corners excellent way. Mark Lieberman of The Washington Post wrote that Stewart ""upstages everyone, from the opening close-up on her gleeful grin to her array of colorful costumes, riotous non sequiturs and unconventional posture choices."" True to the core.
Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska are very good choices for two other leads, too. Their chemistry is palpable and works fine all through the movie. Men leads? Yeah, very good, as well. Patrick Stewart,Jonathan Tucker and others do not seem lame or weak or lost behind the powerful female leads. A neat balance is here and it works, oh yes.
Smart fun film that takes a bit slower start but then goes on well and fast.

41,arungeorge13,"The movie no one, literally no one, asked for! [+46%]",5,11 March 2020,"The Charlie's Angels 2019 reboot/sequel is a film that not even the present-day woman asked for. Writer-director-actor Elizabeth Banks comes up with a more politically correct, contemporary version of McG's femme fatale flick but it's too derivative and features stock characters that only differ by their hairstyles and not their actual personalities. The major highlight of the McG film, while bordering on the sleaze factor, was the scorching screen presence of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu. The new set of angels - Kristen Stewart (the badass), Naomi Scott (the nerd), and Ella Balinska (the muscle) - simply cannot match up to their predecessors.The red herrings in Charlie's Angels are probably the worst conceived ones you'll see in a spy movie. For discerning viewers, it doesn't take all that long to figure out who the antagonist is. It's silly, popcorn entertainment alright, and ought to be treated as is. If the intention of this movie was to get rid of the male gaze while telling the action-packed story of female twenty-something spies with Top 40s pop music playing in the background, it can be deemed a partial success. The bigger question here is, do we need empowerment-sprinkled versions of older flicks or fresh storylines with well-written women characters? I believe, the latter.",Charlie's Angels
42,Abdulxoxo,Light entertainment,6,29 January 2021,"The direction, writing and editing could have all been better. You could tell by the way scenes were edited especially the action sequences. The cuts were too sharp, too frequent and lacking in the necessary flow to highlight the choreography of the fights. It could be that there simply wasn't the stunt talent available to film decent fight scenes. With the budget they had, and two Oscar nominated editors working on the movie, it certainly could have been better. But I will say that I actually enjoyed the acting - mostly. Scott was likable enough in what you could possibly call the lead role. Banks and Djimon Hounsou were solid as Bosleys so was Patrick Stewart. Stand outs however were Balinska, who looked very well suited to the spy role, and Kristen Stewart, who was the comic relief. These two actresses just about kept this film from being a disaster. Balinska, who I don't think I'd seen before, had a fantastic screen presence and I could easily see her star in her own action movies. This is the first time I think I've seen Stewart do such a mainstream comedic role, and I really liked it. Her reputation of being emotionless stems back to her days in Twilight. Since then though she's actually done some fantastic work and become an extremely watchable actress. I'd like to see her in more mainstream movies; although perhaps working under better directors. Some of the other positives I could mention include the costume designs, the beautiful locations and the soundtrack. Overall, Charlie's Angel is a dumpster in most parts but it certainly a good light entertainment if nothing else.",Charlie's Angels

44,rivertam26,Solid and overly entertaining,7,3 May 2020,"I don't get why so many people dislike this reboot on the material. Sure it's not as good as the McG films but it's something new all it's own while still paying dues to the original series and previous films. According to this they all take place in the same universe which makes it a sequel. Centering around a scientist who develops a device capable of very bad things. Two new Angels played by an amazingly charismatic Kristen Stewart and impressive newcomer Ella Ballinska and joined by scientist/ new recruit Naomi Scott. Sure the film feels a bit hammy at times and the pacing is a bit off. But it's ultimate message of woman and sisterhood in all forms, shapes and sizes around us is powerful and sadly should have been embraced more. Us the movie is overly entertaining with fun more reality based action sequences and a lot of clever jokes that hit splendidly. Plus Stewart definitely steals the show in a career changing performance.3.5/5",Charlie's Angels

There were a few laughs some even when they were meant others when horrifically bad. But the film is nowhere near the worst this year let alone ever but with the cast it should have been so much better with a nearer script and story I mean they even made Patrick Stewart seem robotic and cringey as hell.

Though it is not so perfect it is watchable once especially if you had seen previous Charlie Angels. Highlight is Neomi Scott, she did well acting and looks stunning round the movie. Other impressive work by Elizabeth Bank, Ella Balinska and Patrick Steward is as usual we know him for X-men series. Kick ass actions are okay as not super or not so bad. Somewhere movie seems like lady James Bond. Background score is as needed to such movies. Songs are exactly match for every situations. Photography and wide panoramic view of the movie gives you better look. Those are plus points as me. And to say weak points that are predictable story and two types of twists feeling unrealistic. Rest is okay. I did not understand here a issue of man and woman dominating subject for this movie as many viewers talking about.

51,rockman182,Charlie's Angels (2019),6,17 November 2019,"I love the Charlies Angels series from the 1970s. Have seen nearly every episode and while the show doesn't bring the utmost quality, its a very fun watch. I found the McG films from last decade to be entertaining as well and a bit of guilty pleasures. When this new edition was announced I was going to watch it purely as being a fan of the franchise. Having now seen it, i will say that this is the best feature film adaptation even though it runs into pacing issues.A new group of Angels are brought together to look into a corporation who are developing a weapon that has catastrophic implications. While learning to band together the trio also learn that there may be secrets within the Townsend agency involving the agents named Bosley (yes this film instills the name as a rank rather than an individual character). The film stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and newcomer Ella Balinska as the three Angels.The film is not a reboot as stated by director Elizabeth Banks. It rather acknowledges all the former Angels of the film and series and takes on new recruits. I liked the trio for the most part and their different personalities make it work. I think the film suffers from some pacing issues as there are stages where the film noticeably drags. The plot is also pretty predictable all things considered. It's not a wholly original concept obviously but I think Banks does a good job modernizing the film and trying to put a new spin on it.The film is heavy on the power of women and modern feminism. The characters, while attractive, aren't purely there to be sex symbols. I think the action scenes were done pretty well, much better than anything seen in the other two films. The film doesn't really blow you away or really breath a great deal of hope into this franchise but it was an interesting film to watch, especially if you feel nostalgic of what you've seen come before.6.5/10",Charlie's Angels

First off, where are all the scenes with the Angels in their underwear and in bikinis on the beach and being all cute and stuff? Seriously. Secondly, where's Janelle Monae?

Elizabeth Banks you've created a monster. Don't do what you've done here, Elizabeth, anymore ever again, ok? Third off, where are all the men?!! The original Angels all had men that they flirted with constantly throughout the whole film, I don't take joy in saying this, but this remake is lacking testosterone. Patrick Stewart isn't really sexy anymore. This movie has insufficient casting. There's like one 2 second sexy scene in the whole movie which I shall now share with you immediately - Kristen in booty shorts at the gym.

53,fernandoschiavi,"No remarkable scenes, but it is aware of the franchise's tacky and absurd approach, which is a good sign. With elements from previous works, ""Charlie's Angels"" gains new fans",6,4 April 2021,"After so many adaptations, for the first time the universe of the Townsend Agency is in the hands of a woman. Elizabeth Banks took on the role of director, screenwriter, producer and actress of the new reboot that no one necessarily asked for, but that eventually manages to bring something new with the comfort in which it exists between action scenes that do not spare the right use of the environment and the scenarios. This new adaptation subverts some industry standards, but in no way gives up what is the franchise's DNA. In other words, sensuality is still present as a weapon in the agents' missions, but in a more intelligent way: flirting more with feminism and unpretentious humor.Sabina Wilson (Kristen Stewart) and Jane Kano (Ella Balinska) are two Charlie's Angels who need to set aside differences when embarking on an international adventure with the new Bosley (Elizabeth Banks) and scientist Elena Houghlin (Naomi Scott). They must prevent a new energy program from becoming a threat to humanity and find out who is behind such an evil plan.Actress and director Elizabeth Banks takes over the direction of this new chapter with the mastery of those who know the universe of Charlie's Angels, developing the plot with a lot of reference to the past, which will make the fans of the series and films happy, in addition to updating the story when necessary; after all, both the series and the films of the 2000s have always been a portrait of the time in which they were set and showed women as strong and independent beings from men. And this film, my friends, is more than current in this regard. The Charlie's Angels navigate the waters of the new ""wave of feminism"" that has taken Hollywood in recent years, and takes advantage of this to assume a distinct place among all the other versions of this story that have already reached the screens. But it shouldn't be a film that needs to remember all the time that this is a story of women who take advantage of a supposedly naive appearance, and of an almost naturalized instinct for men not to feel threatened by the female sex, to fulfill their obligations. Missions and punching armed men and men in suits. In contrast, that is exactly what the film does. In many instances, it is unnecessarily attached to an extremely didactic explanation of the objectives themselves, instead of showing in a practical way what it came from - from beginning to end. Some feminist messages are hammered into the public's head, without any subtlety. Remember Ghostbusters (2016)? The Charlie's Angels are already opening with a guy wanting to disparage women. He's the villain. But everything is conducted in such a heavy and artificial way that in the dialogue the subject practically says that ""a woman's place is in the kitchen"". Knowing that this is a film that relies on feminism, it becomes a bad start - almost an anvil falling on the head.Other than that, virtually none of the feature's jokes work, and it becomes excruciating. The feature's humor is generic by inserting ready-made jokes and random reference puns; the most situational comedy that the previous ones created is lacking, mainly when they put men to be easily deceived and manipulated by the protagonists for a mission, something that happens in one or another creative moment in the beginning, but like the action, it does not last. This question of durability has a lot to do with the distribution of the plot cores, which spends a lot of time betting on the dynamics of a novice with two experienced ones in conflict.In action, the script facilitates or makes it difficult when you want, but you never allow yourself to exaggerate too much or step into seriousness with more consequences, even because of the indicative classification. At times, he flirts with the mockery or that seriousness, presenting real risks to the characters and, in both cases, they are slightly exciting, but he passes very quickly due to Banks' little ability to conduct them on camera, appealing to that logic of a frantic succession of cuts that makes it difficult to understand geographically what is happening. Not to mention that video game identity and its succession of challenges are abandoned, but at least this is consistent with the proposal that is actually linked to espionage, in the assembly of those complex plots of betrayals and interests revolving around technological artifacts or specific documents. Of which a range of people are chasing.The action and fight scenes rarely get really exciting and need a more precise montage. The script, her first, is inconsistent and incoherent, with narrative arcs that needed a clearer direction. As a consequence, the balance between action and comedy falls short of the potential shown all the time, giving the melancholy feeling that he is one step closer to being great. A possible shortcoming of the feature for some is that when we compare this film to other spy films, we never feel urgency in the situations that the spies go through. But even with this ""script problem"" at the end, the result is positive. Not to mention that some catchphrases are misplaced and a dance scene, as cool as it may be, happens absolutely nothing. For this reason, the dynamics between the three protagonists suffer. There is an arc over two of them being opposites and trying to get closer which is confusing and not at all cohesive in their development.As a lot of time is spent on these aspects, even to develop them carefully and provide for the renewal of the franchise, there is little left to actually take advantage of the dynamics of the three together in the adventure, which mixes action with comedy. Even if they spend a lot of time together, the proposal to still be a team in formation is not as skillful as it would be if this stage had been skipped. It is that tiredness syndrome of original films, which, even though it is understandable in view of the history to be considered, is a safe game that is more exciting for continuity than when it is really happening. Because the three when together are great, they have very distinctive chemistry and personalities that complement each other and can be pillars for a new, more promising film sequence. Naomi Scott plays the innocent but fearless Elena, a scientist at a company about to launch an energy-generating device capable of revolutionizing the world, which upon discovering its risk of being used as a weapon, becomes a target to be saved by Jane and Sabina. Ella Balinska makes an impressive debut. Imposing, not only does she own the best action scenes, but she shows layers behind her character's calculated coolness. However, the show itself is by Kristen Stewart. Fitting like a glove on a paper with a more comical approach, she conquers the audience with charm, obstinacy and assertiveness, delivering her lines with such sagacity in her voice that steals every moment she appears. Sabina has a very unique personality and the actress does well by not letting her performance fall into the caricature.However, feminism is not always presented organically in the plot. Elizabeth Banks ends up playing it safe and uses a lot of discourse to play with everyday situations, with which the public will certainly identify. As a joke, this feature works. But, in a broader sense, it gives a banal air to the film, as if it were just another one trying to surf in this ""fashion"". The biggest problem with Charlie's Angels is its script. In the direction, if Banks demonstrates a certain immaturity in the sense of an unnecessary stretch in the script, with revelations stuck in twists that leave something to be desired in the sense of holding the viewer within the story. Fat is noticeable when the weave stretches and ends up yielding to joints that leave little to the imagination and fall into repetition, easily avoided if the final cut was less passionate about the idea of taking extremely seriously what could - and should - be mere trickery to arrive at the idea that, in the end, men are naturally not more reliable or valuable than women.In addition, the director and screenwriter does not create moments that resonate with the audience (such as there is no great scene of memorable action), she also does not compromise, leaving everything on automatic. She delivers (or her team) good photography, good art direction, and especially good costumes. It is also always good to highlight the soundtrack of the always great Bryan Tyler and the music score, especially the partnership between Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey, who recorded a collaboration entitled ""Don't Call Me Angel"", shown in the final credits. Of the feature. But what doesn't really go round is the text. We waited, but the film never took off, perhaps out of insecurity. The film is fully aware of the franchise's tacky and absurd approach, which is a good sign. By bringing elements from previous works, ""Charlie's Angels"" conquers fans of the old ones and expands the universe.",Charlie's Angels
54,brookenichole-98054,Disgrace to females,1,6 April 2020,"Charlie's Angels is crap. That's all it is just awful nonsense. I hated this movie not only because of how boring it was but how inconsiderate it was to men. The fact that this movies message was that all men are evil was just disgusting. I get that there are bad men out there but don't forget there are bad women too. It's not just one gender that can be evil.
The acting was terrible too and the only reason I watched it was for Naomi Scott who wasn't too great. Not to mention the story. Everything that needed to be explained wasn't. I was just left confused the whole movie.
When watching this I knew I would never want anyone else to watch this movie. It's message is one of the worst I have seen in years. I wouldn't want women taking this message and using it. We should be giving equality to both genders.",Charlie's Angels

56,kuarinofu,Women empowerment by Sony Pictures Entertainment,1,15 February 2020,"This movie invoked two emotions with me:At first, it was excruciatingly boring. Incomprehensible action scenes were followed by horrible awkward attempts at humor with some barely believable backstories (Stewart's one was especially laughable and realistic). The story is sort of a sequel and a re-make at the same time, a ""requel"" I guess, it's as generic as possible. I mean, not much rooting can be done for the characters anyway since they are just uninteresting and completely lack any charm or chemistry, they don't play off each other at all. The opening title shots kinda suggested that I wasn't the audience for this film and it was probably made for little girls, but I'm not sure little girls might enjoy this anyway (but who knows).After around 90 minute mark the story takes a really weird turn. I was utterly confused and for around a minute or two I found myself constantly saying ""what?""It went into some weird literal ""bwahaha, I love women slavery"" and ""tee-hee, I will enjoy using this intelligent woman's research to gain profits"" areas. I legitimately thought this movie is intentionally trolling women with this, it was that blatant and stupid. And this Muslim side character...I mean, have some respect, Jesus.Is this how Hollywood richest people see the women struggle in religious and more traditional countries? If this was serious and intentional - that is embarrassing and disrespectful.And one more thing. Please, if you want to give a serious message through a film, why in a love of God does it have to be Charlie's Angels? Sony definitely has a good history of women empowering re-makes, huh?Charlie's Angels, Christ's sake, even the 2000s films were cheesy action comedies where absolutely nothing was to be taken seriously, it was just beautiful women having fun mission impossible style. I'm not even talking about the show that is barely remembered by anyone anymore.Sony, please, just stop. I'm begging you people. Making an easy buck from your old properties is one thing, but wrapping it up in actually relevant and important themes and have those regurgitated onto your viewers - this is just pure evil.",Charlie's Angels

58,0w0,Eye-rollingly bad... and painful to watch,4,15 February 2020,"The movie is filled with SO MANY gimmicks and non-sense sequences. Elizabeth Banks really should stick to acting, as she hasn't directed a good movie YET.First off: The movie contains music from that awful skank & sexual predator 'nicki minaj'. Shame on Elizabeth Banks (who claims to be a feminist). Elizabeth's decision to directly support and encourage a female sexual predator is disgusting. Elizabeth should know better.In one 'action sequence' one of the Angels jumps into the air to dodge a table, yet the table wasn't even thrown at her yet... she jumps AND THEN the bad guy throws the table at her (and then she lands on the table)... so either the Angel has physic power and is able to read minds OR the action sequences in this movie suck and a turtle could choreograph better 'action sequences'.In another 'action sequence', an Audi Q5 does a sideways drift into a small table, hitting the small table and launching it through a shop window... the only problem is: How does the small table launch UPWARDS and through the shop window, if it was hit from the side? How does horizontal momentum from the car, suddenly translate into vertical momentum against the small table? MAGIC?!Also, the motorcycle sequences with the Angels is CGI and the helicopter sequence at the beginning is also CGI... surely it would be cheaper and BETTER for the movie, to just use a real motorcycle and a real helicopter?Also, the 'Jeep Tank' that the one badguy drives has bullet-proof plated armor, but it doesn't have run-flat tires?! I mean, come on!Also, the badguy doesn't hear a v-twin motorbike approaching at full speed? Is he deaf? You can hear that motorbike from literally a mile away, so how does the badguy get blindsided by it?I could really go on with listing all the idiotic plot-holes and senseless scenes in this movie, but my fingers are going to hate me afterwards... so long-story-short: Just avoid this movie. It's painful to watch.",Charlie's Angels

60,CANpatbuck3664,"Charlie's Angels is Slick, Fun and Empowering Even if the Appeal Doesn't Translate Across the Board",8,20 November 2019,"Rebooting Charlie's Angels was a surprising decision and I was skeptical of some of the casting choices for this movie. They definitely went their own direction which can be risky. Instead of completely flopping or uncovering genius, the result ended up in the middle. The best performance from the 3 leads was Ella Balinska as Jane, she comes across as the most believable of the 3 as an action heroine, she's got a lot of charisma and she's pretty natural acting against the rest of the cast. I still think Kristen Stewart was an odd choice but she won me over. She isn't done any favours in the beginning of the movie with how heavy handed the dialogue can be, but this was a good reminder of how talented (she sells the action and she's got decent comedic timing) and beautiful she is. I don't know if she'll ever get to be the A-list leading lady but she's great here and despite the widespread hate concerning Bella, she's proving her critics wrong. I've been a big fan of Elizabeth Banks for a long time, she flexes her muscles as a director and a writer but she turns in her typical excellent work as Bosley. She's strong when she needs to be, more heartfelt when the movie calls for it and she's always been funny. Patrick Stewart was a great get too, he's always cool and Angels benefits from his presence. Several members of the cast go overboard though. I was pretty taken aback by how off the mark Sam Claflin was, he needed to be on to sell his character twist and he missed the mark pretty bad. Ditto for Nat Faxton who just didn't quite hit the right notes either. The most notable might have been Naomi Scott. I've really liked in other stuff but she oversold her character's shock and awe to the point where I had a hard time taking Elena seriously. Also she has the hardest time with the comedic moments, its not that she isn't capable, they just didn't work for me.Elizabeth Banks is getting more experience as a director and this movie is shot pretty well. Its slick, it transitions from scene to scene seamlessly, the action is pretty good (its not on a John Wick level but that's a high bar to clear) and they have a couple of set pieces with some serious tension built in. There's the mix of exotic locations that you want in this genre and they're presented beautifully. They also weave in some comedic touches that function in their intended way. The only note I would make is that the soundtrack is a little overbearing, its not my preferred choice of music but they really blare it in and I couldn't tell if it was for the movie's sake or they were trying to market the soundtrack. Overall, Banks and her team acquitted themselves well, with the movie they put on the screen, you would think they were seasoned vets at delivering this kind of entertainment.I was also simultaneously pleasantly surprised and mildly disappointed in the Angels script. Its hard to create in this genre, if you go too realistic, its deemed ""boring"" and without imagination. Go too far into fantastical territory and you get laughed at and labelled as stupid. Angels isn't realistic but nothing was too outlandish that I couldn't suspend disbelief. I lack the tactile knowledge of how sources of energy can be manipulated to harm others so take that with a grain of salt but deep down, this is a spy movie and I'm willing to play along compared to other efforts in this vein (I still remember Die Another Day). I liked how they built each character with motivations you could relate to and their friendship grew in a way that I could understand. The actresses have chemistry but I could see why Sabina, Elena and Jade could be friends. I thought the movie lacked the subtlety in the beginning needed to effectively deliver the message (a lot of the male characters off the hop are so chauvinistic its laughable, but you can't deny there are those guys out there) but they turn it around and I also liked how they portrayed the Angels as strong but they still had compassion and vulnerability. Female action heroes are often written like emotionless robots, as if showing vulnerability takes away their ability to be respected but for me its the opposite, its about overcoming weaknesses or perceived flaws as opposed to pretending they don't exist. The movie also has a couple of big character twists, 1 worked better than the other for me. The dialogue is so HEAVY with exposition that it can become silly but it also takes away the surprise of those moments. The rule is supposed to be show don't tell and while you need some exposition, they really pour it in liberally at the beginning and it was too obvious for me.I understand some of the criticism being lobbed at this movie, I have my own points but the hate for this is more about the subject matter as opposed to the quality of the movie. Is this a perfect movie? Absolutely not, the exposition heavy dialogue that just won't quit, the weak spots in the acting and some implausible beats all are noticeable and did detract from the experience a bit. But the camaraderie between our 3-4 leads, the good spots in the acting, the character conflicts coming off more organic and some decent action are all there too. I wish it could be judged on its own merits but that's beating a dead horse. If you're open to it, the 2019 version of Charlie's Angels is a lot of fun, its more nuanced than the previous versions (I think most of us liked the Diaz, Liu, Barrymore team up but it hasn't aged well, I don't even remember the sequel) and its a good change of pace compared to the action blockbusters we've been getting lately. I would have been interested to see a sequel but judging by the box office performance, that's not going to happen. I'd grade this out at a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10. Not everyone is going to enjoy this movie but if you can put aside the movie's ""agenda"" (which is women can do anything men can, I don't understand what's so awful about that, even as a man) and you're in the mood for a fantastical spy romp, this is worth a watch.",Charlie's Angels
61,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,26 February 2020,"The stage curtains open ...After all these years, since their start in 1974, Charlie's Angels have gone international. And now, there's more than 3. In fact, there's even more than one Bosley. Yeah ... we've come a long way baby. Unfortunately, those are the only changes worth mentioning in this rather plain and uninspired piece of filmmaking.The Angels are at it again, doing their best to save the world from the latest threat - an energy conservation device called Calisto, if in the wrong hands, can be weaponized to kill. Aided by an engineer who helped to design and build the device, the Angels are thrown into one predicament after another in their pursuit of the prototypes before they are discovered by the bad guys. And the bad guys are not who you think they might be. Then again, they never are. There is action galore leading up the film's final confrontation and climactic finish.Sounds good, right? Eh ... not so much. This is just another yawner of an action fest. Nothing here is new or worth mentioning. There are some cool scenes, some witty banter, and a few over-the-top moments - and as such, it isn't necessarily bad. But, it isn't great either. It was just okay. It might even be worth a watch, if there is nothing else better to do.I can't recommend this one. The infusion of new blood is nice, and it was fun to see Patrick Stewart with a prominent role again. There is plenty of eye candy here, including the Angels themselves. It's obvious they have a chip on their shoulders this time around, which in the long run served to be more of a distraction than a statement. I might watch this one again someday, but if I don't, no matter. 6 stars out of 10.",Charlie's Angels

I'm a big movie buff, however, so I feel my reviews mean something, especially since I can *usually* nail down exactly what people will like and what they won't.That being said, there are a few scenes which could use work or seemed political, but the addition of guns to the Angel's arsenal made it a lot better of a movie. I enjoyed the gunfights, and mainly seem to remember the good ones being with Kristen Stewart and the black haired tall girl who did her own stunts (forgive me for forgetting her name, as she did an awesome job in almost every scene).I don't really understand the bad reviews, so I won't really address them, but I think it was just the addition of guns that people didn't like (but which I did, and think other people will too).The story was also pretty vanilla (bad guy steals technology from good guys to try to take over the world -- quite literally), but it's gotta be hard coming up with new stories all the time, and I feel they did a good job with the plot and story they were given.",Charlie's Angels

The action is very generic, especially the fight scenes which use fast cuts to obviously hide doubles so it becomes just lifeless and not exciting at all.

72,Magow-Intermean,Charlie's Angels Review,9,14 February 2020,"The Townsend agency is waving farewell to John Bosley (Patrick Stewart), and welcoming a new mission. When the dangerous potential of a sustainable energy project is harnessed by the wrong people, two Angels - Sabina (Kristen Stewart) and Jane (Ella Balinska) - must work with the young engineer, Elena (Naomi Scott), who created it to save the world.
Niceties are taken care of from the get-go: ""I think women can do anything,"" Kristen Stewart's Sabina Wilson tells a rich man she quickly ends up swindling. There was the fear that a new spin on Charlie's Angels could have fallen into a trap of performative, derivative feminism - but Elizabeth Banks' film puts its money where its mouth is, as these women do do so much, as well as just thinking about it.The premise is the same as ever: Charlie, never seen, only heard over an intercom, runs an agency of spies, assassins, masterminds. These are his angels. We meet two, hired on the same job, but certainly nowhere near soul sisters. There's Sabina, a sly but also silly rebel with a criminal record and enough comedic energy to power an entire country, and Jane (Balinska), a ruthless and devoted former MI6 agent - show-stopping newcomer Balinska really should be considered on the day when Bond finally is played by a woman.
It's a real joy to see Stewart actually having some fun - she's the ringleader of this new team, sparky enough to keep spirits up but never gimmicky to the point of derision. Balinska is a revelation - sophisticated and focussed in her mission, channelling severe power when required and bouncing off those around her with sensitivity and charm.
And the third angel? Well, it's not that easy. Scott, fresh from this year's Aladdin, finds her feet as the gifted engineer, both the target and crucial asset in the angels' latest job. She knows her craft well, but struggles in her position when her male boss fails to take notice of her warnings or, well, sheer existence. The gender dynamics feel different to those of the 2000 film - physical beauty was then used as the first and most obvious weapon by the angels, distracting men who couldn't stop looking at them. But now, in the age of mansplaining and major Fragile Ego syndrome, the fact that men can't take these women seriously, because they're not even acknowledging base-level worth, makes the conflict so much more rewarding.
These skirmishes play out in heavyweight, high-octane action sequences (an earsplitting roving shootout in Hamburg, an almost body-crushing face-off in a warehouse, a floodlit finale set to a Donna Summer banger). Even if the eventual outcome might hit familiar beats, every single fight on the way there feels like it could be the last.
Banks has always been one for well-designed characters and worlds - the wardrobe, geography and production design of this film are ambitiously stylish. The angels have tons of fun with sequined party attire and monochrome bodycon fighting gear, as well as candy-coloured disguises - bowl cuts and all. We get panoramic views of Hamburg and Istanbul, touching down in London but never settling long enough for things to get stale. The conventional makeover scene is zoomed in on, walking through the accessories but avoiding the cliché montage of a transformation. Whenever you think she's done enough, Banks comes back fighting. And then some.",Charlie's Angels
73,SnobReviews,Another reboot we didn't need.,2,19 March 2020,"Charlie's Angels"" is a little better than I anticipated but none the less still manages to bring nothing new to the franchise.
.
In this action-comedy based on the classic TV series, Charlie's Angels are called into action when a young systems engineer blows the whistle on a dangerous technology, putting their lives on the line to protect us all.
.
Elizabeth Banks' vision is fresh, bubbly and fierce but it goes nowhere. It feels as though a message wanted to be conveyed but it fails in the process of trying. The action sequences are decent and the female leads are quite solid but ultimately this reboot will remain on the back burner for me. Stick to watching the classic TV show or the films from the 2000's.

Oh, it is definitely bad.. I was just amazed at how little love was put into this. There are SO many bad decisions and lack of efforts that I was simply impressed. Even the editing was lacking!
It's such a weird mix of things. There is good production, locations and clothing. Yet the lightning in some scenes is awful (my brother thought I was watching a CBS movie). The action is REALLY bad and painfully slow. There is no camera work, or editing to help it.. so you can see how poorly choreographed it is. There is a scene where an Angel hits the gun off some guy with a pole, but you can clearly see it rebound in his hands before he finally lets it go. Didn't even have to use slow motion to notice it!! Yet there are a few moves (like 3) that look good on camera.The dialogue and the plot is also bad. The movie is a tad boring most of the time, and it meanders on nothing a lot. The high points are not enough to carry the movie. And the ""twist"" is not believable, as it isn't written to make sense if you watch it again.I quite liked Mr Hodak and Jonny Australia.. the bad guys that don't show up or talk much!! Those are the better characters. Though I admit I liked Kristen Stewart's energy and dynamism! ..yet her character was off putting at times with her personality.I'm not even going to go into the whole ""women power"" message that doesn't even develop properly..
Were the original Angel movies as campy? I think they were.. so this is kind of justified I guess.As a film buff, this is something to watch and comment with like-minded people. Specially for those involved in content making.",Charlie's Angels

The message isn't good shall prevail. It's not a moral tale or something with a good plot. It is really as bad as they say.Plot: Bosley is a just a code name. A whamen takes the mantle and their is betrayal and ""twists,"" and turns and money bad, capitalism bad, and women are in reality brilliant and beautiful and so on. That's literally the plot.Did you know women can beat well trained, muscular men? Did you know they can over power them? Did you know time stops during action fight scenes to explain how women escape? Did you know women can be funny? That was a trick, they are not and Charlie's Angels proved it.Poor editing or bad acting and script? That's the surface of how bad this movie is. Kristin Stewart look haggard, and most of the girls in the movie I would describe as past their prime. Naomi Scott is the story we are supposed to follow, but her skills are lacking from an acting stand point. I am not sure if it's the actress or the script.As mentioned, the entire movie is about agenda and the movie suffers heavily. The music also is empowerment.

Maybe it's the four years I spent in a really liberal university years ago, but man this movie was really dumb. It's almost at times like they're trying to sell you the ultra-liberal lifestyle at times, not just Sony products. The mantra of this movie is, if you can be annoying, be as annoying as you possibly can. Elizabeth Banks and the rest of the cast seem to be divorced from reality the whole time, not realizing most of working class America will never subscribe to this nonsense or be able to afford it.Worse yet, at times, the hypocrisy is unbearable. I'm not pro-gun, but the movie loves the use of guns, which really goes against Hollywood's beliefs. Also, for a film that tries to espouse liberal attitudes towards treating women, they loved to exploit their ""assets"" several times for eye candy. I mean, what do you want, to be treated as equals by men or to get their attention any way you can? I mean, sorry, I travel a lot, go to malls, piers, beaches, fly, I can only conclude the latter is the answer, but the media and Hollywood don't want you to believe that.Is it watchable?

Frankly, I didn't like it if the film's name wasn't Charlie's Angels probably not much to see, as the current box office figures are not positive at all.The story is very simple and certainly predictable they tried to surprise the audience, but we've already seen a lot of stories like this.

81,ginocox-206-336968,"Proves women can do anything, except make an exciting action film",1,19 February 2020,"Charlie's Angels (2019) fails to meet even the low expectations engendered by advanced publicity promoting a diverse group of angels and multiple Bosleys.A basic tenet of screenwriting is Show, Don't Tell, yet the opening six-minute focuses on a high-school-level debate on feminism versus anachronistic sexism, while an epic martial arts contest occurs largely offstage in the next room, shown only in quick cuts that fail to cast any light on the Who?, What?, Why?, or other questions germane to the nearly incomprehensible plot.Farrah Fawcett, who starred in the original television series, is considered one of the most beautiful and sexiest actresses of the 1970s. So Close (2002) features brilliant fight choreography involving former Playboy Hong Kong model Qi Shu. Beauty and martial arts skills are not mutually exclusive, yet films like Charlie's Angels seem to adopt the distinctly sexist view that (audiences believe) beauty is somehow incompatible with feminine strength, so cast what one might term chick-flick protagonists - girls who are attractive, but not so devastatingly beautiful or voluptuous as to be perceived as a competitive threat to females in the audience.This is not to suggest the actresses are the least bit unattractive, but none of the many angels possess the captivating beauty or sensuality of Qi Shu or Farrah Fawcett, and none flaunts it with a revealing outfit.The plot is an incoherent mess that seems strangely evocative of The Saint (1997), hobbled together with a mishmash of scenes that superficially resemble scenes from Mission Impossible, Kingsman: The Secret Service, and other popular films, with little purpose other than backdrops for exposition on feminist ideology with a healthy measure of misandry. The final insult to anybody who found the original television series amusing in a campy sort of way is a shot near the end utilizing a voice synthesizer.In a scene of unbridled absurdity, a professional assassin fires about a thousand rounds with a 6000-round-per-minute GE M134 minigun to little effect, but is defeated by an angel firing two rounds one-handed with a 9mm SIG-Sauer P250 Compact, while hanging precariously from a moving vehicle.The film is stylish with solid cinematography, but the constant social/political proselytizing seems incongruous with the campy comic book cosmos of reality. Like Ocean's 8, the film lacks a B-story to give emotional depth, but intimates a lesbian relationship between two of the leads. The violence is largely bloodless with no emotional consequences. Character arcs are virtually nonexistent, other than a sort of coming-of-age arc for a supporting character in a sidekick role - but even there, the shot at true love is abandoned in favor of radical feminism. Also like Ocean's 8, it aggressively avoids anything vaguely resembling sexiness. Efforts at playing the seductive vamp in the opening scene wouldn't even have raised an eyebrow among censors attempting to apply the Hayes Code in the 1930s, if it were not for the inclusive interracial relationship.In Never Say Never Again (1983), quartermaster Algernon comments to Bond (Sean Connery), ""Now you're on this, I hope we're going to have some gratuitous sex and violence."" Such a comment would never occur to the angels' quartermaster, who seems to be some sort of new-age eunuch, even though a bit of gratuitous sex and violence is precisely what Charlie's Angels lacks and desperately needs to counter the ceaseless onslaught of insipid exposition.Charlie's Angels opens with Sabina (Kristen Stewart) asserting, ""I think women can do anything."" Unfortunately, the female-led creative team failed to seize the opportunity to demonstrate that making entertaining action movies is among those abilities.",Charlie's Angels

83,Brooklynsmagicmike,"Movie itself isn't great, but isn't bad either.",6,24 March 2020,"As a big Charlies Angels fan over the years I always understand as guy that the movies itself will always cater more toward the female demographic. I don't mind that at all, as I'm not sexist and just watch movies I like always based on substance.I understand why this movie was panned people are tired of hollywood remaking movies and adding there new liberal spin on things. With that said I do agree that this movie had elements of that factored in quite bit but I'd prefer to disregard that and weigh the movie based on itself not that message it was trying to convey.
PROS- So first the action, It is pretty solid! Quite bit of scenes throughout the movie that were very throughly entertaining. Pacing of the movie was good as well did not feel like it went at snails pace it moved along. Kept me engaged throughout. The angels themselves considering one of the actresses has been around for while (Stewart) and other two are pretty much new and not well known did the best they could I felt like with source material. They diddn't have the barrymore/liu/diaz compatability but they still kept you entertained.CONS-The jokes were horrendous, I don't think I laughed one time throughout the entire movie. Story itself was very scatter shot ""This person is bad, no this one is bad, no its actually this one"" I feel like they tried to add twists and turns to spice up story but after awhile you were left sitting there asking why. Elizabeth banks producing and acting wise fumbled the whole movie. From her idiotic comments made surrounding it at the box office to her extremely wooden/cheesy acting I'm just not big fan of her and she herself doomed the movie from the start. I think if you keep same source material, tweak few things, and have totally different actress/producer this movie would done ALOT better.Overall though I'll give this movie 6 out of 10, not the worst flick you can watch if your bored with significant other. Just dont go in expecting to be completely overwhelmed.",Charlie's Angels

This reboot is directed and partly written and produced by Elizabeth Banks, the director of Pitch Perfect 2. Elizabeth Banks also plays a role in the film.In the film, the young IT person Elena Houghlin (Naomi Scott) discovers that the new digital emergency service in addition to domestic help such as controlling the light or temperature in the home has now become so powerful that it can be used to serve an entire apartment or neighborhood. . This emergency service has become so powerful that when it is hacked it can also be used in a dark way as a weapon. With this discovery, Elena comes in contact with the secret Charles Townsend organization. The organization recruits her as a new secret agent and together the former MI6 agent Jane Kano (Ella Balinska) and the rebellious Sabina Wilson (Kristen Steward) she forms the new secret agent team under the name Charlie's Angels. The Angels must now ensure that the digital emergency service does not fall into the wrong hands.With this reboot they put the film series in a modern twist and thus respond more to the topicality of the new feminist wave. They try to portray these female spies in an equally respectable way, such as the male spies such as James Bond or Jason Bourne. Although this film is a reboot, the film is also filled with connections to the old Charlie's Angels films and TV series. This way, fans of Charlie's Angels can recognize certain things again. Although they try to show with this film that women can also play good espionage action roles, the film has a somewhat simple and familiar story that has appeared in other espionage films before. For example, this film can quickly become familiar to fans of the espionage genre and so it seems a little obvious.Elizabeth Banks has never previously directed an action spy film for this film, which unfortunately can be seen in the action scenes in this film. Fighting scenes don't seem so realistic, because they are filmed scene by scene and these separate scenes are put together side by side. Unfortunately, the action scenes don't look that exciting, because the Angels' opponents are eliminated a bit too easily. Compared to the other actresses, Ella Balinska also does most of her stunts herself. The other two make more use of their stunt double, which unfortunately can sometimes be seen.Despite the lesser action scenes, the three actresses have good chemistry together and know how to play together or against each other. As the serious and more playful Angel, Ella Balinska and Kristen Steward cause mutual comic clashes. Naomi Scott also looks nice as the intelligent wisdom guy who tries to prove that she can also work well as a spy. Elizabeth Banks and Patrick Steward also look good in the film. The actors who play the criminal villains unfortunately come across more as standard bad guys from a spy thriller.",Charlie's Angels

in a time before john forsythe became known as the famous blake Carrington he was playing the role or should I say ""the voice"" of the captain (Charlie)of the famous angels......jaklyn smith, kate jackson and the rest of the gorgeous ""angels"" lived in an era we will never get back.
those legendairy series lasted for 5 seasons and cancelled at season 5 as original cast members started toleave the show even earlier than season 5 and we even got...mis Roberts as a new angel in season 5 but ratings were low and the show cancelled BUT thank god for the dvd era as we can watch them whenever we like.
I urge u to watch this series instead of this useless remake.
in 2000 we got the first remake movie with diaz and liew and a couple years later the sequel. those were passable...watchable....forgettable but at least were not insulting to the old tv series.
then in 2011 we got a remake series which were cancelled after....just 7 episodes a fact which tells u it's ""quality""
this new remake movie is the nail to the coffin......especially those who grew up in the 70s will leave the theater before the movie ends.....it's that bad.
bad acting....bad jokes...bad action scenes...nothing worked..zero chemistry.
this is not......Charlie's angels.so an advise especially for the old fans.

It stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska as the new generation of Angels who are working for a private detective agency named the Townsend Agency. The film is the third installment in the Charlie's Angels film series and serves as a continuation of the story that began with the television series of the same name by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, and the two previous theatrical films, Charlie's Angels (2000) and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003).Firstly, I wasn't shocked at this films extremely mixed reception as I remember the response to the original two Angels films being very similar, some loved it and some hated it. I personally like the first two films, they are flawed but a lot of fun too. This third instalment has some issues, but I didn't hate it like a lot of others did. The biggest issue is probably the film taking itself too seriously, the pacing is a little off and I think the film is miscast with the leads doing a respectable job. but in comparison to the film and tv series, they're no match.

90,darkreignn,"""More money, more horses!""",3,20 November 2019,"Let's get one thing straight: I want a girlfriend. Why do I bring this up? Because when the first scene of this movie flickered from the projector and lit up the screen, I was greeted with the sight of an absolutely gorgeously beautiful Kristen Stewart staring right into the camera, almost as if she was making eye contact with my very soul. And it was at this moment the crippling loneliness that one can only feel after being newly single for over one year resonated throughout my entire body and radiated into the very core of my being. I know I'll never get a chance to go on a date with Kristen Stewart, which is why I rated this movie a 3 out of 10.I'm kidding, at least about the reason why I'm rating this movie a 3 out of 10. Make no mistake, this movie is definitely a three, but not because of Kristen Stewart. In fact, she was the best part of this film. She was acting her *explitive* off with little quirks and nuances that were legitimately fun to watch, and she was the most entertaining and likeable character in this entire movie. Without Kristen Stewart, this movie would have been, frankly, irredeemable.""Charlie's Angels"" is full of cringe worthy exposition, embarrassing dialogue, and music so horrible that I wanted to rip my ears out during every single transition, because every single transition has some sort of ""trendy"" pop music playing. One man can only take so much cringe, and this movie spoon-fed it to me until I wanted to vomit, and then kept going. For example, the movie begins with Kristen Stewart staring right into the camera and saying, ""I think women can do anything,"" defending herself during a dialogue with an Asian man who's telling her how women shouldn't be electricians or plumbers or mechanics. We get it, you're a feminist. But if that heavy-handed women pandering wasn't enough, the opening credits to this movie, for literally no reason, has a few clumsily edited together clips of little girls playing sports, running around, and doing other ""manly"" things. Why? Little girls in soccer uniforms have nothing to do with Charlie's Angels or the movie in any conceivable way, and yet we're subjected to about 30 seconds of these pointless clips in the beginning of the movie. We get it, women can do anything, but how about you show us that instead of telling us that through lazy dialogue and unneeded scenes.But if you're going to see this movie, you're either going for eye candy or for action. And you get both, kind of. You see, yes, Kristen Stewart (take a shot everytime you see her name here if you want a fun drinking game and are feeling suicidal) looks absolutely breathtaking, especially in a scene where she is wearing short shorts. No doubt, that was my personal highlight of the movie, so if you're looking for eye candy, you'll get it. When it comes to action, there are a few action scenes, but none of them hit hard. They're either too sanitized to be suspenseful, or too shaky to be clearly viewed. And neither of those things makes for an entertaining viewing experience. And yes, Kristen Stewart does use her incredible physique to manipulate and overpower men (there was a scene involving her legs that made me highly consider losing no nut November), and even though I'd love it for her to try her moves on me too, it still didn't make up for the fact that every action scene was filmed like McG wet dream. And speaking of McG, if you were to tell me he came back to direct this movie, I wouldn't have even been surprised. The film feels like a cheesy early 2000's television action film, and I'm not sure if that was by design, or because of poor direction.Now, maybe I'm not the intended audience for this movie, but then again, Charlie's Angels was originally made for men to ogle at. Regardless, as I was watching this movie, I started to realize that if I were a 12-year-old kid I probably would have absolutely loved it. This isn't a knock on the movie at all, I'm just saying that it had all the ingredients of a movie a kid would find fast paced and badass. It's slick, it's shiny, and it has its fair share of mindless jokes that you'd hear on an elementary school playground, so if you're a child who's happening to be reading my review right now, by all means go watch this movie because I'm sure you'll have a great time.So would I recommend ""Charlie's Angels""? Ehh, not really. If you have children then I'd recommend you take them to see it because they'd probably have fun, or if you have a big crush on Kristen Stewart like I do then you should probably see this because you'll get to watch her romp around in skimpy clothing for an hour and a half, but other than that, there are much better things out to watch at the moment.3/10",Charlie's Angels

92,TheVictoriousV,"While sexists made the movie flop, I decided to be a good ally by seeing it and explaining WHY it sucks",3,18 November 2019,"Since Elizabeth Banks opined that the new Charlie's Angels flopped because of sexists refusing to see it, I decided to be a good ally for once and actually check it out, so that I can use arguments and textual evidence to tell you WHY it sucks. Now you'll have far more valid reasons to skip it! No need to thank me, Liz (whatsoever).I must also be a little bit contrarian, however, and suggest that the film's failure could also be attributed to Banks casting the Angels with such charisma vacuums as Kristen Stewart, releasing it the same weekend as Ford v. Ferrari, marketing the film poorly, writing it even more poorly, and all-around trying too hard to be edgy, along with the fact that not even the most zealous of Twitter feminists seem terribly peckish for another installment in this particular spy franchise (despite it being more overtly empowering and positive this time). These are just theories, mind.Even more cartoony than previous films, but also even more insistent we find these sexy agents super cool (in spite of the lines they're made to say and how we can tell, due to bad effects, that physics wouldn't remotely permit their combative feats), Charlie's Angels stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska as the main Angels. Director Banks plays a former Angel who now assists Charlie more closely, together with Djimon Hounsou. Noah Centineo and Sam Claflin appear as characters working alongside Scott's character, a scientist (she's not a proper ""Angel"" until later). Lastly, Patrick Stewart appears in all manners of delightful outfits.These are the top-billed stars, but we're also treated to such cartoonish caricatures of sexist males that I'm not really too shocked that even the woke journalists seemed uneager to champion this - at least from what I could see. It's a shame. They could've helped perpetuate the notion that this movie failed due to sexists refusing to pay for it, which would hardly be an effective boycott in the year that Captain Marvel was among the highest-grossing films. It's not the sexists; it's everyone else catching on that in-your-face girl power does not undo a film's issues.It didn't even help that the film was given a totally ""YAAAS"" soundtrack featuring such paragons of defiance as Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Kash Doll. One of the tracks is called ""Don't Call Me Angel"". I now wish the movie complied and was just named Charlie's, but in case that's too male-centric, it might also have been called absolutely nothing.Struggling to find positives, I decided to do Elizabeth Banks another solid and look up more favorable reviews to see what I may have missed. Roger Ebert's website (which gave full scores to things like Black Panther and The Last Jedi) is still the way it is, so I read the Christy Lemire review.She writes that the clothes are really nice, which I guess/assume is accurate. She says Banks' script couldn't be more ""McGuffin-y"" and I haven't surmised if that's a plus. Interestingly, she does note that the opening montage of random girls being awesome around the world seems heavy-handed and poorly sewn in, so it looks as if truly everyone is starting to get the idea. Then again, perhaps the film would have been a 4 instead of a 3 if this montage was excluded?Really, I think the Universe was trying to tell us something when John Forsythe, the voice of Charlie in the original show as well as the McG films, left the mortal plane. Oh, not that the franchise needs to die, but rather that we need to move on from digitally reanimating dead celebrities for the sake of nostalgia bucks (à la Peter Cushing in Rogue One and soon James Dean) and create sophisticated deep-fake text-to-speech programs that can keep voice talents ""alive past death"" too. And they say having children is the most surefire way of keeping yourself in this world.And there we are.

But it was exactly what I thought it was going to be and Hollywood has to see the backlash and start living in reality. No one has issues with strong realistic women. There is a LONG list of great action movies with female leads.But they are getting tried of the lame women tropes. For instance: women that are 90 lbs beating guys up. That isn't realistic unless the woman has super powers. So STOP It. Women have natural attributes that can allow them to best men but they aren't brute force. So stop selling this ridiculous tripe.Remakes. My god no one wanted a reboot of this franchise. Frankly the entire idea is sort of outdated. After all in a story that is supposedly about female empowerment the title is ""Charlie's"" Angels. The lack of creativity and poor choices of Hollywood is becoming scary. There are plenty of movies out there that could have amazing reboots but Hollywood is even so lazy they don't even look for them.Also, finally, I do not happen to think the women in this movie are good looking. The Woke mentality has seeped into everything and it is forming forced visions of beauty. Unfortunately the rest of us aren't woke.

96,solojere,A Somewhat Entertaining Mess,4,20 September 2021,"Elizbeth Banks and I have a love-hate relationship. On the one hand, she has directed great films like Pitch Perfect 2, and on the other hand, she has films like this one. First, let me say it wasn't all bad, and it's certainly not a 1, but it has a tone of flaws that makes the film a mess overall. Spoiler warning as I break down what I feel works and doesn't work.First, let me start with what I thought worked:The action sequences were pretty entertaining even if they were over the top at times (It's Charlie's Angles, after all. What more could you ask for?).Kristen Stewart's character was actually pretty funny, and I thought she had amazing chemistry with Naomi Scott (They should've been a coupe).Hailee Steinfeld has a cameo, and it is literary the cutest thing in the entire world. I wish that she had been one of the main angles. I think she would have really elevated the film. But at least, she won't have to take crap for being in this film as only those who watched to the end and her super fans will even know she is in it.Here is a shortlist of what didn't work as there are too many flaws to lists.Kristen Stewart's character is supposed to be a lesbian, but they never do anything with that other than her checking out other women from time to time. Like why not have her character get with Naomi Scott's character? It would've been so cute and made us care more about the characters.Outside of Kristen Stewart and Naomi's chemistry, the casting isn't great. Ella Balinska's performance was so wooden it hurt at times. How did she even get the role? She has done like nothing else, which is saying something (and sadly, she may not be able to recover from this film, but I hope I'm wrong in saying that). Elizabeth Banks tries way too hard, and it's clear that she was way too invested in her character, looking perfect for making her feel like a real, flawed person. And the great Patrick Stewart feels like he decided to just phone this one in. I would have rather seen a few more experienced actors take to be cast as the lead angles. I. E. Hailee Steinfeld. The plot still would've sucked, but good actors can really elevate a film. Although if Patrick Stewart can't help this film, maybe no one canThe plot is paper-thin. Naomi's character discovers a flaw in a man-run company and goes to the angels for help. They uncover a major coverup and must save the world. N the process, she becomes an angel. The stakes are supposed to be high, but I never really worried about the character, nor did I think they were ever in real danger. It is so predictable and goes on forever.Elizbeth Banks' character should've been the bad guy. A fallen Angle ;) would have provided a contrast to the angles, and it would have shown a broader possible range of famine identity. Plus, it would've been a good twist as Patrick Stewart being the main villain, was way too predictable, and it really took away from the film for me. It also would've made the film feel less anti-men.Every male stereotype ever is in this movie, from mansplaining to men who only see women as objects. There are literally too many to list. This is fine every so often in a film or tv show. In this film, after a while, it gets old and feels preachy even if you agree with what the film is saying. We get it there is gender inequality in the US, and we have a long way to go, but creating a film where all the men are either dumb, sexist, or evil isn't going to solve the film, especially since a lot of men refused to see this film in the first place. (Also, I hate that Elizabeth Banks deflected any and all criticism this film received as men just hating movies made by women. Like own up to the fact your film had flaws, girl!)And of course, Charlie is actually an older woman, like really? And if you are going to make that change, have the voice over the radio be a woman's voice. What would be the point of making the voice a man?Also, there are like a million Angles, which makes the main characters seem a little irrelevant. Like they could die, and there would still be a tone of other angels.I could keep going, but those are the main flaws.In conclusion, it was the worst film ever and probably worth watching even once, but it definitely has major flaws and needs a few rewrites.",Charlie's Angels

103,RhapsodyReviews,So Much Potential. Misplaced.,5,7 December 2019,"Review:
'Charlie's Angels' is a action-comedy film directed by Elizabeth Banks. It is the third installment in the 'Charlie's Angels' film series and serves as a continuation of the story that began with the television series of the same name.
Going into this movie I was fairly excited because I thought the trailer showed promise and I knew Elizabeth Banks can do comedy with the 'Pitch Perfect' film series. I ultimately left a little disappointed with this film.
The film stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska as the new generation of Angels who are working for a private detective agency under its leader, Charlie Townsend.
The acting on most levels is sub par given the amount of talent on screen. Only one person really brought their character to life and that was Kristen Stewart. She was fantastic in this movie. Every time there was a decent action scene, she was in it, whenever I found myself giving a little chuckle is was from what she said and how to came across saying it. She is an underrated actress for sure and I'm excited to see what she brings in the future. Unfortunately, aside form her the other characters really fell flat, and I actually despised Ella Balinska's character, Jane. She plays one of the Angels, but she isn't likable in the least.
I also didn't buy into the 'bad guy' in the film. It's really one note and typical, but it's never really explained why he or she is doing what they're doing. The movie is classified as an action-comedy, but the action sequences aren't very exciting, and the humor hardly hits. I know I'm saying a lot of negatives about this movie, but I didn't hate it. I can just see room for improvement, and I think if it was handled by another director, say one who knows action, it could have been better. It almost seemed like Banks wanted to create a film to show the true power women have, but in doing so the entertainment value of the film suffered. I just don't think this was the right type of movie to do that in.
Overall, I think the movie was made as a statement more so than it was to entertain people. Kristen Stewart was great in the movie, but not enough to give it a good rating.

Not just a good cast, a HOT Cast! This film, on the other hand, is filled with no talents that I wouldn't take to a dogfight if they were the defending champions. With a terrible plot, formulaic dialog, and a whole lot of BS rolled into another blob of celluloid I'm not surprised that this film had an $8 million dollar opening weekend. And I could hardly sit through it myself. Save your money and rent or buy the last series. You'll thank yourselves for doing so!",Charlie's Angels

No pace, no proper streamline and no work done to make it better. Seemed like copied from n number of sources to come up with a whole new trash. Kristen Stewart seems faded, Elizabeth Banks wanted to do something and failed and other casts were just dumb acting. Watched for like fifteen minutes, went out for popcorn, came back after ten minutes and couldn't wait long to leave again.

106,fleck05-485-208981,Hey Charlie's Angel. Farva grins & winks.,1,26 November 2019,"Oh Super Troopers... now that was a good laugh! I thought this movie would be funny, too. Nope. This movie is a complete s**t show!
Where to start... I didn't go in expecting much - I had a free pass and figured there'd be some action, pretty women and humor because Elizabeth Banks wrote it. (Pitch Perfect was way funnier than I expected when I stumbled across it. I thought it was funny because of Banks, but it may have been funny in spite of her...)
Bank's biggest concern in her writing duties was to a feminist message and Hollywood peer admiration, not an entertaining movie.
My first red flag should have been the overly-excited critics. Since they are snobby jackwagons who look down their noses at comedy, fawning critics should have clued me in there'd be no humor. Also, the glee with which critics wrote about the positive feminist message should have been a big red flag, too. If a movie sucks, but has a pro-Hollywood/socialist/feminism message, the professional critics first loyalty is to a movie's political correctness and diversity, not story.
I'm usually on the lookout for critics saying a movie is sophisticated - that means snoozefest. I should have noticed too many critics wrote positive reviews. A truly fun, entertaining Charlie's Angels movie should leave most critics disgusted. This was unfunny, boring, tripe with endless exposition about female yadda yadda something... I'm not sure... I pretty much checked out mentally early on. I sat there thinking, I knew better than to see this... even for free!
Critics don't give high scores to hot, funny women running around with sexy outfits; they give high scores to the opposite of those things. Hence, Kristen Stewart as an ""Angel."" That should have been my biggest red flag from the start.
Who reads these scripts before spending millions? Anyone outside of LA? Never let Banks near writing software again. Just have her act and say words written by funny, smart people that know how to craft a story. Or let her cater - she's probably a decent cook. But please, no more writing.",Charlie's Angels
107,rdamian1963,Downhill,2,3 April 2021,I don't get the 10 ratings. This is a pretty bad movie. Acting is poor and the script is horrible. It has a few entertaining moments but for the most part this movie just doesn't cut it. Sometimes it is just better to let a franchise die than try to keep it going with a major disappointment.,Charlie's Angels
108,kuangzao,Worth a watch if you like the trailer.,5,19 April 2020,"If you're looking for some chewing gum for the eyeballs, this fits right in. The women are dangerously hot and the storyy is okay. Worth a watch if you like the trailer.",Charlie's Angels
109,plasticanimalz,Was Actually Worse Than I Expected,4,29 March 2020,"The trailer didn't look good so I didn't see this in the theater. My curiosity was peaked as I was a fan of the original TV show when I was a kid, and really enjoyed the first Charlie's Angel's movie, but Full Throttle, not so much, so I rented it. I understand with all the A-list stars doing TV shows it's hard to get them for films, I just expected bigger casting for this as it was a successful franchise. Jane, the Lucy Liu replacement is nice to look at but is about as bland as cardboard and her acting is not much better. When she was crying in a scene I thought she was faking it because it was so bad it seemed like a joke. Elena, who is the Drew Barrymore replacement looks like a Sarah Michelle Gellar knockoff with little of SMG's Buffy charm and quips. She's just kind of bland. She seems more suited for sit-coms where not as much is expected of her. I liked K Stew, and she had some moments in here, but, the script and the actresses she was working against didn't give her much to work with.Basically, the way they've been doing movies for the past 5+ years of doing action sequence storyboards with the director, then hire a screenwriter later does not work. Movies have just been sucking hard. I find so many action films frivolous and boring. I haven't outgrown them, 'cause every once in a while there will be a good one, like John Wick, or a fun one, like the Jumanji reboot. This was pretty light on action for an Angels movie and the action there was you couldn't see any of it 'cause all the shots were tight. And the weird scene with the gatlin gun in the Jeep was just the villain taking a shot, then Jane, then villain, then back and forth. It was really poorly done and I'm not buying anyone would go to such extremes to kill a civilian like Elena. It came off very cartoonish.The only scene in the entire movie I liked was when all the girls dressed alike. That was fun. But that was it. I was just bored. I didn't want to finish it but I did. They really hammered the whole girl power, men are pigs thing a bit too much. It's like, I get it. It would have been nice to give the audience a little more credit that we don't need a hammer to the head. I found it more regressive than progressive. Funny that I feel like the one from 19 years ago was more empowering than this one that clearly was supposed to be a feminist trope. The 2000 version had villains but it wasn't men bad women good. The 2019 version was much too female neanderthal for my taste.And what was with all the killing and deaths? I don't remember anyone dying in the old versions. Charlie's Angels is supposed to be fun and light. Definitely not appropriate for young girls, which is when I was first introduced to the franchise. It's a shame. Take away, despite the Pitch Perfect franchise being fantastic, and Elizabeth Banks a really talented actress, action is not for everybody. Comedy and action films are made very differently and you need to understand stunts, storyboarding, VFX, green screens, etc. There's a lot more to it. I just think she took on too much before she was ready. I would like to see more of her work, this was just not a win. I did like her in Brightburn. Now, that was much better than expected.",Charlie's Angels

112,eelen-seth,Entertaining and action packed!,7,13 November 2019,"In a world full of superheroes and James Bond's, more female role models rise - and it's about time! The 'Charlie's Angels'-brand has stood the test of time and with every generation, a trio of badass, independent women get chosen to become the face of the Townsend Agency.When Elena (Naomi Scott), a young systems engineer, blows the whistle on a dangerous technology, Charlie's Angels are called into action, putting their lives on the line to protect us all. After the OG Bosley (Patrick Stewart) retires and another Paris-based Bosley gets killed on the job in Hamburg, first Angel ever to get promoted to Bosley (Elizabeth Banks), becomes caretaker of our duo of Angels, Sabina (Kristen Stewart) and Jane (Ella Balinska). We get to join in on the action, city-hopping from Berlin to London, Istanbul and the 'Night of the Stars' Gala in Chamonix. These lady spies are on a mission, and they won't stop until they've pleased Charlie.Director, writer and producer Elizabeth Banks is known for starring in a lot of comedies. She more recently also directed Pitch Perfect 2. Her direction is decent, but Charlie's Angels could've benefited from a tighter editing-job. There's too much jumping around between cities in the first half and everything looks as if it's filmed in the same city. The films action sequences - and there's a lot of them - are solid and very well choreographed. As a fan of the previous Charlie's Angels films (starring legends Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore), I would've liked it to be a bit more camp, though Banks doesn't entirely shy away from it, and also knows how to be funny.Together with Evan Spiliotopoulos (live action 'Beauty and the Beast') and David Auburn (The Lake House), they know how to keep a powerful feminist action comedy engaging for two hours, by releasing compelling twists and almost turning the story into a modern whodunnit. A discussion about a classic film getting connected to Birdman and Batman, turns into a serious back-and-forth between our main ladies that made the entire audience at the screening I attended cheer. And a cute interaction between handsome, geeky science boy Langston (Noah Centineo) and Jane will for sure make many girls squeal in their seats.To solely state that Kristen Stewart (Twilight-franchise) is the true MVP of this new chapter in the franchise, is maybe unfair of me, because Ella Balinksa (The Athena) and Naomi Scott (Aladdin) are each in their own way just as good. Stewart is interestingly enough the funniest of the band, after always being portrayed in the media as uptight and having no emotions, and this could once and for all prove those who thought she couldn't act, wrong. Stewart has been active in smaller indie films ever since her ""Bella-years"" and has by now proven herself to be an acting genius. Time for the main audience to acknowledge her talent. Ella Balinska is a genuine surprise as leading lady, always ready to fight. With her more emotional arc, she gets to showcase her talents a bit more than others, and truly is a bright star in the making. We all know Naomi Scott has the range, and most of all, is having fun. These three women have some serious chemistry going on, and it's contagious. Hell, even Patrick Stewart seems to be having the time of his life as Bosley, with some great one liners to prove it.As far as the well promoted soundtrack goes, it fits with the film, although it cheapens the final product a bit. Every new scene starts with a new song, as if a jukebox controls the story. Luckily Banks turns the choppy first half, which feels like one long music video, into a genuinely entertaining second half, with lots of great set pieces - such as a big party set in a mansion, which raises the stakes - and an enjoyable, cameo-filled segment during the credits, that will make you want to sign up to this agency immediately.",Charlie's Angels

But I guess it was too harsh on Elizabeth Banks as the movie was not that bad when you compare it with its previous installments as it was a reboot and first build-up part is always little weak as character's are in their making phase. The problem of the movie was in its thrill part where plot twist didn't landed as it should've otherwise performance's from ladies were good specifically in their fight sequences which movie essentially requires.

121,just_in_case,I was entertained.,7,17 February 2020,"When I checked imdb to do this review I was surprised to see such a low score and page after page of 1/10 reviews.. aaaand then I read them and of course it's just incessant yammering about wokeness or whatever. As an adult man it makes me sad to see guys get bent out of shape about girl power. The worst part of it is..there isn't really any of that in the movie. It's just peppy spy girls. There's a scene at the beginning that's kind of an empty montage of girls being awesome. That's about it for wokeness. It didn't bother me anymore than being forced to sit through Michael Bay montages of pumped dude's prepping for battle. People need to get over themselves.Anyhoo -I'll be honest this is not my favored genre, sorta generic action flick. I decided to check this out because I'd heard rumors Kristen Stewart acts in this. As for cons in this film, that false rumor is at the top of my list. I'm not sure if she's bad or if it's the writing, but her character seems under written. She's supposed to be a quirky weirdo, like a Ryan Reynolds character, but her lines are flat and inconsistent. Not quite nails on a chalkboard, but enough to make you wonder when and where you were supposed to chuckle. It's stands out because everybody else is pretty consistent and they play into their character types well.The movie itself is fine, lots of really well choreographed chase, fighting and shooting scenes. The story is pretty throw away, but there's a couple twists that elevate to something more engrossing that a typical action flick. I think without that I would have been a little bored.Johnathan Tucker stands out a mute oddjob type henchman and man he nails it. Equal parts terrifying and gentlemanly.The girls are fine, Naomi scott being the most entertaining I think I just wish their characters were a little more fleshout and the jokes were a little better written, especially whatever Kristen Stewarts character was supposed to be.7/10 It didn't ruin my day and I don't desperately wish I could get my two hours back.",Charlie's Angels

The plot takes place quite quickly and I have a feeling that they tried to show it a bit in the style of some light comedy, unfortunately they didn't succeed. The plot is interesting and in parts quite tense. So what is it that spoils the experience? The first and sure thing is that this film fights the popularity of its previous more popular movies and tv show, that impression runs through the entire film. The previous parts weren't anything extra either, in my opinion they were mediocre time killers, still interesting to watch. If rated this as a separate film that has nothing to do with its predecessors, the result would surely have been different (better). There is some average mediocre acting going through the film (some better some worse), the choice of actors just didn't sit well with me, one of the worst choices is definitely Kristine Stewart who doesn't fit into the whole situation at all.",Charlie's Angels
123,casablancavic,This review is from a guy,8,7 April 2020,"So, sitting at home with a bunch of time on my hands now that the world has turned to rot - and watched a few movies.Yesterday I watched HUSTLERS - which I found to be very insulting to women and men in general and rated that very low.Tonight I watched Charlie's Angels -with kristen Stewert. Not bad.Not fantastic, not the best movie I've ever seen - but not bad.Far better than the ones with Drew Barrymore in early 2000's. Better dialogue, better scenes, not as much stupidity and better plot.Yes, this had some flaws which I won't bother to type, but it was more enjoyable to me.I did not find it demeaning to men. I didn't feel like I lost any of my masculinity in any fashion - and if any guys feel that way, you have some serious issues to deal with mentally. If a movie with a few women as leads makes you feel so inferior because of that - you should seriously seek mental professional help.I'm a guy, I enjoyed it. It was entertaining and while so many people are bashing Kristen Stewart - while she will never be the woman I think is the most exceptional actress, she is fine for her roles - and she is fine here as well. In fact, she may have been better here than any other role she was in.She also looked pretty hot.Elizabeth Banks directed a decent movie - and I can't put it in the same grade as Terminator or Terminator 2 or a bunch of others which I think are just pretty awesome on so many levels, but it was well done enough to be entertaining.This version was so much far better than that hot mess of a version with Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lui and Drew Barrymore and times far better than the second that they made.Hopefully, her next Charlie's Angels will be as good or better than this - and it would be advisable to have Gina Gerson and Charlize Theron in it - because they are so awesome.Yeah the movie was good, the comedy timing was good, the effects were good - everything passed as it should. It succeeded were so many other movies I've seen failed.In comparison to John Wick 3, this is far better - with a far better plot - as John Wick 3 has no plot and is just a boring overblown ridiculous bunch of bullsht.",Charlie's Angels

132,chrisrowexxx,Mostly terrible with flashes of average,2,31 March 2020,"Let me preface this by saying I'm sick of the men vs women stuff in film and tv, roles should be given on ability and nothing else, the real problem is the amount of untalented women getting prominent roles for no other reason than being attractive, take the actress Ella here, not sure if it was the accent she failed at but she was terrible, no presence, no charisma, just eye candy which is a real shame, especially compared to Kristen who was the bright spot in this, the miserable character gone she was really funny in this. She was the only thing that made this bearable.Rest of the acting was mediocre to bad with a few funny cameos, Patrick was terrible in this, time for him to retire,really weak performance, anyway to get to the crux of the film, poor story, mumbling dialogue and the worst modern age cgi I have seen in a film In years, I'm talking 1996 type bad cgi, it was cringe and ruined every decent set piece, if it was a spoor it needed more humour but as an action film it's genuinely awful.Why is a women filled film ok but male ones are scoffed at, yet this is proof yet again that things are going in a backward direction, hire the right people, not the most attractive, men and women are equal but I'm genuinely more tired of terrible shallow casting.Avoid this utter tripe. Bar Kristen I'd say the worst collection of acting I've seen in a modern film, awful set pieces glorified with terrible effects making the whole films tacky mess.

135,richarddillomes,"Fun, fearless females doing it for themselves.",7,26 April 2020,"Too Doo Doo, Duh Dii Duh, Too Doo Doo...Did I get the iconic Charlie's Angels' theme song? No? That's okay because the latest movie adaptation kinda somewhat also didn't, BUT! - it doesn't mean you should easily dismiss it for what it was trying to accomplish. You know how the recent Star Wars movie also didn't measure up to its forefathers aside from the fact that the writers messed up the storyline? It's because they were trying to move away from the original that the hardcore fans were having abandonment issues. It's the same here. I haven't seen the TV show so the comparison would be to the epochal trio that started the film franchise, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. The 2000 and 2003 installments (there were speculations of a third one but failed to materialize due to massive salary jumps and other alleged issues on the set) are now considered classics and highly revered, but also problematic. They were fun, the ladies had real chemistry and the visuals were insane at the time of their release, but it probably won't fly in today's hypercritical atmosphere.In most of her interviews, Elizabeth Banks, the director-writer-producer-actress shared how she envisioned the reboot to be: a franchise of Charlie's Angels movies in a MCU setup and the idea of getting different Angels in other countries is very bold and exciting. This is very evident when in one scene we see a lot of Bosleys in different shapes and sizes. The idea of Angels helping the Bonds and the Hunts of the world is big and imposing - coming from a female writer/director. She defended her movie's less than stellar box-office numbers compared to Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel, as in her opinion they are female-led movies within a male universe (DCEU and MCU) so some guys watched it because they have to, not necessarily because they wanted to. She has a point. Her jump-off point was 17 years ago. While the world was her oyster, people were still expecting the girls from 2000 to show up (and there were talks but Banks said it didn't feel right but it's certainly something they want to do in the future, if there will be any) and when they didn't, they lost that set of the audience. They also lost some women audience when they did not agree how all the male roles were dumbed down to uplift the women in the story. I mean one major villain only had one speaking line: B*tch. The rest of the audience didn't bite because A.) Kristen Stewart has not been generally liked since after Twilight mostly because she couldn't care less of what people think of her. There's also that she's openly bisexual which doesn't necessarily fit the mold of how Angels usually look like. She also revealed she was told to not be out in public if she ever wants a role in the MCU. B.) It was okay to star the movie with relatively unknows but Ella Balinska was a suitable fill-in for the leggy Cameron Diaz minus the charm. Naomi Scott was an okay choice but if compared to Lucy Liu, she did not stand out. Kristen was kooky, her comic timing is off and she is not necessarily as funny as Drew. There will be comparisons and the new cast did not measure up, I did not make this rule.Oh the movie, how was it you ask? All things said notwithstanding, it's a good movie if you're looking for an enjoyable time. You have costumes, riveting action sequences, male eye-candy (hello Noah Centineo and Jonathan Tucker, minus points for lack of shirtless scenes), cool soundtrack (executive produced by Arianna Grande) and a dancefloor scene! I mean what else can you ask for? It was just unfortunate that Banks had the right ideas at the wrong time. For a movie that was already struggling to mark its own identity, Banks came on too strong which drowned her decent output. I really hope there'll be another one soon, maybe go with a UK or an Asian chapter and incorporate Banks' ideas, alongside reading the moviegoers' temperament. I'd rather she slowly moves the needle instead of being replaced with someone else who will most likely give us your usual blow-by-numbers (hello Michael Bay school of cinema) action movies.",Charlie's Angels
136,GavWaskett,Good Morning Angels!,6,13 September 2020,"In the film industry today, it seems that every film is up for a remake or a sequel, Charlie's Angels was always going to be on the list, the films with Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Lui were hugely successful and starred some of the early 2000s film powerhouses. This version doesn't have that kind of star power behind it, so hasn't received the publicity of the previous incantations.The film follows a very successful Angels scheme, monitored by Bosley - Patrick Stewart and his mini-Bosleys, first and foremost is Eliizabeth Banks who has also written and directed this film. Their primary team of Angels are up against it, as there is espionage, treachery, fights and fun. You get what you expect from a Charlie's Angels film, bright colourful nonsense full of exceedingly unlikely action sequences and improbable plot points, but it is enjoyable fun.Patrick Stewart is also good value for money and Elizabeth Banks has her trade mark snidely funny hint to her Bosley but also shows what a talented director and writer she is. As for the Angels themselves well you have Kristen Stewart, as previously mentioned in my review of Underwater, I've never been a big fan, but she is growing on me, she's not a great action star but is definitely showing potential and she is energetically likeable in this as the livewire Angel. Naomi Scott is brainy Angel and is an actress who is building up a good resume and is showing she can turn her hand to different types of film and has come a long way since Terra Nova. Finally, there is Ella Balinska as Ninja Angel. She is the standout performer for me, hopefully she'll should have a very good career as an action star.
Now, don't get me wrong, there is plenty in this film which will have people face palming or whinging about, but if you take it for a film that is there to entertain and to be bright and silly in its action and its plot, then you'll have an enjoyable couple of hours. A fun 13/20 for this remake, its not going to worry fans of the 2000 but has little links to that film and the TV series as well as modern day culture icons to bring a smile to your face.",Charlie's Angels

A plot that is often a little forced and too convenient. A very weak plot twist. A weak climax. However, the film is excessively preachy, to the point where it becomes extremely annoying. Every man in the story is evil. Every woman is good. Every woman can beat any man with no problem. Every woman can outsmart any man. Every woman is unstoppable, while every man is pathetic at best. There are some scenes that are very cringy, like the sequence of just girls running and playing in the first 10 minutes, trying to be a motivational sort of sequence.

139,andrewmerritt-31652,This is not Charlie's Angels,1,8 December 2019,"Charlie's Angels stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Ella Balinska, and is directed by Elizabeth Banks. This Charlie's Angels is a reboot to the 2000 film with Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu and the original tv series. In this Charlie's Angels movie the spies are tasked with recovering a new and improved energy source before it gets into the wrong hands. Have you ever seen a more shallow, disgusting depiction of Charlie's Angels cause I have. The whole movie is just about feminism and girl power to the point where they have to shove this subject down our throats, that we become completely exhausted. I'm not expecting much of Charlie's Angels, but enough with the overuse of feminism and girl power. I'm expecting a Charlie's Angels movie that has I can turn off my brain and enjoy it for what is is. But I got none of that with this at all. It felt like I was watching a really bad episode of Keeping up with the Kardashians without the action, the gadgets, and everything I love about Charlie's Angels. And that's not what Charlie's Angels is about. To me, this kind of felt like it was all about Elizabeth Banks as she had control over everything and gave off that my way or the highway attitude and gave the cast with nothin to work with. Now if she was the villain the whole movie that would've been cool, but spoilers it's not. Instead it feels like she gave the audience the middle finger with a message that says that women are more superior than men. And if that's what the message you're going with, no wonder men and women are going to hate this film, and then later it's all men's fault because they're anti feminism. And that to me is a really poor depiction of women because women aren't like that and men love women who are tough too, like Sarah Connor, Lara Croft, and Wonder Woman. Those women are great examples that women and men should look up to because they tell, but don't show. Unlike Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinska, who are trying way too hard to be perfect examples of strong female driven characters. So in the end, this is the most disastrous, disappointing movie of 2019 and go watch the show, the 2000 film or the sequel cause this is not the Charlie's Angels I remember.",Charlie's Angels

You have to wonder what the people who made this were thinking and,2,4 September 2020,"What the film makers must have been telling each other as production went along for this complete waste of technology to ever get made. Since there's nothing in the movie to think about - it's an intellectual void with literally nothing there but some people moving around and occasionally talking - so naturally my mind went to the thought processes it must have taken to get this turd made. What sorts of lies, exaggerations, half-truths were going around during the production for everyone to delude themselves so completely while earning the pay-check on the production crew making this thing.
Ultimately though, listing what's wrong with this movie just takes too much effort for what it is: a total cinematic failure, no more no less. It isn't the first time this happened, naturally, and it isn't unique as far as the history of American cinema goes - except now we have sites like IMDB where people with no agenda nor axe to grind, like me, can tell you to do the smart thing and just stay far away from this mess.

147,Wikkid_Gamez,Everyone is way too hard on this movie...,10,21 February 2020,"All I have to say is that this movie proves that people just love to hate and discriminate against certain actors/actresses smh. Yes its another reboot, who cares? How many decades has it been since the last? It was a fun movie, the acting was just fine but apparently people are never going to let Kristen Stewart live down her part from the Twilight Saga. Yes, she was awkward af in those movies but hello, the character was awkward af in the books. She played the part perfectly and anyone that had actually read the books before the movies came out would know that. Besides even those movies themselves were done over a decade ago and she has been in a number of other things both before and after those movies. Get over it people.The acting was good, the movie was entertaining enough for what it was, its not like any of the Charlie's Angels movies, spin offs or shows were award worthy. They were always just purely entertainment for a short while and this movie holds up to the others just fine. Lots of great actors/actresses in it, entertaining enough story. It is definitely a solid 5-6 star worthy and I am tempted to overrate it just to try and help counter all of the smashing being done against it by people that just want to be nasty over it for no reason. There are two types of haters here. The first half all anyone has to do is look up basically any movie with Kristen Stewart to see that she is obviously unfairly discriminated against by idiots everywhere that just need a focal point for their anger. Although why they chose to target her and not someone else from the movies, go figure. The second half addressing gender swaps in movies lately, why so much hate over it? Is it really that important that its a MAN in those parts? Maybe that type of attitude is EXACTLY why the swap was done in the first place. That aside following the storyline from the original show till now it actually makes perfect sense that the Angels would eventually inherit the whole business/empire whatevs after Charlie died as he trusted them all so much. Companies continue on after founders die, that's just how it goes. Back to the gender swapping. No one seemed to care when it came to the remake of The Mummy which in and of itself was a complete joke if compared to the original movies, or even the last remake before this one that was the best remake in the history or remakes as far as I'm concerned, Brendan Fraser's Mummy beats Tom Cruise's hands down.

148,Eclectic-Boogaloo,Better than advertised,6,21 November 2019,"""You hid a person in my Louis XIV?!""Charlie's Angel's gets my (straight male) Seal of Approval. See... we don't all hate female driven movies. Just the bad ones ;)What I liked most about it was the clever plot and Elizabeth Banks' strong direction, which was good even in the action scenes. Now i'll address the girl power stuff for a moment: That element was definitely there but it was mostly early in the movie and not ""in your face,"" so it wasn't that bad. The only distracting thing was that a few of the female empowerment moments were not organic to the story and felt like they were sprinkled on just to make a point, which no matter how well intentioned is always bad. But It didn't ruin the movie for me. Not even close.That's because these Angels had a few surprises up their sleeves. The script had a very clever misdirection that setup a satisfying twist (I'll spoil neither). So all and all I thought Charlie's Angels was a good, NOT great movie. The issues I think kept it from being great were the tone of the movie and its cast.It didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be a serious action flick or a comedy. Seeing these skinny little girls beating up big dudes is not believable, and the movie wasn't sure if it wanted to play that aspect straight or have fun with it like the Barrymore/Diaz/Liu 2000s versions did. I think it had to pick a tone and stick with it. Not try to do both. And the second issue was that the movie was either miscast or used the actors in the wrong way. They were too small and skinny for it to be believable that they could beat up a bunch of big dudes, which is why they should have considered a more comedic tone. Kristin Stewart and the other actresses are simply too scrawny. And specifically, K-Stew was given much too much liberty too improvise and ""be herself.""She's a terrific actress but NOT a movie star. She's better when she's in a more understated dramatic role.

166,Web_Of_Doom,Worst remake I have ever seen of any genre!,1,31 July 2020,"I feel sorry for all the previous Charlie's Angel films/TV shows, actors & actresses, as this film is abysmal.
The special effects are all good ( from a professional special effects team point of view ), however the really terrible script, total lack of believability, total lack of any decent humour & some incredibly bad acting means there are no redeeming factors you can accept still.
For such a big budget the quality is shockingly bad.
Elizabeth Banks as the Director & co-writer of the screenplay must take 90% of the blame for this disaster of a movie, as she had the power & responsibility to protect this genre which for all her good intentions no doubt you have to say Elizabeth Banks totally blew it.
The other 10% of the blame must go to one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen by Kristen Stewart, who simply is not believable in her acting.
If like me you are a fan of Charlie's Angels the original TV show & the good movies made in the years 2000 + 2003 with Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu & Cameron Diaz which were all entertaining, my advice is to forget this movie was ever made ( unless you need to see for yourself just how incredibly bad a movie this really is ).
I really hope lessons are learned here & the Charlie's Angels genre is not cashed in on again in the future, as we need believable female role models in our movies.
If they do remake Charlie's Angels again it really should be a TV show that has no connect to this movie at all.
Though for some people this movie may have killed the genre, but personally I think a well written TV show with a good sense of humour that is believable is probably the best way this iconic genre could be rebooted.",Charlie's Angels

It can not only dress up the toilet head, but also control the evening dress, can not only skydiving at high altitude, but also chase the horse on the horse, not only can solve the tricks of the fighting killer, but also can bury the thoughts of comrades in arms. Only in this way can I calmly say that the man was still saying love you yesterday, and today he will want to kill you and realize what he has learned.

Thankfully this gets toned down after the first ten minutes and becomes more enjoyable. This movie is just dumb fun and if you go in expecting that, it'll do the job. The film definitely gets better as it goes along, so if your pissed off at first, I'd say give the rest of the film a chance.Sure I could criticize the amount of cliches/tropes, jokes that didn't work (some made me laugh tbh), head scratching twists, shotty camera work and bland direction but there's a sense of fun which kinda counterbalances it. This could've turned out way worse then it did and I'm happy to say it's not that bad. If your on the fence about seeing this, i'd say give it a try.Also, if this is how Noah Centineo redeems himself after Swiped then I'm all here for it.",Charlie's Angels

You don't have to be a man or look like a man to make a quality movie or tough character, you can't blame men for your own failure. - some of my favorite movies have female leads and I am perfectly fine with that.Besides 'even' if this had good looking female actors or men actors this movie would still be terrible since it has no creativity behind the script, no talent behind the acting, no new ideas, poor directing and poor editing, pathetic uneducated one liners, it's just a political disguise to push some nonsense message across which still makes no sense, eventually when all these movie flops start adding up Hollywood will need to take a new direction, I mean this is seriously bad, how can anyone put their name on this and be proud?, its a embarrassment I would be ashamed to have my name in the credits.Just to mention it's pretty pathetic to pay for imdb reviews to bump the rating up. start making quality movies, and stop paying for 2cent scripts with political agendas.Anyways go watch the new Jay and Silent Bob (2020) it has a good explanation of reboots and remakes lol.",Charlie's Angels
170,vuileharry,No. Not so good.,4,4 June 2020,"Let's get this out of the way first: yes, I am a man. And I am all fine for feminism. I freaking love present-day movies with cool, hot-ass women! Seriously... love them.
BUT. The movie still needs to be good.Take that first 2000 Charlies Angels movie with Drew Barrymore and such. Such a cool, fun movie with cool women I can still watch that every now and then because it's just really entertaining. This one? No, not so much.My biggest problem with this movie is just the action man. The action scenes and fighting sequences are all so cliche, totally uncreative, boring, and poorly edited, that they kept losing my attention all the time! And since those make for such a big part of this movie you can understand how that is already a huge problem. I also thought music choice was often really poor too.Then the main cast. I do really like Kristen Stewart. Not gonna say she's the most brilliant actress I've ever seen but that girl definitely has something man. Naomi Scott I could really enjoy. Wouldn't mind seeing her in another movie again. Ella Balinska just hardly made any impression on me at all. And Elizabeth Banks always has this problem for me that, even in interviews, she always seems to be performing this 'act' of herself. Like as if she's just unable to ever be relaxed, open and real for even a second. And thus, also in her roles, she always come off a bit 'fake' and forced to me.Dudes, I really hate these men that seem completely 'feminism'-frustrated, that would call this movie 'an insult to men' or other dramatic nonsense like that...

Maybe he's not the best director but he made mildly stimulating, cheesy films that can be called entertainment. The new 2019 reboot is certainly not entertainment. It has very poorly directed action scenes and the acting is awful for the most part, especially from Kirsten Stewart. It might not be her fault, it might just be the dialogue but her character is so painfully unfunny I cringed and rolled my eyes multiple times. Her whole character is based around the fact that she speaks her mind and loves food which Elizabeth Banks clearly thought was the pinnacle of comedy, The other two Angels are bearable I guess but the chemistry between all three of them is non-existent. My favorite character in the movie was the silent henchman because he had zero dialogue and thus didn't have to spout any lines from the appalling script. There's not much else to say other than I don't recommend it and anyone who values their time, money and sanity will avoid this film.",Charlie's Angels

It was action packed and fun! It makes the original series canon as well as the 2000s films. The only complaint I have is the writing dealing with the character of Patrick Stewart's Bosley.",Charlie's Angels
173,Nighthawk1,Charlie's Angels reboot not a total waste but close to it,4,14 November 2019,"I was underwhelmed by Charlie's Angels. Lead actresses were miscast. No way was it believable that Kristen Stewart could beat anyone up in this film, too small, too thin, and the other two actresses couldn't either. Some may find it fun and diverting, but I found it to be superficial, overlong, and more often than not boring. Occasionally there was a funny line said by a cast member, or a scene is mildly engaging, and there is something to enjoy about it momentarily, but a lot of it felt monotonous and tedious.Nothing new or original, more of a rehash of the 2000 Charlie's Angels reboot with less likable actors.I was happy to see Patrick Stewart in this film until his role was squandered. It is a shame that his role was written so poorly. Patrick Stewart could have been utilized much better.The plot was almost non-existent and what was there was just an excuse for the actresses to show off and joke around. I did not find this to be entertaining enough, the way that it was done, but other less demanding viewers would probably be fine with this aspect of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to be a classic of any kind; I just wanted it to be more exciting and interesting. It doesn't seem to have much of a purpose except to try to get more money from consumers from an aging franchise.I will say that the actresses tried hard and had some decent chemistry together, but they are not given a lot to work with in this film. Action scenes were not very exciting, very generic. Could have had potential with a better script, a more skillful director than Elizabeth Banks, coherent story, and stronger action scenes would have helped improve the movie.",Charlie's Angels

But when I finally did watch it, I was pleasantly surprised how much more enjoyable it was. Sure some parts where a bit predictable, but the action scenes and the funny moments between the characters comes frequent enough that it kept me entertained. A credit to the director, Elizabeth Banks.I particularly liked Kristen Stewart's portrayal of her character. A mixture of bad-ass, and funny girl.

Lots of cheesy dialogue, and Patrick Stewart, well, the less said about his bit the better, totally hamming it up and probably taking the Michael on the quiet. Just another throwaway action movie using a classic theme to lull you into a false sense of security.

178,alexkzapf,Pure garbage,1,28 November 2019,"Action movies work because the protagonist, or protagonists, have to overcome inherent weaknesses. A movie such as this, where the main characters are shown to be ""perfect"" in every way, just doesn't allow you to feel for the characters because there is no struggle. I like Elizabeth Banks. I think she is a good actress. But. I would tell her to watch The Raid, The Raid 2, maybe even Die Hard. As the story unfolds, you have a character being put in a situation no one should be and having to grow and go against odds that seem insurmountable. They come out bruised, battered, and changed forever. Rama and John don't have the luxury of being perfect or unbeatable. That is why we cheer when they succeed. And we want them to. Because I small part of us wins too. I don't play video games with cheat codes because it cheapens the experience. So please Hollywood. Stop making drivel like this. Stop thinking we are all stupid and you think you know what we want to see. And for God Sakes, stop rebooting franchises just for the sake of making them pc and ultra woke. I don't want a female James Bond. I don't need Charlie's Angels to be perfect and completely void of any men in them. Maybe Drew, Cameron, and Lucy can be convinced to make a reboot. I enjoyed those. Not because there where men in those movies. But. Because they stayed close to the source material and did not Bash our brains in with pc garbage. Oh. And just in case. Here are a few movies with strong female leads. And how you should make action movies. Original Charlie's Angels movie, Alita Battle Angel, Resident Evil franchise, Terminator 1 and 2, Lara Croft, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, GOT series although would be considered ensemble cast still strong female characters, Golden Girls while not action had strong female characters and an amazing show, Halloween. I know it's horror, I could go on. But I think I made my point. And. This movie failed because it appealed to no one. But it's creators.

I knew this new sequel wasn't gonna be that (just because that wouldn't work in 2019, even though I would die for a true sequel with Diaz, Barrymore and Lui back), and based on the trailer I went in with low expectations, but I was gonna give it a shot.So... the premise is ok, but nothing really new. Characters are pretty weak, very little character development on any of them, and the chemistry between the lead girls is seriously lacking. Kristen Stewart is the strongest character (to my surprise). There were some references and nods to previous installments including the 70s tv series, and I appreciate the effort they made to take all that history into the agency 2.0.BUT, the most disappointing part of this film was the action sequences. The previous films didn't use guns, so there were so much stunt moves and great action sequences of the girls just kicking ass, but in this one there was a lot of shooting. I've seen that thousands of times before, and I don't get why they made a point about not using guns in the previous films, but now they're using guns again... it just doesn't make it as exciting for me.So overall an OK-ish sequel with a couple good moments and some good nods to previous films and the series, but it doesn't come close to the campy entertainment we've gotten before.",Charlie's Angels
181,olivewahh,A chick fighting film with an undeserved popular franchise title,3,13 November 2019,"Now I'm a huge fan of the last two films with Cameron, Drew and Lucy so instantly I was a little nervous for this reboot with three new Angels.Sadly this reboot is nothing like the previous two films. I struggled to see any strong chemistry between the girls, and just felt like they were three different individuals doing their own thing on the same mission.
I applaud Elizabeth Banks for having her hands all over this project, but she needed to take about 100 steps back from the acting part, and maybe some of the script writing too. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Elizabeth Banks but her as Bosley... Ugh! The movie is about Charlie's Angel's.. Not Bosley's Angels. Elizabeth's character was there in ever scene, every mission, every single moment, that she was almost trying to be one of the Angels.
Going back to this being Charlie's Angels.. The movie barely even mentions him and you have to wait till a end credit scene to hear the famous line ""good morning Angels"".I can see where Elizabeth was heading with this film making it a strong female message but this is such a iconic franchise that some changes should not have been made.Surprisingly Kristen Stewart was actually decent in this film and was the glue to the film.

But the movie is just an attempt of a providing a new episode to the popular movies of the 2000s, and consequently an extension of the television series and their spin-offs crime fighting shows. And it fails. It would have been much better if the movie had completely no connection to its predecessors. I am happy to say that this 2019 movie did have some potential, but not for the big screen. With alterations and improvement to the dull script, this movie could have been better (and felt like) as a television series pilot.

But somehow the news got to me that this was such a bad, bad, bad film. How? The anti-propaganda must have been very strong. The women behind this film must have stepped on some long toes in the industry. So reluctantly I started to watch it on Netflix. It is refreshing to have strong intelligent, resilient women in a film. All of them. Not being exploited for their sexuality, emotions or submissiveness. Some people in here say they are taking men down? Please, as if this didn't happen to female characters for like in the past 100 years. It is a slapstick action film, or over the top camp action. It succeeds! It IS entertaining! It is well directed, well edited, well acted. A good film for women and girls to see. Finally women going against male dominance, in film, society, culture, business and politics. Well done! And please make a part 2, 3 and 4. And more if you want. I am sure it'll catch on.

It really isn't as bad as the reviews will have you believe, it is what I deem a popcorn movie, buy a bucket and just switch off and enjoy, it's not like the original series or the earlier Diaz, Barrymore and lui films were exactly citizen kane.
Stewart is fine in it as are her co stars, the action is good, it has some funny lines, and all in all it was better than than Diaz etc. Films imho, it wasn't too long and the action flowed quite nicely, the story was ok, a bit unbelievable, but its Charlie's Angel's, so what do you expect, if you want to just switch off your brain for a couple of hours then go and see it, it is quite fun",Charlie's Angels
188,h-62007-26888,The backlash is a little much,5,3 June 2021,"I'm not gonna lie, this was my first exposure to Charlie's Angels. I've never seen the Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore films from the early 2000s, so this is new to me. And after seeing the 2019 film for the first time, I can now say with confidence that the Charlie's Angels are...meh.In terms of what the film is presenting, it's nothing really cringy like what other female-led action films present, but it does have some serious issues. One is that it does take ideas from other movies I've seen and like a little more, which includes Mission: Impossible, The Man From UNCLE, and Birds of Prey. With Mission: Impossible, it's a team of spies who set out on missions in disguise to fight evil that also never leave a trace. With The Man From UNCLE, it's a spy caper with a rather snarky tone used to deliver comedy that might be catered towards adults. And with Birds of Prey, it's a team of extraordinary women who work together to take on serious threats while also dealing with the world they live in complete with a non-stop reminder of female empowerment, which I feel like might not appeal to everyone with how long it goes for.With all these ideas put together, it should have the right materials to make for some good entertainment. Well...sorta??? Okay, here's the thing. All they're doing is fighting an evil CEO who wants to sell out a brand of electricity to the world that can actually kill people when activated. If this were an episode of the original 60s show, it'd be fine. In a modernized movie released in 2019, though, it's...honestly really stupid. Like, with what came out of this main story, it makes me feel like Gemini Man did a better job handling a plot. Also, some of the other story elements aren't that strong, like too many side plots with easily predictable outcomes, flat humor that mainly relies on one-liners and novelty of the actors, and forgettable characters who only exist just to give the movie some heroes and villains.BUT...if you don't care about what's wrong with the story, then you should have a bit of an easier time with this movie in regards to THE ACTION SCENES. The times when our Angels would join forces and fight the villains in fast-paced, expertly choreographed fighting scenes. If you don't watch these movies for the story, the action does do you some favors, especially when it benefits from solid sound editing and a large sense of intensity where even they do have predictable outcomes, it can be hard to wonder when the odds look pretty one-sided.And then there is the acting, which is...relatively mixed. I mean, some of the actors are pretty good like Djimon Hounsou, Sam Clafin, and Elizabeth Banks, while others either rely on the actors they're playing or just show zero emotion, such as Jonathan Tucker and Patrick Stewart. And then there is the subject of our three leads, whom I will discuss one paragraph at a time.Ella Balinska is...fine. Her character is not really that good, mostly being a serious athlete who looks up to her colleagues during missions, even growing a heart towards her first ally, Sabina Wilson. In terms of Balinska's acting, it's just okay. It isn't really great, but there's not much to really complain about. I'm sure Balinska is an amazing actress in real life and has made some great work, it's just that immediately jumping into a franchise other people hate probably wasn't the best idea to boost her image.Naomi Scott is probably the most tolerable of all the actresses playing the angels, but there is a big catch to it. Although she does have the talent to be a great actress, her problem is that she's playing one of the most cookie-cutter versions of an underdog. Someone who's pulled into espionage with no experience and a lot of fear of death before finally facing her fears and doing what's right. In terms of her acting, she did a good job, and I'm proud of her for it. It's just that for 2019, I'd rather call her Princess Jasmine than Elena Houghlin.And in terms of Kristen Stewart...Sabina was probably not the right role for her to play. Whenever you see her name pop up in a movie, you would most likely first associate Kristen with the Twilight Saga, a cringy vampire romance with some of the most polarizing reactions I've ever seen, most of which are caused by the actress having a neutral expression on her face and sometimes looking like she just found out her goldfish died, a similar feeling to when you see Russell Crowe in a movie as well. In here, it's a bit different. Instead of having her little ""Kristen Stewart-isms"", Kristen plays Sabina as a more eccentric, smart-alec type character, where she would most likely deliver comedy. I'm not saying she did anything wrong; this isn't a bad direction and Stewart's acting here is pretty good; it's just compared to other movies I've seen, this isn't really the Kristen Stewart I'm used to, and the only thing saying it's her is her face and hairdo.My conclusion? Terrible story with great action and strange casting choices. If you want all of that for a movie, then this is what you get.",Charlie's Angels
189,popcolin,"Stop the hate, please",10,21 February 2020,"Yeah this movie isn't groundbreaking and it seems as though a lot of reviews here have more of an issue with what the director said about not liking the movie because it is a female cast. I think she made her point pretty well if everyone is talking about it so much, fueling the exact same thing she was talking about and letting the complainers prove what she said was probably true but no ones going to admit to it.Hating a movie just because it is not amazing does not give you the right to say that ""because women are showing off they need to impress us men"". The movie is showing off female empowerment, unlike the original reboot that was just about watching the girls spread their legs in every karate stance imaginable for us to pause with our TV's to. That movie was not groundbreaking or progressive but this movie, just for the point that women are EQUAL, not better than men, brings attention to a good point we need to discuss in our society.Of course they need to make it in a movie that is entertaining and for my money: yes, they most certainly was a lot of fun to watch. They took us all over the world, car chases, fight scenes all in a high quality package that felt like it is current.So the people reviewing this movie a ""1"" are doing it purely for hate and I'm not sure why. The movie is not terrible so all these people rating below 5 stars I don't think understand they are disliking it for another reason that is not the film itself. Could this be greedy Hollywood or reboots? I doubt that because that's never stopped being a problem. I think people rating this movie one stars are really trying to say that they don't like the fact that there are so many women on the screen. Don't go see the movie if that how you think. And I doubt that all 700 of these reviews even watched the movie, a lot of people just seem out of by the lady-power. But do not think that just because you gave an opinion it is right or justified.Movies like these help society move forward by gaining a lot of publicity to otherwise disregarded opinions like that of how women do not feel as respected as their male counterparts. The only reason I rated this a 10 was to help it standout in a sea of 1,2,3 star reviews. More modestly this movie is a 6, because it moves quickly, looks beautiful, and the story they were trying to say has been said a million times but I still found it fun to watch.I'll just end this by saying think about why you actually dislike the movie. If it is poor performances or problems with the script then that's fine. But stop blaming the cast and director just because they were the parts you saw. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people worked on this movie and supported it and they got all of you to see it in some capacity. It's a job that I think has some impact on society and it's up to the viewer to figure out what it means to them. This movie, as are all the female cast reboots, are a great step forward, hopefully leading us to a world with no hate. Thanks for reading.",Charlie's Angels

The women were not amazing soies before they became angels. This is where all the movies are missing the point. The angels were not super here and they were not the best at their job. They actually sucked at their job because they were never meant to be in those so called women jobs. This is where ever movie has failed that is why the movies suck. The only reason the first Charlie angel did well, was not because the movie was good because they had massive stars. But after people realize how they missed the point of the whole tv series the next one bombed and people are refusing to be fooled. This tv show can't be rebooted if you are not planning to keep up with the orginal concept. Make this movie as a 80's time period and keep with the same concept. Forget about the political concept.

192,OlgaGorelik,Humor and humanity.,7,11 December 2019,"I don't usually see movies like Charlie's Angels. By choice. They just don't appeal to me. Which is why I thought I wouldn't like it. Might also be the reason I actually enjoyed it. A lot. Unlike the connoisseurs of the genre, I wasn't expecting anything. What I found was, for starters, a compelling and timely premise. Sure, we haven't had a buggy device actually weaponized in real life. Yet. But it is known that our over-computerized cars and appliances can be hacked and turned into who knows what. And then there was that Boeing thing. A manager taking credit for his subordinate's achievement and having it bite him in the rear was a brilliant touch, if a bit harsh. I found the story engrossing and surprisingly logical. The twist was unexpected. But I think what really makes the whole thing work is the three main characters as well as Elizabeth Banks' Bosley coming across as so endearingly human. And I loved how Sabina (marvelous Kristen Stewart) with her street urchin habits turned out to have come from money, while fearless, tough as nails Jane (Ella Balinska - a revelation) proved to be the most sensitive one. Oddly, Elena (Naomi Scott), arguably the most realistic character of the bunch, felt the least real. Regardless, the whole cast deserves a credit for what is probably the movie's most appealing quality - humor. It's not easy to make me laugh. I dislike slapstick and hate toilet humor, so common in movies. Thankfully, in Charlie's Angels it was neither. Not that it was always particularly smart, but the setup and delivery made me laugh out loud even at silly lines like, ""Did the rookie just tranq herself?""Action is something I really don't care for. I found some fight scenes overly long, but appreciated the relative realism of them - beats the kind where we see a few swishes of the limbs and a half dozen men drop like flies, like in the beginning of the movie. It makes sense that a woman, no matter how highly trained, would struggle with a trained male assassin. Unfortunately overall the movie makes its feminist point rather heavy handedly. I was relieved that Elena's interactions with creepy Ralph (David Schutter) and her thinking that her boss (Nat Faxon) is flirting with her weren't over emphasized as MeToo teachable moments. But I couldn't help noticing that all male characters, with the exception of two minor ones are either evil or stupid, or, in case of Elena's big boss Alexander Brok (Sam Claflin like you've never seen him before) - both. Female characters though? All heroes.",Charlie's Angels
193,Randy_Dreammaker,Spice Girls Get Physical,6,5 March 2020,"What do you get when you mix a solid TV series and movie and mix it with the Spice Girls? You get Charlie's Angels (2019)This movie, as it's ratings on IMDB indicate, is below the standard set by the original Charlie's Angels TV series and first movie.Very girl power themed, which will alienate a lot of viewers, with Spice Girls like characters. Over all it's not completely horrible, but it's just not what someone who has any history with the series, will be expecting.Some of the CGI car chase scenes are really poorly done with the characters stretching and bodies moving in ways that are highly unrealistic.The over all story is pretty solid and reasonably decent, with a good twist, and it was nice to see Patrick Stewart back on the big screen.Young girls and teenagers will probably find this movie entertaining.",Charlie's Angels

Personally, I'm not a fan of the other movies but I did watch them, and I'm not a fan of Kristen Stewart either (and my wife isn't either so she didn't bother watching it).First off, I found Kristen Stewart to be very likable and enjoyed watching her. Actually found that the team chemistry was way better than the previous older films. And the opening action sequences were fantastic, but then it goes straight into this weird girls / women empowerment montage. And then into multiple sexual harassment / women can't do anything settings that it started becoming preachy. Perhaps not as preachy as the Ghostbusters remake.The movie's first half is pretty excellent and it feels like a genuine female team James Bond meets Oceans 11 (or I guess 8). And then it starts to slip and the finale just didn't work as well as I would have liked. Overall it's decent and hopefully they make a sequel.",Charlie's Angels

Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lui are all that and then someDo not make a film with man-hating women. Who act and look like feeble little boys. Who can then somehow take out an entire room of grown burly men without breaking a sweat yet looking like they have done no martial arts training whatsoever. But just because they are women they don&#39;t need any of that they are stronger than 10 men. Why would any man ever want to see that? And if they did want to see that, it would be disturbing. As it would mean they have a thing for little boys not women.I mean fine you want to make a film with women. Have them be realistic women. Have them be properly trained in martial arts. Have them be muscular. Have them take hits and damage but still win through. Have them be real to life women; Vasquez from Aliens, Sarah Conner from Terminator 2.

199,kmjnhh123,So Predictable.... & That's It,3,31 December 2019,"Not much to say about this film but as how predictable the plot of this film was, it could of been so much better rather going down the usual plot route of a good guy turns bad inside a corporation.It's a shame they have used the ""Charlie's Angel's"" name because they have ruined its hope now, hopefully they will make another one, BUT actually make it good.Theres just no sustenance in the film, jokes are minimal, acting isn't great, usual mild action here & there & not much else.As for the director of the film blaming men for not wanting to watch women on the screen she could be not more wrong, as a guy i actually prefer women on the screen to men, but at the end of the day its about the writing of the film rather than just the actors.Just look at these great women film franchises, Tomb Raider, Underworld Films, Wonder Women, Black Widow, Frozen, Dark Phoenix & even the 3 recent Star Wars films with Rae as the main protagonist & even the various TV shows with women leads. Look at them examples & learn from them.Age - 25

205,imjaredross,A Reboot without a Spark,5,18 November 2019,"Charlie's Angels is the newest sequel/reboot of the films directed by McG as well as the campy series of the same name. This time Elizabeth Banks is at the help and tries to give us a fun and silly spy film filled with feminist ideas, which isn't a bad thing in concept, but in execution it just doesn't work. Banks has mistaken themes over fun and the two just do not mix. Charlie's Angels is for the most part devoid of fun, takes itself to seriously at times and handles its message in a very mishandled and lazy way.I'm not going to pretend like the previous Charlie's Angels films are great cinema. They are far from it, but they were fun, schlocky movies that new what they were and never took themselves too seriously. This new reboot/remakes does not. In fact it makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously. Now, this could be done. There are plenty of remakes/reboots/sequels that have reinvented themselves into something new and different, but Banks's script doesn't allow for this. Banks has instead made and incredibly bland and unremarkable film that only has one thing going for it and that is its new feminist angle. However, Banks fails to implement this in a clever or meaningful way and it ends up feeling forced and amateur.This years Late Night, written by Mindy Kaling had a feminist edge to it about working in the workplace and it handled it so much better. Kaling has proven herself in the past to be a very clever writer and Late Night ended up being a very fun and poignant film with similar themes this film wants to explore, but it is handled in a much worse way. Banks has stated that her film is filled with ""sneaky feminist ideas"", but there's nothing sneaky about it. It's so in your face, it comes off as a parody of itself.What about the rest of the film? It's mostly just standard, bland and very boring. The film takes forty minutes of its near 2 hour runtime to truly get started and still finds time to waste time. The original McG films lacked in plot, but made up for it with fun action beats happening every second. This film instead has very little going on.Now, some have actually criticized the acting of this film, however I found it fine. Our three main leads to an alright job with the script they're given and find ways to have fun with it, but the best stuff is watching the actors work off of one another. The action scenes are also choppy and chaotic, but there's a few moments where there was some potential and some alright choreography, but mostly it just ends up feeling very bland.Charlie's Angels is not a total disaster, but it's not a good film either. It mistakes topical themes for story and character and fails to give those themes real meaning. It is mostly just a bland generic action film that is ultimately just very forgettable. It feels amateurish in many respects and just ends up feeling like a complete waste of time.",Charlie's Angels

212,ukxenafan1,Entertaining,10,29 November 2019,"First off, this is NOT A 10/10 movie but the blatantly biased reviews had me rooting for it. The film isn't bad, it's ok, but I was disappointed with a few elements. Firstly the casting was not quite right. Kristen Stewart looked impossibly glamorous throughout and was quirky and fun. Maybe they spent the budget persuading her to do a dumb action film as the other two angels were not at her level of charisma and recognisable star power. Best of the others is Naomi Scott, who is quite appealing as the scientist the angels end up helping. She's a bit eccentric but, of course, super pretty! For me the charisma vacuum was Ella Balinska. She was clearly cast for her height and looks and is fine I think the action scenes but her acting was wooden and generally cringey! Charlie's Angels needs a balanced team and someone like Gugu Mbatha Raw, Zendaya would have given the trio a better balance. You need someone up to Stewart's level of talent but a strong action woman who takes the lead.
The other gap is some real wit and verve. Elizabeth Banks is talented but a script polish to put some life into the dialogue would have been helpful.
Still, it was an enjoyable romp. Loved the end scenes of Elena training with a bunch of awesome ladies in little cameos. More of that would have been good.",Charlie's Angels

Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Terminator, James Bond, Ghostbusters etc. ALL of these were some of my favorite franchise growing up. This is no exception to Charlies Angel, which I LOVED the original movie and the TV show. So why, why, WHY did this have to happen? Has Hollywood run dry on ideas and are now desperate to find something new to make? Is that it? Is that's why they needed to resurrect this franchise with an all-female reboot to fit in with the apparent ""new"" Hollywood today? They did this already with Ghostbusters 2016 and it FAILED!! So WHY?!?! What happened to just making creative stories? Is it THAT hard???I recently watched this with my roommate for her birthday and she rented it. I started with the mindset that I was gonna hate it because I purposely ignored this movie dead on arrival. And now, after being forced to watch it I'm pissed. Why is Kristen Stewart still hired for acting roles? She has the emotional levity of stale bread. And that stale bread is a better actor. The other actors are just as awful. The plot was terrible, the comedy was just as bad. As a woman, I felt embarrassed by this movie and I don't claim this movie. It's horrible.Also, WHY is Sir Patrick Stewart, one of the most respected actors of all time a part of this?!?!? It's like watching Ian Mckellan in Cats. It's unbelievable. Who are their agents? They need to be FIRED for humiliating them by putting them up to this. Seriously. Patrick Stewart shouldn't have been demoted down to a Kristen ""I can't act to save my life"" Stewart's movies. He's way better than that. He didn't deserve this humiliation. I just HATE it!I want to say something nice, but I can't. This is seriously one of the worst things I've seen in my life. And that's saying a lot because I've seen the destruction of many of my favorite franchises in one single blow. But for 2019, I'm really believing that this movie competes with Cats for the worst movie of 2019. Gosh...DON'T watch it!

This movie was as good as any of the best episodes of the original.
Now to be fair, that's a positive and a negative, because... well... it was only as good as one of the best episodes, but with a much bigger budget.
I think that the people who really hate this movie are acting like trolls, but at the same time, the director's defense has been to accuse movie goers of not liking movies about strong women. I feel the need to mention Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Atomic Blonde, any Underworld movie, Lara Croft, Hunger Games, Kill Bill, La Femme Nikita, any Resident Evil movie, any Alien movie, and Terminator 2.

This new version remains in this spirit. And this new trio is excellent, but not as iconic as the old one. Kristen Stewart is very adept at comedy, and I want to see more of it, it's like this role is create for her (she's really an actress that I love more and more). In conclusion ? Charlie's Angels is a fun, goofy action film, that celebrates female empowerment with some bad-ass Angels in Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott & Ella Balinska. Stewart stole every scene and clearly had a ball. It's not perfect, it's predictable, but it's a fun popcorn flick.",Charlie's Angels

Djimon Honsou plays the other Bosley who dies in the middle of the film somewhere in the Second Act. The Third Act they try to play it up like Oceans Eight. Danica Patrick, Hailee Steinfeld, and Michael Strahan the tv host of Good Morning America was invited by Elizabeth Banks to be a cameo Bosley. Ronda Rousey, Danica Patrick, and original Charlie's Angels show up at the end as Angels training new Angels at their Academy. Elizabeth Banks invited Hailee Steinfeld from Pitch Perfect 3 to be an Angel. Drew Barrymore is a Producer for the film for the first time she had no ideas shared in her Charlie's Angels film with Lucy Liu and the other Angel.

Don't know who greenlit the script, but he/she should be fired, and who would have approved a reboot of this property by a very unexperienced director in comedy/action AND let her write AND star in it (even though as the actress she wasn't that bad, should also not be in charge of producing movies..

I agree that these kind of movies need no logic, and we only need some properly executed action for the sake of the action. But, unfortunately that didn't happen at all.All the cast members are lazy as hell, even when they are running. They didn't even put any effort at all especially Kristen Stewart. It is clearly visible when she is riding the horse. She needs a stunt double even for such a kindergarten stunt. Ella balinska has the physicality but expressionless all through. And Naomi Scott, it's best not to talk about her.Even if there is no story, an apt cast and one or two properly choreographed action episodes are expected out of these kind of movies. I'm giving 4 stars which is only for the soundtrack which is good when compared to the movie.In my opinion drew Barrymore's version of Charlie's Angels is far more better than this porcelain piece",Charlie's Angels

Definitely a popcorn flick as they call it. The soundtrack was a bit offputting as well, at least most of the Ariana Grande entries. They didn't fit and subsequently threw off the vibe of the movie. I enjoyed watching this film. Didn't take it too seriously, so I was able to relax and enjoy the ride. There were moments of vulnerability that I didn't expect and were welcomed in my eyes. This film doesn't deserve the hate it's received in my opinion. I see what Elizabeth Banks was trying to do. She wanted to create an action packed girl power film. While it most certainly could have been better, she reached that goal. It's not a nail biter. It's not all that visually interesting. The humor is hit or miss. It has heart though, which is something a lot of action films in the spy genre is missing.",Charlie's Angels

I certainly didn't have high expectations. It was light hearted fluff with some great kick ass action scenes.It didn't follow the same iconic formula as the previous movie & TV show which has put some noses out of joint, reading some of the negative reviews.
Someone commented that Elizabeth Bank's character was too much like an angel & not Bosely. They must have missed the reference to her history as an angel before becoming a handler. I didn't have an issue with it.What surprised me most was Kristen Stewart. She stepped out of the broody miserable persona she usually projects. Instead she was fun & actually looked like she was enjoying herself!There was enough story & action scenes to keep me engaged from start to finish.

OH MY GOSH, every single movie and even TV show it is the same thing. They keep trying to force feed what they believe we should think and feel down our throats... whether it is woman's BS, socialism, immoral lgbt behavior, on and on and on... example, even polygamy on a cop show lol...
Hello America, it is still illegal in all 50 states lol... but no, they think you should just be able to do what ever the hell you want, laws be damned lol...
This movie was pathetic, very sad. especially for the beautiful strong young women.

Come on Hollywood, the rest of the world is passing you by, making better and better movie and television that doesn't force feed a dogma of some sort down your throat... as you begin to waste million's of dollars maybe your pocket books will finally get you to change, i doubt it, but maybe lol....",Charlie's Angels

Patrick Stewart is wasted potential. Naomi Scott just marvels at everything and Ella Balinska is fine.Overall: A lackluster film that provides some entertainment. Kristen Stewart single-handedly carries the film. Elizabeth Banks is fine as an actress but not a great director or writer, just look at her directing filmography.

258,PanamaVeggie,"Pure entertainment: funny, feisty, fearless, feminist",9,18 February 2020,"I'd heard that this film had gotten poor reviews and, being a fan of the previous movies featuring Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz, I thought: 'well, maybe I don't need to see the reboot.' But when I saw that the Internet trolls were, once again, ganging up on the film with ludicrous one-star ratings, I of course decided that I had to see it for myself.Is this movie truly bad or is it just--like many a recent film--wounding a lot of fragile egos?Well...I was pleasantly surprised! Not a dull moment. Stewart is funny and tough in this film...and I love that she's not an exact replica of Barrymore's Angel (sweet and a total rock n' roller, into wrestling, bikes, monster trucks...). Stewart's Sabina is ""really annoying,"" doesn't ""fight like a girl,"" and she's (characteristically, for Stewart) a bit of a misfit. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments. Elizabeth Banks is, as usual, brilliant as a director, writer, and actor (seriously, Banks...is there anything you can't do?). Naomi Scott reminds me of Linda Cardellini (especially as Velma) and was perfect for the role. And Ella Balinska is an excellent actor...great stunts, too...one to watch!If you're easily offended by women poking a bit of fun at men, then this movie isn't for you.

259,keith-w8888,Lacklustre in almost every way,3,20 November 2019,"There were some moments, but they were few and far between, but firstly casting: last time around Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore at least they were all hot names at the time - Kristen Stewart? Ok, so her fame and popularity stem from Twilight and although she has done many other things, since then she's a one trick pony like Johnny Depp or Vince Vaughan. This role required more than she had to offer, especially since she was the only 'name' on offer. Elizabeth Banks hit the spot with Pitch Perfect but in retrospect those male jokes were pretty lame and the success of that franchise was more down to dumb luck than skill and it shows. Patrick Stewart was just wasted, particularly during the reveal, obviously he received no meaningful direction. How long did it take to write the screen play? Two months maybe? Most of the attempts at humour were just awful and although I know that I wasn't the target demographic (being male) but this thing missed the mark just like Ghostbusters 2016 and Oceans 8. If anyone shone at all it was the newbies mostly Naomi Scott but also Ella Balinska.If you want to play a badass female role either be badass (like Cameron Diaz) or use your stunt double because Kristen Stewart can't even run convincingly, That scene at the racecourse when she's overdressed as a jockey and she's supposed to run and pretend to jump on a horse, that was about as convincing as Emma Watson 'pretending to cry' in Noah. At least in the Avengers to accommodate for Scarlett Johannson (who can barely run herself) they employed her stunt double to the point of showing her face in one of the fight scenes - and her stunt double was awesome. Why couldn't you have done that Banks? Oh, I know, because you're so caught up in your own female vanity that you've lost all sense of reality. This movie deserved to fail. There's been a lot of failures this year, but this one is the greatest train wreck since Train Wreck.",Charlie's Angels

But... This Charlie's Angels is actually fun. It's not feminist (not all films done by women are feminist; it's a trap that many people fall in, unfortunately). It has action, humour, beautiful talented women, funny cameos, smart self-references - it does what it's supposed to do. Maybe it's not exactly-exactly as good as the 2000s Charlie's Angels, but come on, it's not like those were arthouse films! (Not to say that 2000s Charlie's Angels are themselves a kind of sequel to the '70s Tv show, which in turn weren't exactly Fellini.)
Elizabeth Banks had a great idea and made another fun Charlie's Angels movie. So if you don't judge it for being a sequel, made by a woman etc., you get 2 hours of entertainment, which is everything a Charlie's Angels film should be.

He hated the 2 previous Charlie's Angel's and I disliked the actress from TWILIGHT.Kristen Stewart was amazing in this film. Honestly, I really like the new look and attitude and am starting to wonder if I misjudged her.First of all, if you know anything about Charlie's Angel's, you would agree that it is time we had a female Bosley. Seriously, we live in a society that seems to have no problem with the loss of our reproductive rights, the fact that women are STILL paid less than men for the same jobs & elected a judicial official accused of raping/sexually harassing a fellow college student while other women sided with him using the ""boys will be boys"" excuse.But one movie dares to celebrate womanpower, and its is a man-hating movie?I agree, they could have made it more difficult to determine who the antagonist is, but they did better than most movies (cue pretty much EVERY superhero movie of the last 2 decades). Usually within half an hour I can predict an entire movie, this was was at least fun to watch and had some twists and turns I didn't expect.I believe the biggest problem with this movie was simply calling it Charlie's Angel's. There was already a movie by that name and not quantifying that this movie is a different chapter in the storyline is bad form in an era oversaturated with remakes.As to all those obsessed with the concept of ""man-hating"" watch the blasted tv show and all the other Charlie's Angel's movies ... seriously, this franchise has always been about women power.

No. It's trying so hard to be feminist. That first scene when the guy is saying women shouldn't work in certain professions, what as the point of that dialogue? Like the fact that he's a criminal wasn't enough to make him a bad guy, they had to be all ""AND this is what he thinks of women!""

This director knows how to act and knows how to direct a movie, but it felt like this director was being hand held by a Hollywood executive while making it. It was too on the nose Hollywood. Someone needs to give Elizabeth Banks a paint brush to let her do her own thing because I'm sure we'd get some magic from her.Next is Kristen Stewart. She seems cool and someone I would get along with in real life, but in this movie; it's almost as if she hated being there. The whole time, with the exception of a few scenes, she seemed to be totally over that movie and wanted to move on. Maybe this wasn't the case, but it's how I interpreted her acting in this film. Part of me wanted to yell at her and the other part wanted to reach out and give her a hug.The plot was predictable and exactly like the other Charlie's angel movies.

274,knight110tim,An Insult To The Memory Of A Beloved Vintage TV Show,2,7 August 2020,"Let me tell you what I detest about this movie upfront: the way it takes a dump on the rich history of the franchise as the main ""twist"" in its very pedestrian plot line.The wonderful Patrick Stewart is introduced as the retiring John Bosley, and, while there are now a legion of ""Bosleys"" in the Townsend Organisation, it is strongly implied - assisted by some dreadfully Photoshopped pictures of him with the original Angels from the TV show and the Angels of the Drew Barrymore movie era - that he is same John Bosley as played by David Doyle in the old television show.Sadly, it's also plainly obvious from pretty much the moment he is introduced that he's going to be the bad guy, despite some ham-fisted attempts at misdirection by writer/director Elizabeth Banks (who also plays his replacement).Anyone who grew up with the Angels should find the idea of Bosley breaking bad both insulting and wholly unconvincing.It's a stupid gimmick and a cheap shot at a beloved show.Nothing about this movie makes it feel like it earned the right to flip an established character 180 degrees with no solid story justification.Despite some amusing moments and the odd snappy one-liner, the overarching plot about the new generation of Angels (now a huge, global, organisation) trying to stop a piece of potentially dangerous stolen tech falling into the wrong hands is so blah.It's a thriller plot we've seen a million times before, with all its twists and turns telegraphed.This was the relaunch nobody asked for (after the dismal attempt to bring it back to TV bombed), and, despite upscaling Charlie's organisation, it doesn't bring anything clever or cinematically interesting to the table.Whereas the Barrymore era films gave a larger-then-life sense of heightened reality to the franchise, this iteration feels like a cheap Mission: Impossible knock-off, but without the spectacular set-pieces.The main Angels do great work with the material they are given, and Kristen Stewart's quirky Sabina Wilson is adorable in the same way Kate McKinnon stole every scene she was in in the 2016 Ghostbusters.",Charlie's Angels

I get where it was trying to go with the female empowerment thing (I'm a female reviewer), but strip that away and all you're left with is a very basic spy/spies save(s) the world storyline (with matching generic twist) that has been told a million times.

282,lf_macias,Solid spy movie ruined by in your face messages,6,3 January 2020,"A new sequel to this franchise, which following the canon of the classic television series and previous films, brings together a new trio of spies with a new Bosley and always under the invisible gaze of Charlie. On this occasion they must prevent a powerful artificial intelligence created by a conceited millionaire from being stolen by villains who could occupy it as a weapon to destroy the world.
The plot is basic and offers nothing new, however it follows a fine action formula that works, in which we see the protagonists go from one country, or continent, to another and in each place there is a mission to solve that ends with some sequence of action. I think that in that aspect, the director / screenwriter / actress Elizabeth Banks did know how to bring the film afloat because her action scenes are efficient and entertaining.
The leading trio has chemistry and each character is well represented by the actresses: the rue, the naive rookie and the weird one. In particular, Kirsten Stewart shows how she is having fun. The secondary cast also has moments to shine, especially Patrick Stewart in a role I haven't seen him before (to reveal more is serious spoiler), and also Luis Gerardo Méndez as a kind of Q has some funny dialogues but does not participate much.
As a good spy movie, the plot has twists that may be obvious but work at the moment to move it forward.
The main problem that I saw was that when movie ends, it forgets its history and how well it had been doing as an espionage film to focus on giving a very forced and obvious feminist discourse. This causes that instead of the movie ending with a good final battle, or with a more emotional ending, or finishing resolving the consequences of what was previously presented, it ends so abruptly and presenting moments so out of place, and taken out of nowhere, which more than reflect the good ideals that the director surely had, ends up self-sabotaging her work.

Charlie's Angels has chase sequences, a psychopathic hitman, explosions, a good deal of betrayal, and a little love, but it does none of these cliches particularly well. It certainly does not justify a remake of the old movies.None of the performances are good, litterally none. But that is likely not the actors fault considering how terrible the writing is and how sophomoric the direction is. This movie certainly lacks a firm hand to guide it's structure and flow. The fight scenes come off lacking vicerailty and overrely on quick cuts and simple one two punch coreography, especially the scene in the cafeteria.Really this movie feels like it was made for tv.

The direction is relatively pacey but the action scenes are contrived and accompanied by a tacky bond themed trumpet laden score which is very undermining and distracting. The 3 main leads aren't given much of a script or scope to express themselves and effectively just end up as trinkets there to be pretty and pleasing on the eye...not really what I'd call 'girl power.'

It took me about three days to watch. The first day, I watched it to see if I would be interested in finishing it. I was a little intrigued. I liked how the Townsend Agency has gone global since if I recall, when they were in Hawaii for the last season, I think they only had offices in Los Angels, Honolulu, and Milan? A few days later I watched it some more and was...meh...and I rarely use that word. Another few days later and I just finished it....well, I started watching it and it has some clever points like the mind, body and soul guy, the different offices, the other ""angels"" that help along the way.However, read a few mainstream reviews, and rewatched it because I think I fell asleep through part of it. The story could've been stronger and considering Banks wrote, directed and starred, more star power in the angels...she could've cast someone from Pitch Perfect. There had to be a stronger chemistry between the three angels. Who knows, maybe a second one could be better....stranger things have happened.What I really liked, and what they could've really developed a story within a story, was when Kelly Garrett appeared, and whom I assume is running the agency. But just think if the story made stronger references to the angels who came before and had them more involved. This would've given it more mass appeal because the fans of yore would flock to go see it. Not enough character development for the audience to connect with, although I kinda liked Kristin Stewart's Sabina, who was always hungry.Again, too bad the plot was weak because it could've been soooooo good!",Charlie's Angels
320,KirkFogg,"Objectively terrible, but in a really fun way.",4,24 February 2020,"I'm not going to pretend that the newest reboot of Charlie's Angels wasn't abysmal, it was, but it was no worse than say...""Shanghai Noon"" or ""Shanghai Nights."" Not to say it's an honor being compared to that kind of early 2000's tongue in cheek slightly nauseating action comedy, but people are acting like this movie is a breakthrough in trash. It's not.I'll start with what works, which isn't a lot. As a huge fan of the Charlie's Angels series, it was also pretty awful. It has it's charm, it's time period, and the grace of Farrah and Jacklyn that makes it an iconic series that's been rebooted by Hollywood twice now. The same cheesy antics, the catchy theme song, the falling haplessly over the hood of a police car for a stakeout-these are all well done callbacks to the classic series. Had they played more towards parody and less towards badass action heroes, this movie would have been a lot less sour for many people. That said, I really love TRULY awful movies, so I had a fantastic time and it was money well spent.Kristen Stewart...god help her, she tries. Every single one of her lines plays as if it was written by a middle schooler that is always ""on"" if you know what I mean. She can't just say a line, it always has to end with her being ditzy, but cute and random. I understand that is the character choice they went for, but it just comes off as shallowly written. Again, I'm just being objective, I loved how bad she was.Elizabeth Banks, who I tend to be a fan of, is kind of becoming a characature of herself in her more recent films. She wrote and directed this picture, and many times I could picture her clacking away at a typewriter giggling to herself about the very mild and wildly unfunny quips and trope laden dialogue vomited out of every characters mouths at any given second. She also said, regarding the movie's horrible reviews, that male viewers just don't like watching women heroes. While I absolutely acknowledge that a tremendous amount of sexist neckbeard trolls do think that way and post disgusting online comments and reviews about things like this, she's got to take credit for this garbage can of a movie. It's not just the fedora boys that didn't like this because they're salty ingrates. Very much of this movie was ham-fisted ""MAN BAD WOMAN ALWAYS HARASSED"" and on one hand I get it. That's really relevant in Hollywood (and EVERYWHERE) right now. A lot of rapists and gropers coming to light, and it's a theme that's at least worth a mention. That said, every single man in this movie is a force of evil in some way. Every one of the Angels get sexually harassed EVERYWHERE they go, and it's just so in your face. I get it, I'm your ally, but seriously they can't go anywhere without some form of sexual harassment or like man guilt. ""Smile sweetheart, it'll go a long way!"" Or a security guard spilling his coffee and leaving his post so he could scramble across a hotel and sexually assault Kristen Stewart with a metal detecting wand. Just take it easy, Elizabeth.""Patrick Stewart, what are you doing here man?"" I've seen this sentiment from a lot of reviews. What do you mean!? He's collecting a paycheck and acting in a movie that was probably a lot of fun to make, just like all of these actors. Get over it, Opie.So, it boils down to this.

323,varunmirasdar,Movie made for few and shown to everyone,3,11 April 2020,"The first 2 movies were way better than this. The cast was great sexy funny with good enough action and silly plots but atleast it didnt give headaches. Most thing for me was that the lead actresses did not have to preach before practice. They did as good as any man would in any action movie without whining about how unfair the world is. They didn't ate any political correct foods and yet they exhibited more energy than these 3. It's the problem with these type of movies they juts want to make men as bad as possible so that the actresses have less difficulty in overcoming them and then talk how difficult it was to save the world. I really loved Kill Bill, Atomic Blonde, Salt, Tomb Raider, Aliens etc. They just grabbed the bull by horns that's it.

So what. Remakes happen. Take it for what it is.one very small criticism I have is that it is a bit heavy on the girl power side at some points - and that's coming from a feminist. LOL.I did enjoy seeing Stewart in this role - she was so different to her other characters/ portrayals - in this one she played a more fun, flippant, upbeat, optimistic, expressive woman. She looked like she had great fun in this role.I'd probably rate it 6/10, but the ratings are so harsh I was flexible to a 7 for the lightheartedness.

Honestly, I think they should start verifying reviewers purchased a ticket because I'm starting to think a lot of reviewers on here are just hating on the movie for whatever reason, without having actually seen it.Look, this movie isn't a masterpiece and it never pretended to be. I went in there with an open mind, expecting some laughs and fun action. I definitely got that, and then some.I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. It was fun seeing Kristen Stewart in this role, and she did a pretty good job here. In fact, I loved all three angels. They balanced each other out well. Ella Balinska as Jane was my favorite by the end and Elizabeth Banks was pretty great, too. Naomi was hilarious and held her own.I wasn't bored for a single second so the ignorant reviewers calling this film a ""cure for insomnia"" clearly haven't watched many movies. You can say what you want about this film (because it's definitely not perfect) but it absolutely was NOT boring in any way.So, basically, if you're not super lame and already decided you were going to hate this film before walking into the theater, you should have a good time watching this.

340,jenkinscammy,Cheesy fem humor might not be for everyone...,7,31 July 2021,"...but rating this movie under a 5 while similarly cheesy male-dominated action films consistently rate a 7 or higher is not a fair assessment.Every action film has cheesy cringe scenes. Every superhero movie, secret agent movie, all of them.A common cringe in buddy action flicks is when the banter feels forced. We're used to seeing the same stale banter between males, though, and a lot of the cheesiness gets a pass.Now, imagine that all the male bonding scenes have been replaced with female bonding. Here's where Elizabeth Banks made (and lost) an awful gamble. She gambled that playing to 'fem' traits - like crying in times of heightened emotion stress and physical exhaustion, and hugging and open platonic affection - would play well.And it does, at first. But there's no development to the relationship. The team has trust issues until the very end of the movie and even as the credits roll. The end result felt like an unnatural union, Mission Impossible meets The Oprah Winfrey Show. There's no growth, no payoff, no explanation.For that lack of character growth, the IMDB fanbase have HEAVILY penalized the movie's rating. However, the acting was well executed The action was great. The casting was spot on. The writing was a bit spotty - but when it was good, the jokes killed and the dialogue flowed naturally. And the production is top notch, with some nice tech and nice big explosions. This movie has a lot to offer.I think this film went out of its way to avoid any type of romance beyond brief flirtation - and it suffers for it.There were times when the overly emotional female bonding scenes played well. When Jane breaks down crying at the hospital, that's a perfect time for a good cry. But other times, not so much.I really think perhaps some subtle chemistry between two of the Angels would have come off as 100% natural - Kristen Stewart and Ella Ballinska have incredible chemistry onscreen. And speaking of chemistry - it's a pity that Banks didn't write more scenes for Sam Claflin - he's got incredible screen presence and played his scenes to perfection. In fact, I think he overshadows Patrick Stewart, even though Stewart has at least 5 times the screen time.If I'm entirely honest, this film should be a 6. But these three Angels work well together and I hope to see more.",Charlie's Angels

I had relatively high hopes that it was going to be better than the less than stellar reviews I'd read about it.I was disappointed, not that the movie was so unbelievably cringy, but rather because my wife disliked it so much that she asked if I wanted to leave half way through. I feel bad because I told her to give it a chance and see if it gets better. It didn't.I value my wife's opinion greatly, so when she told me she felt embarrassed and extremely uncomfortable watching the movie I asked to why. She explained how uncomfortable she felt that the men were constantly being over powered by woman who were so obviously incapable of actually pulling off these feats of superhuman abilities along with the constant mouth breathing of Kristen Stewart. Yes she actually said that lol.My take on it? In short, zero chemistry between the actors caused the acting was very disingenuous. The fight scenes were rather choppy and (again) cringingly unbelievable, along with a plot was all too predictable. Not the actual plot of the movie, but the agenda I guess.Do I feel bad this movie is going to flop?

346,bradersl7,Ehh,5,7 August 2020,"The film doesn't take itself too seriously and I accepted that but this is not what I would call an action film at all! It's a spy comedy with very minimal if any good action sequences, they were cut too much and it's hard to follow what is happening in most of the fights.The only real positive I found was that the key 3 characters all had quite good chemistry, it lead to some ehh jokes which in a film which is directed by someone who has more of an action background would be better. The script is typical cringe from these Charlie's angels films and the plot I would say is amazing but made sense. There is a small twist but I feel like they show it too early, the film still has 30 odd minutes left and we know who the protagonist is, we know the girls are going to win. Kristen Stewart really shows her range with this film and looks like she honestly had fun with it (along with the other 2 female actors) her comedic side really comes out. There is no real exposition on each character which is fine but it doesn't let the audience get attached to all of them which is also sort of ruins any fight scenes as you don't emotionally care for them all. With no exposition most of the background comes through Angels introducing new Angels for instance one is a former MI6 agent, okay we can deal with that but Stewart's character is minimal in this area, all I can remember is that she is a lesbian! That's it and that's only because there are jokes about it a few times in the first act?! Once is fine!The cinematography of the film is nice, it's well filmed, it's the same guy who done Baby Driver and the Matrix so it's to be expected but the action sequences are just cut to pieces which sort of ruins it for me. This obviously isn't his fault but it doesn't help the film.",Charlie's Angels

348,gerick_goldwyn,***AN HONEST REVIEW - THIS IS WHY CHARLIES ANGELS FAILED***,2,21 March 2020,"Initially, I had no desire to see the new Charlies Angels film, largely because of the cast. However, after reading so many negative reviews about it online, and hearing that Elizabeth Banks recently attacked people for not supporting a female-centric film, i.e., claiming that men would be sexist if they didn't go see it and would jeopardise the chance of future female-led action movies. I decided to go see it for myself and make my own judgements. However, after watching the movie, it's clear the film failed because it was just a bad movie, not because it was a female-centric film. I personally like seeing strong, female characters on screen, just as much as strong male characters, because it's exciting... Strong female characters, however, just need a strong male counterbalance to be successful, and that's something this film desperately needed. For example, Wonder Woman had Chris Pine, Captain Marvel had Samuel L. Jackson, Edge of Tomorrow had Tom Cruise, Zootopia had Jason Bateman, the 3 amazing women in Hidden Figures had Kevin Costner, Jim Parsons and Mahershala Ali, Underworld had Scott Speedman and Theo James, and the list goes on... The only film I can think of that had an all-female cast that I enjoyed was St Trinians, but then again it did have Colin Firth, Rupert Everett, and Russell Brand in it was well. However, Charlies Angels on the other hand was just an epic failure across the board.First, the cast. By starring women in their early 20s, it tells the audience that the film was made for young, female teenagers/adults. As a result, it was never going to appeal to anyone over 35, which presents its first problem. Most teenage women would never have even heard of Charlies Angels before, given the last film was released almost 20 years ago, let alone want to see an action film because it's not their genre of choice. Where, if the film was made for people over 35 (and for both male and female viewers), we would have seen a completely different outcome. I personally would like to see a well-thought out Charlies Angel's film at the movies, but Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska was never going to get me there. I personally would have chosen women between 30-45 for these roles, perhaps someone like Emily Blunt from Edge of Tomorrow. She also recently played Mary Poppins, which would also appeal to younger viewers as well. Next, Jessica Chastain, who needs no introduction... She is potentially one of the most talented actresses on the planet. She was blow away in Miss Sloane and played an amazing part in Interstellar. And, finally someone like Taraji Henson. She exceeded all expectations in Hidden Figures and was fantastic in Person of Interest. As a result of starring 3 women like this on screen, it tells the audience it was going to be a well thought-out Charlies Angels film, and which men wouldn't want to see these 3 sexy women on screen kicking ass!Second, the overall tone of the film. It starts with Chris Pang talking down to Kristen Stewart, implying she's nothing more than a beautiful arm adornment. Kristen Stewart rightfully stands up for herself, explaining: women have the right to think and do whatever they want, which is absolutely fantastic. But, in the same scene she's also acting like a complete tease. She sucks his finger. She puts her foot between his legs. She then uses her body language to seduce him. I mean, the way Chris Pang is speaking to Kristen Stewart is wrong, but what she is doing is far, far worse. Men hate being used or teased this way only to come up empty and it only further highlights horrible female typical stereotypes... like ""dumb-blondes"" or ""cock-teases,"" and creates ill will between men and women. A strong, feminist film should be trying to break these stereotypes, not reinforce them...In the next scene, Naomi Scott is in a meeting with her boss, Nat Faxon, and his basically a character from the film Dumber and Dumber, and this is the overall tone of the film. Every opportunity Charlies Angels has to highlight horrible male typical stereotypes or attack men - it takes it - which ultimately creates an over-the-top parody of female empowerment; where women are betrayed as universally smart, virtuous, incorruptible, tough, confident, outspoken, highly-skilled at everything and physically unstoppable, which would be fine if they were counterbalanced by some halfway decent male characters as well. The problem is, there not. All the men in this film are shown as arrogant, corrupt, jealous, unstable, selfish, insecure, dumb or stupid, just begging to be put in their place by their female superiors, which just comes across as hostile and further creates a division between men and women. As a result, I don't know why Elizabeth Banks thought this film would ever do well at the Box Office, or why people think attacking men is the new frontier for feminism. Hate breeds hate. So, whenever feminists attack men, it just creates a backlash that undermines their cause. The best thing feminists could do today is be the bigger person and try to lead by example. I too believe in equal opportunity for all, and feminism is an essential step forward for the future. However, attacking men at every turn isn't going to get us there. It just pisses off the guys your trying to change, and just comes across as catty, not progressive or intelligent.Finally, the end of the film, which is the biggest slap in the face of all. I initially thought that Elizabeth Banks would try to end the film on a positive note or bridge the relationship between men and women; especially after trashing men for the past 1.5 hours. But, I was left disappointed again. In the final showdown, the Angels are surrounded by a group of evil henchmen (or men), the lights flicker out, and all the guys find themselves knocked out by lots of different Angels. Revealing that all the women that appear in this film, here and there, were all Angels the whole time. Revealing that, Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska aren't really special at all because there are hundreds, possibly thousands of Angels across the planet. Furthermore, it also highlights that all women are angels, while all men are just evil in comparison; given all the antagonists in the film are all men. The movie then flashes forward to reveal Charlie himself, is now a woman, and all of Naomi Scott's teachers and combat instructors (in Angel school) are all female as well, which further vilifies men. As a result, are people really left scratching their heads into why men didn't rush to the movies to see Charlies Angels? All the film did was degrade and vilify men for 2-hours straight. If the main antagonist was a female character, this film might have had something... But, Charlies Angels failed entirely.After watching Charlies Angels, I'm not sure how I feel about the film and I don't think for a second it's a forward-thinking feminist movie. I was also left wondering if this is how Elizabeth Banks feels about men? In my opinion, movies like Aladdin (2019) or Frozen 2 are far more feminist movies today. In Aladdin for example, Jasmine is betrayed as a strong, confident, intelligent woman, with a beautiful heart and soul. She is also passionate, outspoken, with a kind heart, and above all not afraid to stand up for what she believes in. Furthermore, she is respectful towards others... So, in my opinion, she is a perfect role model for young women today. Even Elsa and Anna in Frozen 2 were fantastic characters. All the male characters in the film look to them for hope and view them as natural born leaders. Again, another perfect example for young women everywhere... Charlies Angels just comes off as teenybopper crap compared to these two films...",Charlie's Angels

Regardless of all of its flaws the movie still maintained a good pace.If ""Hobbs and Shaw"" holds a rating of 6.5 then Charlie's Angels deserves at least 7.",Charlie's Angels
368,yasmeenshabana,It's really a bad movie and the story doesn't make any sense,3,23 February 2020,The movie had a story that does not make any sense. They break into a lab and take something then destory it in the way out whichaccomplish nothing. They are chased by unknown people for unknown reasons and trying to escape with unknown plan and going somewhere to more empty accomplishment. Nothing made sense. The parts that were supposed to be funy seemed really unnecessary and forced into the situation. Then of course the most close person to our characters had to be the one who betrayed them. So cliche. And the worst thing is that the action scenes are copied from other movies.,Charlie's Angels

For instance, they had a good mix of cast members ( talented ones )... they decided to go the realistic route and use guns and explosives, makes sense right? Unlike the last two movies where pacifist and fool executive Drew Barrymore insisted that no guns be used in either movie by the Angel's, who are supposed to be dangerous, state of the art SPIES...lol. What a joke.
So this time around promised to be better by a mile, however, Elizabeth Banks complete lack of directorial experience and amazing lack of talent behind the camera showed exactly what a novice she is...honestly, you have starpower like Kirsten Stewart, and this, THIS is the finished movie you turn in???

375,dancingerin,Why is the rating so low?,8,20 April 2021,I don't understand why people rated it a 4.8 this is about 6 or 7. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it also wasn't the worst. It was entertaining and I'd say it was pretty empowering. Don't let the trolls fool you it was a good movie.,Charlie's Angels
376,stop_thebeat,Full Throttle action,8,4 March 2021,"I was sceptical when they mentioned doing another CA without Drew, Lucy & Cameron, but their story was covered off on their last film. And being honest that wasn't the strongest. Now we come to this, a recognition of CA franchise with fresh Angels, big chases, explosions, plots & twists & turns. Just like a CA episode. And why didn't people like it?
Well I don't h Derry and it tbh, I really enjoyed it. I thought all the Angels were great and I really liked Kristen Stewart's character in it. They were relatable and fun, Bosley (Elizabeth Banks) did a great job acting & directing this film. She did rock some pretty mental glasses as well. I feel so sorry for everyone involved in it as to how the film was treated. They didn't deserve that, but I feel that as soon as you mention 'all female/ girl power' it seems to be like poison in the more conservative of the Hollywood reporters & reviewers. The film wasn't bad at all, I've seen much much worse.

379,zlfh4,"Alright, from a female perspective.",7,19 November 2019,"This movie was interesting. I kind of like that they showed how an angel might be recruited. That was an aspect that had never been shown before. Was it feminist? Yes. Was it man-hating? That depends on your point of view. I didn't think so. To me it was a fairly accurate portrayal of how most men act in a workplace. Do most men perceive themselves as behaving this way? Of course not, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen on a regular basis. Are there some women who have only gotten where they are because they were able to seduce a man into giving it to them rather than actually earning it who are not going to like this movie? Absolutely. It doesn't have the same magic as the old one, but I did think it was fun and enjoyable.",Charlie's Angels
380,itsbrianduh,Meh,3,30 August 2020,"First, this is not a good movie. But I wasn't bored throughout it. It's cheesy, and the action isn't done very well. Kristen Stewart is the bright light of the movie. Most of her comedy lands, and she just has a good swagger.",Charlie's Angels
381,grantonearth,Boooring!,1,14 February 2020,My wife and I love the old CA movies so despite my better judgement we went to see this one. Wow...what a terrible boring movie.

382,forcefromabove,I don't get the hate,10,20 November 2019,"I went into the movie hoping for sexy lady spies, and I got sexy lady spies. There was feminism, but it wasn't ""all guys are bad"" it's ""women can be great too"".The plot was as good as modern movies of this type, which means it wasn't very good but good enough to get the movie A to ZAction was pretty good and fairly well done.All the reviews says they hate men in this, and I just can't agree. There were several males that were helping them along the way, there was a love interest with one of the angels and a random boy, several leaders of the angels we're guys. They never once implied that females are better than males, or that a female couldn't be bad. They never implied it was wrong to be a guy, and the women had flaws in character addressed on screen and were overcame by hardwork, nothing more. There were several times where men where doing dumb ass stuff and there wasn't a female doing dumb ass stuff, but there was a lot of guys who showed the girls whatfor. They allowed the girls to be sexy during sexy scenes, and they never implied it was bad for the girls to be sexually attractive.Overall I feel like the movie earns a 7/10 for being nice and decent, and I don't think it would be much improved if everyone was replaced by a guy most likely.",Charlie's Angels
383,pjgross,Even Kristen Stewart can not save this one,3,8 March 2020,"I love the Charlies' Angels idea of girlpower in an area where we are overfed with cliche tough-guy action. But you can overdo it and you can also choose totally interchangeable actresses in a boring script. Even the best special effects can not make up for that. And Kristen Stewart, who is the only memorable character from this movie, can not make up for it. Go watch de previous editions of CA and enjoy the fun, girlpower and chemistry of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu.",Charlie's Angels

I would call her a one-note actress but she's tone-deaf. Please... STOP HIRING HER.",Charlie's Angels
385,wongcalvin,Okay for an action movie but bland,6,15 November 2019,"The movie overall is just actions upon actions and big explosions and car chasing moments and girls fighting on each other. The movie just felt bland and simple, there not much humorist in this movie and many of the jokes felt intentional, like it's just trying to fill in those awkward and boring gaps which they had no better dialogues to be filled.The story is just a normal linear story and the plot twist isn't much of a twist just doesn't felt like there is much impact. Probably it's the joke they try to pull out but end up spoiling much of the tensions and plot holes they try to build throughout the movie.On the other hand, Kristen Steward is great in this movie, she's the one which made it feels like she was born for the role, badass, strong and bold well comparing to the other angels just doesn't feel much of an angel. There isn't much of a great chemistry among those angels and just felt like strangers meeting up for the first time, rather than great teaming battle kind, it's like all of the them are having individual fighting between them and none coherent.Overall this movie is probably the movie you would want waste time and not really care about the details and storylines and such. It's just a great action movie if you wanna see cars, fighting scenes, running around buildings and such.",Charlie's Angels

They should have a stamp on the movie posters that says ""no dudes allowed,"" and I mean that in the most harmless way possible.I was expecting to skim through this for Kristen Stewart (I'm a fan) but found myself watching this from beginning to end. It was just so unapologetically FUN. In the first half I wasn't sure if they were gonna take the time to have the main girls really bond, which would have been okay but a little disappointing. Fortunately, they pretty much came through in the end and created a trio of women I would have loved to learn more about in future installments. (I say 'would have' because this movie, sadly, didn't make nearly enough money to warrant a sequel. It's like 2016's Ghostbusters all over again, except this one actually WAS overt with its feminist messaging.)And yes, I greatly appreciated the deliberate ""we are here to be a fun and empowering place for women"" vibe throughout. I'd much rather have annoyingly pointed feminism than the annoyingly pointed *sexism* in every single silly action flick the straight dudes salivate over.Speaking of which, butthurt dudebros have absolutely tanked this movie's rating for all the usual reasons, a chief one being they really, REALLY hate it when something isn't made specifically for them. They have umpteen million fun, silly, over-the-top action flicks tailor made to their gaze, taste, and sense of humor. Maybe they should go watch one of those and leave us alone with the one (1) decent action chick flick we get every couple of years.",Charlie's Angels

The movie tries hard to be funny but becomes irritating in the process.
Kristen Stewart talks a lot and it's neither funny nor important.
The movie is so predictable. If you take a shot for every correct prediction you make, you'll be so drunk before half of the movie and that makes it easier to watch the rest of the movie.
Action sequences - a lot of quick cuts and not good at all.
There are three good guys in the movie. One dies in the beginning, One can't even open a ketchup sachet and One does the housekeeping. (If you think this spoils the movie then this movie is for you).
Elizabeth Banks should stop blaming men for the failure of this mess of a movie and learn how to make a good female-centric movie.",Charlie's Angels

Yet I managed to watch it all and it wasn't too bad.What I don't like about the movie is the fact it keeps advertising that women can do anything men can do. No one is disputing this anymore if anything, men's rights are now being tipped in the same direction women's rights used to be. No such thing as equality.
But rather than make a good reboot of a classic, it is like being force fed feminism. I have absolutely no issues and problems with anyone doing anything, why make a fuss? But why feel the need to keep shouting about it?I was quite impressed by Kirsten's performance in this movie and the plot was relatively good and I didn't expect a twist but again it's downfall was its very strong statement.This in turn has most likely killed the Angels in the long run?",Charlie's Angels

The press ruined this movie, to be honest. The reason might be an epic failure in the advertising department, but also I would expect the press to look beyond what they have been fed.I find this movie very similar to the old ones. The angels are women who display certain skills in getting the attention of men. The men seem to underestimate them. And that seems to be the same good old boring dynamic that the old movies had. An inverted James Bond, if you know what I mean.Yes, there were some statements that women can do everything. But also in the old movies the angels seemed to be very well trained specialists in all sorts of areas. It was unbelievable at times, just like in the old movies. This seems to be some sort of trait of this kind of movies, where characters (men or women) seem to have just the abilities they need to outsmart their opponents.This film was entertaining but nothing new. In my eyes these angels were no different from the previous ones. So I give it the same rating that I would give the previous movies.",Charlie's Angels

Maybe I'm just right when I say that the movie is a little better than just OK.There are some of the genre's obvious flaws and clichés but it has enough freshness to be worth a look. The (s)exploitation of the female participants is restrained, but there is still a good portion of femininity. Feels more up to date seen from a gender perspective than most movies delivered from Tinseltown.The film works but with a reservation. Sir Patrick Stewart. I really like him but not as an actor. He is a wonderful person and storyteller on a theater scene, as a guest in a talk show and social but on screen I have a hard time liking his acting.
Otherwise, I think the actors deliver but it is not at the highest level. There is probably no room for an actor in a movie of this type to delve into the character.
Two hours of OK action that is just a little fun without any major revelatory elements. The smaller ones, however, make me follow the story somewhat pleasantly from beginning to end.",Charlie's Angels

But the truth is that they are even worse fascists than the ones they so loudly lump together here.

Probably the overt gal power gets to some but aside for a few heavy handed lines, it's fine. Really, it's no different to corny buddy bro movies really - we are so used to them but soon as a bunch of chicks do the equivalent, it's all oh no, men are in trope roles, typical feminism script, blah blah blah.
For me, it was probably a bit too shiny/over the top in costumes, but so was 2000 CA - I think it's just targeted towards the 15-25 group and that's how it looks for it.

However, I don't think this movie deserves a comparison as it is quiet very different from all the other Charlie's Angels and it can be gauged from the visually delightful modernized look that it inherits. Elizabeth Banks has made a mistake to give a feminist tinge to it, which should be more obviously understood than said. but the director tends to nail it in our heads so much that most of the male chauvinists puke out criticisms, blasting her work to smothers. that's understood as to why most of this Charlie's Angels haters are those males who feel pushed down. But the blunder lies with the advertising and marketing team who have failed to position this film on its entertainment values and rather go for an less treaded path of morals and newfound feminism. The film is not that bad as it is portrayed out to be and has its funny moments and sizzle which an all new brandishing look.

427,meanmrslinky,Charlie's Man-Haters,1,30 November 2019,"Elizabeth Banks wanted to make a badass girl-power film. So, what does she do? She remakes Charlie's Angels. Is this a joke? Is this really meant to be taken seriously? It's astonishing how terrible this film is. It isn't even fun to joke about. It's sad more than anything. Before the film was released, Banks said it wasn't a film for men to enjoy. So, when it turned out to be a complete failure, who does she blame? Yup, you guessed it. She literally made a film to trash men, told men it wasn't for them, then she says the films failure was due to lack of male support. Yes, her film about women being superior failed because of the lack of male support. How ironic.Forget about the story itself. The plot is so uninteresting and everything you see has been done. The characters are weak and aren't relatable in the least. When Kristen Stewart is giving the best performance, something is wrong. The action scenes were decent. That's the only positive thing I can say. Everything about the film is just boring. I was far more entertained with the guy in front of me tossing popcorn in the air and catching it with his mouth.Hollywood needs to realize remakes aren't the key to a successful film. It's typically the opposite, unless some originality is present. People simply don't care to see the same movie made twice. I'm surprised the idea of a remake is acceptable in the first place. Now it has gone beyond too far.Did I mention the fact that Banks asked men to support her film out of the kindness of their hearts? Yes, this is how pathetic she is. She makes a movie trashing men, tells men they won't like it, the film fails, she blames men for its failure, THEN asks men to support it out of the kindness of their hearts. Yes, because men love paying money and giving support to a film (and filmmaker) that completely trashes them.Just save your money. Don't pay any attention to this garbage. This isn't a film for men OR women. It's for idiots who entertain the notion that sexism can be solved with sexism. Elizabeth Banks needs to stick to being the dumb girlfriend in stoner comedies. I actually enjoy her idiocy in those films. Her idiocy in this case is just frustrating.An easy 1/10.",Charlie's Angels

429,zimmerblitz,To say something nice...,3,8 January 2020,"About Charlie´s Angels is what i´m trying to do here, simply because i am generally a great fan of Elisabeth Banks (as an actress), and of Kristen Stewart
(in any capacity).
The Production design alone is worth 3 Points- the movie looks amazing-
and so does Kristen Stewart . Just awesome. I know many people think she´s not such a great actress (and i wouldn´t say she is the best- but she is most certainly not the worst.)See ""Equals"" for example.)
And in this movie i also only mean the way she looks.
But Elisabeth Banks does not do herself or womanhood any favors with this film.
As some other reviewer very rightly remarked, she should have done ONE job right- which in this case would have been the directing, because the cast was helplessly trying to make something out of a screenplay that was not in any way justified to be shot.
Take women seriously please- and men as well- and give us a story that makes at least any sense.
I´m referring to the technical gadgetry in the center of the plot (i won´t mention the name of the thing, and the totally stupid way in which supposedly very intelligent people talk about it.As well as the ""funny"" chase in the Elb-Philharmonie.
This is on the level of a movie for six-year-old kids. Admittedly i think this all the time- in most of the James Bond movies for example- but even worse is the way in many scenes where the Angels are being talked down to, or doing it themselves. I
t never works as it was supposed to- if it was supposed to be funny.
And so i conclude...
Keep giving jobs to Kristen Stewart- because she deserves it.
And they will- there are enough people out there who know what a cool person she is, and that´s the ""cool"" as in "" i do what i want-because i want it ! "" Go KS !

433,wildcard97,Forgettable and insulting,1,28 March 2020,"It was once deemed that Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was unwatchable bad. I'd rather watch that 100 times than watch this again. The movie, or Elizabeth Banks for that matter, was more busy trying to push their anti-straight white male political agenda than to make, at the very least, a decent movie. I say decent, because the previous films were never full-on great movies but they were fun to watch.This movie just makes you cringe for nearly two hours and has the balls to connect itself to the previous films and series rather than keeping to itself.
On top of that, have fun watching the first movie again knowing that Bill Murray's Bosley, played by Patrick Stewart now in this movie, turns bad 19 years down the road. Quite the twist but ruins everything because it's completely unnecessary. If the movie was a stand-alone, okay. But since it's in the same universe as the other movies and the show, makes totally no sense to have Bosley turn.
And on top of this, Elizabeth Banks doesn't care about continuity between films. Obviously Bill Murray didn't come back as Bosley as he refused to come back for the second movie due to his relationship with Lucy Liu on the first film. But they should've chose an actor who matches his nationality. Going from American to British? Why? Makes no sense. Especially when they comment on the fact that he's British later in the movie.
Elizabeth Banks: ""Who cares about continuity, we need to make men look totally evil!!!""Watch the first two films and pretend this one doesn't exist.",Charlie's Angels

But this was extremely disappointing.My wife walked out around 55 minutes in saying she was over seeing classics ruined by a need to shove feminism and equality down her throat. The last thing she wanted was that during the remake of one of her favorite films. On the other hand, for me, I'm always open to any film really, regardless of agenda and propaganda. But this film was too much for me. Bring back Le Femme Nikita, bring back Ripley, The Bride, Sarah Conner... if you want a film that displays strong female characters, then give them heart! Give their characters depth, and some grit and hint of realism. Leave us to run our imaginations, but build a solid base and leave the rest to three actresses.If you're wondering why this movie will never succeed, go in to critic reviews and click on the female reviewers.

I'll give half of the hater a pass and assume they just didnt vibe with the movie, but the rest are people who decided to hate it before they even saw it because they read ""girl power"" before entering the cinema.I've seen it twice now and I really enjoyed it. The cast works really well together, Kristen Stewart (who I was never really the biggest fan of) truly shines as the slightly off-spectre Sabina, she's quirky, reckless and with a serious dry wit that made me laugh plenty. This role looks like it's made for her.
The other two angels I had not seen before at all, but they really come into their parts as the badass (Jane) and the totally out of her element nerd (Elena).The trio work really well together and I felt their relationship develop throughout the movie into a real sisterhood (another word people seem to hate, btw).The supporting cast is excellent sporting veterans like Patrick Stewart and Elizabeth Banks (who also directed the film, brilliantly I might add), as well as the dudes who play Elena's adorable nerd-colleague, Hodak the stone cold assassin, Saint the funny, spiritual ""angel fixer"" and the douchy, but funny ""Australian Johnny"". Sam Claflin also gives a fun performance as billionaire CEO playboy smartass.Does the plot have holes? Of course.

452,keshjig,For Teenagers But Still Fun,7,27 July 2020,"I'm pretty sure this movie is aimed at, and would please, adolescent girls, based on the music choices, the lack of gratuitous or gory violence, and the simplified characters and plot. For example, friction between two leads is resolved in a ""I thought you didn't like me"" conversation, the story is very basic, and the villains are cartoonish.
However, there's a lot of humour that made me laugh, the action scenes are well done, sets and clothes are gorgeous, and there's good chemistry between the Angels. Plus I'm a fan of Patrick Stewart, Elizabeth Banks, and disco music.
I've not paid much attention to Kristen Stewart before, as reviewers often state she is wooden, but she won me over in this role. If you see this as a tween movie, she played it perfectly as a slightly goofy, wisecracking insouciant, who also is loyal and can handle herself. All of the women in this movie are capable, highly trained professionals who make clever decisions and are also compassionate and ethical. That makes them good role models for an adolescent.

The old C's Angels were also not a masterpiece, but still enjoyable. I ended up regretting the two hours of my life that I've wasted on this.All these incredibly talented actresses and actors couldn't make the final product any better than the pile of crap it basically is. The whole movie is a cringefest, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this, except if they wanted to see how bad a movie Elizabeth Banks (whom I like a lot) can direct.Christen Stewart, Ella Balinska and Naomi Scott did a great job of playing the each of the angels, led by Elizabeth. Patrick Stewart, Sam Claflin, John Tucker and Chris Pang did great as well. So the acting is definitely not what's wrong here. It's the whole ""women good, men bad"" storyline that makes this movie something that no person with at least two grey cells in their brain can enjoy. Especially because it presents girl-power as a female version of toxic masculinity. I mean, is it really supposed to be funny to watch a guy getting his  brutally kicked, stepped on and sodomized by two warrior women? All men are incompetent and evil, all women are superheroes. This just doesn't work.I am sorry for Elizabeth, and all these talented people, that the movie couldn't be something more.

It looks like they had a blast filming together and that comes through to the audience when viewed. Ella Balinska has a great presence on screen. I've not seen her in anything previous to this but I think she will become a fan favourite actress in future films. Naomi Scott gets a pass as not only is she a great actress, even in Aladdin, which I do not rate highly as a film, but also because she played the role of the Pink Ranger in 2017 perfectly.Kristen Stewart gets her own paragraph. I cannot understand why people still hate her. My only thought is that people only think of Twilight and how bad the franchise became. I actually think Kristen was great in the first and fifth films and still good in the others. If you then check out her indie filmography she has been smashing it with varying roles. I was so surprised at the role she had in Charlie's Angels, it is unlike any performance I've seen her give. She was genuinely funny and charming.The directing by Elizabeth Banks I thought was good. Some very nice establishing shots and well framed scenes. The much derided action scenes were engaging and it was interesting to see them flow from the start to their climax. For someone who has never directed action this was a very competent effort. There were some slight cutting issues but I don't think it had an adverse effect on the scenes.This currently sits at a 4.0 on this site and I'm not sure if this is trolling, political or the fact that people just don't factor in how enjoyable a film is in their rating.This is a fun and enjoyable movie and nothing more should be expected",Charlie's Angels

I grew up watching the TV series and thoroughly enjoyed the first remake with Drew, Cameron and Lucy (the second was way worse than this latest version). The little nods to the previous instalments were pretty fun (though whoever did those terrible photoshops of Patrick Stewart should have their eyes seen to).The action sequences were decent, the chemistry between the Angels was good (except for that crying scene, what was up with that?), the music was great. Sure, the script wasn't amazing, but just like Hobbs & Shaw, when I watch this kind of action movie, I'm not expecting Shakespeare. I'm expecting action and chemistry, and there's plenty of that, with a fair amount of humour sprinkled in.As for all that so-called man-hating, where is it, exactly? The guys played their parts well and there was no hating that I could see. No man was emasculated, so what's all the moaning about?There are some cute little scenes (the lab with Jane, the discussion about Birdman and Batman, the ferry) that are grin-worthy. Naturally everything is OTT, though a bit more camp wouldn't have hurt.

468,meadever,Let's be honest people.,7,31 March 2020,"This movie is objectively better than a lot of the male-centric action movies we've seen over the years. It's not a masterpiece of cinema but the writing, the fight scenes, the story, the cinematography, they're all on par with the testosterone fueled movies we're used to. You really gonna tell me the action here is worse than the shaky cam extravaganza that was Taken 3? That the overall story is more far-fetched than the last several Fast and Furious movies? That the dialogue pales in comparison to the poetry of Schwarzenegger? Not to disparage any of those people or films, but let's stop acting like this is somehow far beneath those popular cinematic entries. No, the real reason I think people hate on this movie is it is unapologetically feminist and female-centered. It doesn't try to mitigate or cater to men by playing down the abilities and intelligence of its heroes. It doesn't see them disavowing their womanhood and ignoring the advantages and/or disadvantages that come with that in order to make the audience comfortable. And it doesn't see them engaging in pointless titillation to lure in certain demographics. In short it's clearly not meant for the male gaze while existing within a genre that is typically geared towards men, and that's an unfortunately sure fire way to ensure backlash. Which is a shame because I have seen my share of action movies over the years, in fact I'm a huge fan of the genre, and this is on the higher end of the spectrum of my viewing. I like that I can see the fight scenes clearly. I like the thought that went into the various choices made. I like that there are real consequences to those choices. And I like that what I see is more grounded in reality (as much as any action movie can be). It's just a well-crafted flick that is worth seeing as long as you can check your sexism at the door and accept that just like men like to revel in their masculinity (which we allow them to do freely), women like to acknowledge their womanhood and what it means without having to resort to shades of androgyny or sexualization for acceptance. I do have to end with saying though that my favorite part of this whole movie is Kristen Stewart. She is a phenomenal comic relief at times and utterly likable. Her performance alone made this worthwhile viewing for me.
Is this movie perfect? No. Have other films like Wonder Woman done similar things to better effect? Yes.

Naomi Scott is so charming, Ella Ballinska is a badass and even Kristen Stewart who I wasn't very fond of, gave an excellent performance. Having said that, didn't like at all the twists and turns it had towards the end. In the hopes of having a girl power moment like the ones in the Avengers movies, it delivered a very lazy ending to the final fight, making the Charlie's Angels asosiation much larger than has ever been portrayed on screen. As an audience we could assume there are more Charlie's Angels than the 3 the story follows, but why this mission specifically had to bring dozens pf Angels into the same place? Just for a girl power scene?
What really ruined it for me was Charlie being revealed to be a woman right towards the end.
While I had always seen Charlie as a man that trusted women and saw them in a way no other man could, it just turned out to be a woman distorting her voice to sound like a man for no reason.
And finally, we didn't really need to see the star-studded ending of all the women training to become angels. Just give me an ending where the three main charachters have now decided to have each other's backs and work together and that would have been enough. If it hadn't been for those ending twists, I would have given this movie an 8, and would actually be specting a sequel, but I'm done with whatever Elizabeth Banks has to bring to the table as a writer or producer.",Charlie's Angels

May be because people don't like Kristen Stewart they are showing hatred to the movie which is unfair.People are saying some bulsh** that men-hating is shown which is completely untrue. Good men are shown in good light and vice-a-versa. They are actually giving out great examples of how women should empower themselves so that they can help other women which is need of the time.A little plot hole towards the end of the movie is why I have given 8 stars.

I thought Sabina would be independent,strong willing woman but i did not see much of that. I just have that feeling that movie is just about girls who can fight and it doesn't explain real motives of then or the villains. Most of bad guys were bad because they were guys , so when movie has not decided what it's against of , its hard for viewers to find out themselves . Fight scenes were okay, i also loved the ending.

Banks ranted about getting bad reviews because people are not for female directer and female led films....But, this was just awful. I knew this was not going to be a Peppermint like movie but was hoping for a watchable action movie with some good jokes. What I got was bad acting and a horrific script. It tries to be funny, but the so called jokes hurt my soul (and not in a good way).I wanted to turn the movie off after the first car chase because of all the annoying comments made by ""the client.""

The empowerment, soundtrack, and chemistry between the actors were all enjoyable aspects.",Charlie's Angels
512,Eve_of_Destruction,Better than the 1 Star Reviews,7,9 October 2020,"My expectations were super low based on the reviews so how could I not like it?! I went in expecting a Charlies Angels reboot and that is what I got. Not nearly as campy (which I loved) as the 2000s versions but still entertaining. The girls are gorgeous of course (for who I wonder?) and I prefer their look to the original 70's so for me it's a win in that aspect. It is definitely a little edgier and less of a lighthearted comedy. I mean it is Charlie's Angels not Tomb Raider. People should know that going in. My review could end here but:
Before I go on to address the unfair 1 star lowball ratings: I DO agree they should not put down guys OR girls in films but that IS Hollywood for you. And we ALL have to deal with it. I also agree feminism should JUST be about equality and not bashing men. Nor should patriarchy be about bashing women. As a girl I have spent my life watching predominantly guy action movies, guy sports on every TV while in almost any bar, and here in America EVERY President has been a man. (I will stop there because nobody wants to hear it). So, for me it's refreshing to not have women just be eye candy or the ditzy side kick. I get that guys want something different. Which leads me to the next paragraph...
I know guys hate when the reverse happens - where they become the brainless people in female films and/or the Bad Guy. But if you watch many action movies most, if not all, of the villains ARE guys. This is not unique to Charlie's Angels. But for some reason in this movie it is a problem. Hence the extremely low ratings. In addition, it has been mentioned that there may be a couple of feminist points made but aren't there chauvinistic points made in male dominated movies? Are we really going to lie to ourselves and pretend that it's not the same for both genders? Have we not all been in this world for a while? The Godfather is my favorite movie and the women are nothing in that film. Yet I gave it a high rating.
I just feel like when it comes to girl movies some people have no tolerance for the reverse of what happens in male movies. Can you imagine if we 1 starred EVERY movie that put down women? And if you really want to know what being a woman feels like take your wife's name when you get married. If that doesn't show you that we live in a male dominated society I don't know what does. So maybe throw us a bone once and a while and let us have some fun at your expense for once. If not for the RIDICULOUS amount of 1 Stars I would've let this go. I am not even a feminist and 5 or 6 of them I could see but there are hundreds. (Which, actually, doesn't surprise me lol given the men I have lived with but I better not say that... Here's looking at you Dad).",Charlie's Angels
513,r-vandeventer,Don't expect too much...,8,22 February 2020,And you'll be mightely rewarded. It's just fun! Not all movies need to be highminded some just need to be mindless fun and this is it.

515,zuzuspetals927,Sometimes a Cigar is Just a Cigar,6,13 January 2021,"Maybe it was because I am old enough to remember the original Charlie's Angels when it first aired on ABC television in the 70s.Maybe it was because you could not have paid me any amount of money to watch Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu stammer their way through the two films that were made based on the tv show.Maybe it was because I had never seen Kristen Stewart in pretty much anything.But I have to admit, I enjoyed watching this movie.These days, as Hollywood has clearly decided that no one other than 14 year old boys go to the movies, I have relegated myself to one category: is this film entertaining? Was I entertained while watching this? For the 2019 version of Charlie's Angels, the answer is a resounding YES.No, I did not see this in the movies. And had it not been for the free STARZ weekend and a COVID-19 lockdown, it's unlikely I would have seen it otherwise. But I thought, let's just look at this for fun and giggles.It did not take itself too seriously. It was funny. It knew exactly what it was, what it wanted to say, and where it going. Girl Power on display, for sure. AMAZING soundtrack. You have to take where it was, have zero expectations, and enjoy it for what it was and is. Did the world need another Charlie's Angels film?

I went with a group of friends & most seemed to enjoy it because it's light & fluffy with a bit of action. The woman power angle seemed a bit contrived to me, but still I like that it challenges the status quo in Hollywood & any challenge in that regard is another step forward. I loved the Charlie twist at the end.Unfortunately I didn't particularly care about the characters, so when K-Stew's character ended up in hospital & the other one (see I can't even remember their names!) was sobbing over her, it didn't tug at my heartstrings. I'm hormonal at the moment too, I even got teary watching a YouTube video about a dog seeing it's own after a whole year of being away.Go watch it, but don't have any high expectations for a wild ride, it's cheesy but not in the cheesy fun way the last 2 Charlie's Angels movies were.And for guys rating this a 1 because their girlfriend ""made them"" go with them, grow a set & do something else 😊",Charlie's Angels

531,bogdan253,In line with Charlie's Angels,6,13 February 2020,"Charlie's Angels is a TV show from 1976, with all kind of reboots, cartoons, movies, shows, and the formula is 3 beautiful women that work for a pervert which called them ""angels"", which in 2020 could be considered a sexist term. Charlie is some kind of Hugh Hefner.I'm not a fan, but I believe this formula didn't change since 44 years ago, it's always been about chicks that kick ass.So what's with the 1 stars here talking about lesbians and how weak women are? How sick did we become as a society when we try so hard to strike at any film which shows strong women? Why even compare this with Ghostbusters? The main characters here have always been women.The movie industry is at a low right now, with films like Fast & Furious getting 6-7 stars and no one having a problem with Dwayne Johnson racing a train.Obviously, women fighting trained professionals would have a different outcome than in Charlie's Angels, most of the time. But what did people expect going to this movie? Why pay to watch a movie which you know will have women beating men and then go rate it a 1 star because it's not believable?Charlie's Angels is a mix of James Bond, The A Team and Chuck, it's a light action-comedy show.I don't watch films with Kristen Stewart, she's really boring as an actress, but I thought she was the only interesting character here.Patrick Stewart is old. I thought Star Trek: Picard was forcing him in that role, but now I realize he just acts like on a stage, which doesn't translate that good on screen. He seems out of place.In conclusion, this is a normal, mediocre action film, but it's far from being a 1 star.

I thought the cast was fresh and did a pretty good job. I'm not a big Kristen Stewart fan but I liked here in this one. The overall pace wasn't boring, the action was pretty good and not over the top as compared to the earlier movies.

543,pearson252,Fun movie,8,3 December 2019,"Once again sensitive straight men get trigger over nothing. This idea of an agenda that women can be in movies is so dumb, it's just now anytime a women complains in a movie about a man saying you need to smile, isn't some huge feminist agenda. Let's be honest if you genuinely want to see the movie you're not going to be one of those sensitive guys.Seen the movie today it was enjoyable, nice pacing, I'm genuinely not a big kristen Stewart fan but I actually really like her in this movie.
I loved how they made the original TV show, the mcg Charlie's Angel cannon, I wasn't expecting that. Now the movie is less bubblegum music video like the previous movies. The tone was abit like the new fast in the furious movies, as in don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it. The plot was the usual popcorn action stop the wrong people from get tech that can be weaponised. Because this genre is it, the twist are a bit predictable.Its a shame the movie didn't do well money wise, and bashed it, because it set up some interesting world building, I loved how the townsend agency has went globally, I like the idea Charlie is most likely a rank, like bolsey as we see a female hand to communicating using a voice changers.
I would of loved to see naomi scotts characters progress.I really enjoyed Noami Scott in this movie, she reminds me of SMH abit acting wise. Banks was her usually charming self, Ella Balinska had some great moments. But Kristen Stewart I was genuinely surprised how much I liked her character. I do think people need to know the difference between not like an actress or a character vs bad acting. Because people saying she's a bad actress arnt being objective with themselves. For example I couldn't watch the punisher, because I absolutely hated Shane in the walking dead, it had zero to do with the actor. But it put me off watching The punisher.
Candace Cameron Bure stopped be from contuines watching fuller House after the horrible things about lgbt never mind trump supporters, that being said because of that I wouldn't say shes a bad actor or can't act.

Having said that, what the Hell happened with this movie? To be a viable film, Banks' iteration of the ""Angels"" legend needed to be either absolutely hilarious or a glorious series of impeccably choreographed fight scenes. Both would have been sublime. Neither was a major letdown.Kristen Stewart is always just the worst. I wasn't expecting much there. Her flattened affect lends itself to comedy stingily. I mean, the girl is not funny. Her action scenes are lazily executed. She perpetually wears the condescending smirk of an angsty teen, as though she hates what she is doing. Really, Kristen, why not just completely break the Fourth Wall? Just stare straight into the camera and tell the audience how dumb the movie they've paid to see is. You've only been paid millions of dollars to be here. No big deal though. Phone it in. We didn't want you here in the first place.Sadly, if you strip away Stewart's star power, all you have to judge this flick on is the inexperience of practically everyone involved. Making an action film is an art form. Banks underestimated the challenge she faced in this regard. The editing was all over the place and choppy as can be. During the action sequences, you could barely tell what was happening most of the time. The actors obviously hadn't undergone much fight training at all. Ella Balinska was the only vaguely credible fighter, but her prowess as an actress left much to be desired. As a fan of the MCG installments and of action movies in general, the neglect shown to the quality of the action scenes stung.The writing was pretty rough too. It felt rigid and not human. Neither funny nor interesting, I felt my IQ dropping the second the movie started. The movie was aimed at female empowerment, but it ended up just being terrible, strangely socially retrogressive, and overall forgettable. It's too bad, because I wanted to like this one. I give it a D-Minus. Don't watch it. You can trust me. I've watched it all.",Charlie's Angels

Basically, it felt like a real cheap, and long, pilot episode. Which obviously wouldn't get picked up by any network, at all!
And it makes the last CA movies feel like Oscar winners.I'm comparing this one with the all female Ghostbusters movie. They made this with no heart OR effort. Just throw in a bunch of nobody's as the lead actresses. And let a nobody direct the movie.
I mean, there are plenty of both big budget, and low budget indie movies that became huge successes.
But this one, just as Ghostbusters, was just made to showcase ""girl power"" and ""female empowerment"". Forget about script and buildups, rip off Fast and Furious, Mission Impossible and copy paste some Michael Bay style. Done.
Forget about character. Just be bad ass women. In a dull, no talented, cliché, predictable, acting manner.
Because this isnt new, at all. A Charlies Angels movie DOES have the potential to be great and awesome, IF it had the right actresses, with chemistry on screen, a new and improved script, and perhaps some better directing.
Blaming and arguing that Wonder Woman was so popular just because its related to comics is just BS. That movie was great and entertaining. Plus it didnt have that PC feeling over it.",Charlie's Angels

Kristen Stewart's character was quirky and unique in a modern way that felt realistic though a bit goofy at times.

It wasn't advertised as one and despite the opinions of these other reviews, I wasn't at all bored. I didn't 'fall asleep' or wish I was doing anything else. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Stewart plays her character incredibly well, and is definitely one of the best things about this movie. Contrary to other viewers, I thought the acting in this film was very solid, and the amount of action was perfect, and also a really consistent plot line. It's not oscar winning that is for sure, and if you're in a mood for a serious, emotional action / thriller that has the same tone as the previous charlie's angels this is not the film for you. However, for a causal viewing of a genuinely funny and exciting action film, this is a really good shot. I can't speak for all the other reviewers, but I would definitely recommend this film. Sure it's cheesy at times, but having women as the protagonists makes absolutely no difference to the plot line, and I thought it was just as good, if not better than the previous 'Charlie's Angels.'",Charlie's Angels

Stewart) and plot much more.
And for those who use box office as proof of the movies poor quality: I am not sure you noticed, but the film has yet to be released in cinemas in most of Europe (click on the ""release date"" button, you'll see).

And then the opening girl on bike, girl smiling, girl being a....girl, montage immediately after!That opening 5 minutes did more to make me question how conceited the writers/director/studio really are. I'm pretty certain they just caused more hate toward a gender than any bloke who still lives in the dark ages and should be treated as such.In summary, I did watch the whole film and if all the cringy preaching had been removed, the film was certainly not the worst.

The movie abruptly changes tone after that and I began to wonder if I was watching a two hour tampon commercial. (Oddly, that's when they literally introduced a van filled with tampons with very little explanation.)In the end, I was left wondering what type of movie this was supposed to be. I can't see fans of action movies or comedies enjoying it, and it likely wouldn't appeal to anyone who feels strongly about women's issues (the women all have so much eye make-up on that they look like raccoons). All in all, the movie felt like it was assaulting my frontal lobe. Hopefully it works out better for you, if you have to watch it for some reason.

It was fun, fast, silly at the right times, and I left feeling good about the world and myself. That's a lot to get from one movie, so I was thoroughly happy with it.

Any one of them was interchangeable, with the occasional burst of ""oooo I'm rebellious"" to try and make you believe ah that's the rebellious one. Pathetic.2 Action: after all this is an 'action' film, is it not. The pace of which was very very pedestrian, nothing really good and/or above competent.3 Music: dear god the music was awful, what was that bilge. Nothing that was memorable or fitted the film or action. In fact it seems that music was, I'm going to say produced, but probably mean vonited and just jammed in there to pay some moxy.4 Antagonists: please could I have a decent villain please, one you can remember. This one wasn't overt, wasn't underplayed, just boring.5 Story: that's what we are here for, a good story with twists and turns, thrills and spills. Not something a monkey had produced from its rectum and daubbed on the page, like a smear across all that is good in creativity.6 Camera Work/Interesting shots: looking like it had been filmed in a very very work-a-day fashion by some kind of listless scarecrow who may have filmed it on there iPhone.7 CGI work: from the get go at the retirement of Patrick Stewart's character (Dear god sir, why are you consigned to this twaddle) even the pictures he had been added into looked like someone's nephew could have done a better job with paint in 1999.So with all these poibts considered, what do we have left. Let's see, there is some light and some noise for 2hrs. So it may keep some poor soul company, for that time.
But as a film, that is for the entertainment of human beings, not hamsters, not badgers, not meer cats. It is wretched.If I were you I would, and I shudder to say this. Dig out the first Barrymore, Diaz and yes Liu (the talentless flesh bag she is) and re watch that. I mean even the bits where Matt LeBlanc is being his Joey character grimmly trying to grip hold of some remaining career, were better than this .....I'm going to say effort, but I feel I may mean hideous pile of mixed diseased animal faeces.",Charlie's Angels

It wasn't revolutionary in any sense of the word and being a remake of a remake does bring a lot of baggage but it was a good action movie. Maybe they didn't include as many iconic lines as you would have liked from a Charlies Angels movie and they had a female Bosley (I don't think that counts as a spoiler) which some have said is disgraceful.Having said all this the movie was pretty good. There was a decent amount of action and perhaps most surprisingly I really liked Kristen Stewart in this movie - like really liked her. I liked all the female leads actually and Patrick Stewart was excellent as always - in fact all the bit casts were good, I even liked the Assassin by the end of the movie who at first I was very unsure about. I used to joke that the mirror in Snow White was on drugs to suggest that Kristen Stewart was the fairest of them all and that the Twilight actress couldn't act and was unattractive but she was excellent in this. She was personable and portrayed the character exactly as I thought she should have. She was cool, fun and really sexy - in fact I wasn't certain it was her until I logged on to IMDB this morning!All said and done if you like action movies on the big screen then you will like this - I don't see how you can't!

Dont get me wrong, there's many movies that potraying a women as a main character that i like. For example, one of them is wonder woman, yes i love gal gadot in it. At least she's good at acting and the movie had soul in it. What this movie lacks was the soul. You will agree with me when your watching this movie. Want my advice? Dont waste your time on this. You'll not miss anything. For the feminist part, If you have an agenda why not you give it a go at the street rather than trying to send the message throughout the movie.

But those concerns were quickly laid to rest.I don't have an issue with women playing the lead roles in any kind of movie. It's all about the quality of the story/script writing and, of course, the acting. While the story is not the strongest, the film's 3 main characters are likeable and the acting decent, in particular Kristen Stewart.I'm no high-brow movie critic or a movie snob, as you can probably tell from this review. But I watch a lot of movies and at the end of the day the thing I want most from a movie is to be entertained.

I went with a large group of friends (a mix of genders) who were all pleasantly surprised.I think people are going into this expecting it to be exactly like what they already enjoy from Charlie's Angels and being critical of everything different.

Her comedic chops in this flick are awesome! She is so funny! Like in the best ways. I want more directors and producers to see her this way and enhance her skills in her films. She is a genius. Plus she is sexy as hell! Her dance skills are exceptional and I was left wondering how much she learned on set and how much was natural. I really love the other actresses in this movie as well. They are not only gorgeous, but incredibly talented. I hope to see more of them on the future. I love the women featured in this movie and greatly appreciate the work they put into this film. I genuinely hope to one meet Kristen though...she was by far my favorite. This movie kicks ass overall and personally I think holds it's own with the others in this franchise. Kristen made this movie for me.",Charlie's Angels

Sure the device behind the plot is kinda goofy but you don't watch die hard for it's deep philosophical musings.

Ella Balinska simply can't act. She is so wooden, she must have splinters. Her scene when she tries to cry when Kristen Stewart is seemingly at death's door was horrendous.

672,sierra_dawn12,Elizabeth banks...,2,25 November 2019,I actually went to see this movie because of the comment she said about it being a female led action movie and that is why it tanked. Also how some comments about how the men in this movie were portrayed as stupid.( which they were. To me this was the best part of the script. As many men do stupid things for beautiful women without thought it was satirical and the only funny thing. versus men driven movies where beautiful women do anything for men old enough to be their father...lambo please!) this script was so bad the acting was average just in the sense that there was no chemistry at all like none of the actors liked each other.

People used to get upset over remakes but at least they for the most part tried to add something and make it their own ""Dawn of the Dead,Hills Have Eyes,Halloween,etc now its just a quick cash grab and not even that as these stupid agenda filled ""films' are flopping left and right. As an Actor its frustrating as hell because they are erasing what I loved about the industry..no not every movie has to be a thought provoking series masterpiece but jesus christ at least make it fun and entertaining ..you try playing to that twitterverse that wont even support your film anyway you will lose evwrytime.",Charlie's Angels

683,jogoodman-42124,A Female POV,1,15 March 2020,"I am a female and felt completely embarrassed by this film, so much so I turned it off after half an hour. The first opening scene says it all, how a male condescending character says women can't or shouldn't do this or that. Then every other male character you meet, with the exception of Bosley, is either a jerk or a complete idiot! It's absolutely pathetic and totally unnecessary.All of these woke films gracing the big screen nowadays are a joke. We have had strong lead females in past films for many years - alien, terminator, Halloween, Columbiana, tomb raider, underworld... The list goes on. Please stop this growing trend Hollywood, we don't need this ""women are strong"" message shoved down our throats. We know we are strong and so are a lot of men for that matter, we don't need you to tell us.",Charlie's Angels

It's indeed like the other extreme side, what they see in E.Banks is what they are themselves.This film might be showing far more authenticity of people, less pretention and artificiality, despite the ridiculous action and story, the portrayal of some men and women is so dead on in this one, it's chilling. I love the acting, action, the mystery, the quirky fun of the whole thing is irresistible. Very good film. Easily one of the best spy action films of the last two decades.",Charlie's Angels
685,lenkatoulalala,The sequel would be so welcome... PLEASE!!!,10,2 December 2019,"We know now that almost every single film in history has had some political agenda, a lot of times filmmakers have just not been aware they are psychologically influencing people how to be or see the world. This is something so admirable about these recent films that have managed to abandon the old paradigm, they are more self aware about themselves and the power of their beliefs they are spreading through actions, words or themes in their films, which is something I'm grateful to see in more and more films these days, because they're far more conducive to healthy human spirit and condition than ever before, especially when they used to be so unconscious.What I love about this film is how for a change filmmakers are making mockery of gender or race stereotypes, especially in a film that that is largely removed from reality in terms of the genre or story. This is easily one of the best spy films of the last 2 decades, and certainly the best film this year so far. It just needs to find the right audience, many losers just go watching films only to end up feeling miserable, this is not for them, all it shows is just how they waste their life, it has nothing to do with the movie, be always mindful of that, as some of them probably are not.",Charlie's Angels

The acting is great, the locations are gorgeous (as are the actresses!!), and it's surprisingly funny too- I found myself laughing out loud several times.

What dome may confuse with hyper feminity is only an all female cast with its women not wearing bikinis and instead using their intelligence and talents and not being mannekins. White men who are usually the leaders and saviors instead take the role of sidekicks, bad guys, and just normal people.

Shouldn't be compared to the 2000's films.
Doesn't seem to take it's self too seriously, in most aspects, but potentially a little heavy-handed in spots with the underlying message.I thought the overall plot was expected but not bad, the acting was good, and I enjoyed seeing a different side of Kristen Stewart, who I feel is coping it from the twilight days, she's definitely a better actor than that.
The other two angels did a great job with their characters as well, don't think being as unknown as they are impacted the movie at all. Thought the chemistry between them was solid too.Would've appreciated a better introduction/back story to the characters, and did feel it dragged on in some sections. Could've used more action scenes, and I felt the beginning montage of girls doing things was unnecessary.Otherwise a good fun movie if you have 2 hours to kill, especially if you don't take it or yourself too seriously.",Charlie's Angels
697,sexbomombassett,It's not nearly as bad as people say but it is cringey,5,24 November 2019,"As opposed to the campiness of the original Charlie's angels and of the older movie it's not nearly as cheap. Kristine Stewart was a surprisingly strong role, very well written, and probably the highlight of the film. The sound track was pretty bad and out of place and definitely it's weakest aspect. The opening sequence was the most cringe inducing but ignoring that it's a descent action-comedy with a few good laughs and a descent twist.

I think the casting was great and the actors gave tremendous performances. I appreciate all the hard work and vision Elizabeth put in to this film. I could see many of her little, well thought out touches. I am not a fan of feminist, man bashing movies, and I never once felt a twinge of that.
I think this movie will be one that people realize is great after it's out of theaters, like Pitch Perfect.
I will certainly watch it again and even hope for a sequel because Naomi Scott as an Angel would be boss. Thank you to the entire cast and crew. I know so much we don't see goes in to creating a film like this and it's sad when that is not appreciated or recognized.",Charlie's Angels
701,threenotch,Better than I expected,8,20 June 2020,"I enjoyed the film. Yes it is light entertainment fare, but it never tried to be anything else. I appreciate it when the company of actors along with the production crew stay true to the body if work. It was meant to be a film supporting strong women even if flawed but redeemed.

Seriously, some comments saying they did not enjoy the film because the angels were not ""sexy"" or ""pretty"" enough... well they obviously missed the point. It is about female empowerment and not about being objectified. Just lighten up and enjoy it! For me personally it was refreshing. There will always be some predictable moments but I thoroughly enjoyed it and liked the twists! Don't think of it as a reboot, think of it it as a new film with a new story to tell.

Super I repeat super disappointed that they made Bosley number one a bad guy, did they just rewrite Mission Impossible 1?.
How about a little more thought about plots next time the action was fine, kind of what you expect from a movie like this.

715,TMLS313,No Angels but No Devils either!,6,12 August 2020,"I've been a big Charlie's Angels fan since I was really young when the TV show was on. The McG movies were what they were meant to be - fun, popcorn stuff and turn your brain off and enjoy. I don't see this as being much different to be fair.Sure, it's not a great movie, but neither were those. But the people giving this 1s can't have seen the TV reboot from a few years with Minka Kelly and some others I don't even remember the names of - now THAT was bad!You don't have to agree with something being pushed down your throat because it's there and whilst there's definitely ""feminist overload"" it's always been a story about strong, smart and powerful women overcoming odds generally from male antagonists. If you go into an Angels movie expecting otherwise then you can't know the franchise at all!It's not the best casting, but they seemed to run with who was in the roles. Scott is probably the best of the core three, and whilst Stewart is of course the weakest she's not ridiculously out of place and at least shows a couple of expressions for the first time since... well, probably ever. The other girl's a newcomer basically and does what she's required to do. Some have said they don't find them attractive... so what? It's not a porn movie and since it's subjective I wouldn't say no to the latter two!Sir Patrick Stewart as the original Bosley doesn't work and that's a shame. If anything, that's the character so out of place if he's meant to be the one from the original series and without spoilers what they've done to him is probably the most unforgivable thing.But I can live with stuff like that. Not every movie needs to be Citizen Kane. There are FAR worse movies out there, adaptations or not.Just make your own mind up. It's all about your own personal opinion at the end of the day - now click to say this wasn't helpful those of you who can't cope with someone's own opinion.

Smart script, solid, complex action sequences, and good acting. The biggest star here is Banks' unpredictable script, filled with twists and misdirections that are rewarding and surprising. Yes, there are lines of dialogue that push us in a paradigm shift around gender in the spy/action genre - and why not?! It's smart, clever, and fun! Ignore the negative reviews here complaining that the film is ""too woke."" I'd say it's a film of the times - and it's a great time!!! I hope we get another - who knew Banks would be so good at action films! More please!",Charlie's Angels

It was no more unbelievable in action than any other movie of its genre, and Kristen Stewart clearly had a lot of fun with her character. I really felt the connection between the Angels, and loved seeing the story brought into a high tech, modernised vision.
Honestly, the hardest part for me was realising I was going to see Elizabeth Banks or Patrick Stewart go evil, but it worked for a great story and brilliant ending.
The iconic 3 Angels will always be the classic story, but this retelling of sharing the power honestly made for a compelling and exciting film. I'm truly devastated that there won't be another.",Charlie's Angels
727,lpucci,Better by a mile than Terminator Dark Fate,6,14 November 2019,"It is what it is. Tries to be too stylistic with jarring camera movement during action scenes which can be pretty unnerving to watch. Story twists were a bit too obvious to me. The girls had decent chemistry. Ellla Balinska might have a pretty decent career and would be a reasonable Bond if they ever relent and have a female lead in that franchise.By no means was this a great film but it was head and shoulders above that travesty Terminator Dark Fate. How that movie is rated 6.5 and this one below 4 makes me seriously doubt the veracity rankings. That said, in my opinion this film was not in the same league as the Kingsman movies and Spy for humorous spy film franchises.",Charlie's Angels

Didn't think that would be something I'd have to do in 2020 but here we are. The film is OK, as much fun as you'd expect from a Charlie's Angels film. All they did was flip the script and that wasn't popular. There are tonnes of similar films out there with better reviews, only difference is they're full of men. It's not that deep, guys.",Charlie's Angels

Honestly I really enjoyed this, I loved that the movie payed homage to the original angels of the 70s and the films in the 2000s. I thought it was a fun movie, not to mention all the new extensions Banks made to the film. Kristen Stewart is the star of the show, she truly shines in this film, never have I ever seen her so comfortable in a role. This is a great movie 10/10",Charlie's Angels
731,jetpilot29,More woke garbage!,1,10 January 2020,"First off, I want to start by saying that I genuinely like movies with strong female characters. Terminator, Alien, Kill Bill, Wonder Women, The Hunger Games, Resident Evil, just to name a few. I do believe people like seeing some movies with strong, capable female characters kicking butt and overcoming odds, it's exciting and can be inspiring. I knew it was going to be a pile of waste when I saw some of the producers preemptively protect this movie by saying in interviews that men/people are sexist if they don't go see this film and like it.I really debated rather or not I should sit here and write out why this movie is so bad. But honestly it's not worth the time. I wouldn't recommend it but if you do see it you'll most likely understand. It's nothing more then feminist man hating woke garbage. Built around poor low energy acting (God Kristin Stewart was awful), some unrealistic over the top action scenes, and terrible writing and plot lines. How many hundreds of millions of dollars is Hollywood going to waste on garbage like this before they realize people don't want to see it. No matter how many positive reviews this movie gets they can't alter the profit loss statement. And this movie is due to loose tens of millions of dollars. Not surprising. Basically another Ghostbusters 2016 type movie where you have an unnecessary franchise reboot with a bunch of woke Hollywood garbage, antagonistic and very divisive marketing, a substandard script, and  producers who blame the failures on the very audience members they want coming to see the film.",Charlie's Angels

733,mariakattou22,Actual female perspective,8,26 July 2020,"I liked it. Good acting, action and subtle comedy.
I am sick and tired of everyone hating every single remake is made and especially when its more female cast.
Examples Oceans 8 , Ghostbusters. Of course people hated it cause it was a remake and more female actors. Well well isnt that thinking forward and positive.
When the actors and the movie is good why on earth hate it so much.
I read somewhere how a gender obsession can ruin a film. Really?
Its like saying James Bond is too manly and has sex with every woman he sees and thats taking advantage. Lol grow up people. Men are allowed to be this obnoxious and admit it so can women.
EQUALITY :)",Charlie's Angels

You can tell the action shots weren't done very professionally - not up to par as the old McG movies. Also, I think the actresses could have trained better and made the action shots more real and wow...The women were definitely HOT in this film but come on - it was lacking in 1) the WOW factor for kick-ass martial arts 2) quirky jokes & fun & 3) crazy silly seductions. I mean Wonder Woman was HOT too but when she kicked did it was kickass! Could have been done much better (not just a casting problem). QUALITY MATTERS Hollywood!",Charlie's Angels

The action was ok, not too heavy, like i said earlier: easy. Easy watching and easy to follow. All these complaints about ""pushing an agenda"" and i honestly don't see it. Charlie's angels have always been about women secret agents, this isn't a reboot with the gender reversed. Nothing on this is man hating, they made sure to include men as the heroes & badass villains. So like, if you think women existing and doing things is ""Hollywood propaganda"" then i guess this movie, or even this earth, isn't for you. Suck it up and have some fun, don't take things too seriously, not every movie have to be pretentiously artistic and depressing.

Full disclosure I think I enjoyed it so much because of nostalgia, I absolutely adored the original movies; it was a childhood favorite of mine!I think we should look at this reiteration of Charlie's Angels as something that exists to inspire young girls just like how the original movies did. The og Charlie's Angels empowered the heck outta me, it was the first time I saw Powerful women Playing the main character, also the first movie that resonated with me because someone in the main cast looked like me (first Asian actress I saw on tv <3 Lucy Liu)Therefore, if we look at this as something FOR the younger girls/women of this generation.

At the end of the day, the film is by Elizabeth Banks of Pitch Perfect fame and so you get what you pay for. You might have higher expectation of the film based on the cast but the three female leads do a decent job and work well together. It's easy going, the plot's not complicated and easy to follow and if you've got a couple of hours to spare where you don't want to think too hard, then you just might what to give this film a watch.

I watched the old Charlie's movies a long time ago and obviously loved them, but still, knowing the nature of remakes - I didn't expect it to be the same, just fun.
And it sure did the job.
Yes, it definitely has some downsides to it - Kristen played pretty good but the character was SO annoying, every time I saw her on screen I wanted her to leave.
The over-feminism in the film wasn't as unasked for as it was very obvious, what made it feel a bit uncomfortable.
Overall, I enjoyed it and don't think it should have such negative reviews, which I believe it only got because of the comparison to the original movies.

This is more a follow up to the earlier movies, not a remake. It doesn't disrespect the prior movies/show but plays off them.2. Girl power issues? Okay, so what??? The target audience is girls and young women, why can't an empowering movie be made for them? I did not think this movie was anti-men, if anything the 2000 version was because all the men were idiots except the bad guys.3. For the people saying the 2000 version and Full Throttle were better.... have you watched those movies lately? I love those actresses and grew up watching them, but come on, every other line was a joke. Tom Green was in the 2000 version and you're really arguing about the quality bring amazing/better??? (Don't get me wrong they're fun movies.)4. Kristen Stewart did a really good job. She's not going to be like Meryl Streep, but she was a lot of fun to watch in this. She seems WAY more comfortable and confident in her role and didn't have her blinking issues like in earlier films.5. There were a couple of over the top, I guess ""feminist"", scenes: One near the beginning that I didn't fully understand why it was there (I think it was trying to follow the 2000 version) and then one near the end but won't spoil.This is a fun movie and I would encourage people to watch it!",Charlie's Angels

I've recently re-watched both and came to watch the 2019 version prepared to like it in spite of bad reviews.It starts off with a typical witty bad guy Angel interaction that is supposed to draw you in, smiling, imagining yourself sitting there in her place, feeling the attraction brushing off on you. But only minutes in, it feels like a knock-off instead of the real deal.Stewart sits there in an ill-colored wig and can't quite make me believe she is the cool, lethal seductress that she is embarrassingly literally explaining to the audience she is. In stead of an exiting back-and-forth between her and the bad guy, the man is just portrayed as a flat dummy with nothing to say. Cringe! That's not what girl power is about.

We have our own private opinions about why agenda-minded people may have given this movie a poor rating. I grew up a Charlie's Angel fan from its inception many years ago. My wife and I both commented that this is the best Charlie's Angels movie we have seen, and we have seen them all. I thought these three angels were all very easy on the eyes (a supposed MUST to be an angel), where in the past there have been some ""angels"" that were definitely NOT so easy on the eyes IMHO. Let me qualify what I am going to say by this: I am not a Twilight fan, nor have I ever been much of a Kristin Stewart fan at all. Never honestly understood the hype, especially since there were far more attractive young women that the ""totally gorgeous"" Edward could have fallen for. Now, that said, Kristin Stewart is absolutely stunningly gorgeous and unbelievable in this movie. In every scene. In every outfit. smartest ""angel"" ever. She knocked my socks off (figuratively). I couldn't imagine me saying this (before I saw it) but I would love to see it again tomorrow. The story was good, the twists reasonably unexpected and the acting as professional and good as expected from a cast that was chosen well. They all had their funny moments and the movie was filled with, not belly-laugh out loud moments, but comical moments that made one smile and laugh all the way through. Do yourself a favor gentlemen (and ladies), go see this movie. Keep the ""4"" rating in your head and go see if this movie is truly a ""4"". You will realize, if you are honest, that the movie is what it purports to be: fun, enjoyable and action-filled. Oh yeah, and say hi to Kristen for me!",Charlie's Angels

While the plot idea can hold up, although a bit predictable, it is so poorly executed that I was almost bored. The acting is really bad, this is definitely NOT an action movie.

782,nardellacn,Movie rocked my socks off,10,5 December 2019,"Kristen: probably one of the best she's done since Catch That Kid, Zathura, or Welcome to the Riley's: she should explore her sense of humour more often in roles. And thank you for having a character who hints at more aspects of herself when to comes to those who she is attracted to. Stewart's come a long way since Twilight.Ella Balinska: first time seeing her acting, and it made a really good impression.Naomi Scott: really has an essence of Buffy from the TV show, I don't know how, but it's cool! Mannerisms, maybe even the funny puns.Like everything that tries to do something new, it will always have not so great reviews. It needs to stick. Something has to start somewhere, somehow. Sorry this one didn't have as much skin reveal as other movies: this one had a different approach (and the 2000 movie was at a time when people weren't streaming as much, so can't blame box office ticket sales on all movies results nowadays, can we?)Excellent movie.

I am a bit disappointed that the new one didn't very well. While a lot of people didn't want to watch it, because there have been a lot of remakes, this movie is worth the money and the time. It is a good action movie. While some scenes might be a little boring, most are very entertaining in several ways.
With the discussions about women's rights and equality going on everywhere in the world, this movie has a great introduction where two characters talk about that specific topic. It is in general empowering for girls and women.
Apart from that, the framing and editing are great. The locations and cloths that the characters wear were chosen nicely. Both help to give the movie a colorful and fun look. The actors and actresses do a really good job too",Charlie's Angels

I don't believe in any idealogical followings but there is nothing wrong in woman empowerment (I dont know the actual word).

Nowadays there are much more movie review sites.I feel lucky that I did not remember much about the original, otherwise maybe I might also have hated this?The feminism in the movie is actually quite subtle, I don't think it is as preachy as haters are saying. They are probably just too sensitive.Anyway, it is fun, hilarious and has a good pace although it doesn't have an amazing plot. It deserves 6/10 or 7/10.

Banks had some funny lines--she was more reserved than I expected--Kristin Stewart was more the jokester--and she was good kind of playing at her public persona.Not sure why the polarizing reviews--maybe Stewart has a hate her or love her reaction for some viewers? Sure you can complain about the plot--but name any movie in this action genre that is much different--I mean all the plots are simple and silly, all the action is over the top ridiculous, and men or women you have BS indestructible leads who are usually outclassed 50+lbs by their foes.

806,GizmoMac52,Charlie's Angels? No. More like Charlie needs improvement and potential.,6,30 August 2020,"Look, I have got to be honest with this movie (as a 20 year old female). I've watched the whole thing and the entire movie needs tons of editing. Tons of it.Let's start off with the script and the story - it needs improvement in character writing, because all of the characters had potential. I wished that they started in the character's backstory. And as an audience, we got to see them on a journey and how they became empowered. Actions speak louder than words - why go and tell rather than act? Yes, we get that all of the girls are powerful, but where was the main struggle in all? It seemed like Elena was the only one who was really struggling. But what about the other two? Jane and Sabina? I really wished they gave the movie more of the Kill Bill vibe. For instance, with Beatrix (we, as an audience see her entire journey filled with actual purpose and a theme that is gradually built). But as for Charlie's Angels? It was too much of a dead giveaway. Why just attack the men for no reason? Just because they didn't like the Calisto? It had so much more potential to the story. The script and the story needed improvement and re-vision in my opinion.Secondly, the fight choreography. The Angels should have used hand-to-hand combat rather than weaponry most of the time. Why? It shows their true skills, not having to rely on gadgetry and it shows how smart and capable they are when using hand to hand combat (just like the 2000's Angels - it showed their true potential).The movie's theme is about progression and female empowerment - it's great that we have ""diverse"" characters, but as for the use of gender? I think it's a bit of a step too far. Female empowerment should be a real struggle that an individual overcomes that we see along as an audience (yes, for Elena). Although, I just wished that we got to see a backstory for the other Angels (like Dylan in the originals).However, for the cinematography, I thought that the use of props and mise-en-scene were fantastic. I really liked the futuristic approach for the film and I think the production team did great on that. I also loved the costumes and the makeup, I thought it was modern and stylish and it seemed to fit the characters great. The setting and the location for the atmosphere? I thought it was well-used too, and it gave me that ""James Bond""-esque vibes/approach to the movie. The camera shots they used were also great, but a bit too much of a quick pacing and it almost felt like a flash sometimes - especially during the fight scenes. And the lighting/filter? The use of natural lighting was conveniently used - nothing overdone or underdone, it was honestly great.Lastly, as for the actors - I think that Ella Balinska did an excellent job for Jane and she knew her character well and the same goes for Naomi Scott (as Elena). The two did embrace their characters well. And what about Kristen Stewart? I must say, she improved and I can see a potential for her. She had a huge range of emotions and actions and I think that Elizabeth Banks did well on capturing Sabina for Kristen. Also, Elizabeth Banks did well for Bosley, she was entirely different - fun, fresh, energetic and exciting. The other actors (Patrick Stewart, Sam Clafflin, etc) had potential as well for a villain, but as I said from earlier - lack of gradual buildup.And as for a sequel? I better hope that Elizabeth Banks should take criticism and improve on that - positively. And if everything does improve, then most of the audience should give it a second chance. Maybe hire a different writer, producer or editor perhaps?And my rating would be a 6/10. Recommend to watch? Just watch the classics if you'd like a real throttle experience.",Charlie's Angels

It is not a bad film, by any means - I have certainly seen much, MUCH worse. It's actually unreal how much hate this movie is getting, it's kind of absurd really. It almost seems to be fake; in a way that I wouldn't be surprised if half of the negative reviews come from people who haven't even seen the film and were just sitting around on their phone waiting for the release day, itching to spout nonsense.It's a decent movie! It's fun, it's funny, it's action packed, it's campy - it has decently written and witty dialogue and likable characters; what more could you want from a Charlie's Angels flick?

The other two girls were great as well. And of course Elizabeth Banks was a delight as Bosley.The story itself was pretty par for the course, but had a few tricks up its sleeve. What was most fun was seeing the girls engage with each other and learn to work as a team. That's where the heart of the film was.

819,capnsol,Tons of silly fun!,10,7 November 2020,"Tons of fun. Fits perfectly in the genre of silly action movie that doesn't try to be realistic or serious. Along the lines of The Fast and the Furious.All of the main characters have a good dose of personality, and they're all fun to watch, and clearly having fun making it, Jane to a lesser extent, but she is playing the serious character, so not really her fault.It's a pretty funny movie, mostly intentional, but there are also a few moments of unintentional humor that just add to the intentional humor. The setting montages are poorly edited, but this ends up adding to the goodness of the movie because they're so good-bad. The CGI is similar in this regard. There are a couple moments when it looks rather cheap. But as I said, it just adds on to the healthy dose of intentional humor.Some people are saying this reboot was pointless or unnecessary, but I disagree. It's been a long time since the last Charlie's Angels. I watched it not long ago and it felt so dated it lost my attention. I'm not saying it's bad, but it's very much from a different era.For the record, I would actually give this an 8/10, but since all the butthurt neck beards with fragile egos are giving this 1s and 2s, I'm trying to restore balance to the force.",Charlie's Angels

Ella is blossoming and K-Stew is her fullest and realest self... this trio is a match and the cameos (possible future multi-teams of angels) are a must see.This 2019 reboot has lot of humor that isn't often super dropping on the floor/ gut bursting, however leaves you feeling good pretty much for the entire ride of this action adventure comedy.Go in with it and have fun.

I'm not sure who came up with the notion that the two main Angels should barely know one another - and not like what they see, until they have bonding time, until they're BFFs for life - unless Elizabeth Banks was intentionally trying to mimic the plot of every male ""buddy movie"" ever made. (Most recent case in point: ""Hobbs & Shaw."" Or the first ""Fast & Furious."" Etcetera.) What made both the last two movies, as well as the original series, believable - despite the outlandish Matrix-esque FX (in the movies) and overpowering ""jiggle factor"" (in the series) - was the visible bond between the Angels themselves.In a similar vein, the Angels always worked as a team - which, in fact, was the entire character motivation for the last movie's villain, a former Angel played by Demi Moore: she proudly worked for herself. (To which Cameron Diaz retorts - in one of the movie's better lines - ""Your boss sucks."" Guess you had to be there...) Jane, meanwhile, is a loner who at one point pushes her partner off a roof on a rappelling rope. (Again, see ""Hobbs & Shaw."")Despite the ostensible ""girl power,"" there's no reason given why the last ""batch"" of Angels, each played by actresses around Elizabeth Banks's own age, have been put out to pasture, as it were. On top of that, Banks hired 22-year-old Ella Balinska to play an ostensibly ""hardened"" former MI6 agent. Considering 53-year-old Halle Berry kicked some serious ass earlier this year in the third ""John Wick"" movie - and even did all of her own stunts, which are far more complex than any of the standard-issue rapid-fire action scenes here - this comes off as more than a bit retrograde ... even considering a particular reveal in the closing credits (which I won't mention for spoilers' sake).Finally, the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense, considering it's largely a remix of the first ""Mission: Impossible"" movie and the last of the two earlier ""Charlie's Angels"" ones, but OTOH it's more cohesive than the previous two iterations, which much of the time came off as excuses to get the Angels into increasingly ridiculous costumes. (At least there aren't any Pussycat Dolls this time around!) And yes, Kristen Stewart is the revelation here, showing surprisingly subtle comedy chops. (Curiously, Banks herself - despite being a gifted comedienne - is largely humorous throughout much of the film, at least until the closing credits.)",Charlie's Angels

People instantly recognise this as bad storytelling.This is why people stay away from films that pander to 'voices', and why so many men and women do not enjoy self-consciously 'female' films. They present diminished caricatures of women, men and human relations, which people experience as untrue. Ideological point-scoring makes for terrible cinema.",Charlie's Angels

A welcome update to the Charlie's Angels franchise.I might not have given it full stars because action movies aren't my go-to. But the first review that imdb was displaying was an off-topic review about how someone thinks this movie is ""offensive to men,"" encouraging people to skip it. Dude: it's not for you. Go review something you can relate to. If you can't accept the ""woman power"" spin on the genre and/or appreciate that apart from that angle it has all the expected elements of any other film from that genre -- plus enjoyable performances by top actors (all genders)*, and minus the loud, testosterone-driven constant cursing and braindead violence that seems to infect so many movies that, therefore, I have no interest in watching -- then it's not for you. You don't get it. Imdb, don't feature a review by someone who can't even ""see"" the movie and then encourages others not to see it!I looked up the ""rookie angel"" on imdb. Turns out she played live-action Princess Jasmine in the Aladdin movie, and is playing the pink power ranger in an upcoming movie. I think of how my niece and nephew watched a bunch of animated princesses when they were little, and they were certain that princesses are magical beings with superpowers. Maybe that will translate into a generation that appreciates the awesome capabilities of women. That's part of the audience for this movie, and that's great.*Of all the performances I liked in this movie, maybe the tops were the two Stewarts -- Kristen and Sir Patrick. Love!

In my opinion, acting, and I spoke about the second option. I liked acting, three girls: Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Ella Balinska, main cast Patrick Stewart, Djimon Hounsou and Luis Gerardo Méndez.
Directing is bad because Elizabeth Banks was taken as an ordinary movie not a reboot film for a new series.
The story is not strong and attractive to people who love movie stories, but it is good for a new series
The movie failed many reasons, and Elizabeth Banks' permits and implementation of the film to show it in the fastest time,show time (end of the year) is unacceptable in my opinion.I saw Charlie's Angels on November 25th, his last week in cinema, and I wrote this review as my first movie review in Imdb.

The writing is better, thinking outside the box (the story line is modern). Loved the entire cast....(Patrick Stewart, Elizabeth Banks - really great in their parts). I found the characters more believable than last version. Love the messages at the beginning and throughout (inspiring women to not play small, that you can be sensitive and strong)... Love the action in just the right amount, smart and believable.

Well, I guess I'm very much wrong about my first opinion on the remake. The remake continues to show the women empowerment vibe from the TV Series, Movies and to this remake. I love how they made the plot twist classic, it's very Charlie's Angels. This is a new generation of Charlie's Angels, and they are slaying it. I never knew I would see the chemistry I saw from the 2000 & 2003 angels to the remake angels. Ella Balinska, Naomi Scott and Kristen Stewart is very promising and they are so amazing. I, personally love Jane (Ella Balinska). But, the first Charlie's Angels movie is much more fun than this. But, both of the movies are very fun to watch and worth to watch.

891,alise-16024,Charlie's Angels NOT babies Angels.,8,22 December 2019,"I really do not understand what the complaint about how terrible this film is?? It's a reboot of a cheesy 70's show that was not exactly Emmy award winning and especially in this day and age would definitely not been greenlit for television. I went in to have a chilled out afternoon, expecting to be mildly entertained and it ticked all categories.
I'm baffled by what expectations people were wanting? It's a reboot. It's definitely not Academy award winning material and yes there was some clunky moments/dialogue but overall it was entertaining. But then again I guess some people expected something similar to the Expendables. More testosterone than the female Chinese swim team.
This was definitely a fun film, the actors looked like they were all having a good time and not trying to outmuscle each other. Maybe it is a little too much to ask and hope for that a bunch of babies would just enjoy a female directed and female lead roles in an action film without the comparison to testosterone fuelled ones.. oh, that's right.. you do have them. Rocky V anyone?",Charlie's Angels

893,kendraaubry,Fast Paced Fun!,10,20 November 2019,"This movie was fantastic! It streamlined the genres of action, comedy and just enough suspense while still being lots of fun. Kristen Stewart had a lot of good lines and she was not the only one. Well done Elizabeth Banks and thank you for making this film! The world needs more fast paced, funny feminist films like this one and I can't wait to be there in theatres.",Charlie's Angels
894,koopvrouw,Really bad..,3,18 October 2020,"No.. just.. no.. it was awful.Elizabeth Banks and Creepy tattooed assassin were allright though, so the stars are for them.And with was with that dog collar scene??

895,sgombio,Not a big fan,3,15 March 2020,"After seeing previous Charlie's Angels movies i had high expectations on this one. Unfortunately it didn't have the ""action"" like the previous versions. It felt like a teen spy movie. The action was almost non existent and when there's action, it was ""slow"".",Charlie's Angels
896,brmckim,Empowering,8,18 November 2019,"So, I'm pretty sure the majority of the people leaving review on this movie are men. As a woman, I loved this movie. Absolutely loved it. I left it feeling empowered, like I could take on the world. Is this what men feel like after watching every other action movie where all the main characters are men? Also, I saw someone was hating on Kristen Stewart. She was the star of the show!! She was incredible! She really came into her own and shined!!! She was my favorite part of the movie! All of the women did phenomenal jobs. There were also fun plot twists that kept me on my toes throughout. Ignore the hating comments, this movie was golden as an angel's wings.",Charlie's Angels
897,machiboy,Dont waste your time or money,2,20 November 2019,"Wow.. Ill spare you all the details as im sure plenty of other reviews cover them in full, but this movie is trash.

I saw this movie yesterday, haven't seen any trailer at all and I was surprised how entertaining it was.
Just a good action flick, with beautiful girls.
I think Kirsten is stunningly hot.
Just go watch it, the action is nice!
And yes..... Shame on all those too serious, negative people!",Charlie's Angels

903,loranleerskov-89254,Fun fun,6,23 November 2019,I thought it was totally funny and entertaining. Kristen Stewart's most entertaining role. Could be room for improvement but all and all Charlie's Angels has always been cheesy and fun loving.,Charlie's Angels

905,MsHexley,TV Show Succesor,8,2 April 2021,"I'll admit I was a bit worried about this movie cause my first introduction to Charlie's Angels was through the 2000s movies and I always have reservations about sequels. I feel a lot of people went into this movie expecting a successor to those movies rather than the TV show. I'm in the midst of finally watching the TV show and I can say it definitely shares the same vibes as the 2019 movie.The movie has fun with itself in a way I wish a lot of movies in this era did without desperately trying to appeal to the #We'reHip attempt like a lot of these reboot/sequels do or try to be ""gritty"" just cause. It's a fun spy-action movie just like the 2000s movies and just like the first tv show. So long as you go into the movie with that knowledge, it shouldn't be a bad viewing experience.",Charlie's Angels
906,CaptBecks,So many wrong reviews,10,18 November 2019,"This is a super fun movie and would've made a great summer action blockbuster if it were marketed better and released in the summer. It does not belong here in the discard bin before the trickle of Oscar-bait films.Kristen Stewart has reinvented herself, and the rest of the cast is great. The movie had everything you would expect from Charlie's Angels and is no more ""woke"" or feminist than the others, not that that should be a deterrent. There's still plenty for the male gaze, don't worry.",Charlie's Angels
907,MeisterYoda896,Wasnt expecting much and was positively surprised,8,28 March 2020,"Iam usually not the biggest fan of Kristen Stewarts as she allways seems so emotionless in her acting and i wasn't going to the movie in expectation as too good of a movie but was then positively surprised and i really enjoyed it.
But as always enjoying a movie can depend on the mood of the day, so watch it and decide for yourself.",Charlie's Angels
908,jean_cesar,Terrible movie.,1,16 December 2019,"Don't you waste your time watching this. Terrible story, terrible acting. Awful!",Charlie's Angels
909,culmad1,It's a fun movie!,9,18 May 2020,"I went into this movie with zero expectations, and loved it! It is an all around FUN movie. It's got comedy, action, and a pretty good twist. Reading a lot of other reviews, that are comically harsh to be honest, I get the impression people either went into this movie expecting it to be the next Oscar winner or they seem to be from grown ""men"" who can't handle a little girl power.I thought the acting from everyone was pretty good. Once again, award winning, no, but this is a fun popcorn movie, that's all. I'm not normally a huge fan of Kristen Stewart, but actually loved her in this. She seemed to really let her guard down and enjoy herself.Anyways, if you're looking for a fun reboot of a classic franchise, I say give it a watch! Grab some popcorn, or your favorite snack, and have a few laughs!",Charlie's Angels
910,ratcliffz,Nice Action Comedy,5,27 June 2020,"I just recently enjoyed watching this movie as it is free on Starz right now. I read most reviews first and have to say the extremely low 1 to 5 star ratings are trash. The movie kept me entertained it made me laugh and the action was nice but that's what's expected from a action comedy even if it was all male actors. The only scene that seemed a little over the top feminist was the one with the security guard telling her to smile after he completed his security sweep of her. Other than that it is a nicely entertaining action comedy and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel or better yet a TV series to continue the storylines. Having some of the former ""Angels"" appear in the after credits scenes was a welcome extra. Using any of them to play ""Bosely"" would have been an added boost to the overall experience.",Charlie's Angels
911,misrael-1,Waste of time,1,17 November 2019,"Unless you're a preteen or early teen girl, there is not much here of interest. The comedy seemed forced, the plot generic, and the fight scenes were completely silly. The actresses playing the three main characters are talented and do the best with what they have to work with here, but the end result is simply ridiculous.I usually just rate movies and leave it at that, but I felt compelled to actually review this one, that's how bad I thought it was.",Charlie's Angels
912,jonasshafie,Underestimated,6,12 February 2020,"The movie was good and fun, it had a lot of good moments but it wasn't special.
We all have seen a movie with spies who fight an overpowered assassin who never talks.
The movie wasn't bad but still not good, when I go to see a spy movie I usually want the movie to be a little dark and more of a thriller than a comedy, the movie should be more darker and not so colorful.My favorite scene in the movie was probably the first scene where they fought that mafia boss in the tower.The worst scene in the movie was when they went to the horse competition or whatever it's called (the person who came up with that idea should get executed). It was so dumb and the clothes were so absurd.The last thing I want to say about the movie is that I really like the female empowerment feeling the movie gives. Such as the last scene where all the goons faint and all the angels are standing.Lastly I give this movie 6/10",Charlie's Angels
913,zaanislife,Ignore the ratings,8,8 December 2019,"This movie was rated so bad and it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, the movie was an actual genuine good movie, all the ratings are so inaccurate before you judge the movie from ratings, watch it",Charlie's Angels
914,luisamourab,Cringe worthy,3,15 November 2019,"This reboot is unbearable. The Angels are so lost and appear to have no training. The plot is flat and has so many holes, I stopped counting. It's SO BAD I wish I had left the movie theater (I stayed because I had company).",Charlie's Angels
915,ashleytomkinson,Why are the reviews bad?,10,19 November 2019,It had a lot of action and fight scenes with a really interesting plot. I don't see why people are so upset unless they have a problem with the even stronger girl theme,Charlie's Angels
916,BadMoonArisin,"It's not bad, so chill out everybody",7,18 November 2019,"Decided to drop a review here since all of the other reviews appear to be by men that haven't even watched the movie yet.I went in expecting this to be a 5, but walked away surprised that it's a decent 7. It's not great, there are a few jokes that I just kinda clenched my teeth at, but it's nothing that ruined the movie.I, like a lot of people, couldn't stand Kristen Stewart for the longest time, but after seeing her do a good job on SNL I was eager to see her in a more comedic role, and she defintely does a good job here. She's so awkward and weird and does a good job of making scenes awkward in a comedic way. Also glad to see Naomi Scott in another role, I was worried after Power Rangers we wouldn't get to see her again. And I don't know that I've ever seen Elizabeth Banks in something that I didn't like. She sells whatever role she's in.I know a lot of people are saying this movie is ""man-hating"", and I'm sure that's a quick reaction to jump to, but there really isn't any of that here. I went in expecting it to be the sort of heavy-handed ""girls can do anything"" theme, but aside from a very oddly out of place intro, the rest of the movie is free of that. Yes, the **** SPOILER WARNING **** main villain is a male, along with several other male villains along the way, but there are also non-villainous males throughout the film, not to mention one of the previous villains eventually gets turned into an ally. And for people saying it's a crime against the show, did you watch the show? It was also about skillful women taking advantage of scummy dudes,. I would say this movie does that justice.Look it's not gonna dazzle you, but, if you're looking for a girl power film with decent action scenes with chuckles, give this movie a go.",Charlie's Angels

919,ilkindem,So bad that it made me sad,2,23 April 2020,"This movie made me want to reach out to Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore so that I can personally apologize for not being able to stop this movie from seeing the daylight. It takes genuine effort to make a movie this bad, I don't even think it's unintentional.
The only twist in this movie for me was the fact that not a single person from the cast or production during this whole process stopped for a second to just tell others ""Guys i think this is just not working"". Think about it, there must be at least 100 people working on this. It's just... wow.",Charlie's Angels
920,lpowell-00583,Not as bad as the critics say!,8,2 December 2019,"This movie has had some serious critical malling, when I went to an opening day showing in the UK it was half empty. However most of the audiences were groups of under 18 women which thrilled me as it is so important to me that women see representation of themselves on screen which I something this movie does in buckets full. The opening montage of all kinds of women doing great things did bring tears to my eyes. If I had to compare it to a film I did remind me of the spy who dumped me. I recommend people give this movie a go in theatres or on home media",Charlie's Angels

Naomi Scott is hella funny and Ella (gorgeous) and noah is a perfect match damn!I recommend that you guys watch it yourself and don't be influenced by the negativity that it is receiving from haters. I'm even going to rewatch it on cinema. The only sad part is it might not have a sequel because of its performance on the box office but still hoping.,Charlie's Angels
922,minansmansapati,Pretty enjoyable,8,15 November 2019,"I dont understand how it comes people giving 4 stars in average for this movies.. this deserve get way much better that that. This movie is so funny, i really enjoying that. those 3 angels are the best, so much fun. Go get watch yourself i am not lying",Charlie's Angels
923,sanfordemilia,Shades of action wrapped in comedy,8,18 November 2019,"Charlie's Angels its made by director Elizabeth Banks still lifts the story of three tough women who became private detective agents. Being a continuation of Charlie's Angels (2000) and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003), starring Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz, Charlie's Angels 2019 version feels fresher. Now, Kristen Stewart (Sabina Wilson), Naomi Scott (Elena Houghlin), and Ella Balinska (Jane Kano) who are the new generation of Angels.The nuances of the action match wrapped in the comedy Angels make the 1 hour 58 minute film not make the audience bored. The friction between the new Bosley played by Elizabeth Banks and John Bosley, played by Patrick Stewart, is an interesting story in itself. Can they complete the tasks and divisions that exist?
You have to watch guys because the movie is very exciting, enjoy watching..",Charlie's Angels

931,brieditsxo,Don't waste your time,1,16 November 2019,"I was looking forward to this. Sadly, It has absolutely no substance and the acting felt forced, especially from Kristen Stewart. What convinced the studio to throw so much money at this project, what a waste. It feels like a money grab and nobody even tried to make something somewhat decent. What an insult to the film industry, everyone involved should hang their heads in shame.",Charlie's Angels

But I ended up liking it. i particularly enjoyed Kristen here than her, on twilight. Its like she came back from her panic room days. She's good! Elizabeth as always 💪🏻 Do not based it on others. Go and see the movie. Have fun!",Charlie's Angels
933,BlaiseAmistad,Angels reboot does just about everything right,9,16 November 2019,"Producers of Hollywood take note: this is how you do a reboot. Charlie's Angels isn't just resting on its laurels of name recognition, but instead it's doing that thing we always hope a reboot is going to do. It takes the original source material and elevates it. This is Charlie's Angels for a new generation of audience and a new generation of cinema.Let's talk about the cast. The three Angels have excellent chemistry; it's one of those cases where you can tell a movie was fun to make, and that translates directly into it being fun to watch. Newcomer Ella Balinska nails her role as Jane, the deadly combat expert, with confidence, but also imbues her with enough humanity to avoid being an archetype. Naomi Scott is delightful as Elena, the scientist who gets accidentally caught up in a deadly spy game; she plays into her character's vulnerability without losing agency. But Kristen Stewart is the stand-out as Sabina, the slightly unhinged honeypot. She has more charisma on camera than she's ever had, along with excellent comedic timing and really strong physicality. Elizabeth Banks plays fairly to type as the sassy matriarch Rebecca Bosley, but she's fun to watch. And the cast is filled out by excellent supporter roles delivered by Patrick Stewart, Djimon Hounsou, Sam Claflin, and Jonathan Tucker as the main antagonist, very reminiscent of the T-1000 (without the shapeshifting).Writer/director Elizabeth Banks doesn't make any excuses for the fact that she intended this movie to be an anthem for young female viewers. Doubtless that will annoy some people. I might have been annoyed too, if that's all the movie was. But it is built as a really solid action movie from the ground-up. You won't see a lot of tonal similarity between this movie and the classic TV series, or the Drew Barrymore reboot. It has largely replaced the classic Angels campiness with a more modern blend of action and humour. They no longer buy their action sequences from the softer side of Sears. The action is brash and often violent, bearing more similarity to what you'd expect from Mission Impossible or Kingsman. It's still fun and over the top, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, but the action still feels fundamentally grounded. The characters are all believable in their roles.The movie does take a few missteps. The soundtrack by Ariana Grande feels mostly forgettable. Tech writing is not Banks's strong suit, so there are jargony moments when tech buzzwords (like ""blockchain"") are tossed around in a way that doesn't really make sense if you know what the words mean. The story itself doesn't take any big risks. The beats will feel familiar and you're unlikely to be knocked to the floor by the twists. But the plot is coherent and self-consistent, without notable holes or flaws.Overall, the movie is tight, well-paced, and brilliantly acted. It's about as good as anyone could expect it to be, and probably better. As a bonus, Kristen Stewart has never been hotter. The whole cast manages to embody a cool and confident  appeal without resorting to the cheap tricks of previous versions (like Cameron Diaz dancing in her underwear for no reason, or Drew Barrymore dangling naked over the side of a building). It should be a great experience for old and new fans alike.",Charlie's Angels
934,booksumsense,Don't believe the bad reviews,6,17 November 2019,I took my 13 year old as a treat and we had a great time. No this movie won't win any awards but it's loads of fun. Nice to see girls delivering the action. Even better to see Kristin in an upbeat role. I think Elizabeth Banks did a great job. Watch the movie for what it is - fun girl powered action movie great for teens - and you'll enjoy it.,Charlie's Angels
935,manojparvathi,Don't @ me,10,17 November 2019,"This movie is wildly entertaining and just wild throughout! The end credit scenes alone make it worth watching. Kristen Stewart is amazing is this, and the chemistry between the actresses is amazing. They really play off each other and there's an amazing sense of camaraderie which translates so well on-screen. The sheer badassery we see in the movie is pretty cool, too.It's not exactly art, but not all movies about women empowerment need to show that message overtly, and the final showdown made chills run down my spine, with it's intersectional feminist overtones. I think when the ""Don't Call Me Angel"" song came on at the end, I might've teared up a bit.Altogether, it was a dream come true for every woman who grew up watching cool spy movies and wishing that she could be the hero instead of the love interest (I'm looking at you, Bond films!), and it was a fun ride fom start to finish.P.S. There were no petty rivalries or catfights in the movie, and ""damsel-in-distress"" was a cute nerd played by Noah Centineo. I love just how subversive this was!",Charlie's Angels

Solid movie and better than I expected. Had a good story line with actual levels and was well done. Were there some cheesy flashy parts? Yes. Was this anything new to the spy genre? No. I literally created this account to make this review because I'm literally insulted this has a 4 rating but Hobbs and Shaw has a 6??? In what world? If reviewers can a afford the highly ridiculous situations in that movie then you will be more than fine with this. I also liked that it didn't force feminism down our throats but just showed strong spy women being awesome. Liked the story a lot more than the 2000s versions and had fun and some laughs. That was the purpose and it succeeded. These reviews are completely off base and I'm starting to feel a way about it (especially right after Hobbs).",Charlie's Angels

No one wants to be feeded feminist propaganda for almost 2 hours. It was exhausting to see.
The casting was awful, the dialogue was even worse, and the wokeness of the movie made me almost hate women. And I am one.
Stop patronizing your audience with these political messages, stop assuming that all women think the same and that we are gonna see a bad movie just because there are female leads. Make a good movie, and people are gonna see it.

I've recommended this movie to all of my friends and family.I think it's important for me to note that i had not seen the ""original"" charlies angel's before this so i had no prior expectations going in. maybe that's why so many gave this movie a bad review?",Charlie's Angels

YES . the Entire Movie Audience was packed and Clapped several times during the movie !! these Angels are incredible, very very beautiful and dynamic . This film has lots of trolls most of whom feel insecure have extreme inferiority mental complex seeing such exquisite women of different background who are amazingly talented and incredibly lovely. The Characters are unique , fun, special and this movie as a man in my thirties married to a beautiful wife LOVED this Charlies Angels much more than the dinky older diaz drew versions. This is serious but done in a great way with techniques, action, stunts these beauties (real Angels) many did their own and with witty comedy and coolness, a little bit of innocence and sexiness and lots of bravery and beauty. This film features Gorgeous Naomi G Scott who is adorable intelligent, yet introvert character whose cool, beautiful, adorable and fun. Kristen Stewart is sleek, super and unique rather than typical and usual boring previous movies characters and delivers incredible awesome performance and acting natural talent. Ella Balinska is super pretty and is smart, unexpectedly brave,  and can do just about anything a women thinks may not be too easy.",Charlie's Angels

It was highly entertaining. I found myself buying in to the script. Who cares if it wasn't Oscar worthy. If every movie required those stats we would never have any Will Ferrel movies, which deserve one, come on people?!!The good:
It was fun. I didn't find myself checking my watch.Kristin Stewart. Her range is insane. She was awesome and balanced out the cast.The most inspiring cheese and fruit spread ever. After the movie I obviously went to the market and picked up fresh fruit.It made sense. Charlie's Angels has never been Bond, but this film moved from point to point without the campiness of it's predecessors. There weren't over the top stunts and forced comedy. Totally loved that from the previous ones but it wouldn't have worked with this script.Bottom line, it was fun, enjoyable, and full of excitement. Don't hate. We have bigger issues than hating on a film that does nothing but make me want fresh pineapple and to learn Krav Maga.",Charlie's Angels

Harkening back to the 70s TV show, Charlie's Angels has always had messages about strong, powerful women. So what? And calling this movie a re-make is a bad mischaracterization,as it is set 40 years after the TV show with an agency that had grown with the years. I was happy to see that the movie was actually enjoyable, with the traditional plot twists. Was it great art, no. Was it fun, yes.

Having said that however, I do have to agree with some of the reviews that some of the ""feminist"" messages are way over the top and overall are cringe-inducing. Had that been toned down, this would've been a totally fun movie. No, this is not an action-packed action movie to be taken seriously. But as a fun, family, girls' night, somewhat action-ish movie? It's actually kinda cool. If you're looking for some movie to pass the night, this will not bore you.Also Kristen Stewart in this, totally caught me off guard.

""you should wearing makeup ,,,"" ""you should go on a diet."" ""hey, i see your nipple."" ""you can't open your legs , except for sex. hahaha "" we always heard like this crap. you didn't know this, did you?
anyway this movie give me the thought 'womyn can be really cool (not in an appearance )' 'i wanna be that cool ,too.' 'i wanna learn boxing' and so on.

1012,terryganzie,Awful!!! Complete Waste!!!,1,15 February 2020,"I decided to watch this film and I can easily say this is one of the worst decisions I've ever made. Hollywood has become utterly void of actually sitting down and crafting original films. Let's start with the story-line, boring, boring, boring!!! A bunch of females with suspect back stories beat the crap out f every man they come across. That's pretty much the size of it. Throw in some high speed car chases, crashes, few gadgets, the party and nightclub scene, fashion ... if you can call it that, and what you get is a total mess. The acting is undisputedly bad. A man of Patrick Stewart's calibre really should not have gone anywhere near this train wreck. Everybody else in the movie is pretty much ""I don't care who they are"".This is bad on every level. The iconic Charlie's Angels theme song has been given the ""remix"", and it's woeful to say the least.I have no problem with strong female leads, more power I say, but this is just not the way to do it. The Wonder Woman movie proves you can make a female led super hero movie if the script s well written and the direction top knotch. This is just a total disaster and should never have been done. I don't really know what more to say. There is nothing I can defend about it. My advice, don't waste your time. There's better films on Netflix.",Charlie's Angels

1014,Silverbandman_05,Decent tribute to it's predecessors,6,25 November 2019,"This edition of Charlie's Angels featured Naomi Scott hot of her success in Disney's live adaptation of Aladdin, Kristen Stewart in a better light, and a relative newcomer to me, Ella Balinski.Based on my past history with Charlie's Angels abd Elizabeth Bank's success with the Pitch Perfect Franchise, it deserved at least one watch in Theaters.Kristen Stewart did her part well and was more enjoyable than some of her previous work and appeared a bit more lively in an action role, Naomi Scott played her part well as a concerned scientist and the misuse of her created tech. Ella, was a bit of a wild card in my book as i havent seen her previous credited work, but played her role well for my taste.The story line left a bit to be desired and although tribute is paid in small amounts to the history of Charlie's Angels, it is only in bits and pieces and can be lost on thise unaware of those Easter Eggs.The story does flow fairly smooth, and brings back a beloved Patrick Stewart years after he has helped the Angels become an international secret organization.The filmography is good and entertaining with a fair amount of comedy that shines on what made Bank's success with Pitch Perfect enjoybale. With some modern day implications, this movie was made for a new generation, but fails to deliver based on what I feel is sub-par casting.If you're a fan of the Charlie's Angels from the past, it may be worth a Redbox or streaming service watch, but I wouldn't waste money on the Theater Experience.Thankfully, my A-list pass from AMC prevented over expenditures from occurring.",Charlie's Angels
1015,nat_dourado,I loved it,10,27 October 2020,"It's difficult for me to understand the HATE for this movie when you factor out the - honestly cliche - misogyny + self importance combo. And I refuse to believe ALL of its haters are self important misogynists.
It's a fun movie. An action comedy production that does not take itself as seriously as the Bond franchise, for example. It's honest and very similar to it's predecessors, with the benefit of better technology and cinematography of its time.
Its silly, because it was always supposed to be silly. There's no man hating, AT ALL, no matter what the other reviews say. It is, yes, heavy on its feminism, but I trust by now we learned that feminism does not equal man hating? Good.
Kristen Stewart is a gem in this. And I didn't even like her before. Sam Claflin is also, muah. Chefs kiss.
Elizabeth Bank's wig could be better.
Don't take it so seriously. Have a drink, relax, stop wanting every movie to be a masterpiece even when it doesn't promise to be.

1019,christ_har,The movie is bad it has nothing to do with men not wanting to see a female lead,2,7 June 2020,"Elizabeth Banks your movie flopped not because men didn't want to watch 3 lead female leads, it's because the movie is bad plain and simple, writing ,acting , the horrendous editorial cuts. I don't understand how Elizabeth Banks blamed men for the movie not doing well, you were in THE HUNGER GAMES each of those movies made over 700 MILLION in the Box office with a LEAD FEMALE character !! or did you forget ?? I tried to go with an open mind watching this movie but the narrative of shoving down our throats that men are bad and woman are strong and woman can do anything every 5 minutes is really off putting, make it natural don't tell us, show us without the constant bragging.",Charlie's Angels
1020,Torpsgirl,Not worth any amount of money or time,1,27 November 2019,This was slow and boring with so many feminists agenda attitudes. It felt like a political statement that was lost in translation. This did not have the fun humorous writing of the TV show or the 2000s movies. This tried to fill the gaps in plot with flashy action. At the end of the movie you can not get the time back that you have wasted on this.,Charlie's Angels
1021,mday924,Great popcorn action flick,10,17 November 2019,What a fantastically fun film!! Way better than expected. Definitely has a few shoehorned woke-worthy lines but anyone with a brain will feel the empowerment of the Charlie's Angels sisterhood. Great action and good comedy! Would love to see it again.,Charlie's Angels

1023,alvin_the_elf,Breath of Fresh Air in an Industry Dominated by the Male Gaze,9,17 November 2019,"You know how Hollywood's usual idea of writing a strong woman character is to just write a man and give it a woman's body? That's exactly how Charlie's Angels is NOT written. It outright refuses to see femininity as something weak and vulnerable, that only has value in the male gaze. As a result, we have lead characters who are strong, funny, charismatic, resourceful, and at the same time unapologetically women.And what was even more interesting was that in spite of those excellent lead characters, the movie is not about just them. The focus is purely on solidarity among women. In fact, the movie will remind you again and again that the real star is what we refer to as 'girl power'. And honestly, that's a much needed breath of fresh air.The cast was phenomenal, the dialogs were very well written, and Elizabeth Banks was an incredible director once again. So it's really cute seeing this movie get review-bombed just because people are not ready to watch a movie, which is about women and made by women, because it doesn't feature women who are just eye-candies. It really proves the point of the movie in real life.",Charlie's Angels

It's not trying to convey a message or any of that BS. Just pop some popcorn maybe mix up a adult beverage and enjoy. Don't over think it.The sound track is actually very good too. We are over 50 years old and loved it.

This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen recently. The cast was entertaining, the plot was coherent, the soundtrack was fun, there was a good mix of comedy and action, and overall it was an enjoyable film. Will it win best picture? No, but that's not what it set out to achieve. Charlie's Angeles is a fun, entertaining action film. Additionally, It is about time we are starting to see action movies with female leads. It's refreshing to see a movie directed by a woman, as it is SO rare in Hollywood particularly in this genre. Elizabeth Banks deserves way more credit than she's being given. This movies doesn't deserve to have its rating lowered by internet trolls who didn't bother to see the whole movie if any of it.

I dont get peoples low scores. I dnt know any of the background with bank's comments and what not but as a film it was enjoyable. I read a comment that said the way the movie treats men as objects makes it ridiculous. But i found it really good, it was being ironic about how woman are always treated and its funny to see that role reversal.
All in all a very decent action film that isn't marvel And i find that refreshing. I love the Drew barrymore charlies angels movies and i think this meets that standard.
I'm not a 'elite' movie buff so my opinion isn't as snobby i guess as the others. I like a good cringy romance or a cliche click bait. Other than a horror or something its hard to find a movie i wouldn't enjoy. So if your someone that enjoys all kinds of movies i cant see why you wouldn't like this one.",Charlie's Angels

If you're someone who gets angry by female led movies (like some of the 1 star reviewers here) then this movie is clearly not for you.

1051,jamespeng-1991,Unfairly reviewed. Decently entertaining movie.,6,20 September 2020,"Noticing that certain female centric movies get unfairly reviewed low, this is one of those movies. Is this the movie of the year? No, far from it. But, it does a great job of entertaining the audience. The dialogue was fun and genuinely made me chuckle a couple of times. The story flows well and had no slow moments. Naomi Scott's character, the new recruit, is endearing and does a great job of allowing the audience to be introduced to the world of ""Angels"" through her eyes.On a more critical note, this movie lacked truly spectacular action sequences or jaw dropping location scenes that are typical with the Hollywood action genre. It's obvious that a lot of scenes cut around the action to make up for the lack of proper stunt work. Perhaps This movie simply did not have the budget for this, and perhaps Hollywood does not feel fully confident backing this type of movie. Instead they banked on the ""gimmick"" of a female lead film. A shame for this genre of movie as it had the potential to be better.All in all I enjoyed this movie, it was a great way to spend the evening on the couch. It's quality is higher than the rating it got and I think that's very unfair. I hope we see more from this franchise, hopefully with a higher budget the next time around.",Charlie's Angels

So many MANY negative reviews. That combination convinced me that it'll be bad. But after watching it just now, I've been reminded to never trust random people I don't know with entertainment advise. Some people simply have bad taste. I thought it was fun and entertaining. Cheesy? Yes! But so was the Cameron Diaz /Drew Barrymore version.

For the record, I'm a happy feminist who loves all the wonderful men in my life and has a great sense of humor.Reviewers who say this movie is not funny are clearly not aware that the primary humor in this movie is geared for women who have dealt with crazy, stupid sexism their entire lives. It is a different, darker, more real humor than in any previous Charlie's Angels movie.This movie was fun and funny but without the painful cringe factor of past CA's. The women are kickass, silly, and brilliant.I muse it likely that the reason other reviewers found it to be boring or misandrist or ""lecturing in feminism"" is that they are used to movies geared for their perspective alone. There are plenty of male characters who are admirable, capable, and beloved. Women will love the humor. And not being sexist isn't a lecture. ;)",Charlie's Angels

Either way I watched this and was pleasantly surprised!Kristen seems like she's having a BLAST in a role for the first time in forever.

Elizabeth Banks should stick to acting because her screenplay and directing were terrible. The original movies had a good writing that made the cheesy lines work. The actors worked well with each other. This movie had none of that and the action was so predictable it was painful to watch.

It seems like they all had a lot of fun shooting this movie and it really comes through the screen. While the plot may not be original and the action scenes may not be the best, it really did feel like this film was made as a love letter to the previous films/television show. If you go in without viewing it as a Charlie's Angel reboot/spinoff/whatever, even though that is clearly what it is, you may enjoy it more. I personally loved it and always will enjoy women teaming up in film. It inspires young viewers to want to grow up kicking a** no matter what they do in life. I grew up watching the older Charlie's Angels movies with Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu. While the plots for those films are not so great either, they are more feel good movies to me. I suggest going into this movie with your mind open; don't keep the bad reviews in your head while watching. View it as an all new movie, something you've heard nothing about. Maybe you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",Charlie's Angels

The rest of the acting is ordinary at best, The directing is decent, but the story is a dumpster fire. I know we don't expect Shakespeare in a movie like this. But really didn't think an action movie could be worse than Mortal Combat. And really, we get it, men are responsible for all the wrong in the world.

It's funny, it's engaging, all the three leads have great chemistry and charisma, Kristen Stewart is a scene stealer and a great comedic relief (yes, she is the comedic relief and she does a great job at it). It's the kind of film you could easily watch more than once.

Of course it's not a movie for toxic males to enjoy (I understand why they hate this movie so much), but if you won't be offended watching females being really tough and smart at the same time, this movie is actually fun to watch.

I liked the basis of the movie, I got more female empowerment from the action and dialogue in this film, compared to the humor and padded action from the original two films. The movie branches out far from the original basis of Charlie. That is what really upset me the most. It's Charlie's angels, not Bosly's angels. To see only Charlie in his box 2 times in the film was a big disappointment. The movie made up for in humor and the new female characters.",Charlie's Angels

Kristen Stewart was amazing and hilarious it was so great seeing her in such a different role that she usually does, reminded me of her role in American Ultra but more fun. Enjoyed seeing all the references to past Charlie's Angels movies and all the Angels our there. My 10 year old daughter loved it as well.

1103,MiyokoDesdemona,Kristen Stewart gained a fan.,10,21 November 2019,"I forced two of my friends to go see this with me for my birthday. One also wanted to see it, the other one was dreading it because she hates Kristen Stewart.I'm a big Drew Barrymore fan and knew it wouldn't be like those two films and had read several reviews on how terrible this movie was, how bad the acting was, way too political, and too much use of guns instead of hand to hand combat so I wasn't expecting much but it's still Charlie's Angels and I wanted the nostalgia.Y'all with the negative reviews, did you even watch the movie or did you just review it without seeing it because you didn't like who was in it?Within the first ten minutes my friend was actually enjoying herself and by the end of it she said she's actually now a fan of Kristen Stewarts.For the people who say it's too political, how? Because women kick? It's Charlie's Angels...How is it anymore political then the other two films? Also they did feature a lot of guns, which is typically frowned upon by the left wing, and it wasn't all guns, there was plenty of hand to hand combat.People need to get over themselves and realize this is a fun, feel good movie, just like the others and just like the show. Ella Balinska is fantastic, can't wait to see what she does next. Naomi Scott brought a lot of fun with her character, Kristen really shined throughout, Elizabeth Banks did an amazing job with this and c'mon, Patrick Stewart! How could you not want to see this? All the guys were super hot as well and definitely didn't disappoint. Cameos.... A+",Charlie's Angels
1104,djbianca,K-Stew is an enigmatic female spy,8,15 November 2019,"The movie is an updated version for the Millennials and Gen-Z's of the previous Charlies Angels of 2000's. Much like the previous three characters in the older version, the 'Angels' here are beautiful spies (mainly Ella Balinska, and Kirsten / and one with a newbie scientist who ends up becoming an Angels trainee in the end). The thing about the movie is that there is the same female empowerment and kick ass moves but it never showed too much sexiness for the boys to ogle their eyes - a much different breather from the previous movie.K-Stew is just so perfect for this movie - loose, confident which made her hotter than before. Her portrayal as Sabina in Charlies Angels is almost her own personality now as gay-girl and it she was magnetic onscreen. I never knew I could giggle a lot when her character most of the time flirt and almost kiss with Naomi Scott and it was too hot!",Charlie's Angels

1109,annac-70112,If you liked the show as a kid you'll probably like this movie,10,14 February 2021,"I grew up watching Charlie's Angels, and enjoyed it but never understood why Bosley was a man.... So Elizabeth Banks flipped the script and created an updated version of the story. Plenty of bad guys and complicated enough to keep you guessing. The angels are of course clever, strong, and empowered, yet also flippant, humble, and there is even character growth between all three. Along with many cameos from the original actors. Kristen Stewart has definitely found her groove in comedy, her character Sabina is the alter ego to serious badass Jane (Ella Balinska). Their dynamics are fun to watch. Naomi Scott is the newbie nerd who is a proverbial fish out of water and gets to see behind the glossy exterior of the angels' facade. Elizabeth Bank's character Boz gets promoted to replace the outgoing Bosley played by Patrick Stewart. Both do a great job.
The fight and chase scenes are good without being too long (ahem Mission Impossible) and move the plot forward.
All in all a fun, interesting movie with a very good soundtrack. For once I wasn't on my phone while watching a movie at home. Which says alot ;)",Charlie's Angels

Going into it I had quite low expectations because I was never a fan of the old movies and from the trailer it just looked like a classic shallow action movie but from the very beginning I was so impressed and absolutely loved it the whole way through! Script I think is great, you can tell its truly written from a women's perspective instead of those movies where men are putting the words into the womens mouths which creates irksome storylines and dialogue which to a real women just make no sense ie thinking 'No why would she do that?! She only just met him!'.

1119,Hadele,This movie is great! Scroll down and you'll see the good comments,9,21 November 2019,"Charlie's Angels was a lot of fun! Looking at the reviews, it seems like this movie is getting hate for the wrong reasons (i.e., for not being what the people wanted it to be, such as the 2000s version with Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore). I honestly thought it was an enjoyable watch, with Kristen Stewart at her best here (she was hilarious!). The story focused on empowered women, as Charlie's Angels was always about, except without the male gaze this time, which was welcomed. It's just cool to see funny, badass women on screen who love their jobs, and I wish there was more of that. My suggestion would be to go see it and make your own mind about it.Of course, women empowerment also comes with the acknowledgement of the current world we live in, so there's a nod to various feminist issues that have been hot topics for centuries now (such as women in the workplace). I think it was a necessary move in order to see how being an Angel is empowering. Elizabeth Banks did a great job in making this movie fresh and up to date for the current audience, and it's a shame that so much hate is attached to it.",Charlie's Angels

So I'm not sure where all this hate is coming from. I thought casting was fresh and excuse me but Jane (Ella Balinska) ROCKED HER FIRST MOVIE!

1123,taym128,Feminist overkill but a fun enough watch,8,22 February 2020,"Was a bit heavy handed with the girl power, but I did enjoy watching it. The writing wasn't incredible but I thought the fighting scenes were well shot and there were some good jokes here and there. It was also pretty inclusive racially, nationalistically, and in age variation.I think these 1&2 star reviews are being a bit dramatic - it wasn't *that* bad. I am a woman and the idea of kickass women being proud of how good they are at their job and looking great doing it was cool to watch. I thought this was a step in a positive direction, even if it wasn't the most ideally executed. I mean, it's just an action movie - it's not supposed to bend your mind and change the way you think. It's supposed to be unrealistic fighting against bad guys and then the heroes win in the end.It was definitely too feminist heavy, but I guess I just don't think that's the worst thing. The excellent quality of the filming, the sets, the wardrobe, and a huge shout-out to the hair and especially makeup artists because those close ups were fierce as all hell. I'd honestly watch again just to admire the flawless eye makeup...and I just thought it was an easy movie to watch.I don't think Elizabeth Banks was trying to indoctrinate any of you into some kind of feminist army where we overthrow the men and unnecessarily place women in roles they weren't designed to be in. There were jabs at men that I thought were cheap shots, I'll give you that. But seriously, I can't understand why so many of you are offended enough by this movie to rate it as poorly as you did. It's middle of the road, and the extra star was for the truly impressive visual quality.",Charlie's Angels

1140,bobbiesszabo,Men Hate It Because It's Not For Them,8,16 November 2019,"This movie was written, directed, and produced by women. Unlike most movies of a similar genre, the female characters were not hypersexualized, and they had autonomy over their own bodies and decisions. Furthermore, the characters are dimensional, and they each grow and change throughout the film.The diversity of the cast was refreshing, and it is nice to see many different women being represented on screen. Unlike most reviewers, the diversity is not being pushed in your face--in fact, none of it is discussed in the film at all. The women are just who they are, as it should be.The majority of bad reviews--both by individuals and by critics--are from men who do not know how to watch movies or how to live in a society that does not cater to them.For those claiming it has ruined a franchise or that it was not necessary, I ask this: does it bother you that there are dozens of Spiderman movies? No? But a second Charlie's Angels movie is too much?There are some confusing fight scenes and twists that move a little too fast, but overall the film is fun, retains the entertaining absurdity the franchise is known for, and it has an amazing and empowering message.",Charlie's Angels

1148,miketsymbal,Different but good different,10,15 November 2019,An enjoyable watch. It's a different take and expands the universe but it's good. Go see it and judge for yourself. Don't listen to the negative comments. It's entertaining.,Charlie's Angels

1150,josephcrussell,Clever and witty,8,16 November 2019,"Enjoyed this film. The action and fights were good, and the banter especially from Stewart's character was fun.
The story was a little predictable but still entertaining.",Charlie's Angels
1151,lilyflower-58195,FEMALE EMPOWERMENT,9,25 June 2020,"It was a great movie for my 3 friends and i to go and watch on a friday night! Not sure what all the bad reviews are for...? It definitely wasn't boring, and in fact there was never a dull moment!",Charlie's Angels
1152,zasjatkin,"Having honestly watched half of the film, I already realized that films of the 2000s are definitely better, and with almost everything!",10,17 November 2019,"The negative sides of the film:
Everything is too long, 2 hours is too much for this film, they could fit everything in 1 hour 30 minutes (like the 2000 film) and that would be enough.
Many unnecessary moments, or rather the moments that should have been shown in more detail, were made too short, and those moments that could have been shown rather quickly were shown on the contrary for too long.
In the film, in fact, there are 2 Angels, not 3, because (personally, it seems to me) Elena cannot be an Angel, but as if simply helps the other two, which, as it seems to me, spoils the concept of the original.
But in the film, there are also positive aspects:
Action scenes, I really liked them, they even (to some extent, but not completely) look better here than in the films of the 2000s, although again only 2 Angels fight in the film for the most part (or rather mostly) - it's Sabina and Jane, of course Elena wasn't deprived either and hey was given a fight once in the quarry, although for me this is not enough, but nonetheless the chases and fights looked amazing.
A simple plot, no matter how strange it sounds, but for this film it's good, because here you do not need to go deeper, but just sit and enjoy the film.
Humor and character Kristen Stewart - Sabina. Of course, humor is not understandable in some places, but on the whole it's pretty good with big hints, in most cases even vulgar, and all from the character of Sabina, who at every opportunity gave out some kind of joke. I especially liked the moment on the ship with the girl and the joke about the corpse.
Compassion, there are essentially two such moments here, but if the second personally passed me by, then in the first I really felt a little sad. This is the moment when the black Bosley Edgar (the character of Djimon Hounsou) is killed, and Jane wants to save him, but realizes that it is too late and is going to save the drowning Elena.
Numerous cameos of various actresses at the end of the film, this really pleased, and especially Jaclyn Smith (Kelly Gerrett or Angel from the 70s series), because those who watched the film realized that it was she who was now Charlie's voice. Of course, it's a shame that none of the actresses of the 2000s film made a cameo, and in particular Drew Barrymore, because she is one of the producers of the new film (and so to speak, also Angel in the past), as I could see for a couple of seconds on screen and Jaclyn Smith.
Actually, the pluses end on this and as you can see they turned out more than minuses (personally in my opinion), I would also like to add that it's very disappointing that the very first Bosley (the character of Patrick Stewart, who was previously played by Bill Murray in 2000 and David Doyle in 70s) made a villain, because in fact he was Charlie's right hand for 43 years, and then he suddenly betrayed his organization with which his whole life was connected.
Elizabeth Banks tried to emphasize (well, or a big hint) in the film that all men are callous, evil, ungrateful, two-faced and, in short, they are the main antagonists of everything. In McG Dilogy, this wasn't shown there (and in both in the films) that antagonists can be men and women not only antagonists, but bad people in general, but Elizabeth Banks in the film are only men antagonists, I certainly don't know, but if Banks plans to shoot the sequel, then let him continue to show everyone the antagonists of women (well, or at least a woman), since not only men can do evil and be unpunished, but also women.
In general, I put the movie 7/10, but only because I want to see the sequel and I hope that Banks in the sequel will take into account all his mistakes and it is possible to make the second part two, or even three times better.",Charlie's Angels
1153,superlaeske,Elizabeth Banks is killing it!,10,14 February 2020,"Okay this movie doesn't really deserve ten stars, but I am furious. Why do people hate this movies so much? I thought it was action packed, funny and unpredictable. Maybe its just me. After all the original got crappy reviews as well and I liked that one too. It's not the greatest movie ever, but compared to most action flicks it stands out for me. It has fewer plotholes than most and the fight scenes are good (tiny girls don't take out men twice their size with a few punches as much as most other comparable movies). Whats not to like about hot kickass girls.",Charlie's Angels
1154,reprobatereviews,It's a Femme Power Fantasy,10,26 November 2019,"It was really nice to see a female driven movie where the characters defining traits weren't just being sexy, and where the characters had personality beside their hair color. The way the movie was shot didn't feel gratuitous or gross, and it was generally a great film. I think any time you make something that tries to be a little different, people immediately call it pandering or explainy without just enjoying the film. Not every thing that supports women is pandering. This film does a good job of being fun to watch without contradicting its message.",Charlie's Angels

1157,coryt-50279,DId yal even watch the movie?,6,12 February 2020,"I dont get the 1's and 2's. Theyre all literally in a line, so Im guessing theyre mostly trolls. None of the other reviews are actually helpful, so Id figure Id leave a review by someone who ACTUALLY watched the movie. As far as pure entertainment value is concerned, when compared to 8's on here and above, this movie is an easy and obvious 6 or 7. More like a 6.5 But not a 1 or 2, thats absurd. The acting wasnt what the other reviewers are making it out to be; everyone in the movie acted the way they usually do,with the exception of Kristen Stewart, whose acting in this movie was DRASTICALLY better than in Twilight. I dont think the other reviewers understand how acting works. Actors dont choose their script; they ACT OUT a script they are GIVEN. They have to nail a role that ANOTHER PERSON dreamt up. In that regard, Kristen Stewart nailed her character, and thats easily obvious by anyone with a brain. Out of the entire cast, her acting in this movie was easily and obviously the best. She provided an electricity and refreshing atmosphere to a character I havent seen in a long time. Honestly, I feel like the other reviewers watched 30 minutes of the movie, and simply judged Kristen Stewart for being Kristen Stewart in Twilight. Out of the 3 Charlies Angels movie since 2000, this is easily the best one. Easily. The plot ACTUALLY makes sense. No glaringly obvious plot holes. I simply took the movie for what it was; a hollywood action film with women. Oh wait, maybe thats why theres all the bad reviews...you know, cause...well, you know...men.",Charlie's Angels
1158,jope-36932,the 2000 one is more feminist than this one,1,2 March 2020,"Id say im unbiased. i went into this neutral and wasnt expecting it to be that bad. This movie is very shallow. while it tries to uplift women it keeps contradicting its feminist ideals with stereotypes, needless violence (seriously, its violent at times it doesnt make sense and they kill without remorse) and a sort of mean girls feeling. it upholds this sort of flawed ""strong woman"" ideal that only when a woman can fight , show no emotions and be badass theyre equal to men.with this said the main characters personalities are 1. a dumb blonde 2. a ""hacker"" and 3. a gun lover... they also dont do any uplifting since two of them kept belittling each other in the first half of the movie and fighting about who is the best (also fighting abt who should be the one to murder someone jfc) while in the 2000 one they loved eachother and always supported eachother. they also had actual fleshed out characters with things they loved, hated, and actual interests without being pushed into some lame stereotypes. Femininity is not bad. they were a team. this one is not a team but a fight who can be the most badass. Also, in the 2000 one Angels never used weapons, but it seems like in this one that was forgotten, a real shame since it was a nice touch.they tried too hard. uplifting women doesnt mean belittling men. equality isnt whatever this is. its like a hollywood version of twitter wokeness. they should take a gender studies class.PS: the villain was insulting like come on, didnt you have any original ideas left?",Charlie's Angels
1159,petermahood,hopeless,1,3 March 2020,"How are women actresses supposed to gain respect when they do crap like this. half the cast in this i HAD! respect for, now no longer. all women in films since p.c. came along are cringe even if they have good skills the current feminist crap makes it seem they have to be given roles because men owe them. i feel so sorry for the good actresses been over look for p.c.'s sake.",Charlie's Angels

I was so excited to see her work as not only a talented actress, but also as a writer, producer and director.
The best part of this movie was the complex plot, and more importantly, complex characters! They successfully brought back the intelligence and ingenuity of the original angels, which is what lacked from the 2000 and 2003 movies.",Charlie's Angels
1161,turqvoise,Transparent Critics,7,18 November 2019,"Much like the Ghostbusters reboot, the many reviews putting this movie at a low 1-3 are more than likely thinly-veiled misogyny. The difference here is that the Ghostbusters reboot was terrible. So while this movie is another obligatory reboot, It is still coherent, entertaining, and fun. I enjoyed most of the performances within & if you can look past spy-movie logic and pacing you will have a much better time with this remake than many.

This movie isn't like those movies but it's it's own while having a few throwbacks to the original angels and the movies, and I really enjoyed it. The action was pretty cool and the fight sequences were not bad. If you don't wanna see badass chicks fighting bad guys don't watch this. The whole point of Charlie's Angels is exactly that, so if you come into this movie expecting gender equality and all that, this is the wrong movie for you.
