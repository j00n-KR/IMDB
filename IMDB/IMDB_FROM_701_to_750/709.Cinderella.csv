0,TheLittleSongbird,Bibbidi-Bobbidi Beautiful!,9,31 March 2015,"The trailer was a mixed bag, one where the production values, music script and acting really impressed but it was also one that gave away too much and gave the impression that it was going to be too faithful to the 1950 animated film. This viewer found this film to be absolutely wonderful and easily the best of the live-action Disney classic make-overs.It also compares extremely favourably with the animated film, with every ounce of its charm, heart and magic, which was my first Disney film and one of my most watched as a child. Still very fond of it now but is not a personal favourite anymore. The two versions have things that are done better than in the other, with the animated film having a quite creepy introduction(other than at the start) for Lady Tremaine, Cinderella's reaction to being locked in the attic being much more believable, the stepsisters being more loathsome and the hilarious interaction between the duke and the king and this film having less filler(a common criticism of the animated film), more back story for the characters and the characters being more expanded, especially the Prince who has much more to do and more of a personality and the beginning with Ella's parents. Both have huge amounts of charm, heart and magic, the characterisation of Lady Tremaine is about equal and the transformation sequence, which has always been my favourite part of the story, are brilliantly done in both versions, that in the animated version is one of Disney's most iconic scenes and here it is just magical.Under review here is the 2015 live-action film. It's no surprise what's going to happen and how it's going to end if you're familiar with the original fairy tale and Stellan Skarsgard while funny and sinister felt a little underused. Other than that, it is a wonderful film with very little to complain about, it's also perhaps more accessible for most. The most obvious merit is the production values, the whole film looks absolutely exquisite, with beautiful photography, colourful scenery that are as delicious as a box of chocolates and while it's a bit early in the year to say it would be a hard act to follow for a film to have even better costume designs than the ones in Cinderella. Ella's blue ball gown is jaw dropping in how gorgeous it is. While I may slightly prefer the music in the animated film, which contains some of Disney's best, most memorable and best-known tunes, Patrick Doyle's music score matches the film's whimsical tone perfectly with a sparkling whimsy of its own without going overboard with the sugar and sweetness.Cinderella(2015) has a witty script, with Lady Tremaine having the best lines and the story is beautifully told, faithful in detail and spirit to the story and the animated film but with some refreshing new touches of its own like the pre-ball encounter, what's done with the glass slipper and some of the climax that prevent it from being too faithful or like a carbon copy. The back-stories added a great deal with none of it feeling like filler, letting us to get to know the characters and bringing a psychological element in places. The highlight for me was the transformation scene, which was visually enchanting and enthrallingly done. The ball scene was great as well, with the opulent gowns and rich colours. Kenneth Branagh gives some of his best directing in some time, directing with classy style while bringing deep understanding and depth to the story and the film is very well acted, with the standouts being Lily James, with the charm and poignant emotion she conveys the role of Ella suits her like a glove, and an exceptional Cate Blanchett. Richard Madden is a dashing Prince, a role that you get to know much more than in the story and the fairy tale where he gets little to do, Anastasia and Drizella while perhaps a little too attractive look like they're having a lot of fun, Helena Bonham Carter has a ball as the Fairy Godmother and Derek Jacobi is very touching as the King. Oh and the animals are adorable, especially liked the goose.All in all, a wonderful film that should please anybody who loves the fairy tale and the animated film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Cinderella
1,Leofwine_draca,Missed opportunity,4,28 December 2017,"CINDERELLA is another in a recent series of live-action versions of Disney's animated classics. The unknown Lily James plays the protagonist here, the put-upon stepsister at the mercy of her cruel stepmother who catches the eye of a handsome prince and utilises the magic of a fairy godmother in order to win his hand. The weird thing about this film is how unenjoyable it is. The main thrust of the story is skimmed over in haste while added-in sub-plots involving Stellan Skarsgaard's random bad guy character are given way too much screen time. James is a simpering and uninspiring protagonist - it takes more than adversity for a viewer to warm to a character, and the scriptwriter should know that - while Kenneth Branagh contributes zero style to his direction. Even worse is a one-dimensional stereotype turn from Cate Blanchett and the actresses playing her daughters. Richard Maddern's prince is all teeth and eyes and no personality, while the less said about Helena Bonham Carter's cameo the better. Add in some unimpressive CGI effects and surprisingly 20th century-looking costumes and you have a generally poor attempt at a classic fairy tale.",Cinderella
2,SnoopyStyle,beautiful interpretation,7,5 January 2016,"Ella (Lily James) had loving parents who taught her to love and be kind. Her mother dies. Her father remarries Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett) who has daughters Drisella and Anastasia of her own. Her father dies leaving the estate in decline. Tremaine fires the household staff and makes Ella do all the work. They tease Ella for the ash dirtying her face by calling her Cinder-Ella. One day in the woods, Ella meets Prince Kit Charming (Richard Madden) who claims to only be an apprentice. He's completely taken with her goodness. The dying King wants Kit to marry for advantage. Kit organizes a grand ball for all the maidens in the kingdom. Tremaine forbids Ella to attend but Ella's Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) intervenes.Director Kenneth Branagh creates a beautiful compelling interpretation of the classic tale. Lily James is a great Cinderella embodying her innocence and her goodness. Blanchett is a brilliant actress. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty funny. I would have like Branagh rework some of the political intrigue behind the scene. Princess Chelina could have helped explain the politics. The Grand Duke shouldn't be allow to hide behind the good of the kingdom. He should be an evil usurper to the throne. The story needs a little additional work to add to the traditional fable.",Cinderella
3,Prismark10,A safe but colourful retelling,6,20 May 2018,"Kenneth Branagh is tasked to bring Disney's animated version of Cinderella to life. What Branagh brings is extravagant costumes and a colourful rendition of this fairy tale classic.Ella (Lily James) is a kind hearted girl but after her mother dies, her father remarries the vindictive, selfish Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett) who has daughters Drisella and Anastasia of her own. After Ella's father dies Lady Tremaine cruelly treats Ella as the maid and her two stepsisters tease her. One day Ella meets Prince Kit Charming (Richard Madden) in the woods where he claims to be a lowly apprentice. The prince is taken in with Ella's beauty, kindness and charm.When Kit organizes a grand ball for all the maidens in the kingdom one of whom he plans to marry. Ella attends with the help of her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter.) The prince who is enchanted strives to find the maiden who left one glass shoe behind.The film has an icy performance from Blanchett dressed up in haute couture costumes with just a hint as to the reasons why she is so vengeful against the world.Cinderella benefits from nice production values, a good blend of CGI and live action but it is still a well worn story. There is very little that can be done with the familiarity of the story though.",Cinderella
4,claudio_carvalho,Have Courage and Be Kind,7,16 August 2015,"Once upon a time, the girl Ella is the princess and pride and joy of her parents. When her mother (Hayley Atwell) gets sick and dies, Ella and her father (Ben Chaplin) grieve for many years. When Ella (Lily James) is a teenager, her father asks her if she would accept that he gets married again and she accepts. Soon her stepmother Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett) moves with her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) and the cat Lucifer to their house. When Ella's father dies during a trip, Tremaine dismisses the servants and Ella is treated as a servant by her stepmother and stepsisters, living in the attic. One day, Ella is riding a horse and stumbles with the Prince (Richard Madden) that is hunting a stag with other men. He immediately falls in love with Ella, and poses of an apprentice called Kit, but he does not know her name. The King decides that the Prince shall marry a princess, and the Prince decides to offer a ball for all the ladies in the kingdom expecting to see the mysterious girl again. Tremaine and her daughters get excited with the news and she forbids Ella to go to the ball. However, Ella's Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) helps Ella to go to the ball using magic, but she advises that she must return before midnight when the magic will end. Ella and the Prince stay together and near to midnight, Cinderella leaves the ball but loses one her crystal shoes. The Prince orders his guards to find the maiden which the foot fits in the shoe and after many attempts, they find Ella that lives ever after with the Prince.""Cinderella"" is a fantasy that tells the well-known fairytale with no modifications or surprise. The film has good cast and special effects and is a great family entertainment. Lily James is not beautiful but has a delightful smile. Cate Blanchett, Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera are very funny and the cameo of Helena Bonham Carter is probably the best moment of the movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Cinderela""",Cinderella
5,nogodnomasters,HAVE COURAGE AND BE KIND,10,17 April 2019,"The movie gives us some background information on Cinderella (Lily James). We get to meet her real parents before their expected deaths. We also see her privileged life and education prior to living with the cartoonish step-sisters and overly evil step mother (Cate Blanchett) who enters the film with her own ominous sound track.The character of Cinderella is developed beyond the typical one dimension. She is a woman of character who knows right from wrong. She has been elevated from a kept woman or ""Cinderella principle"" to the woman behind the man. Hey, it's a start and step forward. The prince has wicked blue eyes (Richard Madden) that even a guy would have to notice. The fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) was a Disney delightful character.",Cinderella
6,kosmasp,Magic of appearing and other things,6,14 December 2015,"I guess there is no way most of the people who are going to watch this, are not familiar with the general story of it. And it's well made and well acted too. It's a decent movie to say the least and if you get caught up in the magic, you might even feel inclined to give it an even higher rating.It was well made and ""mistakes"" like everything disappearing except the shoes will not bother anyone. It doesn't have to make sense. It just has to be driven by its romance and feel-good vibe it carries throughout (minus a couple of bumps along the road to the inevitable ending we all know and cherish I reckon) ... Fairy tales are a good thing",Cinderella
7,Sleepin_Dragon,The Sweetest Fairy tale of all,8,12 October 2015,"Made for a new generation. The original animation will always be a beautiful timeless perfect movie, but this new version has retold the story to a whole new audience. It's not the typical film I go in for, but I vowed to step outside the comfort zone.Young Ella tragically loses her mother very young, just before she dies she tells Ella she she must have courage and always be kind. Her father meets a new wife, but he then dies, leaving Ella at the mercy of her Stepmother and two half sisters Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's life of sadness is changed when she meets a handsome stranger.The production values are utterly incredible, it looks beautiful, the effects are great. Some truly wonderful costumes, Blanchette gets to wear some dazzling outfits very couture, as does Ella, naturally.Nice humour too, Blanchette and Brydon provide some fun. It's of course the delectable Helena Bonham Carter that adds a true touch of magic, she's super cool.Best bit has to be her entrance into the ball, it's why Disney is so cool, and why they'll always be so magical.Some super performances, Lily James is so sweet, so well cast, Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger are so much fun as the ugly sisters, all great young actresses. Blanchette puts in a gorgeous performance as the Stepmother, her face is so perfect, she's very sinister.You'd need a heart made of granite not to enjoy it. 8/10",Cinderella
8,lee_eisenberg,an eponym by any other name,5,28 March 2015,"OK, so we all know the story, so here's some things about Kenneth Branagh's ""Cinderella"": *I watched the 1950 movie in 2006 for a college course about deconstructing fairy tales. Not only was I wearing a T-shirt that I had bought in Estonia a few months prior - I had spent a weekend in Tallinn during a study abroad semester in St. Petersburg, Russia - but I viewed the movie like Mel Brooks or Carl Reiner probably would have. I also referenced the ""Gilligan's Island"" episode on which Mrs. Howell dreams that she's Cinderella. And I wondered something else: if there's a fairy godmother, is there a fairy godfather (and does he make offers that you can't refuse?). To crown everything, my IMDb review of it compared the cat to Stewie on ""Family Guy"", called the king a cross between Archie Bunker and every Jack Nicholson character, and even came up with a link to the ""Evil Dead"" movies (it's a long story).*Aside from the fact that this is an adaptation of Disney's 1950 animated feature, Cinderella is also a recent character; Anna Kendrick played her in the big-screen adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"", with Christine Baranski (Leonard's mom on ""The Big Bang Theory"") as the cruel stepmother. Other similar recent adaptations include 2004's ""Ella Enchanted"" (starring Anne Hathaway) and 2007's ""Enchanted"" (starring Amy Adams).*It's out of character for Branagh to direct this, since he's best known for adaptations of Shakespeare plays, while occasionally playing different roles (a conceited professor in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", government bureaucrats in ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" and ""Pirate Radio"", and Laurence Olivier in ""My Week with Marilyn""). I honestly don't know why he of all people would direct a live-action version of an animated Disney feature.*In the movie, the most interesting role is that of Lady Tremaine. Unlike the embodiment of evil that the 1950 movie depicted, Cate Blanchett turns the cruel stepmother into sort of an early version of Meryl Streep's character in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". In fact, when an interviewer asked Cate Blanchett a stupid question about the cat, she gave him a, um, blunt answer.*Responding to the controversy about her waistline, Lily James gave the perfect answer: people need to stop judging women exclusively by their looks.Having read all this, you probably think that I have no life. That's sort of true. More than anything, it's hard for me to take these movies seriously. If you've read my reviews of musicals and Disney movies, you'll know that I usually heckle them like Mike, Servo and Crow do to the crummy movies that Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank send them on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". I didn't heckle this movie. For one thing, it was in a theater, so it would have been inappropriate. Also, Cate Blanchett isn't someone whom I would be inclined to heckle. Nonetheless, I probably seemed out of place: I was wearing a T-shirt showing a picture of blues legend John Lee Hooker.So, this movie might appeal to eight-year-old girls (one girl in the theater was even wearing a Cinderella dress), but probably few people beyond that range. ""Frozen"" made me think that Disney was trying to make its princesses more complex. I guess that I jumped to conclusions.",Cinderella
9,jboothmillard,Cinderella,7,24 April 2015,"The original 1950 Disney animated film based on the famous fairytale is fantastic, I saw the trailer for this new live action version directed by Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit), which gave away the whole story, but reading positive reviews I still went to see it. Basically ten year old Ella (Eloise Webb) lives with her wealthy parents in a beautiful estate in a peaceful kingdom, she believes in the existence and presence of magic, allowing her to befriend animals, particularly mice, everything is perfect until her Mother (Hayley Atwell) contracts a fatal illness, on her deathbed she makes Ella promise to ""have courage and show kindness"". Years later Ella's Father (Dorian Gray's Ben Chaplin) reveals his old acquaintance, Lord Tremaine, has died, and he has chosen to marry his widow Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett), she has two daughters of her own, Drisella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger), Ella (Downton Abbey's Lily James) welcomes her new Stepmother and stepsisters, but they are unpleasant to her and she has to protect her animal friends from Lucifer the cat. It gets worse for Ella when her father dies while abroad on business, this loss reveals Lady Tremaine's true cold, wicked nature, desperate for money she dismisses other servants and forces Ella to do all the work, gives her room to the stepsisters, forcing her to sleep in the attic, only getting their scraps to eat, and sleeping by the fireplace to keep warm, soot on her face earns her the nickname Cinderella. Crushed by their cruelty she goes for a ride in the woods, she encounters a hunting party lead by a young man claiming to be an apprentice named Kit (Richard Madden) who lives in the palace, he is in fact the Prince, son of the dying King (Sir Derek Jacobi), she does not say her name, he is charmed by Ella. The King doesn't have much longer and insists Kit should take a wife, a ball is announced with every eligible maiden in the land invited to attend, the Tremaine family are ecstatic, however Lady Tremaine will not buy Ella a new dress, Ella fashions herself a new dress from her mother's old dress, with the help of the mice, but Lady Tremaine claims her presence will disgrace them, she and her daughters rip the dress and go to the ball. Ella left behind runs into the garden in tears, contemplating giving up hope, but an old beggar woman comes along, with a wave of her magic wand reveals herself to be her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter), she uses her magic to turn a pumpkin into a golden carriage, four mice into horses, who lizards into footmen, and a goose into a footman, and finally transforming Ella's ruined dress into a gorgeous blue gown, complete with glass slippers, she warns her however that the spell will be broken by the strike of midnight. Ella arrives at the ball and draws attention from all, including the Tremaines who do not recognise her, she wins the coveted first dance with Kit, and is pleasantly surprised to learn his true identity, Lady Tremaine overhears the Grand Duke (Stellan Skarsgård) irritated, he has secretly promised Kit to a princess. After dancing, Ella and Kit tour the palace and grounds together, slowly falling in love Ella hears the clock preparing to strike midnight before she can tell him her name, forcing her flee, in the rush she drops one of her glass slippers in the process, she manages to get away before the stroke of midnight and the magic ends, but she still has the other glass slipper which she hides away as a memento. Soon after the ball the King dies, but before dying he did allow his son to find his love, with the other slipper in his possession, the Prince wants every maiden in the kingdom to try on the shoe, Ella hears this and goes to find hers in the attic, but Lady Tremaine is there waiting for her, she figured out she was the mystery girl, she demands Ella make her head of the royal family and give her daughters proper husbands when she becomes queen, Ella refuses, so Lady Tremaine smashes the slipper and locks Ella in the attic. Lady Tremaine takes the smashed slipper to the Grand Duke and explains the identity of the mystery girl, wanting the reward of a countess title and worthy husbands for her daughters, but the Prince following this is more determined to find his love, so the Grand Duke and Captain of the guards (The Grey's Nonso Anozie) continue the search with the remaining slipper, all maidens are rejected by its magic. Finally they arrive at the Tremaine house, Drisella and Anastasia fail to fit the slipper, and it is only when Cinderella is heard that the Prince, disguised as a guard, has the Captain and Grand Duke investigate, Lady Tremaine tries to stop found Ella trying on the shoe, but is overruled by the Captain. Ella successfully fits the slipper, and finally tells her name to Kit, they leave together, but not before telling her stepmother that she forgives her, Kit and Ella are married and crowned king and queen, they rule together with courage and kindness, and live happily ever after. Also starring Rob Brydon as Master Phineus and The Inbetweeners' Alex Macqueen as Royal Crier. James is sweet and beautiful, Blanchett is a good choice as the cruel stepmother, and supporting cast members Madden, Carter and Jacobi do their parts well also, the story is pretty much exactly the same, with little references to the original cartoon, but the origins of Ella's family is different, and other extended scenes make it interesting most of the time, and of course the special effects to bring the magic to life are fantastic, overall it is a fantasy film that the whole family will enjoy. It was nominated the Oscar and BAFTA for Best Costume Design. Very good!",Cinderella
10,edwagreen,***1/2,9,26 January 2016,"The story follows the standard line with the exception that the wicked stepmother's detesting Cinderella is exacerbated by a conversation she overhears her husband having with his daughter where he professes how much he misses his mother.I also liked where the plot seemed to be going. After the wicked stepmother finds out that it was Cinderella at the ball, she plots with a wicked minister to advance her daughters into honorable marriages and keep her step daughter locked up.Cate Blanchett is awesome as the wicked step mother. Her cruelty knows no boundaries and even at the end, she tries to pull the girl away from going to see the prince and put on the silver shoe.Helena Bonham Carter is totally unrecognizable as the fairy godmother.",Cinderella
11,studioAT,Much better than expected,7,18 June 2017,"I didn't expect to enjoy this film as much as I did, having not really liked the original cartoon version that much.But this was a pleasant surprise as Kenneth Branagh manages to not only retell a classic fairy-tale, but to tell a good story in general. It's a story about family and hope, and those are all very important themes to cover.I thought Lilly James was good as Ella (Cinderella) and that Helena Bonham Carter did her normal kooky woman act well as ever. Quite what Rob Brydon is doing here I don't know, but hey.I'm not overly convinced by Disney's latest trend of making live action versions of their cartoons, but this one was impressive.",Cinderella

13,Theo Robertson,Show Don't Tell,5,7 April 2015,We all know fairy stories . We were all brought up on them and their longevity has universal appeal . We soon grow out of them of course but very soon a new generation will come along to learn them . One problem might be that how you're going to re-tell an oft told story but Cinderella has that strength that it's about a cruelly oppressed underdog who get the happiness they richly deserve . There's more than enough feel good factor to get the lefty masses like myself on their feet clapping and cheering while there's also enough dark misery to get the modern phenomena of grief whores to cry themselves an ocean The fault in this adaptation - and it is a very serious fault - is that it is completely unaware of a basic fundamental rule of storytelling - show don't tell . We are told that Cinderella' s stepmother and step sisters are cruel but there is very little evidence of anything constantly cruel playing out on screen and you're left with the feeling if any cruelty has taken place it has ended up on the cutting room floor . There's a great opportunity to make a dark fairy tale here but there's little in the way of the macrabe and grotesque almost as if the film is going out of its way to be as inoffensive as possible which makes for a bland film . You want to be inoffensive ? I think you might just have picked the wrong story to do this with . The story telling is also heavily reliant for its exposition and goes back to the criticism of show don't tell There's also another element where the story is told and that is the intrusive use of music by composer Patrick Doyle . In almost every single shot there is incidental music blasting away in the foreground regardless of whether it's called for or not . If we get a scene might be called vaguely sad then overdone sad music will be played . If there's an uplifting scene appears cheery happy music plays . It's almost as if the music is trying to tell the story on its own which sums up the film where the only bit of the movie that isn't telling the story is the screenplay itself,Cinderella
14,CinemaSerf,A few too many pumpkins...,6,19 October 2020,"This is a film with two aspects. The better is the beautifully created fairy tale/love story that uses animation and visual effects sparingly and carefully to help recreate some of the magic of the story. The other part, however, is the writing and the casting - and those, sadly, aren't too much to write home about. Lily James and Richard Madden aren't quite as sickly as Gemma Craven and Richard Chamberlain (""Slipper and the Rose"" (1976)) but then neither do they have their chemistry nor charm. A fairly glittering supporting cast that includes Sir Derek Jacobi, Helena Bonham-Carter and an oddly off-form Cate Blanchett range from indifferent to downright hammy and some of the dialogue really does make you cringe! It's a watchable effort from Sir Kenneth Branagh, but the whole is nowhere near the sum of the parts.",Cinderella
15,writers_reign,If The Shoe Fits,6,15 August 2015,"The movie theatre where I saw this has a block of six rows in front of the screen then a gap about three/four rows of seats wide then a block of seats stretching to the back of the auditorium. Although it opened in March this was the school holidays so I opted to sit in the first row after the gap reasoning that any kids whether alone or accompanied by parents would be sitting in the main block and behind me. I was right but during the pivotal ballroom sequence I noticed that a young girl around five or six years old and wearing a 'Cinderella' dress, was standing two or three feet away from my seat, leaning on the back of the seat in front of her and was utterly captivated by the film. She remained thoroughly engrossed for the rest of the running time and actually clapped her hands in delight at the end and began to dance. I found this the perfect response to the negative criticism because this, surely, is the target audience, innocent young children who still believe in magic. Personally I found it a pleasant enough effort that on the whole I'm pleased I saw but wouldn't want to revisit.",Cinderella

It doesn't surpass the magic of the animated classic for telling the traditional story and it doesn't surpass Ever After for a live-action updating. But it is well-directed, visually attractive, and enchanting in its way. There's an old-fashioned sweetness about it that I appreciate. The romance is especially nice. Frankly I was happy that this isn't another movie that adapts old stories with modern sensibilities. I'm glad Cinderella wasn't a Buffy clone, kicking butt and making quips along the way. I'm also happy to see the Prince is not a wimpy hipster type nor was he changed into a villain, as I've come to expect from the revisionist fairy tales we get today. So kudos to the filmmakers and Disney for daring to put out something that is unusual (for the times we live in). They proved old-fashioned storytelling is still effective and even profitable.",Cinderella

All ""Ella"" wants to do is to be her own woman, keep her rodent buddies well-fed, and look after her ancestral home. But the dark witch Bellatrix Lestrange says ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo!"" and Ella is cursed for all Eternity. Ella, you see, has earned the hatred of the new owners of her childhood house by feeding most of their meager rations to vermin, and by breaking their antique china Willy Nilly. Adding insult to injury, she puts the whole household at risk by wantonly interfering with a Royal Hunt. Clearly, Ella is ripe for the plucking by the Dark Side. So, thanks to Voldemort's minion Bellatrix, the entire kingdom in which Ella resides is cursed to third-rate nation status by the Death Eaters' Glass Slipper Spell. Ella becomes a not-so-innocent pawn in this Slytherin Plot, suddenly able to understand the Parseltongue language of her reptilian footmen, but unable to ever shed the ""magic"" footwear which separates her from all she'd previously held near and dear.

18,neil-476,Classy family fun,8,2 April 2015,"Ella's idyllic childhood meets heartbreak when her mother dies, leaving her with the optimistic instruction to ""have courage and be kind."" When Ella reaches young adulthood, her father remarries a rather cold and imperious woman with two silly, selfish, shallow daughters: he then goes off on a business trip and dies, leaving Ella to the depredations of her stepmother and stepsisters who promptly demote her to the role of skivvy, christening her ""Cinder Ella"" due to the ashes which cover her when she sleeps next to the hearth for warmth. Then, while out riding, she meets a handsome stranger and they take the first tentative steps towards falling for each other. The young man is secretly a Prince, under pressure to get married, so he throws out a Kingdom-wide invitation to a ball in the hope of enticing the mysterious young woman to the Palace. And – d'you know, I think I'll stop my synopsis right there, because I very much suspect that you may already know this story.Kenneth Branagh directs an utterly traditional Cinderella for Disney, taking elements from both Perrault's re-telling of the Grimm original, and Disney's own 1950s animated version (Ella is friendly with the mice in the house: she calls them Jac' and Gus, for instance). The film looks superb – it is lush, lavish and wonderfully staged, and the engaging effects are unobtrusively integrated into the spectacular live action, sets and scenery.The early set up may prove a touch too leisurely for young ones waiting to get to the familiar story (and at least one element – the tree branch brought back from her father's last trip – is set up, then never returned to) but this is more than made up for by Helena Bonfire-Carter's dippy Fairy Godmother, the depth Cate Blanchett brings to the stepmother (who still remains vile), Lily James' gorgeous and charming Ella and, most of all, Derek Jacobi's King. There is a single short shot where the King watches his son dancing with Ella in which Jacobi conveys, without words, that he has changed his mind about his son having to marry a Princess for political reasons – wonderful, classy stuff, within a frothy family fantasy.I am, incidentally, bemused at the number of people who feel that this film merits fairly severe criticism because it tells the traditional story of Cinderella, and not some modern hard-nosed feminist variation wherein Cinderella rebels against her servitude. Sorry, but it wouldn't be Cinderella then, would it?",Cinderella
19,HotToastyRag,Fun Disney remake,7,28 January 2021,"Fans of Cousin Rose from Downton Abbey will want to rent two movies to see her adorable energy and dazzling smile: Cinderella and Mama Mia 2: Here We Go Again. She's just delightful, and she puts you in a good mood when you see her twirling around at a party. What better choice to play Cinderella?
In this lavish Kenneth Branagh remake, there's a twist to the story that many versions don't include. If anyone felt Cinderella and Prince Charming (played in this movie by Richard Madden) didn't have enough interaction to fall in love, they'll be happy this time around. They meet in the forest at the beginning of the movie, with each identity a secret from the other. A bit of banter, a few smiles, and they're drawn to each other before the ball. I always liked that part of Sleeping Beauty, so I was glad to see it in another fairy tale.Cate Blanchett plays the wicked stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter plays the fairy godmother - but wouldn't it have been even more entertaining to see the roles reversed? Blanchett seems far more ethereal, and Carter has typecast herself with modern audiences with a wicked tinge. You'll also see Sophia McShera and Holliday Grainger as Anastasia and Drusilla (since this is Disney, the names could be kept!), and Stellan Skarsgard as the king. And, a bonus to these real-people Disney remakes is the repetition of the original music!

Casting is mostly good with a predominantly British cast. Lily James with her tiny waist delivers an expressive and likable performance. While not the most classically beautiful actress she is fresh and charming. What's with her dark eyebrows though? Stepsisters were well played by the slightly plump Holiday Grainger and Sophie McShera of Downton Abbey. Helena Bonham Carter is quirky as Fairy Godmother. Cate Blanchett was superb - giving a suitably theatrical and quite spellbinding rendition of the wicked stepmother that added top class acting to this movie. Unfortunately as the prince, Richard Madden wasn't quite dashing enough. He is a bit too short and looks ordinary and dour. The story is faithful where it counts and has a small twist regarding the stepmother which doesn't spoil things. Some of the dialog was a bit pedestrian and not that well written but it doesn't matter. There is a bit a of a Kate & William hint with the Buckingham Palace like fountain outside the balcony after the wedding.Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella is a faithful, thorough very well done live action movie that is more delightful than any cartoon could be.",Cinderella

Have courage and be kind.',8,10 January 2016,"'I have to tell you a secret that will see you through all the trials that life can offer. Have courage and be kind.'For those with doubts as to whether or not to watch Cinderella, toss the jaundiced eye aside and prepare for an evening of creative melding of a very old fairy tale as enhance by the lasted in cinematic art. Recast into a screen play by Chris Weitz who has the sensitivity to fill in the missing pieces form the original story (how Ella, a young girl from a happy family loses her beloved mother, then lives with her father who finally decides to marry again – to a beautiful but self-centered mother who has just lost her husband and must struggle to survive with her two obnoxious daughters, taking in Ella and treating her as a maid) makes the story come alive. Match that with the creative direction by Kenneth Branagh and the skills of incorporated animation by Disney, anchored by a stellar cast and the whole thing works beautifully.Cinderella is brought to life by Lily James, her father by Ben Chaplin, her mother by Hayley Atwell, the handsome and kind Prince by Richard Madden, the king by Derek Jacobi and his court by Stellan Skarsgård and Nonso Anozie, the stepmother by Cate Blanchett (strangely overlooked by awards nominations) and her daughters by Sophie McShera and Holly Grainger, and the wondrous fairy godmother by the inimitable Helena Bonham Carter – a dream cast who are obviously have a terrific time recreating one of our favorite fairy tales.The transformation of the pumpkin into a coach, the mice into horses, and the splendid dresses for both the fairy godmother and Cinderella allow the magic of animation to be subtly used in a manner that seems completely credible – if you can still believe in magic.In a time where the screens are crowded with apocalyptic, Marvel comic book reincarnations, and noisy corruption and crime films, Cinderella is a little island of happiness.",Cinderella
22,JamesHitchcock,Giving Family Entertainment Back to the Family,8,22 January 2016,"There has been a cinematic vogue in recent years for ""dark"" or ""adult"" versions of traditional fairy tales. These films are often influenced by horror movies or ""Lord of the Rings"" type epics. Examples include ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and the Amanda Seyfried ""Red Riding Hood"". ""Into the Woods"" can be seen as an adult reinterpretation of no fewer than four different fairy tales. Even Disney have got in on the act; their ""Maleficent"" is a dark reimagining of their own cartoon of ""The Sleeping Beauty"". (""Alice in Wonderland"" is not strictly speaking a fairy tale, but Tim Burton's film of it can also be seen as an adult remake of a traditional children's story). Kenneth Branagh's ""Cinderella"", however, bucks the trend. It is a traditional tale told in a traditional manner, essentially a live-action remake of Disney's animated version from 1950. It keeps a number of features of the original, including some of the songs and many plot elements. For example, Cinderella's stepmother is named ""Lady Tremaine"" and her two stepsisters Drisella and Anastasia. Lady Tremaine has a cat named Lucifer and Cinderella's best friends are a family of mice.I don't need to summarise the plot as it will be familiar to most people, although (in common with the earlier Disney version) there are a few differences from the traditional version; there is no character of Buttons and Cinderella's father dies early on, thus allowing the film to avoid the difficult question of why Baron Hardup (as he is called in the pantomime but not here) should so supinely allow his new wife to mistreat his beloved daughter.I had only previously seen Lily James in one film, that cheesy and cliché-ridden sporting drama, ""Fast Girls"". Here, however, the lovely Lily is perfect for the title role, not only strikingly beautiful enough to win the heart of a prince but also able to convey Cinderella's personality- great stress is laid upon her kindness and generosity- without making her seem insipid or a goody-two-shoes. This is, in fact, a film where the female characters are generally stronger than the male ones; Prince Kit, for example, is more a generic Disney prince than an individual, although Derek Jacobi's elderly King may be an exception. The two other performances which stand out come from Cate Blanchett as a splendidly bitchy Lady Tremaine and Helena Bonham Carter in a cameo as an eccentric but sexy Fairy Godmother.The lavish sets and costumes lend an air of nostalgic magnificence to the production, suggesting the Victorian era without tying the film down too directly to any specific historical period. (Branagh's version of ""Hamlet"" also had a quasi-Victorian look). Costume designer Sandy Powell said that she was aiming for the look of ""a nineteenth-century period film made in the 1940s or 1950s"". This vaguely 19th century look may reflect the fact that this was the era when Europe's monarchies were mostly evolving towards a more democratic, constitutional model, making it easier for republican Americans to accept Jacobi's King as a benign old man rather than an absolute mediaeval ruler. (By contrast, the King in ""Maleficent"" is a brutal tyrant and the vaguely Tudor costumes reflect this; he is even given the name ""King Henry"" to suggest a link with Henry VIII).After a raft of fairy-tales amended or distorted to suit the preoccupations of 21st century adults, this ""Cinderella"" comes as a refreshing change, a children's story which will actually appeal to children. Branagh has succeeded in giving family entertainment back to the family. 8/10",Cinderella
23,StevePulaski,The fairest of them all,8,14 March 2015,"Kenneth Branagh's traditional retelling of ""Cinderella"" comes as a huge surprise for me in 2015, mainly because Disney has had a successful run at transforming fairy-tales and fantasy ideas into something bigger and more subversive, especially in the past few years. We've had films like Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" give us Wonderland like we've never seen it before, ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" transport us back to the place where we all spent sometime during our childhood and give us a beautiful new story in the land of the Yellow Brick Road, and even last year's ""Maleficent"" gave us a taste of a rarer, darker side of Disney. I use all these as footnotes because it's strange to see how straightforward Branagh and writer Chris Weitz (who may just be one of Hollywood's most diverse screenwriters with this, ""Antz,"" ""American Pie,"" ""The Golden Compass,"" and a future ""Star Wars"" stand-alone project under his belt) make this adaptation of one of the most known and beloved fairy-tales.Does the plot even need to be reiterated at this point? The story of Cinderella is firmly in place here, with the titular character being played by Lily James in a performance that assures we'll be seeing more of her in the future, and Cate Blanchett as her evil step mother. All of the ""Cinderella"" storytelling features are here, from her run-in with Prince Charming, to the immaculate glass slippers, and even the Ball, where Prince Charming (Richard Madden) will select a woman to be his princess.As you can see, ""Cinderella"" does more than tell the story in a completely straightforward manner, but it also plays it pretty safe, which is the film's immediate issue. We've seen Disney and other Hollywood productions take fairy-tales to new heights, and even if they're not amazingly strong retellings/reimaginings (""The Brothers Grimm""), they still get points for toying with age-old subject matter and bringing audiences something new and different. ""Cinderella"" plays its entire outing in a safe and eloquent manner, almost like Cinderella herself. While it's nice to see a committed retelling of a story that, granted, hasn't seen a mainstream, live-action adaptation, it's also disheartening to see an opportunity to breed new life into the story so heavily missed. Once we recognize that all the ""Cinderella"" conventions are in place, we are robbed of any kind of excitement or tension in the story because we are all reflecting on bedtimes-gone-past when we heard how all the events in this story played out.Nonetheless, there is fun to be had in ""Cinderella."" For one, James and Blanchett liven up the film in an incredible manner. James lives up to the physical and idealistic traits of Cinderella beautifully, preaching her own personal gospel of courage and kindness throughout the entire film, and even showing us that she is human in scenes when she weeps to herself about how she has failed her mother. Blanchett, on the other hand, is worth the ticket price alone. If Meryl Streep could get an Oscar nomination for her performance in ""Into the Woods,"" one could only call bias if Blanchett doesn't at least receive some early consideration. She is devilish and wickedly entertaining as the evil step-mother, doing more than chewing scenery and existing as an empty, storytelling convention, but truly giving power and energy into her performance thanks to strong dialog delivery and telling facial expressions; Blachett is a riot on screen for the entire time.In a time where TV news brings us more and more uncertainty in the world, and reports run amok about people treating others with needless disrespect, ignorance, and prideful arrogance, ""Cinderella"" reminds us of the most touching and attractive human qualities in a way that, while traditional, identifies their importance and gives us a film that beautifully encompasses them. The visual effects on display here, vividly shot and only more beautified by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, combined with the meticulous, candy-colored costumes make for an eye-popping film that works its magic so heavily with its sights that it reinforces its morals and ideas quite nicely. All of this prevents ""Cinderella"" from too obviously being what it ultimately is; a favorable but safe retelling of a classic story that disguises its familiarity by giving all of its aesthetic and actor fields life and gusto.NOTE: Preceding ""Cinderella"" in its theatrical release is ""Frozen Fever,"" a short film revolving around the characters from the hit Disney film ""Frozen."" The short involves Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) and her friends Hans, Sven the moose, and Olaf the snowman (Josh Gad) preparing a surprise party for her younger sister Anna (Kristen Bell). Elsa, however, has a cold, where every sneeze produces several tiny little snowmen, sort of resembling Olaf, but she persists on, taking her sister through all of the little decorative zones she has set up for her before taking her to the final party. The short reinforces my believe that the ""Frozen"" characters are best in small doses, and I only wish now that instead of the ""Frozen 2"" we all knew was coming, we'd see these characters populate several, extremely fun shorts like this.",Cinderella
24,lasttimeisaw,"A well-meaning fairytale told in the most conventional way, still it is a marvel to behold",7,23 March 2015,"Kenneth Branagh's revamped Disney fairytale Cinderella is the first movie I watch from 2015. A faithful adaptation of the household fable and an eye-catching costume/production pageant. While two leads Lily James (from DOWNTON ABBEY, where also outputs McShera, who plays Drisella, one of Cinderella's step-sister) and Richard Madden (from GAME OF THRONES, with his fellow alumnus Anozie, as his loyal Captain) are relatively unknown as for cinema-goers, Cate Blanchett singlehandedly upstages everyone as Cinderella's wicked stepmother without tampering the original gusto.In an era where most once-upon-a-time tales are being refashioned (both in small and big screens) to offer an alternative spin to rekindle the allure such as the recent success of Angelina Jolie's mega-star vehicle MALEFICENT (2014, 6/10), or the less-impressive hotchpotch musical INTO THE WOODS (2014), I am a tad surprised to find out Branagh leaves the story literally unaltered as the one we can all recall from our childhood memory, due to its tradition-abiding devotion, the film is less gripping in its narrative progress whenever Ms. Blanchett is off-screen and save the fantastical changeover and anthropomorphic magic cast by Cinderella's fairy godmother (a typecast Carter also moonlights as the movie's voice-over), than its unmitigated visual splendor, fortunately the casting branch has done a swell job to select the personifications of its stock characters, a mostly UK-recruited cast tallies with the requirement of royalty and majestic flair, James and Madden make a delectable pair of eye-candies, and revive the fantasy realm of there is a prince charming for every beautiful girl. The film is a fitting treat for children, the screening I attended was almost a full-house, at least half-filled with kids, who are all transfixed to the marvel on the screen and are taken by the story from A to Z. The evil elements never rise above the family-friendly threshold, alas, the subplot of Blanchett-Skarsgård's vicious scheme doesn't have time and space to pan out, which is an abuse of talent. Cinderella thoroughly conforms to the traditional virtues told by her mother - courage and kindness, which are repeatedly instilled to edify the audience as a motto almost reaches the hallmark didactics, nevertheless, one simply cannot bad-mouth this film harshly for all its well-meaning posture, moreover what it illuminates is the most rudimentary criterion to be a human being, which intend to be overlooked during one's maturation, thus the film is both a finely-constructed reminder to adults and a resplendent cinematic feat to younger audiences as well, therefore, it is no surprise it prevails triumphantly in the box offices both domestically and internationally.",Cinderella
25,KineticSeoul,Good effort,7,4 August 2015,"I personally think it's unfair to bash on this film for being a ""Cinderella"" adaptation. Although a LOT of people know about this classic fairytale, they did a really good job of making a live action version of it. Now I personally like the Disney cartoon version better, but maybe that is due to the talking mouse and because of what I grew up watching. I will admit the first hour is very straight forward like the fairytale book and the animated movies. But after the first hour or so, it does give a bit more insight on the mindset of certain characters. And delves more into the emotional and heart elements, like what makes the character tick and such. Which I thought was interesting, since this is one of my childhood fairy tales I grew up reading and listening to when I was a kid. This is a movie where they tried to make the Cinderella story come to life and I could tell they put quite a lot of effort to make it the best adaptation possible. So yeah, this might be boring for people that already know the complete story. But even if that is the case, it's still a movie that is worth a watch with the family.7.1/10",Cinderella
26,OllieSuave-007,An in-depth look of Disney's fairytale.,8,9 November 2017,"This is Disney's live-version of its animated featured film, and retells the classic story of the kind maiden in rags, Cinderella, who is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters, all while dreaming of a joyful life of her own.I liked how we get to see a more in depth look at each character, particular the close relationship between Cinderella and her parents, and the events that led to the cruelty and coldness of her stepmother, Lady Tremaine. The Prince also played a larger role, as we get to see his relationship with his ailing father and his first meeting (besides the ball) with Cinderella.All the characters were quite memorable, including Cinderella's animals friends, though they are given a much lesser role in the movie. I particular liked Helena Bodham Carter's portrayal of the Fairy Godmother - charming and whimsical.The beautiful cinematography and visual effects made the film enjoyable, though, I could have done without some of the characters in the film including the Prince's right-hand man, and wished the stepsisters were given more screen time. Some of the scenes were also a little rushed, including the scenes where Cinderella does her chores and the infamous dress-ripping scene.Overall, a nice Disney film.

27,Hellmant,I found myself to be very bored by it!,6,18 March 2015,"'CINDERELLA': Three Stars (Out of Five)Disney's live-action remake of their classic 1950 animated kids' movie; which is a feature film telling of the beloved fairy tale, of the same name, by Charles Perrault. This new version was directed by Kenneth Branagh and written by Chris Weitz (who's also co-written and directed movies like 'ABOUT A BOY'). It was made with a $95 million budget and also features actors like Lily James as Cinderella, Cate Blanchett as the Wicked Stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter as The Fairy Godmother. I think it's basically a well made film but it's also lacking any originality, whatsoever, and is kind of pointless. After Ella (James) loses her mother (Hayley Atwell), to a tragic illness, her father (Ben Chaplin) decides to remarry. He marries the widow of a friend; that recently passed away. Her name is Lady Tremaine (Blanchett), and she has two daughters of her own; named Drisella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger). Although her new stepmother, and stepsisters, seem very unpleasant, and unkind, Ella still tries to remain happy and peaceful. Then her father passes away, on a business trip, and leaves the family without a source of income. Lady Tremaine fires all of the help and makes Ella take over all of the house work; while waiting on Lady Tremaine, and her daughters, hand and foot. The family also nicknames Ella 'Cinderella'. Cinderella is miserable, until she's paid a visit by her fairy godmother (Carter, who's never looked better).I liked this story, a lot, when I was a kid; I also really enjoyed the Disney animated version of it. Watching it again, now, as an adult, in a live-action version, just seems like a waste of time. I found it entertaining, at first, but once the film got to about the midway point, I found myself to be very bored by it. I couldn't help but wonder what was the point of remaking it, in just a slightly different way, and watching it all again. I know the story by heart and this film has absolutely nothing new to offer it. It's well made, to a certain extent, but the jokes are pretty silly (even sillier than the cartoon version) and the acting is often overdone. For kids that haven't seen it before, it could be a fun time though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/IG_hW4WZgWE",Cinderella
28,Buddy-51,Hits most of the right notes,7,13 December 2015,"Die-hard traditionalism is both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of Kenneth Branagh's version of ""Cinderella,"" that seminal tale of a young orphaned girl who suffers great abuse at the hands of her evil stepmother and stepsisters, but who is transformed by a fairy godmother into the belle of the ball and thus winds up living happily ever after married to a handsome prince (should I have included a spoiler alert with that last part?). On the one hand, one appreciates the movie's sincerity and squareness, its resistance - in the face of what I imagine was a fair amount of pressure - to provide that cynical and snarky postmodern ""spin"" that almost inevitably attaches itself to any contemporary adaptation of a literary classic (see ""Noah"" and ""The Great Gatsby,"" for just two of the more recent examples). The risk, however, is that our very familiarity with the story will dilute our interest as we sit around waiting for the well-worn plot points to play themselves out. Yet, despite our over-familiarity with the material, it's amazing just how caught up we become in the story and outcome, as strong a testament to the durability of the story as anything I can think of.Certainly, this ""Cinderella"" is as good as any we're likely to get for the foreseeable future. The screenplay by Chris Weitz is loosely based on the Disney animated classic from 1950 - sans the musical numbers, that is. The transition from animation to live-action works well enough, though the CGI mice here are a mite lethargic and lacking in personality compared to their cell-drawn predecessors in the original film. Lily James (""Downton Abbey"" and the upcoming 'War and Peace"") lights up the screen as Cinderella, charming without being overly cutesy, and feisty without being anachronistically modern. Richard Madden is suitably scrubbed and bland as her Prince Charming, while Cate Blanchett, Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger score as her cruel and boorish stepmother and stepsisters, respectively. Derek Jacobi is the king and Helena Bonham Carter plays the fairy godmother who also narrates the tale.It's safe to say that this visually ravishing version of ""Cinderella"" will become a home video staple for generations to come. And, for the less romantically-inclined among us, the midnight-escape scene alone is worth the price of admission.",Cinderella
29,cherold,"Absolutely Lovely, with a Radiant Cinderella",8,5 November 2015,"In the 50s, Disney made an animated Cinderella who was painfully bland, a cardboard princess who meets a cardboard prince. But they have finally made up for it with this live action version, which features a charming and fiercely sweet young lady played to the perfection by the preternaturally glowing Lily James.The movie starts with Ella in happier days, and the early part of the movie involves seeing those happy days slip away. While I appreciate the use of giving some context, I found these early scenes a bit slow. The movie picked up with the entry of evil stepmother Cate Blanchett and her odious daughters, but in spite of some lovely scenes, like the first appearance of the prince, I didn't really get drawn into the movie until the entry - heralding a stream of resplendent special effects, of Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother.Once the fantasy really gets going, though, the film becomes utterly entrancing. The special effects are a small part of the movie but are beautifully done. The ball is beautiful, the young couple in love are both just so darn nice, the stepmother continually reaches for new levels of awfulness, and I became deeply invested in the story.James makes a perfect modern-day Disney Princess, with typical sweetness goosed with feistiness, and Carter makes a breezily quirky fairy godmother. There's a little palace intrigue to round things out, along with a lot of pretty scenery.You should watch this movie.",Cinderella
30,Robert_duder,I expected to be bored and was anything but,8,4 January 2016,"I love a beautiful Fairy Tale. I also love Disney films more often than not. So many movie goers and fans are always asking ""why can't Hollywood do anything new?"" I personally don't care...the question I ask is how do they keep making the same stories and make them good? Cinderella (this iteration) is very, very good. It is beautifully shot, excellently acted, true to it's source, magical and entertaining. Ultimately there is nothing new to this version. It doesn't try to stand out or change anything other than being live action and closer to the Disney animated version. How many Cinderella's have we seen? And yet this was so entertaining and fun and you knew what was coming but it was such a great style and amazing special effects and cinematography that you wanted to see how they were going to do it and show it. This in no small part to brilliant direction by a very seasoned and great director, but I'll get there. I actually liked that they stayed true to the story we all know inside out and backwards. It wouldn't always work but for this it worked perfectly because it was a true remake but to an animated film which they seem to be doing now in order to make money. It was just nice to have that classic feel and it's beautiful and fun and just really nice and sometimes that's a good thing. Lily James is lovely and completely perfect for the leading role as the famous princess. She just has the right look of purity and naivety to an extent and certainly is the perfect old world heroine. Cate Blanchett is so far down my list of favourite actresses, however, she absolutely nails this role. She is perfect as the evil stepmother perhaps not so ironically. She plays it up but subtle and not so much so that you forget who the star is. As far as I'm concerned this is one of her better roles. Her wicked step-sisters are okay but sort of dull and very one dimensional characters but played decently by Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger. Richard Madden is decent as the Prince but much like the animated version he isn't the focus of the story. He is almost secondary to the whole thing but they still manage to establish a good romance that is integral to Cinderella. Helena Bonham Carter is very good in a very small role as the Fairy Godmother. She is custom cut for a role like this and she isn't overused like she often is in her husband's films. She is almost not used enough because she is a lot of fun. I also particularly enjoyed the small roles by Stellan Skarsgård, Derek Jacobi and Ben Chaplin.I'm convinced that most directors would have ruined this. It would have been boring and blasé and yet they brought on a master of his craft with Kenneth Branagh who really has an eye for the fantastical. He just makes this fairy tale world seem so alive and he really uses his characters so well no matter how big or small they are. He takes a story told a million times, tells it again and we eat it up. His style is always one of subtle use of colour and tone and the scenery is as much of a character as the characters themselves and it works so well for bringing this story to life once again. It is a perfect family film and the perfect way to experience a classic fairy tale. 8/10",Cinderella
31,Lejink,The Godmother,6,7 February 2016,"I suppose the two main issues I had watching this live-action retelling of the famous story are the obvious ones about knowing how the story goes of course and the comparisons with Disney's earlier classic animated treatment of the story. I guess it's a sign of how far C-Gen SFX have come that film-makers can remake animated features in this way. I thought the story took a long time to really get going with almost no special effects to charm the eye as the familiar story almost as old as time played itself out, the fireworks really only kicking off with Helena Bonham-Carter's short but sweet entrance as the fairy godmother. After that though, the story really takes off in more ways than one and just about makes up for the rather bland lead-up to it.The story itself gets a little embellishment too, I hope not just to build up main star Cate Blanchett's part, but I'm sure any fans of both the story and previous cartoon feature couldn't have been disappointed with the final result on the screen.Lily James is appropriately pretty and demure as the title part demands and Cate Blanchett reins in the natural temptation to go over the top as the wicked stepmother. Richard Madden is affable too as young Prince Kit and Derek Jacobi adds appreciable gravitas as the ailing King, even if he looks old enough to be his son's grandfather if you get my drift.There are some nice humorous touches too and director Branagh, not long after his commendable work in ""Thor"" shows again that he's good with fantasy features.I don't know how many more of these real-life remakes of fairy tales we'll see in the future, but this one I certainly enjoyed although I still wouldn't trade it for the classic original version in Toonland.",Cinderella
32,ThomasDrufke,Kindness Is What Makes It Great,8,13 March 2015,"I think people have a right to be upset with the film for the unnecessary diet that Lily James reportedly went on to fit in the dress, but i'm going to choose to look at the film for what it is and stay away from the politics for the review. For the record, it's truly a shame that she had to do that. James is an absolutely gorgeous young woman who doesn't need to lose any weight for herself let alone a movie.But if we are going to look at the film, Cinderella is a sweet and innocently touching film. Sure, it's pretty much the original film just in live action form, but it's as about as good of a remake as you're going to get. Lily James gives an emotionally charged performance full of the sweetness and tragedy that we came to learn from the original. Richard Madden, of Game of Thrones fame, also gives a grounded performance as Prince Charming, though I'm not sure they ever actually call him that. The point is that they don't need to. They both have great chemistry even in the short amount of time they share the screen, you can tell the magic exists. That's the other thing I was really pleased with in this film. Kenneth Branagh knew the perfect amount of magical elements to bring to the film without taking the audience out of it. Let's face it, a pumpkin carriage and talking mice is unbelievable to begin with so you should at least know what you're getting into. Which by the way, i'm really glad they didn't push the whole 'mice' thing too far. They kept it to a minimum, and it worked to it's favor.There is a certain amount of satisfaction with seeing James stand up to the great Cate Blanchett a few times, who by the way steals basically every scene she's in. Blanchett gives the tiniest bit of sympathy to her character so that the audience doesn't feel that the rudeness is over-the-top and out of place, but yet can be purely terrifying in other moments. The music is also beautiful, and captured that delightfulness and glamor of the original. Cinderella is a rehashed story sure, but I don't see how anyone can dislike this film. It may not be better than the original, and I wouldn't argue if someone had a problem with the behind the scenes issues, but if you're taking the film at face value, it's great. Plus I loved seeing Agent Carter pop up in the beginning (Hayley Atwell).+Performances, especially James & Blanchett +Music +Sweet and charming story +The liberties they took added to it's greatness 8.4/10",Cinderella

This live-action version doesn't really add anything to the story. I thought the cast did a great job, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - I'm not a fan of the insane fairy godmother - and I think it was visually appealing, but overall if I want to watch the story of Cinderella, I'm going to choose the classic Disney animated version.",Cinderella
34,secondtake,"A classic if restrained version, well done and fancifully told",7,4 May 2015,"Cinderella (2015)With some gorgeous computer aided sets and characters, a lovely sprig of innocence as Cinderella, and an imposing (and too little used) Cate Blanchett as the stepmother, this is a ""Cinderella"" for everyone. It works for kids, and it has levels for adults, too.This is the real world, live-action version of the great story of Cinderella, directed by the rather serious Kenneth Branagh (of Shakespeare production fame, originally). So this is a humorless but delightful version, with appropriate drama and maybe a hint of qualities an adult might appreciate. More on that in a sec.The one drawback, of course, is you know what's going to happen. This is a very straight up telling (re-telling) of the great Italian fable, centuries old, about being mistreated and having life (somehow) come to the rescue. Brannagh makes this a very British affair, which is fine, though it seems almost to co-opt the idea as their own. There are shades of ""Alice"" here, including both a dignified and pretty blonde in the lead and Helena Bonham Carter along for the ride. But this falls short of that in terms of excess, but that becomes a strength after all.Key here, since the story is well known, is certainly the cast: Lily James as the lead, and Cate Blanchett as the stepmother, along with very small roles by Stellan Skarsgard and Carter. Certainly James is a star, and rather perfect as the vulnerable young woman suddenly thrust into this awful situation. She carries every scene, and she's in every scene, so all is well. Blanchett is a surprisingly dull presence, presumably because Branagh didn't want to ham it up too much.And there's the problem, in a way. The movie is so middle of the road on everything it's quite nice and enjoyable and restrained. The deep romance, the love of the father and daughter, the evilness of the stepmother, the preposterous inconsequence of the stepsisters, the great triumph by the end, all of this is barely felt. Oh, sure, when the music comes in and the slipper fits, you know you're sucked in, but this is a story with real depths. Even the Disney animated classic included a remarkably effective twist that is left out here-the idea that Cinderella goes to the ball and doesn't know she's dancing with the prince, only to discover it later.Too bad all around. I suppose there's no harm in a well enough made movie with a luminous star retelling an awesome story. But the potential! I hope someone someday really makes this a live-action fairy tale, or a deeply moving adult drama. Those were not the marks hit here.",Cinderella
35,Irishchatter,OK movie but I would rather the 1950 version,5,21 June 2015,"I have to say I very much enjoyed seeing this film, Lily James looked absolutely stunning and has the resemblance of Grace Kelly when she was wearing the blue dress. It's just the cartoon version was so much better. The reason is because of course it was part of my childhood but really there was more music and more brighter then this film. I just wish Disney would stop making these remakes of these fairytale films and start creating new fairytale films that were never heard of before. It just isn't the same really to have two versions and people forget the old one in which I wouldn't want!I'm not criticizing the actors but I still want Disney to leave fairytale films the way they were!",Cinderella

That is until her fairy godmother uses magic to help her attract the eye of the Duke's son.Well cast and wonderfully acted, with stunning visual effects and a clever script, director Kenneth Branagh delivers a faithful adaption of the animated Disney movie.Furthermore, once you're done with the carriage, you can enter it in this year's giant pumpkin boat regatta.

38,851222,"The Most Anti-""Game of Thrones"" Movie Off All Time",9,28 June 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.Please don't get me wrong - i love ""Game of Thrones"", but this movie has to be the most opposite version of ""Game of Thrones"" out there.""Cinderella"" (2015) is superbly made movie for a whole family (young females especially). It tells well known story, and it doesn't re-imagine it nor it's a reboot of remake of it - it is superbly made retelling of this fairy tale. This has to be one of the most ""cheezee"" and beautifully made movies of all time. Set design, costumes, music is all Oscar worthy. Cienamtography is gorgeous and acting is solid for this material - there are many well known faces doing their good jobs. Pacing of this movie excellent, at running time 1 h 39 min this movie barely drags and is entertaining from start till finish.Overall, on one hand ""Cinderella"" is probably the most cliché and cheeze movie ever made but one the other hand so was this fairy tale and this 2015 live version adaptation is just retelling this tale and at the same time it does so very well - it looks beautifully, it's involving and it's craftsmanship is superb.",Cinderella
39,tabuno,An Uneven But Lavish Spectacular Fairy Tale,7,15 January 2019,"17 March 2015. Oddly enough, this visually epic, lusciously presented live action version of Cinderella has its amazing moments but at the same time inconsistent tonal qualities. Without the traditional musical accompaniments, this famous fairy tale of the movie must depend on a superb script and directorial expertise to maintain a grand fairy tale extravaganza quality. Yet at the beginning of the movie there is more is presented more as a period piece than a fairy tale and the tempo slows way down with lumbering exposition and dramatic license that takes some of the magic away from the movie. The fusion of both substantive live action drama along with the lighter fantasy elements are uneasily blended together.It is the amazing magical moments between the lead characters, Cinderella and the Prince that the true inspirational fireworks explode into a compelling experience. The opportunity to flesh out the evil stepmother and stepsisters is sidestepped which would have been more consistent with a more dramatic and fully developed fairy tale. Johnny Depp in Finding Neverland (2004) offers up the nicely balanced serious but lighter tones that would have provided the solid foundation on which to present this more lively version of Cinderella or to have gone with a musical live version that would have allowed the music to enhance the fairy tale experience like Craig Ferguson's created in his written, directed, and starred in ""I'll Be There"" family drama that included both fine humor and music.In some ways the magic of the fairy tale nature wasn't there as the live action family drama at times became more pervasive even as the overly heavy use of the narrator attempted to keep that storyteller flavor intact. The movie might have also been better if it had been structured more like dramatic and seemingly magical ambiance of The Secret Garden (1993) a period movie about a young British girl who is forced to live his uncle or Hugo (2011) rich visually period piece of historical fiction about a boy who lives in a railway station. Of course a live action version of Frozen (2013) about two princesses one who has apparently magical powers approach would have been intriguing to attempt. Personally Drew Barrymore's Ever After (1998) retains the strongest presentation of the live action fairy tale.",Cinderella
40,Reno-Rangan,Probably the best live-shot Cinderella I've seen.,7,30 July 2015,"Disney has done it again. Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.The movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairy tales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.Lily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.7/10",Cinderella

The classic tale comes wonderfully to life with a very good cast, great director at the helm, and incredible visual effects. The dress transformation scene is spectacularly done! The costumes are stunning, and the entire production design is awesome. Lily James in particular is excellent as Cinderella. There are a few lessons to be learnt here, and it is done impeccably without being melodramatic or over the top.",Cinderella
42,tomgillespie2002,Aesthetically lovely but ultimately soulless,4,20 January 2016,"Kenneth Branagh's live-action re-telling of the famous Cinderella story does not attempt to offer any kind of fresh spin on one of Disney's most beloved movies. Where the likes of Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) and Maleficent (2014) played out well-worn fairy tales from a different perspective, changing the entire outlook of the tale in the process, the 2015 version of Cinderella alters very little and adds even less. The real stars of the movie are the set and costume design which, with the exception of Cinders' rather drab ballgown, are sadly the only hint of magic on show here.Ella (Downton Abbey's Lily James) lives happily in her peaceful kingdom with her loving mother (Hayley Atwell) and kind father (Ben Chaplin), who teach her of the existence of magic from a young age. After her mother takes ill, Ella is told to be courageous and kind with her final dying words. Years later, her father attempts to fill the void in his life by marrying the recently-widowed Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett), who brings her two deplorable daughters Drisella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) to his home to live. When Ella's father also dies on a business trip, the Lady Tremaine reveals her dark side, dubbing the young girl Cinderella and forcing her to live in the attic while tending to their every need.While the 1950 version can be forgiven for its rather old-fashioned patriarchal ideas of young girls fantasising about marrying rich and escaping the blandness of their existence, times have moved on and such an over-simplification of an entire gender in modern film- making really has no place. The moral message of showing kindness is of course eternally relevant, but James, aside from having a naturally sweet demeanour, injects very little personality into her character. The bulk of the first half is made up of trying to develop these themes, but without any songs to distract or cutesy animals to provide the chuckles, the narrative seems to move along with the urgency and excitement of an ITV Catherine Cookson adaptation.It only really kicks into gear when the Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) shows up to help Cinderella on her journey to the King's palace, where the Prince awaits every maiden in the land as he searches for a wife. Although the pumpkin transformation looks very nice, her other creations - including two unfunny lizards - are rather grotesque creations unworthy of a bippity-boppity-boo. Game of Thrones' Richard Madden plays the prince blandly but handsomely, while the long- awaited dance with his Princess-to-be lacks the magic of the cartoon version. Ironically, the Prince finds himself in the same situation as that of his most famous role, Robb Stark - promised to one but insistent on another - but there is sadly no bloody massacre at the end of it all to liven things up. Aesthetically lovely but ultimately soulless.",Cinderella
43,filipemanuelneto,Has the original version of the fairy tale gone out of style?,8,15 March 2017,"This movie has been very poorly understood by the public. Unlike previous films, which seek to rewrite traditional fairy tales or watch them from new perspectives (""Maleficent"", ""Ever After"", or even the animations ""Brave"" or ""Tangled""), this film is the live-action version of the fairy tale in its more traditional version. Therefore, we know the whole story and very little has been changed or added. Any problem? Not for me. I usually like original versions more than any contemporary re-interpretations, but it seems that fairy tales have gone out of style.One of the criticisms I saw was the Cinderella's passive attitude: the girl was educated under values of kindness and generosity (something our current society no longer knows) and isn't willing to abdicate these principles in adversity. Maybe she think that would betray her mother's memory. For our society, which treats the dead as unknown and the living even worse, such submission and servitude is unacceptable! The oppressed must revolt! Cinderella shouldn't serve the tea, she should take that teapot and stick it in her stepmother's throat! Or should she kick her feet and whine, saying ""I don't do it, I'm sick of it""? If you are reading this and you're also think that Cinderella should revolt, then you're one more who has totally forgotten what a fairy tale is. A fairy tale is not about reality or what we do. It's about moral values and what we should do. And the moral teaching conveyed by this tale is that biblical passage ""turn the other cheek"", that you must have heard in Sunday School if you have frequented it. Cinderella's tale is entirely about this! She had the courage to silently endure her suffering and to forgive those who hurt her and, in the end, her reward was to fall in love with a prince and change her life. Her stepmother's punishment didn't delay: she ended up punished, but not by the person she most offended. Moral of the story: love your enemy and forgive, you will have the reward, sooner or later.Well, the movie is great and is absolutely true to the original fairy tale, including with regard to costumes and sets, which are beautiful. Unfortunately, CGI is too obvious. I would have preferred realistic sets in proper locations rather than the green screen, which should be used with more caution. I have seen some criticism about the large neckline of Cinderella's dress but, in the historical period in which the tale was set (19th century), the ball dress were usually very low-cut. But don't complain! We see women with even fewer clothes on our streets today and we find it natural! Lily James and Cate Blanchett are the main actresses of the film and it is their work (as stepmother and stepdaughter) that supports the whole plot. Blanchett, unsurprisingly, shone with her usual charm, and the veiled but venomous malice she had bestowed on her character. James is an actress I didn't know but I liked to see, having done her work quite well. It's a young actress, surely this movie isn't going to be the movie of her life, but she left a promise of talent that may come to blossom. Helena Bonham Carter and Stellan Skarsgård also enter the film in supporting roles that their talent makes it seem easy.This movie will easily please all those who want to watch a movie with the original Cinderella story. It's absolutely the same as the book our grandparents used to delight our childhoods. However, if you've gotten tired of it and prefer a modern version of the story this movie is not for you.",Cinderella
44,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,4,3 September 2015,"The story needs not an introduction, it is the exact Cinderella story, but with a little less magic and a little more explanation on the characters. As a downton Abbey fan I had to see Lily James in a role other than Rose, and she pulls it off, even though, to be fair, it is not a very demanding role. Cate Blanchett is good, but the screenplay doesn't allow her to reach her full potentials. The costumes weren't that great, but good enough and the special effects and the graphics were satisfying. The story has no surprise and very few twists now and then, but half of the time you will spend gazing at the prince, so if you are not a child and you have seen Cinderella before, you won't be impressed. So 4 out of 10.",Cinderella
45,leonblackwood,Surprisingly enjoyable! 5/10,5,30 August 2015,"Review: I know that this story has been told many times before and that it is quite corny but this movie actually wasn't too bad. The vibrate colours and well picked cast made the film quite a joy to watch, even though I found the main character quite annoying but it still worked. Its about a young girl who has loving parents and an extremely kind heart but when her mother dies, her father marries a wicked stepmother from hell, who brings her 2 daughters with her to live there mansion. After her father dies, she ends up banished to the attic whilst serving her stepmother and her daughters. She then bumps into the King's son in the woods whilst riding on her horse and they immediately fall in love with each other but he doesn't have any information about her. He then invites the whole village to a ball, hoping to meet up with the mysterious woman who he has fallen for. Cinderella then tells her mother-in-law about the ball and she prepares her daughters to meet the Prince, hoping that he will fall for one of them. She then makes them dresses for the ball whilst secretly making one for herself but her stepmother tells her that she is not allowed to go to the ball because she will embarrass them. After they leave for the palace, Cinderella's fairy godmother pops out of nowhere and she prepares her for the ball, even though she's not allowed to go. After supplying her with a beautiful carriage, dress and glass shoes, Cinderella makes her way to the ball were she steals the Princes heart and they find out more about each other. The only problem is that the fairy godmothers magic will only last until midnight so she rushes home so the Prince won't see her in her common clothes. After the king dies, the newly appointed king sends out his soldiers to find Cinderella so she can become his Queen but the wicked stepmother locks her in the attic because she won't agree to her terms if she becomes the queen. Anyway, I can go on forever about the plot but I'm sure that everyone knows how the story goes. She finally ends up with the king and everyone is happy except for the wicked stepmother and her daughters who under estimated Cinderella. This film really does prove that a good heart gets you much further than a evil one which is why everyone loves this classic concept. To be honest, I was expecting it too be much worse than it was but I actually enjoyed Kennett Brannagh's interpretation of this Disney classic. The constant smiling does become quite tedious but it's expected from a Disney movie. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch because of the amazing scenery and the fact that it's fun for the whole family. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Judging by the amazing box office takings this storyline is still a hit with audiences, even though the first movie came out in 1950. Lily James, 26, was a perfect choice as Cinderella but her jawbone must have hurt after all of that smiling. She's known for playing the feisty Lady Rose MacClare in Downtown Abbey and she's had roles in Wrath of the Titans, Broken with Tim Roth and Fast Girls which was a small independent English movie. She stars in the new Bradley Cooper movie, Burnt, which has HIT written all over it and she has a role in the Kaiser's Last Kiss alongside Christopher Plummer and Jai Courtney. Its obvious that Brannagh was using her experience on Downtown to put her forward for the lead in this movie because of her classic English acting. She did put in a good performance but I'm yet to see what else she is capable of, in terms of her acting range. Cate Blanchett was a brilliant choice as the wicked stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter played the Fairy godmother well. The film was made by Kenneth Brannagh who brought you Thor, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Sleuth with Michael Caine and Jude Law, the awful Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the acclaimed Much Ado About Nothing which has loads of stars in it. At 54 years old, he has starred in over 50 movies which include Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Valkyrie and the Boat That Rocked but he's mostly known for his Shakespeaion acting in classics like Othello, Hamlet and Henry V. I have to give him top marks for this movie because he must have had a lot of pressure to stay true to the all time classic.Budget: $95million Worldwide Gross: $542millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their family/fantasy/drama movies about a young girl who falls in love with a prince, against her stepmothers wishes. 5/10",Cinderella
46,matthewssilverhammer,Pure Disney Magic,9,21 March 2015,"""Have courage and be kind, because kindness is powerful and magical""; this is the kind of corny sentiment that can turn me off. Luckily, Cinderella's syrupy sweetness is so hopelessly romantic that its sincerity swept me off me feet, often reducing me to tears. It's the kind of old-fashioned filmmaking we need, one that hearkens to the days when movies helped us forget our troubles instead of pointing them out. With complete earnestness and a refreshing lack self-commentary, Branagh brandishes the ubiquitous romance with more grace and fun than a fairy-godmother could shake her wand at. Cinderella is a fleshed- out version of the story you already know, more focused on being charming than surprising. You may ask, ""Do we NEED another Cinderella movie?"", but this modern take's inherent loveliness reminds us why the term ""a Cinderella story"" has become the ubiquitous term for any rags-to- riches tale. Lily James, in a stunningly beautiful turn as the titular servant-turned-princess, possesses the grace, vulnerability, poise and animated quirk needed, giving purpose to her character's unrestrained goodness. The design is immaculate, like a real-life Disney story with British costume drama sensibilities. Even the score and narration, which are relatively generic, fit the emotional and regal tones of this honestly sad yet ultimately triumphant children's fable. Okay, so it's not breaking new ground. It's simply an unabashed fairy tale with its soul deep in humanity. However, in a culture working so hard to comment on itself at every turn, maybe Cinderella's comfortable confidence in its own simplicity is the very thing making it groundbreaking. Emotionally powerful and sweetly entertaining, Cinderella is refreshingly pure Disney-magic.",Cinderella
47,Vartiainen,Doesn't add enough new to stand on its own,6,18 October 2016,"Disney seems to be going through its catalogue of classics with these live-action adaptations. And sadly, this is one of the better ones I've seen so far. Not to say it's bad, but it certainly exemplifies the problems with these adaptations.So, we all know the story. The father of our main character passes the curtain, leaving our lovable and innocent Cinderella to suffer the tyranny of her cruel stepmother and her two spoiled daughters. A prince, a ball, a fairy godmother, et cetera. It's a classic, but it's also one of those stories that's so iconic as an animated Disney film that it's hard to imagine it any different. But that's what we need to be able to do. This film needs to stand on its own to have any merit beyond nostalgia fodder or something that merely looks pretty. They could have done away with the mice, instead of these CGI monstrosities. They could have told it from the point of view of the prince. They could gone the Wicked route, and told it from the point of view of the stepmother. But no, it's the story we all know and have seen and heard a million times before.Sure, it looks very good. Disney has enough talent and money for that. And, to the film's credit, I do like Richard Madden a lot as the prince. Especially because he and Cinderella actually bond in this film through multiple meetings instead of laying eyes on one another and bam, wedding bells. Sure, the meetings are not that far apart time- wise here either, but at least it's an improvement.In the end I can't really blame this film for being what it is. It could have been better, but even as it is, you get more than you probably expect.",Cinderella
48,lisafordeay,A charming remake of the 1950s cartoon that saved Walt Disney's Company,8,24 March 2015,"Cinderella. Everyone knows the story by now. The likes of Hilary Duff,Brandy Norwood,Anna Kendricks,Drew Barrymore to name a few all played the iconic role and now its Lily James' turn to play Cinderella.The story opens with the original music of When You Wish Upon A Star which I thought was really cool and we start off with Ella and her dotting parents who spend time together in a nearby meadow. Of course tragedy strikes as Ella's mom(Hayley Atwell)tragically passes away and she tells Ella to have courage and be kind. Later Ella's father remarries shortly to a widower named Lady Tremaine(played by the brilliant Cate Blanchett who in my opinion stoled this film)and she has two daugthers of her own Drizella and Anastasia. But when Ella's dad has to go away,Ella hears some bad news that her father passed away too and she is left with the evil Lady Tremaine who treats Ella as a slave and makes her do everything ,while her step sisters make fun of Ella being covered in soot and they give her the nickname of Cinderella. So Ella gets upset and runs into the forest with her horse when she meets a handsome stranger named Kit(Richard Madden who is so charming may I add)and the two become smitten. Of course Kit is the prince of the land and he falls head over heels in love with Ella(who he doesn't know her name of course)and decides to throw a ball to find her again. As you can guess Ella does go to the ball in style thanks to Helena Bonham Carter's version of the fairy godmother and she meets Kit again.Of course they dance together and then he shows her the secret garden and Ella goes on the swing.But the clock strikes twelve as she was about to say her name to Kit and she has to go off into the night? So will Kit find Ella again? And live happily ever after in the end of the film. Bottom line this is a classic love story that I have never seen in a movie in a very long time. Lily James looked radiant in the ball scene with her blue dress(which I wouldn't mind wearing myself)and she had the grace and elegance of a true Disney princess with a hint of Julie Andrews added to her personality. Richard Madden is handsome as the prince and thank god he has a personality here than the 1950s version who was so boring and bland. So what did I think of this movie well I have to say I LOVED IT as it reminded me of what all Disney movies should be magic and believe in miracles. Here is the good: Lily James as Cinderella was spot on and the visuals are stunning. As for the rest of the cast they are all wonderful too especially Cate Blanchett who was excellent in this film and Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother who is only in it for a short period. The special effects are very good too with the Lizards,Mice and Goose turning into horses and humans as well as the pumpkin as a carriage for our heroine to go off in to go to the ball.The bad: If you seen the trailer you basically seen the whole film,so whatever you do don't see the trailer for this movie as it will ruin it for you. Like I said I am giving this an 8/10 and also its better than the 1950's version because the would be lovers had more screen time together and they spoke quite a lot during the ballroom scene. As for the director,he did a marvelous job with everything and Walt Disney would be proud of Kenneth Branagh for remaking his timeless classic into a beautiful love story that children and adults would love. Ignore those who says oh this film is stupid and Ella is so passive and she has a small waist,they clearly don't know what they are on about. And might I add that it will knock Frozen out of the water.Running Time; 104 minsBest part: The visuals and the performances and the chemistry between Richard and Lily. Also Cate Blanchett was excellent as the villain and Helena Bonham Carter. Worst part: A bit boring here and there and the trailer ruins it.Quote: Would you take me for what I am an honest country girl who loves you. Of Course I would. And would you take me for what I am a prince who is an apprentice.Have courage and be kind4/5 stars",Cinderella

I hope more Disney re-tellings will do they same.The setting is perfect, almost feels real and less like a set. Lily James really excels in her role as Cinderella, plays it more realistic, not cartoony one bit. Helena Bonham Carter shows how much fun she is having in her role has the fairy godmother, it seems like the role for her was a dream come true. Cate Blanchett gives a good sutler evil performance as the evil stepmother, she shows you how evil she is, the moment she first enters the film. Kenneth Branagh direction is quite beyond greatness.

50,stevendbeard,Nice Retelling of Fairy Tale,7,13 March 2015,"I saw ""Cinderella"", starring Cate Blanchett-the Hobbit & Lord of the Rings movies, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; Lily James-Downton Abbey_tv, Wrath of the Titans; Richard Madden-Game of Thrones_tv, A Promise and Helena Bonham Carter-the Harry Potter movies, Fight Club.This is a live action retelling of the popular Disney fairy tale that starts from the very beginning, with little baby Ella-who becomes Cinderella-and her parents. Ella's mother teaches her that the two most important things in life are to be courageous and kind-which helps shape Ella's life. You also learn later how Ella's name is changed to Cinderella. Lily plays the adult Ella who has tragedy strike in the form of both loosing her mother to an illness and then, after her father remarries Cate, her father also passes away from an illness-I guess the doctors weren't as good back then, as they are now. Cate has two daughters of her own and treats Lily as more of a servant girl than a family member. Cate has Lily wait on her and her other two daughters, cooking meals, doing laundry, plus doing all the housework. One day, while riding in the forest, Ella meets Richard and a love connection is made. Richard is a prince-next in line to become King-but he did not get Lily's name at their chance meeting, so he comes up with a plan to invite the whole country side to a fancy ball, hoping to see Lily again. Of course, Cate, the evil step-mother, doesn't want Lily to attend the ball and does everything to make sure she can not go. Helena shows up as Lily's fairy god-mother and performs her magic on all the familiar elements from the fairy tale story-making a carriage from a pumpkin, horses from mice and even the clothes, including the glass slippers. All in all, I thought it was a good telling of the familiar story and kids should enjoy it. The only concern I can think of is the length of the movie; it would probably have been better at 90 minutes instead of the 112 minutes that it clocked in at. FYI: Before the movie started was a short mini movie called 'Frozen Fever' that is made by the original people that created the 'Frozen' movie-you might have heard of it. It centers on a birthday party that Elsa is throwing for her sister Anna and it does contain a new song called 'Making Today a Perfect Day'-if you have not heard it yet, I'm sure that you will, soon enough. It's rated ""PG"" for mild thematic elements-mostly the cruelty shown towards Lily-and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I enjoyed it and I would probably buy it on DVD.",Cinderella
51,alindsay-al,A good Disney tale,7,20 December 2015,"I love a good Disney film so I thought I would finally see the 2015 live action Cinderella. The premise of the film sees a girl called ella left with her stepmother and stepsisters who abuse her. When she gets a chance she tries to change her life and have a happy ending. It is actually quite a challenge to play because there are two versions of the character, the housemaid and the princess but Lily james did a great job. I liked her as this average girl who tries her best to be good but decides to take her life into her own hands. Cate blanchett plays the stepmother and she was good in the movie, sometimes she is a bit cartoony but overall you really don't like her character and are hoping she gets what she deserves. The prince was a pretty fleshed out character and I actually ended up liking him and buying his attraction to Cinderella. Skellan skarssgard plays the kings adviser and he does a good job as a parallel with blanchetts character. The story is alright meaning that there are some elements that are good but it does feel really safe. I understand that you want to be faithful towards the original animated film but it does end up feeling very safe. The script is alright with some drama working and providing a good emotional response in the viewer. However, it does feel at times that your watching a cartoon with the fast paced cringey dialogue being used. The style is also a mixed bag, while the film for the most part looks great there is some use of cgi that just doesn't hold up in this day and age. Overall this is a decent film that if your a fan of Cinderella you should see.",Cinderella
52,estebangonzalez10,A magical and surprisingly faithful adaptation of a beloved classic tale,8,22 March 2015,"""I'll have to tell you a secret that will see you through all the trials that life can offer: Have courage and be kind.""Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella isn't much of a re-imagination of the classic Disney animated film as much as it is a straightforward live action retelling of the tale. In a time where we've seen several of Disney's beloved classic stories being reimagined and told through a much darker light, Cinderella's faithfulness to the familiar tale feels like a fresh of breath air. In papers it shouldn't work, but surprisingly I found it way more engaging than Snow White and the Huntsman, Alice in Wonderland, and even Maleficent (which I actually ended up enjoying), all films which were told through new perspectives. Branagh is known for adapting well known literary works (specifically from Shakespeare) and once again he delivers through breathtaking and colorful visuals and surprisingly engaging characters. Sometimes it isn't just about the story that is being told, but how you tell it, and Branagh is an excellent storyteller. He was able to take this very familiar tale and without introducing anything new to it, he still kept the audience magically engaged with the story. A lot of credit must be given to the fantastic cast and the astonishing visuals which turned this fairytale into a classical period piece. At times I felt like I was watching an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel with so much attention to the period details and wonderful costume designs. I'm sure this film will receive a couple of Oscar nominations in the production and costume design department because it is visually inspiring. I've only seen a dozen films released this year, but so far this is the best and I'm not ashamed to admit that I was emotionally engaged with the film. It is better than the beloved animated classic, which I wasn't really a huge fan of.Is it really necessary to check on the spoiler warning box for a straightforward adaptation of this classic tale? There aren't any surprises in this screenplay adaptation from Charles Perrault's fairy tale written by Chris Weitz (About a Boy). It basically follows a similar structure from Disney's animated adaptation with perhaps a little more background on Cinderella's parents (played by Ben Chaplin and Hayley Attwell). Cinderella is wonderfully and beautifully played by Lily James (who plays Lady Rose in Downtown Abbey) while her stepmother is brilliantly portrayed by Cate Blanchett. Her character may have seemed a bit cartoonish at times, but Blanchett sure knows how to wear fashion dresses. We do get some explanation as to why she behaves in such a cruel way so she does have some depth. The stepsisters however are completely cartoonish and deliver most of the laughs for young audiences. Drisella and Anastasia are played by Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger. The heart of the story however centers around the fantastic chemistry between Lily James's Cinderella and the Prince played by Richard Madden (Rob Stark from Game of Thrones). The pair actually share a scene together before the ball that is really engaging and helps sell the love story. In order for the film to work it needs to have a believable love story and it does. Helena Bonham Carter also has a wonderful short scene as the Fairy Godmother, and Derek Jacobi does a convincing job as the King. Nonso Anozie is the Captain of the Palace, while Stellan Skarsgard plays the Grand Duke. Despite our familiarity with the story, the entire cast delivers and that allows the story to flow in a magical way.My only complaint is that the message of the film ""have courage and be kind"" was repeated throughout the entire movie. We constantly were beaten over the head with it, but since this is a film geared towards a younger audience I understood why they did it. In a time where a lot of emphasis has been placed on being brave it is refreshing to be reminded about the power of kindness. Cinderella is given a strong female role here and it requires a lot of strength to be kind in the midst of such difficult trials. We may not have needed to hear the message so many times because we could see it through her actions. James portrayed this character in such a beautiful way and she is an actress with a bright future ahead of her. Cinderella is a much stronger character here than in the animated film; she's not simply waiting for a prince to come and rescue her. She is strong and determined and when we finally see her first encounter with the Prince, it is she who has a greater influence in him than he does in her. The ball room scene is also magical and despite knowing every beat of the film I couldn't help but feel invested and thrilled by the magical spell this warm film left me with. Cinderella is living proof that remaining faithful to a classic story isn't such a bad idea after all. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Cinderella
53,iquine,Cinderella Verizon 20.15,8,10 January 2020,"(Flash Review)This 2015 version is a high quality and modern faithful telling of the classic tale. Stellar visual effects, striking cinematography, lavish costumes and opulent sets complimented with the fun magical transformation scenes make this a pleasant viewing. The acting was solid as well. This production will hold up to rewatching with your children. It does the original justice.",Cinderella
54,r96sk,Plays out slightly differently compared to the '50 production - to positive effect,7,14 November 2020,"An improvement on Disney's past attempt from 1950.I do like the animated version from the studio, but this 2015 release of 'Cinderella' makes for a more enjoyable experience in my eyes. Lily James and Richard Madden are smart choices to play Cinderella and Prince, while Cate Blanchett is impressive as the Stepmother. Helena Bonham Carter (Fairy Godmother), Stellan Skarsgård (Grand Duke) and Nonso Anozie (Captain) are also noteworthy.The premise has a few changes, the ending plays out slightly differently compared to the '50 production - to positive effect. It also makes the nastiness of Blanchett's character unmistakably clear, I actually felt hatred for her - which wasn't the case, at least to the same extent, with the original.Good viewing.",Cinderella
55,cekadah,I enjoyed it !,8,23 May 2015,"To all the reviews that rated this flick oh so very low - the story is Cinderella - a fairy tale, not a message movie or a story with a lot of drama.Lets be honest, Cinderella is a story made for the female pre-tween and tween set. I think Disney did an excellent job on this remake and director Kenneth Branagh & writer Chris Weitz have taken this classic tale and made it their own. What I mean by that is that their interpretation is their signature piece.It's beautifully filmed, the costuming is out-of-this-world, and the characterizations are perfect. I really liked the two evil sisters! And how the animals played a role but were always in the background not stealing the spotlight on Lily James as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett is the evil step mother - and I mean that in a good way!I would suggest this movie to anyone with young girls as a good choice for entertainment especially if their children are into the prince charming fairy tale stuff.",Cinderella
56,MissSimonetta,"When the update is regressive in comparison to a film made 65 years ago, you know there's a problem",5,22 March 2015,"I watched the 2015 and 1950 Cinderella films on the same day, and God is it shocking how the 65 year-old movie has a more active and human heroine. Not that she's the feminist ideal, but at least she has emotions and wants out of her situation desperately. But at any rate, we shall get to that later.Despite that opening, I did not despise the 2015 Cinderella. No one can deny the production is handsome or that the actors appear to be enjoying themselves. It's nice to see chemistry between Cinderella and her prince; heck, it's great that the prince was given a character at all! However, the thing drags on a little too long, especially for a family film with such a simple story.The aspect which near kills the film is shockingly the characterization of the titular heroine. This remake tries so hard to flesh out Lily James' Cinderella, tries to make her a figure of quiet inner strength, but in the end, she's a smiling dolt. Why can't she just leave her situation when she's shown having friends in the village who would likely be more than happy to house her? Oh, just sentimental attachment to the house of her dead parents! At least other versions imply that Cinderella is sheltered and friendless with nowhere to go.The worst part has to be when she's locked in the attic after the stepmother discovers it was she who charmed the prince at the ball. In the 1950 version, she is desperate and gets the mice to bust her out. Not so in this ""updated"" version. Instead of attempting escape or giving us signs that she's distraught at her lost happiness, she just smiles, dances, and retreats into her memories to escape reality. If Cinderella does not care about her situation, then why should I? That about sums up the problem with this movie: I have no real reason to care when the heroine is a perennial smiler who only breaks twice in the movie. It's all glitter with nothing else to offer the audience.",Cinderella
57,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Stunningly beautiful,8,15 February 2016,"Kenneth Branagh's lavish retelling of Cinderella is one for the books, a dazzling jewel amongst live action Disney fare, boasting a well written story and fleshed out characters to accompany the visual flair. The writing is considerably redone from the original animated version, with more for every person to say and do, and an overall maturity to the work. Lily James is radiant as Cinderella, whose loving parents (Ben Chaplin and Hayley Atwell almost steal the movie before it even really begins with their warmhearted, comforting performances) are taken from her at a young age. She's left with her icy stepmother and two stank ass ugly stepsisters, and off kicks that timeless story which we all know so well, given some cobweb shaking new ground to tread this time around. The prince she meets (Richard Madden) is a full blooded man with a lust for life and a desire to find the right woman, smitten by Cinderella every time he encounters her. Her fairy godmother (an adorably befuddled Helena Bonham Carter) makes magic and then some in the classic carriage sequence, with pumpkin, goose and some fantastic lizard footmen all springing wildly to life. The costume design is right outta town, every dress and waistcoat a multicoloured, gilded masterpiece of artistic inspiration, and Cinderella's classic ball gown is an enchanting magnum opus of production design. Cate Blanchett takes a previously one note antagonist and whips her up into three dimensional form, displaying aching flickers of humanity buried like dying embers in the gritty ash of the stepmothers life-sick soul. Stellan Skarsgard makes a smarmy Grand Duke, and Derek Jacobi provides wit and warmth as a most level headed King. A knockout of a Disney adaptation and the best version of Cinderella I've seen to date.",Cinderella
58,davispittman,This is the Disney I love!!!,10,29 March 2015,"Oh my goodness I LOVED this Disney remake, did I know what was going to happen, sure I did, everyone did. But that doesn't matter, the point is, is that this dazzling Disney remake is wildly entertaining, the costumes are stunning, the sets ate probably the best sets I've ever seen, and every single actor portrayed their role absolutely perfectly!! Cate Blanchett was literally the PERFECT Lady Tremaine, she just radiated evil!! And Lily James was great as the dazzling fairytale princess Cinderella. I feel like this is the best I've seen from Disney in a long time!! I felt like I was actually in the movie while watching in the theater, I made sure to sit on the front row so I could fully enjoy it, I like that they stuck to the original story, and didn't deviate, or throw in their own crazy twist. The 2015 Cinderella beats out the original from 2015. I hope Disney will do more remakes like this. So go experience the magic that is this movie if u haven't already!",Cinderella

60,3xHCCH,Spectacular Faithful Version of the 1950 Animated Classic,9,12 March 2015,"The Disney studio had a long tradition of mining the trove of fairy tales and turning them into animated films which have been childhood classics for several generations. Lately, it is now mining its own trove of beloved animated classics and turning them into live action feature films. This year, one of Disney's most iconic princesses gets the live action treatment, ""Cinderella.""We see young Ella growing up in a happy family with the virtues of courage and kindness deeply inculcated in her. We see her orphaned and left at the mercy of her cruel stepmother Lady Tremaine and her two lazy foolish stepsisters Drizella and Anastasia. We see how Fairy Godmother magically help Cinderella go to the ball. We see how she danced with the Prince at the ball, but had to run off by the strike of midnight, leaving one of her glass slippers behind. We see how the Prince uses the slipper to find her and live happily ever after. We see everything as we knew it by heart, but Branagh managed to bring it to spectacular life with vivid imagery and touching emotion.The script was written by Chris Weitz faithfully follows the well-known animated Disney version of the tale released in 1950. As directed by Kenneth Branagh, there was very minimal re-imagining done here, compared to Tim Burton's version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or Angelina Jolie's portrayal of ""Maleficent"". This film is so unabashedly targeted for the ladies and girls of the romantic type. This is a major big-production chick flick that goes all out for the all the sweet moments it can squeeze out of the story. The charisma and chemistry of the young leads were more than sufficient in this regard.I thought Lily James perfectly embodied Cinderella with her delicate face, long flowing hair, kind demeanor and natural elegance, even as a kitchen maid. Unlike when I thought Lily Allen and Kristen Stewart were totally wrong actresses when they played Snow White in two separate movie versions of that other fairy tale, I totally accept Lily James as Cinderella. Since I did not know she was in ""Downton Abbey,"" I am seeing her as a totally new actress breaking through with a successful portrayal of a very iconic character.Prince Charming has a name here, Kit, played by Richard Madden, Madden is clean cut and totally charming here, complete with that princely twinkle in his eyes, not immediately recognizable as his previous character of Robb Stark from the popular TV series ""Game of Thrones."" Fortunately for Madden, the character of the prince was also expanded from how we know him from the cartoon, so we get to meet him even before the ball itself.The scene-stealing role of Lady Tremaine was portrayed by the always scene-stealing Cate Blanchett. With her over-the-top haute couture gowns, Blanchett is definitely an eye-catching sight. The bitter cruelty of her character was given a lot more depth than how the cartoon stepmother was portrayed. Blanchett played the role with wicked delight. The cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos is so vibrant with a bright color palette that pops out of the screen. The production design of Daniel Ferretti was so opulent and grandiose in scale. The costumes of Sandy Powell were so richly designed and meticulously detailed. The musical score by Patrick Doyle envelops the film and brings us to a fairytale time and land. The visual effects of the magical transformation of pumpkin and animals to the coach, horses and staff were delightfully done (with the ever-quirky Helena Bonham-Carter as Fairy Godmother). The remarkably beautiful moment where Cinderella danced with the Prince is a perfect scene which highlights all these masterful and award-worthy technical aspects. 9/10.",Cinderella
61,aharmas,Magic Cinema,10,21 March 2015,"When they announced that there was going to be a live-action adaptation of the ""Cinderella"" fairy tale, I was a bit concerned. There was something special about the Disney tale, simple, but magical, full of lovable characters and memorable tunes. Still, Disney and Pixar had been producing some very good animation lately, and with the excellent teasers, and the mention that Cate Blanchett would be in charge of bringing the wicked stepmother to life, I was hoping not be disappointed.After having two hours of cinematic pleasure, I am glad to say that this is one of the best movies that Disney has ever released. With Branagh at the helm, and a very capable cast, excellent special effects, a clever script that adheres to the Disney cartoon text and has added a few philosophical touches to highlight the virtues of good versus evil, we're on for a great ride.A few things change, but Cinderella is stuck with the family from hell, as the stepmother and her two stepsisters strive to make her existence a difficult one. The stepsisters are caricatures, but the stepmother is a character to treasure in the hands of Blanchett. She's grand, spectacular, bitter, and ready to do what is necessary to survive. She has evolved from an innocent girl to a woman who realizes that women don't have it easy in this particular world, and she uses whatever strategy is needed to get what she wants.Most of the joy from the film is in the chemistry of the leads, and this is essential to keep the romantic and magical angles alive. It's perfectly obvious from the beginning that the princess and Ella will be together forever, happily ever after, and are a match made in Disney heaven. This film succeeds because it's not overdone, and it keeps matters simple (for the story), but when the visual magic is unleashed, we'd better hold on to our hats.The transformation scene is absolute perfection as the fairy godmother delivers the goods and gets Cinderella to the ball, and as if this moment wasn't enough, things are truly spectacular in the ball. Cinderella makes a grand entrance, then she dances with her princess, and we're then taken to the palace gardens in a moment reminiscent of the Gazebo scenes in ""The Sound of Music"". It all fits beautifully, and then it builds on to the expected resolution, when the gorgeous slipper fits her foot perfectly.Dante Ferreti, Patrick Boyle compliment each other with the superb work done in the production and music departments. Every detail is exquisite, and I will never be able to find a carriage more magnificent and delightful as Cinderella's ride. Then there the costumes, each fitting the personality of the women who wear them. Blanchett's are strong and seductive, powerful like her personality. Her daughters' bring out the confused personalities of each sister, and Cinderella's might appear simple but are truly elegant and beautiful. Nothing can prepare you for the flow of that blue gown, and jaws will drop when the bride's outfit is revealed.And they say fairy tales don't exist?",Cinderella

63,guisreis,This is a nice live action version of the classic story,8,23 January 2016,"This is a nice live action version of the classic story. Although not having the best pace possible, is gets more and more interesting as the story advances. It perhaps takes too much time to have Cinderella's father die and the life of the fairytale heroine be converted in a nightmare, and that is a minor problem because that prologue is not very interesting, it does not add the intended development of the main character. From that point on, though, it is a true Cinderella movie, what is particularly a relief taking into account the way Hollywood has been destroying classic fairy tales in silly revisionist action films. Helena Bonham Carter portrays an excellent, funny and very weird fairy godmother, as we could expect. The visual effects of her magic are also perfect, not exaggerated, used for the benefit of the story. I loved the animals transformed into her helpers - four mice into horses, a goose into a coachman, and two lizards into footmen - in the pumpkin chariot. Cate Blanchet is a convincing stepmother, although she does not shine as this talented actress is able to. Lily James is not spectacular but is also convincing in the leading role. ""Robb Stark"" Richard Madden proves to be a good cast for a Disney prince. The sisters Drisella and Anastasia are nice, but their roles are too minor.",Cinderella
64,Seraphion,"Predictable with no surprise at all, but it'll do for a princess movie",6,19 March 2015,"Ella is her parents' only daughter and she lived very happy, with her mother teaching her sometimes there's magic in things. Ella lost her mother as a child. Her father remarries to a widow with two daughters. One day Ella's father goes on a trip for work. The stepmother moves Ella to the attic while they have the best of the house. All gets sealed as news of Ella's father's death reaches the house. The stepmother and stepsisters also have Ella do all the chores like a servant. They call her Cinderella because she's often covered in ash. Ella accepts all those remembering her mother's message of being kind and having courage. One day Ella meets the prince while horse riding. Both she and the prince conceal their true identities. Back at the palace, the king orders the prince to look for a bride. Avoiding a match-made engagement, the prince orders a ball dance where he invites all maidens in the kingdom. News of the ball reaches Ella and her stepmother and stepsisters. They have gowns made but instead the stepmother forbids Ella from attending the ball. In sadness Ella sobs at the garden, but her kind act makes her meet her fairy godmother who puts a spell on many things to enable her to attend the ball, with a special present of glass slippers and a warning about the spell's duration. Ella goes attends the ball and dances with the prince, striking awe in all others. But she leaves the palace as the clock strikes midnight, barely having time as the spell fades. She slipped and left one of her slippers, which the prince keeps.The prince is crowned king as his father dies. He seeks the ""mysterious princess"" who danced with him. He has the grand duke and his captain and an entourage travel with the slipper, fitting all the kingdom's maidens. But the magical slipper refuses to fit anyone else. Ella's stepmother find out about the other glass slipper and in her envy breaks it after Ella denies her demands. The entourage reaches Ella's house, the last in the kingdom, only to find her stepsisters can't fit into the slipper. As the grand duke orders to go away, the captain hears Ella's singing. The young king reveals himself from guise as one of the guards and asks the captain to inquire. The stepmother tries to forbid Ella, but the captain insists, and the prince put the slipper on her to a perfect fit. Ella then marries the prince and becomes the land's queen.The story is just a pretty straightforward live action adaptation of the classic children's fairy tale. This time it looks like that Disney didn't bother to take the risk of turning the children oriented story into something different, like some movies did in the recent years like 2011's Red Riding Hood, 2013's Jack the Giant Slayer, 2012's Snow White and The Huntsman, or even like Disney's own way too altered version of a shared universe meltdown of Into The Woods (2014). Disney nicely capitalize on their positioning as the makers of the ""princess movies"" and focuses a lot of effort on the ball scenes and gown properties.The simple additions patched on to the story only made this movie a little bit more complex to appeal to the older audience. The movie runs pretty much predictable all the way through. This is especially so if you are one of those older audiences who grew up at the time when children's fairy tales are spammed into a kid's, especially girls, early ages. Yet the twists like giving names to the prince, adding a previous encounter between Cinderella and the prince, and adding the beef with the grand duke's conspiracy are also quite nicely mentionable. They don't necessarily alter the story but instead they kind of complete it.One thing that is also mentionable is that through this movie Disney starts to reconstruct the classic children's fairy tale stories with a new and wider reaching set. Adding the role of the captain, which has quite chunk of screen time for a nameless supporting character, into the classic setting of all white characters is quite a good way to build a simple bridge to the more diverse audience while not altering the classic story too far.The acting overall is a good thing to watch. Lily James is quite the perfect pick for the lead role. Her build fits very well as a real life Disney princess and her face is not overwhelmingly pretty that it fits the ash covered face scene very well. Her acting is also at quite the right quality, with her doing wide enough range of required facial emotions. Richard Madden's acting is just enough to fill in the romance angle and finale happy ending. Cate Blanchett is one to be praised here. She is successful in portraying all the required sides of her role. She did her mannerism nicely in portraying the regal widow lady, her facial expressions rightly depicts the stepmother's bitter and envious life, and she completes her role with the hill-billy laughter. Having Helena Bonham Carter and Stellan Skarsgard also nicely adds the complexity to the story.A 6 out of 10 score is from me for Cinderella (2015). A recommendation is a yes from me, especially if you're seeking for a nostalgic experience of your childhood fairy tales. The movie is nicely entertaining even for me who found it to be very much predictable and with no surprise.",Cinderella
65,rgkarim,"The Makeup, Costumes, and Effect Magically Make The Movie",8,13 March 2015,"Disney is at it again this weekend, remaking a classic movie with a modern twist. This time they continue the real life princess momentum with Cinderella, a tale that is close to my heart. Numerous advertisements and television specials have painted what looked to be a promising movie, and seemed to leave nothing to the imagination. With little mystery left of this movie, I had doubts as to whether this movie would impress me. So taking a trip back to the old style, let's get down to business. The thing about Cinderella I always remembered was how cute the whole tale was. In this modern version that cuteness remains with through the fun little quirks the team has designed. First off the budding romance between the prince and the princess, which you know is coming, is very sweet, holding all the qualities that true love SHOULD be. Cinderella focuses on the important qualities love and curbs the movie glamour to emphasize inner beauty despite the gorgeous outer beauty. Second factor is Cinderella herself. She has a bubbly personality, coupled with kindness that brings that heartwarming effect that these movies need to bring more often. And for once it didn't cross into the cheesy love that also is common in these stories. Yet the cutest factor for me was the integration of mice back into Cinderella's life. Yes you heard me; the lovable GusGus is back, though this time without the digitally mastered voice. Along with a feminized Jacque, now Jacqueline, the small family of rodents provides some comedic relief in the form of slapstick comedy. While not the remotely close to funny, the mice are definitely adorable in all their squeaks and big eyed antics that only the heartless, or those with an aversion to mice, can hate. Yet cuteness alone does not make a good movie, it requires a strong cast to bring the characters to life. Fortunately the casting director did their job as the Cinderella's teams of performers are well grouped. The star of course is Lily James, the lovely woman whose physical and inner beauty shines throughout the entire movie. She captures the inner strength and kindness that Cinderella is famous for, bringing a positive energy that radiates from the screen into you. I couldn't help but smile and feel the hope she promised with the good-natured soul she had, her smile in particular mirroring those values. However, she wasn't some high on life hippy, as Cinderella's suffering was the stronger of the two emotions. Making me empathize with her. Enough about the star though, let's get to the charming prince of the tale. Richard Madden makes a good prince, handsome, wholesome, and actually representative of the characteristic he is supposed to have. He carries the pride of a prince, but also remains humble and has the good inner qualities that are truly noble. I can't say if girls will be attracted to him, but this reviewer liked the realistic nobility that defied the stereotypical tools we usually get. Cate Blanchett's poise and deceptive demeanor rings strong in this movie. That haunting tone she makes famous returns, with a little cruel humor thrown in to mix things up and tickle some funny bones. And of course we can't forget the talented Helena Bonham Carter can we. The multifaced actress again blows the roof off an iconic role, bringing a refreshing taste back to a tried and true part. Her time as the Godmother brings the humor all ages will love, her klutzy demeanor and honest to a fault lines perfect to uplift the ""depressing"" scene she appears in. However the biggest strengths of this movie are the special effects, costumes, and makeup of the movie. Cinderella is filled to the brim with fireworks, scenery, and magical spells of light that will make you feel you are in Disney world. I was pulled into the setting with the colorful creations the effects team made, and how well integrated they were into the movie. While the effects pulled me in, the costumes and makeup were what kept me impressed in the movie. The beautiful gowns and dresses were crafted to match the personalities of our characters in both color and flare factor, as I like to call it. My favorite dress in particular, definitely goes to the classic blue gown of Ella's, the modern upgrade to the sapphire blue a very beautiful choice that I agree with. And as for the makeup, well the artists get another round of applause from me. From the subtle touchups to make our cast sparkle to Carter's hag makeup, there were plenty of touchup that impressed this reviewer. The goose and lizard makeup in particular were my favorites as they blended both animal and human qualities together in a way that reminded me of a Face Off challenge. I had low expectations going into this movie, but Cinderella did entertain and impress me. Yes it is predictable, and doesn't quite capture the fun the animated film did. However, the cast and crew have recreated the world and added a few twists to revive the drab Disney tale. It lacks a lot of driving factors, especially the danger and darkness to help keep up the suspense, and it also could have favored from some wittier comedy to bridge the audience gap. Family's will enjoy this tale though, and if you are like me, will feel as if they were living in a Disney World dream. Is it worth a trip to theater? I have to say yes, especially a movie that little ones will enjoy, but please gage your child's attention spans before making the trek. My scores for this charming film are:Adventure/Drama/Family: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5",Cinderella
66,richard-1787,"Visually beautiful, but somewhat uneven",7,13 March 2015,"I'll be curious to see how this movie fares at the box office in the weeks immediately after it opens, and more importantly, down the road.The most striking thing about this movie is the visuals. Some of the landscapes, the ball at the palace, and other moments are often a real feast for the eye.The acting is all fine. I found Lily James (Cinderella) to be particularly good, and Derek Jacobi (the King) at his usual high level. I don't know that anyone could have done much with the role of the Prince. Helena Bonham Carter was fun as the Fairy Godmother, but I kept wondering why they had made up her beautiful face the way they did. Her eyes were surrounded by darkness. If that was supposed to tell us something negative about her character, I missed it.If you grew up with the Disney animated movie from the 1950s, you may feel certain things to be lacking here. The mice, for example, who had real personalities and were captivating in the animated version - remember when they help Cinderella sew? - make no impression here. Perhaps they should have been rethought to be more animated and less real.I was also disappointed with Cinderella's ball gown scene. At one point she descends the stairs wearing her mother's pink ball gown, a simpler affair than the ugly creations being worn by her two step-sisters. Still, she is truly beautiful in it, and I assure you that she would have caught the eye, the heart, and perhaps other parts of the anatomy of every man at the ball, young and old. Yet later, when it has been torn and Cinderella asks her Fairy Godmother to fix it so that she can go to the ball in it, FG completely transforms it into a blue monster that will later cause Cinderella trouble when she is fleeing the palace before midnight. To me, that was an unnecessary intrusion of just the sort of emphasis on expensive fashion that young girls do not need to have re-enforced in their already too-commercialized lives. Cinderella was truly beautiful in the simple but still elegant pink gown, and it had sentimental meaning for her. Why did that have to be replaced by something that would cost a fortune? When she appears at the ball, subsequently, she catches all eyes, certainly - with a dress that big and that brightly colored, how could she not have? But trust me, even in her mother's simpler pink dress she still would have caught every man's eye as she stood at the top of those stairs and then, very gracefully, descended them. In a movie that is, I am sure, going to be commercialized like crazy for young girls - as the animated version was when I was a kid - that was an element that could have been avoided.As I said, I'll be curious to see how this does at the box office, and then down the road. Lily James is beautiful as Cinderella, and really captures the right spirit. Many of the scenes look very beautiful. But, with the exception of the transformation scenes regarding the very beautiful carriage, I don't know that there's really a lot of magic in this movie.",Cinderella
67,Movie-ManDan,"The Best Live-Action Movie Disney Has Released In Many, Many Years!",10,15 March 2015,"This is the first live-action feature film of Cinderella in over 100 years. There have been loose adaptations like Ever After and A Cinderella Story, but this is adapted at the fullest. Kenneth Branagh is one of the most talented people in all of show business and he directs his finest looking film to date. His best ever? Maybe, but it certainly is a contender.First and foremost, this is suitable for all ages and genders. Close-minded young boys probably would not like this as they do not understand what makes a good movie.Everybody knows the story of Cinderella. But Kenneth Branagh makes it more wonderful than anybody can imagine. While everybody knows the story, he provides a sold backstory of how Cinderella wound up with her stepmother (Blanchett) and fills in any gaps that made people wanting more. The first little bit of her with her parents is so heartwarming and inspiring. It filled my eyes with tears a little bit too. When she gets with her stepmother and stepsisters, sympathy rises. But the scenery, set, and costumes are so well done that it doesn't really depress anybody. When her fairy godmother arrives and transforms everything and she goes to the ball, that whole chunk is mind-blowing. Everything, from the music to the effects are so spellbinding. Take this chunk alone and think about all it took to bring it to life. I tried hard not to cry in this bit. After the ball is when the story starts to decline: the spell wears off, Cinderella loses her shoe and she it back to being a mistreated servant. I think that lots of stories around this time had their climaxes in the middle like Shakespeare. But because the ball bit was so good, the effect it has on you stays until the end. I honestly have no idea how Branagh made this movie look so gorgeous. And he does it in such a way that does not upstage the stars. When there's a bit of serious acting that is needed to see, he dismisses anything distracting. It's still wonderful, but not distracting. The only bit of criticism that I could think of would be the acting. Blanchett does a fabulous job as the wicked stepmother, I was just thinking there could be star-making performances and great acting. This is the kind of acting that is allowed in movies like this. There's certainly no bits of bad acting, it is just right.This is not just the best live-action Disney movie I've ever seen, it is one of the best movies I've seen in general.4/4",Cinderella
68,rannynm,Truly a Masterpiece,10,18 September 2015,"Disney's Cinderella, directed by Kenneth Branagh is fantastic! Now available on DVD/Blu-ray/Digital, this movie is about a girl named Ella (Lily James) who ends up living with her stepmother (Cate Blanchet) and stepsisters (Sophia McShera and Holliday Grainger). Ella is treated like a servant until one night when the prince holds a ball that changes her life. Ella is a kind and courageous girl who cares about everyone and everything. One of her mother's sayings was, ""have courage and be kind."" This is a good message to use in life. I think Ella as a character is a good role model. She stands up for what she believes in and is always very kind. This film is very detailed and precious. The costumes in Cinderella are amazing and breath-taking. All the costumes were very stylish and fit the time period. Every sparkle, seam and ruffle on every costume were perfectly in place. Ella's ball gown is spectacular and has very vibrant colors. In general, all the colors in the sets and costumes light up the film.All the actors played their parts perfectly. They are so into their characters that they seem real. The actors fit together as a cast like family which helps make the whole film more believable. My favorite character is the Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter). She is so funny and has a bubbly personality. She really looks and acts like a Fairy Godmother. All the special effects seem real. In one scene, a pumpkin turns into a carriage and it looks like magic. The DVD of this movie includes some cool bonus features. One of the bonus features is Frozen Fever, a Frozen short (based on the feature film Frozen). In this film, it's Anna's birthday and Elsa helps out. Another feature is Ella's furry friends. This feature is about working with all the animals in the movie. Also there's a bonus feature about the ballroom scene which made me realize how much work they put into these scenes. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars for all of its incredible sets, details and costumes. I recommend it for ages 3 to 19 because this film would appeal to all ages but, there is a lizard guy who is weird and a little creepy that younger kids might not enjoy so much. Cinderella truly is spectacular and now it's available on DVD/Blue- Ray/Digital. Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Cinderella
69,Kamurai25,"""The Gingers Three: Evil in the Kingdom""",6,9 September 2020,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.I'm honestly concerned that this isn't a movie that anyone is going to watch again and again, but it's a solid watch, and a definite improvement over the 1950 animated classic, though I can't say this touches ""Ever After"" for me.The original story was somewhat lacking, but had fantastic animation for the time, along with voice acting and writing parallel with the movies of its time. I'm somewhat sad to say that is a fair difference in quality compared to modern standards.Disney very much kept this dumbed down for younger audiences, and I expect them to have more fun with scenes like ""lizard footman eats a fly"", but in the very least they steered away from realistic cg talking animals (a creepy factor in many of the live action remakes), though they do make a very specific nod to it at the beginning of the movie.While I do think they managed to improve on almost ever facet of the original, it certainly isn't without flaws.The casting is all over the place, which, I'm sure, affected the odd character development. Oddly, the less important characters, the men, in this case, are fine, I really have zero to say other than I rather like Nonso Anozie in anything he's in, and I did think the bit about ""Kit"" was a rather inspired thing.I understand that Kate Winslet has had a villainous kick the past few years, and she plays ""stuck up snoot"" very well, but seeing Helena Bonham Carter come in to give us ""the fairy godmother who ain't got time for dat"" really makes me wonder if they just weren't paying her enough to care. It would have made more sense to let Winslet elevate the fairy godmother (one of the only things that really wasn't) and let Carter goes Bellatrix Lestrange as the Wicked Stepmother.Sophie McShera did a marvelous job of making me hate her character, and Holliday Grainger kept making me see Katherine Heigl if we could keep her away from tanning beds, so they both did a marvelous job as wicked stepsisters (honestly, probably the best performances of the movie).For some reason though, they made a very strange decision to make all the wicked women gingers, though not with a very convincing dye job. I don't know if it was supposed to be representative of their tacky fashion and the ability to dye hair at the time, or if Disney really thinks gingers don't have a soul, but it was a blaring message, if illegible.What makes me think that they don't care at all is Lily James. She's lovely, she did a good job with the role as written, and I'm dying to see her in anything else to see if any of the oddities were her, or she's done just as good as Winslet with the roles they were given.Cinderella is traditionally a ""fairest in the land"" look, given that it's the middle of Europe, I imagine northern was exotic once upon a time, or at least certain people thought so she is traditionally very blonde and very fair. Lily James is neither (in this, despite some of the posters), so I thought they were taking a more Germanic look with a more honey colored hair....but it is also very oddly colored, and perhaps we wouldn't have notice if it wasn't for her very prominent BLACK eyebrows (which I have nothing against, I actually think they're lovely) which would have been simple enough to die to match. Alternatively they could have abandoned blonde altogether (plenty of versions do). It is just very odd to spend millions of dollars to do something purposefully (and repetitively) to make it look like they don't care and objectively make their movie worse.Overall, it's this sort of attitude that seeps into the movie at different points. It could have been a masterpiece, but instead, everyone knows it's a guaranteed paycheck on the title alone and made something that ends up being rather average despite itself.",Cinderella
70,bkrauser-81-311064,A Marketing Ploy But Don't Tell Your Young Daughters Yet,7,16 August 2016,"It's a tale as old as time, and song as old as rhyme (oops wrong movie). A beautiful woman falls for a charming prince and thanks to a little luck, a few friends, a dollop of magic and a lot of charm, the two live happily ever after. We all know the story, we all know the stakes and we all know the characters not to mention how this classic fairy-tale ends. The question then becomes is this adaptation really necessary?On the face of it no it doesn't. This new adaptation of Disney's watered down European folk tale is by all accounts, little more than an attempt to rake in nostalgia dollars while continuing to increase brand recognition. It's a marketing ploy meant to weave Disney's version of whimsy into the generations by getting daughter, mother and grandmother to appreciate the same story at the exact same time for the exact same reason. Yet despite of the obvious pandering, despite the little to no risk the story is imbued with and regardless on how formal the film is as to resemble an embalmed corpse, Cinderella is not without its charm.Much of that charm is put on the capable shoulders of Lily James who plays our lovely lead. Told since the death of her mother (Atwell) to ""be brave and kind, always,"" James keeps the innocence of Cinderella alive with a true purity of soul. She sells this role which under more tepid hands would have come off as milquetoast or worse still, just plain flat. Richard Madden likewise has a certain way about him that is sympathetic enough to convince the adults in the room while being transparent enough for children to understand his character.Oddly enough if there are sour apples in the bunch it's the veteran actresses, Helena Bonham Carter and buxom mistress of waspishness Cate Blanchett. As the fairy godmother, Carter is trifling and downright annoying at times. Cinderella proves herself on every occasion to be a genuine article saint yet her godmother sees it fit to test her before any magic is to be received. Additionally her rendition of Bippity-Boppity-Bop is Bippity-Boppity-Bad.Blanchett has the opposite problem, she does her character far too much service. She brings a lot of layers and subtext to her character and if she were a wicked stepmother in any other film, her characterization would be award worthy. Yet since this is Cinderella, she's automatically compared to the nearly supernatural nefariousness that was Eleanor Audley's Lady Tremaine. A woman who needed no backstory because she was a force of evil and not some sad aging vamp. Blanchett's stepmother is sympathetic...but does she need to be?There are some other liberties taken with the story but none radical enough to change the tale for better or much worse. If anything the little changes get in the way of what's really important about Cinderella; the costumes. And boy does Cinderella deliver on the period detail with beautiful bodices hemstitched with multi-colored laces and assorted filigree. When together the Prince and Cinderella look like they belong on top of a wedding cake. Young girls with little to no exposure of the 1950 animated Cinderella will be outright astounded by the ballroom beauty of director Kenneth Branagh's sets. That's of course is when they're not giggling with glee over the rapturous magical effects.I'm of two minds when it comes to this film. On the one hand I abhor Disney's need to mine their old properties for glittering pieces of nostalgia then re-purpose them so they can sell it to a new generation while (I suspect) saving money on new Disney World attractions. Yet at a time when family entertainment has become so fragmented and specialized, seeing something everyone can recognize and enjoy in a communion of leg-crossing attentiveness and anticipation isn't all that awful. Plus any little girl not yet made cruel by the realities of life will inevitably idolize Cinderella for who she is and what she represents. And why shouldn't she? She looks good while doing it.",Cinderella
71,quincytheodore,"Whimsically gorgeous, cleverly written and brilliantly acted, Cinderella shines beyond midnight",8,17 March 2015,"I'll admit that this jolly vanilla stuff isn't my cup of tea, and everyone practically has read the script already, but holy fairy godmother Cinderella is fantastic. Acting and visual are stellar, they reach the magical effect intended, and also a touch of humility. It literally dazzles with sheer production value until you can't help but feeling that warm fuzzy sensation of Disney magic.Cinderella (Lily James) is a poor orphan who is enslaved by her evil stepmother (Cate Blanchett). We all know this already, the movie has a task to just retell the story consistently. Thankfully, the great line of actors does that admirably well. There will be a certain expectation on how the characters behave. For the main pair, Lily James and her prince (Richard Madden) look fitting.She has innocent ambiance, albeit slightly passive on her trial. It's a less empowering female, especially after Frozen and Maleficent, Ronda Rousey wouldn't have this problem. However, it stays true to its root and if you want someone to look likable and good in blue dress, Lily James fits the bill. Richard Madden delivers a light persona as it's his duty to be charming, he does it so well I didn't realize he's the same guy from a more harrowing ball of Game of Thrones.The best has to be Cate Blanchett as the stepmother, she's cunningly annoying. She's a mix between complaining soccer mom and supervillain, basically the most PG portrayal of antagonist to invoke loathing from audience but not till the point of giving them nightmare. Helena Botham Carter as Fairy Godmother is a rather predictable cast. I didn't follow the movie's hype, but when the character appeared, I thought that Helena Carter would be appropriate. Then there she was, magic.Script is fancy and suave, but it's also not over reaching. The dialogues are engaging as they are delivered with confident, they sound very poise and high class without being too cheesy. Production value and costume are downright mythical, it seems that Cinderella wants gold statues for the wedding and seeing how majestic everyone and everything look, it may just grasp the rewards for next year.Cinderella's biggest magic is its universal charm. A children fairy tale that is uplifting and enjoyable for all ages, that's what matters most.",Cinderella
72,mike48128,A timeworn twice-told tale. I almost fell asleep.,8,15 August 2017,"Disappointing. A forgettable musical score. Even the oddly cast Disney multi-cultural video is superior. As much as I like that production, I believe that ""Cinderella"" has to be a fair-haired blue-eyed blonde! Other actors can be anything they wish! Good performances by all in this 2015 ""remake"" so I can't quite figure out just what's missing here. Walt Disney used to call it ""heart"". As a ""film"" collector, I have both versions of ""R&H Cinderella"" (which are both videos), Disney's animated classic, and ""Ever After"" with Drew Barrymore. Plus, I have seen ""The Slipper and the Rose"" as well. (It's also excellent, but it's a bit too operatic, with ballet dancing, for kids.) Here, both her mom and dad die, mercifully, ""off camera"". The most redeeming quality is the great over-the-top Fairy Godmother pumpkin coach and animal transformations (and after Midnight un-transformation). Where is my ""Bibbity-Bobity-Boo"" song? Yes, the chattering mice, lizards and goose are too cute and very well done. There is just not as much surprise here, as the Prince remembers meeting her in the forest and therefore shouldn't have had that much trouble finding her? The new Beauty and the Beast movie (2016) is just so much more captivating and ""alive"". At least there is no ""chunky"" Fairy Godmother here. Whitney Huston could barely squeeze into her costume, so many years ago!",Cinderella
73,JLRMovieReviews,"Disney, Leave Cinderella Alone!!",2,2 February 2016,"Cate Blanchett is the mean stepmother in this new ""Cinderella."" In fact, she is the best thing. I thought just about everything Disney touched turned to gold, but this was a major disappointment in all departments. The leads for Cinderella and particularly Prince Charming were perfectly dreadful with no screen presence or chemistry together and their characters were extremely dull. You never are brought to care about them, despite the fact Cinderella's father and mother are gone soon after the movie begins. I was very disappointed in this and I am surprised to see it so popular on here. Or am I? I do see that some people have trashed it. I usually don't read other reviews, but, when I don't like a movie, I look to see if others feel the same. Some say that even their children didn't like it – very discerning and wise people they will be. If you want to see Cinderella, there are several versions to pick from, the original animated one, the Julie Andrews film, the Lesley Ann Warren film, and ""The Slipper and the Rose."" There are probably more, but none can top those four – EVER. Don't watch this one! You've been warned. (2/10 for Cate, though.)",Cinderella
74,Sergeant_Tibbs,Pretty wallpaper.,6,14 September 2015,"I've never been a fan of the story of Cinderella, including Disney's supposed classic. Nor have I liked Kenneth Branagh as a director, especially during this for-hire decade he's having. So I guess I'm pleasantly surprised I didn't hate this new live-action version. But there's little to like about it either. Instead, it's just bland, but it's admittedly pretty wallpaper at the very least. If it has anything going for it, you can't deny the work gone into the costume and production design, which is certainly an improvement over other 'rebooted' Disney films like Oz the Great and Powerful and Alice in Wonderland. Branagh frames it well for the most part too. However, it seems a little pointless to update the story to live-action when it mostly boasts over-elaborate CGI effects, to the point where some of it may as well be something like Gravity where half of it is made on a computer. I guess that's updating the animation in a way. The film strolls along the story beats as expected, but it's just such an unthought-provoking tale anyway that I can't begin to care. I did like the origin story aspect of it at the prologue though, I think that did a better job at establishing some sympathy than the 1950 animation. Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter inject a small and necessary amount of energy into the film that its leads desperately lack. As a result, this hits the middle-of-the-road square in the centre.6/10",Cinderella
75,valadas,Wonderful,8,9 April 2015,"Kenneth Branagh has succeeded in turning an old fairy tale into an almost classic romantic love movie though respecting the main well known details of the tale story such as the ill treatment of Cinderella by her stepmother and stepsisters, her meeting with the Godmother Fairy and the magic deeds that follow, her coming to the ball in the palace, the scenes of the glass shoe and the happy end.

That is until she meets the Prince Played by Richard Madden. The film does have the time period right as well as good outdoor scenes. Lily's performance as Cinderella makes you feel pain and pity for herCate's performance as the Step Mother is just cruel and heartless.The production designs for the film are stunning to say the least.

77,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,I actually really enjoyed this movie.,8,29 March 2017,"Sure it's still got some of the dated gooey-ness of the original movie, sure Shrek's impact on savaging the Disney/fairy-tale formula can still be felt years after release, but Cinderella is a beautifully directed and cinematographed; and Kenneth Branagh did this? Why do films like this exist in today's industry? Well franchising for one thing, and even though films like this are basically products in Disney's pipeline it CAN be well done given that the movie's got a determined director at the helm. And oddly, Branagh, the guy who directed films such as 1996's Hamlet, was just the guy to make Cinderella into a watchable film. It's pretty, has a good cast and has some nice tid-bits of humor here and there. And it's an update on the whole Disney-esque 'happily ever after' thing. Yes the story's the same but it gives some much-needed chemistry to Cinderella's and 'The Prince''s romantic charm. And... it works.You don't need to be a girl or a gay to like this film; just see it for what it is: a harmless remake of an animation from the 1950s.",Cinderella
78,RforFilm,Cinderella looks gorgeous and boasts a great cast. It's the Disney crowd pleaser you expect,7,14 March 2015,"I'll be honest; Cinderella has never been a favorite fairy tale of mine. I certainly have respect for the story as it has spawned many variations and adaptations, but within my eyes, it doesn't do anything for me. It's probably the inner boy talking, but I simply find the material a little too girly. There's only so much pretty dress and magical prince dreams I can take. Some could say the same thing about The Little Mermaid, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Beauty and the Beast. While they all have similar notions of women wanting something more out of their ordinary lives and want a man, those stories had something for the guys to get attached to. The most well known adaptation of Cinderella is the Disney animated movie from the fifties. I'll admit that I had a videotape of it when I was little and probably watched it a couple of times. Who can blame parents for letting their kids watch it as the movie is cute. The little mice, the songs and the animation are fantastic, as expected from the Disney Company. I expected much of the same in Disney's new live action Cinderella. If you've heard the Cinderella story as a child, it's pretty much the same here. A young girl Ella lives with her loving family, who is always told by her mother that she has more kindness in her fingers then anyone has in their whole body. She passes away, but manages to grow into a beautiful young lady (played by Lilly James) and have fine times with her father, a wealthy merchant. Felling an emptiness in the home, he marries a fellow widow, Lady Tremaine (played by Cate Blanchett) and she and her two daughters, Anastasia and Drizella, move in immediately. He makes a trip to another kingdom, but dies from some illness, where Tremaine reveals her darker colors, leaving Ella to do the chores and be their personal slave. Like the animated movie, Ella makes friends with the mice that live in the walls (they don't talk in this version). She first encounters the Prince ""Kit"" Charming (played by Richard Madden) in the forest, without her knowing of his royalty. He's under pressure to marry a princess to expand the kingdom, though he convincing the dying king to hold a ball so that everyone may have a chance. The Ball is set and Cinderella receives a fairy godmother (played by Helena Bonham Carter), get's a magical makeover, goes to the ball, and you already know the rest.Now that Disney has made Tangled and Frozen, something like Cinderella might seem passé and old fashioned, considering that more recent fairy tales have been more progressive and feminist-like. Director Kenneth Branagh had an interesting challenge to rewrite the story for a more modern audience. The first advantage of this director is that Cinderella just looks great. I love the art direction, costumes, make up, and general look of the film. It all has the grand design the matches the classic animated movie. I'll be surprised if an Oscar nomination is not given to this team. Cinderella also has the advantage of being well casted. Lilly James is sweet and good looking (but not too pretty) as our heroine. The movie certainly gives her character plenty of patience and kindness, though not much is updated with her personality. I think more have been done with that. It's similar with the prince. He's casted well and they try to work in more political ideas, but the movie continues to snap back into the classic fairy tale. Not that it's bad, as it gives the typical Disney audience a well-done fairy tale character. He' just not updated as much as they could have.Cate Blanchett is just perfect as Lady Tremaine. Already a good character in animated format, Blanchett gives the character more of a shielded elegance that would prevent most people from seeing the character's darker nature. I love the more psychological manipulation that's a part of her, not just giving control of poor Cinderella, but of the people around her. Even the Stepsisters, though goofy, are more sympathetic as it's made clear that their mother has warped their minds. I'll give this seven glass slippers out of ten. On the whole, I did like the movie enough to recommend just based on the movie's design. This is the kind of film world that people want to escape from. There's a lot of effort to put in a more revisionist take on the classic fairy tale. I just wished it could have push more forward.",Cinderella

80,natashabowiepinky,The best part? NO SONGS! HURRAY!!,7,30 May 2015,"After the success of Maleficent, which was basically a reboot of Sleeping Beauty told from the perspective of the villainess, (But this time making her a MUCH more sympathetic character). Disney returns to their well of classic fairy tales again for inspiration (Read: Money) and... Oh, look what's popped up... Cinderella!! Why bother putting together a new and unique screenplay, when you can just take an old animation, and spruce it up for a live-action remake?! GENIUS!!Unlike Maleficent, this is a far more straightforward adaptation of the original... the movie stays with Cinders all the way (aside from the occasional foray into the royal castle), and it starts and ends just as you'd expect from a 'Happily Ever After' bedtime story. The Fairy Godmother is a tad more dotty and brusque than before, the various animals that turn into the coach, horses, footmen, etc are loving rendered using CGI special effects and there are a few black faces scattered about to provide a more eclectic cast.What else can I add? I thoroughly enjoyed it. Lily James makes for a beautiful and charming heroine, Cate Blanchett hams it up marvelously as the truly wicked Lady Tremaine (I mean, she walks with her cat on a LEASH!! Unforgivable) and Helena Bonham provides a memorable yet short cameo and the wacky Godmother herself. Sometimes, you don't need bells and whistles to make an already appealing story better. What Kenneth Branagh has done is let the material speak for itself... Adding some modern twists here and there, but never enough to make them intrusive on the central drama.So, despite my earlier misgivings, maybe there IS something to said for this recycling-an-old-animation-into-a-flesh-and-blood-version malarkey. Can we have Dumbo next, please? There may not be a Handsome Prince in that particular cartoon, but I can think of a Not-So-Handsome Prince who'd be PERFECT for the lead role. QUICK Disney...

After Ella's Father(Ben Chaplin) suddenly passes away, Cinderella(Lily James) is in the custody of her twisted & conniving Stepmother(Cate Blanchett) & her witless stepsisters, Drisella(Sophie McShera) & Anastasia(Holliday Grainger). Lady Tremaine, Drisella & Anastasia treat Cinderella like a servant & mistreat her everyday. However, Cinderella never loses heart. She always keeps her mother's(Hayley Atwell) advice in mind. ""Always have courage & be kind"". Eventually, Cinderella's luck begins to change when she meets a handsome stranger in the woods. What Cinderella doesn't know is that this stranger happens to be the Prince(Richard Madden). Cinderella is a beautiful & incredible movie. This movie captures the essence of Cinderella(1950) & improves upon it. The special effects are marvelous. All the key scenes from the 1950 animated film have been recreated flawlessly. I particularly loved the transformation scene. The locales are exotic. What's even more amazing is that most of the scenes were shot in actual locations in England & not sets. The ballroom dance is also very magical. I liked the fact that the movie is not a musical & doesn't go down the same road as the animated movie. There are a few minor changes in the story which I enjoyed. Though this movie is pretty much faultless, I would have enjoyed it much more if I was completely unfamiliar with Cinderella. However, since Cinderella is such a popular fairy tale, my complaint is irrational. Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Cinderella is a welcome addition to the numerous adaptations of the story of Cinderella. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Stepmother Lady Tremaine. Blanchett thankfully doesn't portray the evil stepmother as an over the top baddie but, makes sure that the audience sympathizes with her from time to time. Lily James is perfect as Cinderella. James exudes innocence, warmth & grace as the title character. Richard Madden is spectacular as Prince Kit. Madden proves that his acting range is vast & he can play all kinds of roles & not just the brooding Robb Stark from Game of Thrones. Helena Bonham Carter is good as the Fairy Godmother. Nonso Anozie is impressive as the Captain. Stellan Skarsgard is great as the Grand Duke. Sophie McShera & Holliday Grainger are hilarious as Drisella & Anastasia. Derek Jacobi is super as the King. Ben Chaplin & Hayley Atwell are awesome as Ella's Father & Ella's Mother respectively. Cinderella is a must watch for people of all ages who believe that dreams really do come true.",Cinderella
82,rbrb,Man in Tights(very) meets the Pigeon Sisters(in drag),8,17 March 2015,"On one level this movie is so camp it deserves to be named gay film of the year. No straight man wears such revealing white tights showing his manhood as does the ""Prince"" in this picture. Seems to me the real agenda is to portray the lead as a closeted gay seeking to satisfy his dying father that he will actually marry a girl and keep the royal succession going. He cannot reveal his true sexuality for the sake of the throne as he obviously has a thing with the big burly black uniformed captain, who is also outrageous in uniform. As to the ugly sisters, well they have great pretensions as drag queens but that is the nearest they will get to being royalty.Now of course I viewed and reviewed this film from a gay perspective, but it is equally viewable as a sort of traditional telling of this fairy story, hence suitable for children too.In brief the tale is about a poor abused girl who through magic does get to the ball to meet her Prince Charming, but later the evil step mother and clan do everything they can to deny Cinderella the glass slipper......I thought the sets and special effects were excellent and the picture as a whole does enough to keep whoever sees it well entertained.7 and a half out of 10, rounded up,so,8/10.",Cinderella

That by the way means that we are here spared such hideous touches present in earlier versions as Ugly Sisters seeking to remove digits in order make the glass slipper fit, and so on.Indeed, here Cate Blanchett's portrayal of the Stepmother is delicious without being extremely malicious, while the sisters - also well-portrayed (by Sophie McShera and Holliday Grainger) - regularly become more figures of fun than evil; selfish and pushy as they may be. They're not THAT ugly either!The film is then ""safe"" for children in these respects - no ""Shock-Headed Peter"" this! Indeed, we seem to have more of Ruritania here than either classical Greek, sophisticated French or at-times cruel German cultural influences (these being the three apparent historical sources of what is a well-loved if now much-constrained tale).However, given British filming locations, Brit Director Sir Kenneth Branagh and a largely Brit-cast from Sir Derek Jacobi through to Richard Madden and Helena Bonham-Carter, to say nothing of Lily James in the starring role, one might detect a suffusion of Britishness here, though rather little of any more raucous pantomime tradition. Nevertheless, Jacobi and Bonham-Carter, and indeed Nonso Anozie in a very sympathetic role as Captain of the Guard, offer regular episodes of tongue-in-cheek British humour, while not letting the gravitas go - a fine line tread successfully, then, and one that attests to the fact that these are great or gifted actors fun to see in these roles - as of course are Blanchett, and indeed Stellan Starsgard in a slimy ""Grand Duke"" part...The question already being answered by the above concerns the amount of fun adults are going to get out of this film, as and when they accompany their kids. And the main answer is ""quite a bit"". Naturally, Lily James herself is highly eyecatching in the role, and indeed the actress's slightly unsophisticated beauty fits the bill perfectly. Possibly-correct and well-known criticisms about the actress's somewhat Barbie-minus, corset-induced waistline (which had James herself and Director Branagh fending off attacks) seem somewhat suitable for being played down in the overall context of the film. There is plenty else to look at in these scenes and deft parents should perhaps be ready to deflect on to them, should the need arise. But anorexic it isn't!The romance is a step away from soppy, but it keeps that correct distance, and can indeed look touching or inspiring for those willing to be ""young at heart"". Likewise, the way (Cinder)Ella is portrayed as the epitome of all goodness might easily have looked ridiculous and jarring - not least when set against the world-weary meanness of the Stepmother and others - but this is not so, and all credit to James for that. She is to convey a supremely nice and good person, and this she does. Whether that actually leaves the portrayal more rather than less erotically charged is one for watching dads and elder brothers to ponder in their own minds, but the overall effect would seem to be to keep the story moving forward pleasantly and warmly enough for all concerned.Innovations may be in somewhat short supply here, but the design often looks sumptuous, and the lizards-into-coachmen and mice-into-horses transformation scenes are fun enough.Somewhere inside we are all kids at heart, and Branagh's Cinderella will have most watching adults recognise that fact, while never abandoning entirely a more adult take on the film that also brings its own rewards. For me, it's a winner.",Cinderella
87,silvermistvio,Disney's Cinderella live action turned into something unwatchable.,1,10 May 2019,"Cinderella is indeed one of my favourites when I was a kid and it still is. But when they make live action, it becomes very bad. Compared to the animation, live action is really really bad. This film might be a good one for the others, but for me, it's kind of unwatchable. There are a lot of things I don't like.First, Cinderella is beautiful and warm. But the actress from the live action is not. They should choose the other actress. If they did, I think the film might be better. Second is the performance. I noticed that the acting is really bad, especially the leading role, Cinderella. When she was acting she's excited, it's kind of the worst acting I've ever seen. I really hate that acting.Thirdly, the dress. The costume designer is the worst in the whole film. Cinderella's blue dress which is supposed to be Fairy godmother created. I mean the one who created that dress is fairy godmother. So, the dress should be the most beautiful dress. But that blue dress is very ugly. I can't believe that dress is made by fairy godmother. And also fairy godmother's dress is also very very ugly too. They should have put more efforts to the costumes.Changing of the story is acceptable, so, I don't comment on it. So, as for conclusion, I really had high hope for Cinderella Live Action film, but all I got was disappointment. Moreover, it is one of the worst films I've ever watched.",Cinderella
88,bryank-04844,"'Cinderella', just find the original classic cartoon and enjoy that version, because this live-action one is not worth the time or money.",2,12 August 2015,"I'm not sure why Disney is hell-bent on remaking all of their classic animated films into live-action reboots, but that seems to be the case nowadays. With 'Snow White and The Huntsman' to 'Maleficent' and now with 'Cinderella', Disney is banking on popular movie stars to re-energize their classic titles. The problem is that these are not any good. While there is probably a built in audience already and new generations are now getting to see these old tales, it might be financially viable to think about rebooting these franchises. But in order to do that, you must make something that is quality, which none of these are.In fact, I thought Disney was the leader in re-releasing movies as they were over time. Why haven't they just re-released the originals for the younger generations to see and enjoy instead of making terrible live-action films that people forget in less time it takes to make a peanut butter and chocolate cake sandwich. Cinderella is just as bad if not worse than the prior two films that came before it and I'll tell you why. Before that unfortunate business, there were a couple of decent aspects to this film that was directed by Kenneth Branagh himself and written by Chris Weitz (the guy who directed 'American Pie').Besides the visual style of the film, which is gorgeous, colorful, and fun, and of course the immaculate costumes that went in to the final film (which will win some kind of award in the future, I'm sure), it's the tone of the film that's different here. If you saw 'Maleficent' or 'Snow White and the Huntsman', there was a darker and much sinister tone to those classic tales of Disney. It's a trend nowadays that we see everywhere from the Marvel universe to the 'Star Trek' films. Everything is in darkness or supposed to be brooding like an angry a hipster who found out too late that their Starbuck's coffee has been sabotaged.Branagh flipped the tone on its ear and pretty much stuck to the animated classic film's tone with really no ounce of darkness or brooding to be seen. It was a nice treat. That being said, seeing the 'Cinderella' story in live-action mode, made me think that there really was no interesting story in 'Cinderella' to begin with. Literally nothing happens besides a young girl going to dance at some fancy house, leaving her clothes on the front lawn, and some dude returning those clothes, then marrying her. That really sums up the 'Cinderella' story.Sure, there is a stepmother and her two daughters who can be a trio of jerks to 'Cinderella', but it's nothing that that a few cheese-eating mice can't take care of. It really is a boring film, where I found myself trying to find anything decent about the movie. One of the better scenes in the classic animated film was when the fairy god mother came down upon Cinderella with her magic wand and turned normal household rodents and objects into fun things that were useful, like a giant pumpkin car. Well, here in this live action version, Helena Bonham Carter (Tim Burton's former beard and Johnny Depp look-a-like), played the fairy god mother. Carter completely ripped off Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka character and input that into the fairy god mother. So instead of some hip grandma who grant wishes, we get a dimwitted angel like creature who got lost on the way to heaven with the IQ of a door knob. Just terrible. How could Kenneth Branagh, the guy who made 'Hamlet' awesome allow something like this?Then you have Lily James playing the iconic character who does a decent enough job, but is no where near memorable. And Richard Madden plays the prince, which just makes you angry that he's no longer in 'Game of Thrones' anymore and probably owed someone a favor for this. The only real spotlight is solely for Cate Blanchett, who plays a great evil stepmother. Everything from her body language, emotions, and dialogue completely sells her character to a tee. I wanted to like this movie, but just couldn't. If you find yourself looking to watch 'Cinderella', just find the original classic cartoon and enjoy that version, because this live-action one is not worth the time or money.",Cinderella
89,griffolyon12,"Movie Review: ""Cinderella""",10,14 March 2015,"Sometimes it's just nice to see a movie where you know what's going to happen and that level of comfort allows you to just enjoy the ride and not worry about anything else. That is exactly what Disney's new live action Cinderella does. There are no major changes to the story: Cinderella (the extremely likable Lily James) still lives with her evil stepmother (played deliciously by Cate Blanchett) and her two stepsisters (Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera), who do not allow her to go the ball. Alas, in steps Cinderella's Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter), who grants Cinderella with a pumpkin carriage and a ball gown with two glass slippers so that she can meet Prince Charming (handsomely played by Richard Madden). It's a simple story, told in a very grand fashion visually, but never overturning the story to meet a more modern viewpoint, which is a breath of fresh air in this time of revisionist fairy tales.Director Kenneth Branagh really keeps the story simple and yet opulent at the same time thanks to the amazing team of behind the scenes wizards at his disposal. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography, the music, it's all exceptional, and it is that ability to unite great talents under one person's purview that makes Branagh a desirable director for these Hollywood studios. However, the true star of Cinderella is screenwriter Chris Weitz. Weitz's script is the glue that holds the film together and makes it work, because in our jaded modern age, it would have been easy to have tried to flip the story around and make it to where Cinderella doesn't need the Prince to save her, etc. and so forth. What Weitz does is rather stick to the traditional story and finds the human justifications as to why these characters act and feel the way that they do. Even the evil stepmother has motivation, and so does Cinderella, for why she has not ever runaway from home. The idea that Cinderella lives looking at the world not as it is, but as it could be through courage and kindness, makes her a strong character internally. Weitz also makes Prince Charming a character beyond simple good looks and charm, which is something that a lot of fairy tale films have always struggled with, even the good ones. I especially like the way that he shows Cinderella changing Prince Charming's world view through her kindness, making him a stronger man. Of course, a screenplay would be nothing if it weren't for the actors.What allows this film to really connect is that you actually like Lily James as Cinderella and Richard Madden as Prince Charming. It is hard for actors to sell love at first sight, and their chemistry is wonderfully adorable, allowing you root for the two of them to be together forever. It is in the simplistic ideas of true love, kindness, and courage in even the smaller moments of life, that makes these fairy tales still so enjoyable and life affirming centuries after they were first told. Anyone with a heart and some optimism can be swept away by this film if they just tear down those stone walls of cynicism within and let it.",Cinderella

92,meydiana-65242,Best remakes,10,18 October 2020,"A quite beautiful adaptation of a Disney classic
Right now Disney's current trend with their live-action films has been a series of live-action re-imaginings of their animated classics. Obviously this has proved to be a rather polarizing tactic amongst certain fans, namely because they believe that these are intended to replace the original films. Well I can assure you that this ain't the intention. You see the internet has this mentality about remakes that they're supposed to replace the original when that's not the case. Hell, even if they don't end up being very good, the original is not tainted in any way. And that's been the case with Disney's live- action remakes, even the ones that haven't been well-received like the 'Alice' films and 'Maleficent'.'Cinderella', however, was the first of these remakes to actually be well-received by critics and rightfully so as it truly is a beautiful new adaptation of the story that Disney first told in their 1950 animated classic. The original 'Cinderella' is easily one of my all-time favorites when it comes to Disney's animated films so I was really excited to see this new version and I absolutely loved it. Sure it's basically just the same story as the original but it manages to update it by doing some things better than the original. Namely, the relationship between Ella and the Prince in this version is much more developed compared to the original where they immediately fall in love and only share a few scenes together. Lily James is absolutely fantastic in the role of Ella while Richard Madden proves to be, for lack of a better term, a very charming Prince Charming. Of course the rest of the cast is fantastic as well, from Cate Blanchett's excellent take on Lady Tremaine to Helena Bonham Carter's scene-stealing turn as the Fairy Godmother.But like the original, the film has gotten some flak from feminists over its title character, Cinderella. The argument is that the character is too passive of a protagonist who only sits around waiting to be rescued. Now this is an argument I've never really agreed with. Sure Cinderella doesn't really do as much compared to some future Disney princesses but there's more to her than that. She really deserves the credit. She gets thrown her way by her evil stepmother and stepsisters. The film very much maintains the theme of encouraging people to 'have courage and be kind'. And let's face it folks... those are good words to live by in today's age.Like I said before, these Disney remakes aren't replacing the originals. They're just here to serve as interesting new takes on their original source material. And as much I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this by those who are opposed to the remakes... I think this new Cinderella is better than the original. Don't get me wrong the original is still an animated masterpiece but as a whole I feel that Kenneth Branagh delivered a fantastic adaptation that both reflects the original while also being its own thing.",Cinderella
93,Laakbaar,"""To be seen as we truly are is the greatest risk we will ever take""",7,19 April 2015,"This is one of those movies that gets generally good reviews, but attracts furious downvoting here from a small group of disgruntled haters. Unfortunately, those who like the movie are not upvoting the positive reviews to balance this.I have been known to go to Disney movies, so I thought I'd give this a go. It was the next movie playing.I have to admit I enjoyed it. Well, the second half anyway. It took me a while to get into the movie's world although I suppose that's mostly my fault for not falling within the targeted demographic. My masculine resistance melted away when Cinderella got her dress. Even the old and cynical can do with a dose of enchantment and girliness once in a while.I was impressed at how technically well done this movie was. Much of it was clearly CGI but this re-imagined slightly surrealistic fairy tale world felt worth visiting for a while. It's not animated, but it felt like it was.Traditionalists will love this movie. It is a straight-up cinematic retelling of the Cinderella story. It's the kind of movie we used to see in the 1950s. It's like the last 60 years never happened. It's the kind of movie a movie director would like his daughter to see if he wanted her to believe in traditional values like a girl being swept off her feet by a prince.Girls, there is no prince charming coming to rescue you. Learn to lead your life without this fantasy. If you need rescuing, you need a therapist not a prince. Disney has a difficult task, having to please those of us who don't believe in teaching girls to hope for princely rescue and those of us who do. It's a problem.So, yes, the politics of this movie bothered me. However, there was one line that resonated with me and redeemed the film somewhat: ""To be seen as we truly are is the biggest risk we will ever take."" What a great line to put into this movie. I don't know how they got away with it, because the main story is actually the antithesis of this. ""To be rescued by prince charming, you need a hairy dogfather who is good at transforming you with magical spells and a prince willing to defy his father and possibly shirk his duty.""",Cinderella
94,billygoat1071,Beyond All Magic,8,15 March 2015,"Fairy tale movie adaptations today either retell the story with a darker tone or add a progressive twist. This version of Cinderella makes none of those turns and instead stays faithful, to the animated Disney classic, at least, but still slightly polishes something within the storyline. The 1950's version was straightforward, but made memorable by the songs and the animal characters, this version however brought a different core and establishes more of Cinderella herself. The result is too simple, maybe kind of contrived, but when you focus at the heart of the character, that's where it becomes endearing. The rest of the movie is a good entertainment that also has the stuff you may expect in a Kenneth Branagh movie. It didn't break any grounds, but there is still a lot of charm in this Cinderella.Following the basic storyline would make it feel contrived, it becomes more obvious with a voice-over narrator, but this is an adaptation that takes things easy, anyway. However, there is a strong theme in this narrative, which is centralizing the humbleness of Cinderella. It's all over the place, it features the antagonists as superficial people who don't understand the true value of what they should desire. There's also a clever a parallelism within the love story; the Prince, who was once an obsolete type of romantic figure, is now depicted with the modesty that could match with Cinderella's. These messaging and storytelling may end up looking pretty obvious, but how it embraces this sentiment makes it quite admirable.In another side, the movie is just entertaining, though it really minimizes the antics of the mice and lacks any musical numbers, but nothing goes wrong with those ridiculously hammy scenes with the cruel stepfamily. You may also notice some of the director's trademarks scattered around, like some Shakespearean inspiration at the subplots. The performances, specifically the leading actresses, made it much worth it. Lily James really makes herself feel like a princess, especially when she is dancing with her ballgown, she brings a dashing innocence that is deserving to the character. Cate Blanchette, while the villain is still written as a caricature, gives the evil stepmother some depth and terrifying pizazz.Cinderella isn't really meant to transcend the material, it basically just given the story a different aim and mindset. There is still actual magic in this rework, but the film makes sure that those enchanting spells and other fantasy stuff don't gloss over the real point of this story; seeing more of the humility in the character of Cinderella. Focusing on that intention would make you appreciate this version better, though the old animated film is still an unforgettable classic that this didn't quite capture its own delight, but this Cinderella is clearly making things more fitting for modern viewers, mostly understanding what's more profound in this tale than just having friendly creatures and magical Fairy Godmothers.",Cinderella

No one says the junk like this anymore, but who cares, it belongs in a fairy tale.I was also really put off by the ""PG"" rating. It was ""G"" WHAT in God's name is the MPAA watching that would elicit this? A mean woman? Catty mean step-sisters? Natural death? NOTHING.

96,Rickting,"A very pleasant surprise, even if it won't win Disney many new fans",7,4 March 2016,"Cinderella is a live-action reimagining of the Disney animated movie. The plot is the same; don't go in expecting anything subversive, hilarious or unique because that's not what this is. All this really does is translate the story to live action. Still, what's wrong with that? To my enormous surprise, I found Cinderella to be really charming and rather enjoyable. It's very simple and safe, and follows the Disney formula rigidly. But as a traditional adaptation of the fairy tale, it works. Lily James is endlessly likable in the title role and while Cinderella is a somewhat two-dimensional figure, she manages to give the character personality. Richard Madden as the Prince is similarly limited by a bland character arc, but does fine in the role. The standout is Cate Blanchett as the evil Stepmother, who fills the pantomime villain role wonderfully. Helena Bonham Carter also does a good job as the Fairy Godmother. Kenneth Branagh directs the film well and visually the film is pretty stunning. It's overblown in the best sense of the word, with its dazzling cinematography, brilliant mise-en-scene and vibrant colour palette making it a slightly magical visual treat. While it doesn't take any risks aside from an unexpected and touching scene between the Prince and his father, this update of Cinderella is very likable and is genuinely charming. While this isn't my kind of movie, I genuinely had a nice time watching it. If you're bored of the Disney formula this won't change your mind, but the target audience will absolutely adore it.7/10",Cinderella
97,DareDevilKid,"Not Even a Hint of Magic in Disney's New ""Cinderella""",4,22 June 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.5/5 starsKenneth Branagh, who boasts quite an impressive directorial repertoire, shockingly wields the camera like a quill pen in his latest offering, mannered and dull, seeking Shakespeare where he isn't. You couldn't even begin to imagine how Branagh mishandles ""Cinderella"", so reverent and corny in its approach, so reverent and corny gleeful abandon, a slight swerve from the traditional wouldn't hurt.We obviously can't expect a rollicking fairy tale spoof like ""Enchanted"" or a delectably tangy retelling of Sleeping Beauty's classic yarn from the principal antagonist's perspective (a la ""Maleficient""). No, ""Cinderella"" and her glass slippers or shoes or whatever they are doesn't offer as much scope for innovation as her other fairy princess counterparts. Besides, hers was also the one tale, unlike most other classic fairy tales, that had deep-rooted patriarchal, sexist, and downright questionable themes. With that being said, this ""Cinderella"" is still achingly old-fashioned, with scant humor, a regressive heroine, and a buffoon for a fairy godmother. A darn shame when Branagh and Disney's bosses could have easily tweaked the story without going completely off-course to usher in a new, rational age for Cinderella - the tale does date back to 1697 after all.Branagh's film portrays an outdated Disney princess from a time before Ariel and Belle redefined femininity in enjoyable animated retellings. Plenty of assertive, ambitious women have been drawn since. The trend toward live-action fairy tales gives them even more backbone. So why does Ella, played by poseable starlet Lily James (""Downton Abbey""), need to be this bloodless, submissive, and desperately in need of Prince Charming? Branagh even robs Ella of her singing voice; no dream-wish song for her, or any compositions from the 1950 soundtrack until the end credits.Screenwriter Chris Weitz (""About a Boy"") sticks close to Charles Perrault's 1697 version of the folk tale, which informed Disney's animated 1950 version. Ella is orphaned early, but not before Mother (Hayley Atwell) teaches her to be courageous and kind, and Father (Ben Chaplin) remarries. The rest can't possibly be spoiled by now. None of it will come as a surprise to generations who have grown up on the sugary romanticism of this yarn. Branagh and Weitz don't attempt to bring any major twists or contemporary relevance to the material. An expanded prologue includes segments with a young Cinderella and her biological parents to minimal benefit, and there are the usual lessons about acceptance and kindness, and staying true to yourself, which hardly break the mold.James makes a lovely submissive, always turning the other perfectly sculpted cheek when life slaps her character Ella. She doesn't convey any more depth than a theme park Cinderella welcoming guests. Even the CGI mice sharing her prison loft appear gradually disenchanted. It doesn't seem fair to match an amateurish James' pallid performance against veteran Cate Blanchett's deliciously wicked stepmother, Lady Tremaine. Her steely gaze and venomous line readings are the second-best thing about ""Cinderella"", the first being Sandy Powell's swoony costume designs. The stepsisters' wardrobe, a collection of matching patterns in clashing colors, offers visual comic relief to a movie needing it from anywhere. Indeed, the film's best virtue is its technical polish, complete with colorful sets and extravagant costumes (especially during the lavish ball sequence), along with seamless special effects during the Fairy Godmother transformation scene.Running contrary to its message, the film seems content to fit in rather than stand out from its numerous predecessors on stage and screen. That familiarity renders its wholesome approach somewhat tedious. Perhaps it's missing a little ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.""",Cinderella

I found the Prince bland and uninteresting and the ugly sisters could have been so much more horrible. The only character I really liked was the wicked stepmother brought perfectly to life by Cate Blanchett- she was gorgeous to look at, as always, and really captured the unpleasantness of the character as written. The transformation scene of the vegetables and animals into coach and footmen etc was of a quality that we have come to expect from Disney movies so that was not disappointing.

Now the bad: The movie itself. This was the most boring thing I ever sat through and I think that everyone in the small audience I was in (on discount day) thought the same. Anytime people leave a theater without saying a word it's bad. The dialog was the worst I've ever heard, Lily James is also the worst actress I've ever seen. The saving grace was Derek Jacobi as the King. His relationship with his son was far more interesting than Cinderella's relationship with her entire family. Then there was the endless narration; doesn't Branagh know that the first rule of storytelling is ""Show me, don't tell me"". I guess he forgot in this film. The landscapes were pretty but I got tired of the endless stream of colorful gowns that were way too big on the bottom. Then there was the endless ""message"" of the film.

A chance encounter in the forest will turn her life around - even the meddling of her wicked step-mother cannot stop her destiny.Cinderella is a story that's been re-done over and over again, maybe it's because the story is so good that it's timeless and nobody will never get sick of it, or maybe it's just Disney wanting money and this is they way of getting it. I think I was like everyone else where I first heard about another Cinderella movie then the first teaser trailer came out and I wasn't hooked at all. Until I came across the critics reviews of the movie giving such high and positive ratings that give me a second thought and I give in a watched it anywhere and it turned out...okay but nothing great as people are putting out to be.Lily James did a great job playing Cinderella and who ever cast her as Cinderella did a top notch casting. People may have not seen her from anywhere but some may remember her from the boring TV show Downtown Abbey, but I first sawed her from the 2012 movie Fast Girls and I know nobody has not heard of that film which is fine because the movie is pretty forgettable. But anywhere she did good in the movie and I can a bright future ahead for her.Cate Blanchett as the villain worked in a couple scenes where shes not over the top at times with the cliché laugh that a villain should do, but it's not a cool or a funny laugh it's just a cartoon laugh that took me out of the movie, but let's put that a side and talk about the rest of her performance. Cate Blanchett played the evil stepmother so well that I actually hated her more than the original. She give so much into her character to be the biggest b*tch on the planet and I got to give her a big well done for playing a cold women.The production Design and the custom designs are the icing on the cake in this movie, because it looks amazing and beautiful and I know it's early to say but when the 2016 Oscars come around again it should get a nomination for those two because it totally deserves it.Now for problems: Have you every got that feeling when you see a movie that you liked it but your never ever seeing it again well that's this movie. I will never watch this movie again, because it has nothing to re-visit.The movie doesn't really do anything new or original, no it's the same story and that's why I feel this movie doesn't need to exist and it's kind of pointless and unneeded.Cinderella 2015 version is overall a mediocre okay movie.",Cinderella
104,Al_The_Strange,Cinderella 2015 Review,8,18 March 2015,"We all know the tale, and chances are that most of us are familiar with Disney's classic 1950 animation. The latest trend of turning the classic fairy tales into live-action epics has been quite the hit-and-a-miss with Disney of late, but fortunately, their latest rendition of Cinderella doesn't fall into the same traps that Maleficent or Oz: The Great and Powerful did. You know what you're getting with 2015's Cinderella: a straightforward fairy tale movie.The film immediately sets its tempo through the narration, which gives the film its traditional story-time feeling and structure. The film proceeds at an even pace through the whole story, and then some: most aspects of the original cartoon are carried over, but the story is expanded to give more background to the characters and more scope to the story. All of the embellishments work to the story's benefit, giving the characters more depth. There are a few silly moments, especially with the animals, but the film is careful not to overplay the comic relief. For the most part, the film lets the story speak for itself, without fudging it up with too much action, spectacle, or frivolous nonsense: it relies solely on dramatic tension and conflict to keep it running, and it does so rather well.In spite of this, the film's storytelling is decent. The plot unfolds really nicely, to gradually make the audience understand and care for Cinderella, up to the feel-good climax. Each character has a life and personality to admire, and enough depth to benefit the nuances of the plot. Through it all, the classic themes of grace are thoroughly emphasized, and it remains timeless now as it did when the story was first told in the 17th century.The film looks marvelous. Photography and editing are pretty straightforward. It is a colorful film with extremely lavish sets, props, and some very impressive costumes. Special effects are liberally dispensed, but they rarely detract from the overall experience. Acting is good from the whole cast: Lilly James, Richard Madden, Cate Blanchett, Stellan Skarsgard, and Helena Bonham Carter all provide wonderful performances for their respective characters. Writing is pretty straightforward. Music is alright.Just as Kenneth Branagh's Shakespeare films are generally straightforward, so is his remake of Cinderella. There's nothing pretentious about it, and it's not going to pull out any nasty surprises; it's simply a colorful and charming fairy tale, just as you'd expect.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)",Cinderella
105,rocknrelics,Utterly charming and magical.,9,21 February 2021,"Well, what a surprise this was. I found it to be wonderful, heartwarming viewing, I know that won't appeal to all these days , but it's my kind of thing, and it made me feel warm and fuzzy.

106,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Follows 1950 narrative to the letter, so what's the problem you haters?!",7,19 March 2015,"Disney's real life adaptation of Cinderella follows the beloved animated film significantly, so audiences can't dislike this film if they tried, unoriginal as it is.The fairy tale of Cinderella should be well known by now, with the Grimm's folk tale, Disney 1950 original, the Drew Barrymore ""real"" adaptation, the Hillary Duff tween modernization, and now recent release. A fair and true maiden is left to a life of poverty and servitude by her horrid step mother when her father unexpectedly passes away, and she meets and falls for a handsome prince and they live happily ever after.Thankfully Disney finally took an adaptation of its successful animated films seriously by getting actors who could inhabit and bring to life their much adored characters. Lily James is Cinderella; she is sweet, sincere, kind but not in a saccharinely unbelievable sort of way. Her relatively unknown persona significantly adds to her ability to pull off playing such a wide- eyed wonderess. The real casting masterstroke is having Cate Blanchett play the wicked step mother in this cinema telling of Cinderella. With the talent of a seasoned veteran she finds the harmonious balance of evil and yet never turns into a caricature.The criticisms for Disney's Cinderella are few and far in between. With a real life adaptation of animated source material from sixty- five years ago, one hopes that a new spin from the inclusion of humanity will be added to the film in some way, and it is not. Especially in regard to the villainous step-mother: villains always have a two dimensional perspective to their character that one hopes will be fleshed out, pun intended. Besides a fleeting conversation nearing the conclusion of the film, Cinderella does not even bother to illuminate the cause for the step mother's malevolence and it is a pity and a misstep.Its faithfulness to the original plot is both a catalyst and hindrance to the film's success. Had Cinderella deviated too far from the 1950 original, fans would be outraged, but the 2015 version has nothing to add to the story which leaves fans asking 'besides being beautiful and perfectly acceptable film, and for financially beneficial reasons, why?""Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Cinderella

108,rajatdahiyax,"Same story ,new characters!!!!!",7,3 August 2015,"Cinderella is a 2015 American romantic fantasy film directed by Kenneth Branagh, with a screenplay written by Chris Weitz. Produced by David Barron, Simon Kinberg and Allison Shearmur for Walt Disney Pictures, the story is based on Charles Perrault's eponymous fairy tale. Although not a direct remake, the film borrows many elements from Walt Disney's 1950 animated musical film of the same name.The film stars Lily James as Ella (""Cinderella""), Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine (the Wicked Stepmother), Richard Madden as Prince Charming, Sophie McShera as Drisella, Holliday Grainger as Anastasia, and Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother.After her father unexpectedly dies, young Ella (Lily James) finds herself at the mercy of her cruel stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and stepsisters, who reduce her to scullery maid. Despite her circumstances, she refuses to despair. An invitation to a palace ball gives Ella hope that she might reunite with the dashing stranger (Richard Madden) she met in the woods, but her stepmother prevents her from going. Help arrives in the form of a kindly beggar woman who has a magic touch for ordinary things.",Cinderella
109,josh_lambert1991,Forgettable,4,3 February 2019,This movie is just the same version of Cinderella that we have heard so many times it didn't really feel very inventive,Cinderella
110,Magow-Intermean,Cinderella Review,7,7 April 2019,"You know this by now. An orphaned girl (James) is kept as a servant by her wicked stepmother (Blanchett) but shown a way out by a prince (Madden) and a fairy godmother (Bonham Carter).
This live-action take on Cinderella, which sticks closely to the Disney animation, is primarily for those who found Frozen a bit radical. It's for those who like a fairy tale where men are men (riding horses, bearing swords, wearing britches so snug they may imperil their paternal prospects) and every woman is an aspiring princess. Progressive it's not, but as a traditional tale it is well told and beautifully presented. Its lack of knowing nudges is almost radical.
In Kenneth Branagh Disney has found reliable hands, a director who can keep a story briskly trotting along and all the style in service to the content. He also has a sharp sense of humour and knows that if the setting is absurd, you don't have to lean too hard on line delivery for the joke to land. Where similar films like Mirror Mirror and Maleficent have strained so hard for camp the effort killed them, Branagh recognises the story is camp by nature and doesn't need further winking. Which isn't to say for a second this is subtle.
There are a lot of 'turns' in Cinderella. You can see the bite marks in the scenery, but the largely British cast nibble rather than gnaw. Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera are despicable fun as the cruel stepsisters, looking like the Shining twins rolled through Barbara Cartland's knicker drawer. Helena Bonham Carter does her energetic Tim Burton pantomiming but with sparkling lightness instead of swivel-eyed darkness. Hayley Atwell has a good old faint before popping off as Cinderella's much-missed mother. They're at the tipping point of going over the top, and the film is better for it.
The main event, obviously, is Blanchett's devious stepmother. She isn't just given a big entrance, she's given a big entrance for every scene (there's one shot where she simply opens a door, but contorts herself into an arch that should require pulleys). Branagh has apparently riffled through every female star of the golden age and grafted the best to Blanchett. She's Rita Hayworth yucking it up with the boys. She's Marlene Dietrich glaring out of the shadows. She's Vivien Leigh smouldering from under outsized hats. She is also one of the characters for whom Branagh and screenwriter Chris Weitz have tried to find some depth. We get a monologue about why she's become so calloused and see her face harden at every mention of Ella's mother. That, thankfully, doesn't mean we're meant to sympathise with her. She's still dreadful, but dreadful with purpose.
All this noise and gesticulation makes it tough for Lily James and Richard Madden, as Ella and the Prince, to create an impression. Theirs are the least dazzling roles - Cinderella's arc is largely a makeover bookended by washing up - but they are endearing in their eternal optimism rather than tooth-rottingly sweet. The one nod to modernity is in making the mantra of ""have courage and be kind"" applicable to both leads. Most Disney fairy tales would not have a scene of the prince curled up, crying next to his dying father - a touching, smart surprise.
This is the Disney princess model of old with some new technology, but that's a formula which built a studio. If the gender politics don't make you grind your teeth then the light humour and sparkling visuals should keep you happy, if not ever after, at least for 90 minutes.",Cinderella
111,xamtaro,Untapped Potential and no Singing Mice.,7,6 April 2015,"The only way to describe Kenneth Brannagh's Cinderella is ""The Disney fairy tale come to life"". I for one am thankful that it is no longer a surreal musical but a straight forward fantasy story. No talking mice in clothing and not too much singing for starters. Live action adaptations of such cartoons allow creators to take the tale in a more mature direction. To provide depth of character where they were once shallow ""hero"" or ""villain"" archetypes. To provide believable development in the characters' journey and growth. To go beyond juvenile wish fulfillment. Cinderella does that to a certain extent but seems to hold back on fully exploring its potential. At first glance, Cinderella is beautiful. The movie I mean. It sounds wonderful too with an uplifting score composed by THOR's Patrick Doyle. The production design and costumes are magnificent. Those along with the music effectively capture the royal glamour of fairy tale palaces, the down-to-earth simplicity of a idealistic medieval countryside and the warm feel of a simpler time. With a resume in movies on Shakespeare and Shakespearean in scope, director Brannagh brings his keen eye for visual detail and love for romanticized Victorian age elements to this movie. Indeed, Cinderella hews close to its roots, adapting the Disney classic into live action while expanding on elements that were never fleshed out before. One such element was Cinderella's backstory. How does a simple unassuming good girl end up in the company of an evil stepmother and horrid step sisters? Where does she draw her inner strength from to carry on as no more of a household servant? This movie answers those questions. In making the transition from 2D animation to three dimensional live actors, the characters too gain some depth. Cinderella herself, played wonderfully by Lily James, is portrayed as a thoroughly human protagonist given inhumanly cruel treatment in an unfortunate world. She is an ideal, no doubt, of strength of character with a solid foundation of good values, never giving up even in the face of persecution. Still, we see her human side when she falters emotionally; her smile hiding a loneliness and inner sadness. A far cry from the pure and perfect damsel from the cartoon. Most intriguing is Cate Blanchett's evil Stepmother character. You get a sense that she represents cruel reality. An idealist girl who was slowly turned by the unfortunate ways of the world; the money minded, dog-eat-dog world where only survival of the shrewdest matters. She is the perfect foil to Cinderella's pure hearted personality and the perfect breeding ground for a complex conflict of character. Yet this movie hovers. That complexity never came. Instead when the story started to delve into the complex, it reined itself back into simplistic fairy tale goodness. This is where Cinderella suffered. Expanding just enough but never quite making its characters fully rounded. Take the relationship between Cinderella and the Prince for example. It still comes across as love at first sight with both parties enraptured in each other's beauty. You get a hint that their romance went deeper than that but the movie never elaborates. You get a sense that there is more to the Prince than a pretty face, hinting at his insecurities over marriage, his inexperience in leadership, but the movie never elaborates. It is a missed opportunity that could have taken a story, reviled by many for its simplistic notions of love, into a modern fable with morals that children can learn from. It does maintain good moral fibre that perseverance and steadfast belief in one's good values will eventually lead to good things and good people. An additional point for that. Where Cinderella loses points is in its unwillingness to explore deeper themes. It plays safe with the whole kid friendly fairy tale angle, keeping complex conflict to a minimum or at least to a simple black and white, good and evil. Our characters are more developed but maintain their ""perfection"". Cinderella, having had near zero contact with men other than her late father, waltzes into a crowded ball seemingly with a surprising air of confidence. Would it have been too complex to show her insecurities or a little shyness? The prince had lied to her about being an apprentice. Would it have been too much trouble to show that him feeling bad and apologizing rather than making up some smug excuse? Their humanity is hampered by wanting to keep it kid friendly and simple. Similarly, magnificent designs are sometimes hampered by disappointing CGI special effects.The young and the young at heart would have no trouble following and loving this live action fairy tale. For those of us looking for a clever deconstruction or at least a more complex reconstruction of this classic, Cinderella is not that movie.",Cinderella
112,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,12 March 2015,"Cinderella returns timeless as ever, delightful as always, vested with the irresistible charm and sensibility of the great Kenneth Brangah and makes a triumphant return to the big screen.I do acknowledge the film's flaws, but I just could not resist it getting me, I had the best time at the theater, I laughed, and I even shed a tear or two. This is probably the best live-action adaptation of a fairy tale Disney has done yet, maybe that's not saying much since the previous ones weren't really that good, but it understands what it is, it know it's place and even has fun with it, not taking itself too seriously. Of the live action fairy tales it is also the most beautiful one to look at, finally someone that understands that a green screen isn't enough for visual flare and doesn't only use gargantuan masses of cgi. The mix between the wonderful sets and costumes and the cgi animals is seamless and wrapped up by splendid cinematography and a fantastical score by Patrick Doyle. Yet what was the best part of the movie was without doubt the cast. Besides Lily James being absolutely stunning both in beauty and talent, a really surprising performance that I didn't expect, the whole cast is so brilliant I can't simply pin point who was the best, everybody was just so busy stealing the scene to everybody else: be it Cate Blanchett in all of her majestic screen power, be it Grainger or McShera hilarious sisters, Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy or Derek Jacobi as the wise king. Branagh proves he know how to direct a cast and how to do great character work.Or the other side of the charm unfortunately there is cheesiness. The prologue of the movie was full of cringe-worthy moments that are present in the rest of the movie too, not many, but they are there. The film also carries on for a bit too long and doesn't offer an original enough perspective for it to be deemed a great telling. It clearly doesn't need to because the traditional rendition here is wonderful, but it can be faulted for a slight lack something to liven things up.I really do recommend everybody to go see the film, you will come out with a wide smile on your face.",Cinderella
113,daisukereds,Nigh-perfect adaptation,7,14 July 2021,"I didn't know this movie existed until recently.. and what a pleasant surprise! From the great casting (and each and everyone one of their lovely portrayals, expressions and interactions), to the colors, clothing, sets, music, locations and developments.After every photorealistic disappointment from Disney since Alice in Wonderland (2010), to find a lovely adaptation of the original that isn't flat or insulting and with a damn good script as a foundation! That is to say, that if you are going to remake these movies, at least make them ""good"".. not worse (like they did Maleficent, Aladdin and the Lion King amongst others).This has a fresh and lovely start. The family setting of fair standing, with a context of love and caring relationships, followed by loss and moving on. It feels different.. although if you've seen Ella Enchanted from 2004, you'd probably say I'm very mistaken. Still, the direction it takes gives you uncertainty of its development. Almost everything is more realistic. That is, until it doesn't.. for a moment. Personally, I feel this story would have been perfect had it kept its course with some elements left out. While still good, my expectations for it begot higher expectations. You'd have to see it to understand.. the way it unravels feels known but unique.Still, I wasn't disappointed. It feels magical and lovely still. I particularly enjoyed Richard, and therefore his interactions with Lily (both leads). And every other character isn't underwritten or annoying or wasted. It's hard to find consistency, and for everything displayed to matter.Easy recommendation for any Disney fan.. specially for those disillusioned with what we've gotten as of late.",Cinderella
114,asb_deutsch,Not original but good!,6,26 December 2015,"Audiences gave Cinderella a grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale, really? 🤔 It sticks to the age-old idea that ugly women must be evil and continues to pit women against each other based on their looks. ""Cinderella"" could have explored patriarchal confinements, of the time, that forced women to fight against each other in order to gain a wealthy and/or titled husband in order to better their standard of living. But, nope, ""Cinderella"" instead chooses to stick with a superficial conflict: the step-sisters hate Ella just because she's better looking than them. Its stupid and does nothing for female development and teaches impressionable children a completely flawed and outdated ""lesson"".Cate Blanchett served the stand-out performance, but she's Queen Blanchett and rarely ever puts a foot wrong. I also thought that the costumes in the film were really beautiful, and I loved Cinderella's wedding dress (gorgeous!😍). The special effects were pretty good, but the CGI on Helena Bonham Carter was laughably bad. 😆I don't know why constant narration has become the new-trend in film making. It completely defies the purpose of SHOW and not TELL - narration should be used as a framing device, not as a device to tell the whole freaking story when the film is a visual art.The only thing I like was the transformation of Lily's carriage and her dress playing hide-and-seek with me! 😘",Cinderella
115,shawneofthedead,"Charming, with excellent character work, though it's rather too safe for its own good.",7,11 March 2015,"Everyone knows the rags-to-riches story of Cinderella - and that's the biggest problem with Kenneth Branagh's smart, colourful but ultimately overly safe adaptation of the fairy tale. With great skill, Branagh and screenwriter Chris Weitz mix and match elements of the original story, which has subsisted in some form or fashion since the 1630s, with the enchanting magic dreamt up by Disney for its 1950 animated classic. Along the way, key characters are given more depth, and outmoded politics and courting rituals receive a nice shiny polish far more suitable for modern times. But, in the end, there's still too little grit and grime to Branagh's film. It sparkles, but in a familiar fashion - it entertains, but in a mostly predictable way.Young Ella (James) lives the blessed life of a daughter thoroughly adored by her parents. But tragedy soon strikes - Ella's sweet, kind mother (Atwell) dies, leaving her father (Chaplin) all alone in the world. Taking another chance at happiness, he marries the widowed Lady Tremaine (Blanchett), inheriting that fearsome lady's taste for the high life and her two quarrelsome daughters, Anastasia (Grainger) and Drizella (McShera). When he, too, dies unexpectedly, Lady Tremaine forces Ella into the role of servant girl. It's a part she will seemingly have to play for the rest of her life - until the Prince (Madden) throws a royal ball in order to find himself a bride.The film doesn't open on a very promising note. It's almost overbearingly soppy at the beginning, as sun-kissed Ella dances in the beautifully-manicured garden with her doting daddy and her mother sings her to sleep with a lilting lullaby. It's hard to warm up to a little girl who's so very good when she's also so very blessed. Small wonder, then, that the entrance of Lady Tremaine and her loud, fashion-challenged daughters comes as a relief. Even the arrival of the Prince - who is the very definition of colourless in the animated film - is welcome.This is where Branagh's film excels. It's easy to forgive its almost slavish adherence to the well-known beats of the narrative when it takes its time in breathing life and colour into otherwise paper- thin characters. Ella is bequeathed a mantra - ""Have courage and be kind"" - that helps explain much of her frequently martyristic behaviour, including why she stays in a house that most people would no longer consider her home.The Prince, too, is brought charmingly down to earth. He's as blinded by starry-eyed love as he is in any other version of this story, but his determination to find and be with the girl of his dreams feels more personal and hard-won. The pressures of royal duty and obligation are neatly folded into his relationship with his ailing father (Derek Jacobi). Perhaps most importantly of all, this Prince is not presented as some nitwit who can't recognise the girl he dances with at the ball until he places a glass slipper on her foot.Most intriguingly of all, Cinderella actually makes a decent attempt at humanising its chief antagonist. The character of Lady Tremaine is typically played as a cackling, uncaring shrew - the prototypical wicked stepmother. In Blanchett's remarkably capable hands, this incarnation of Lady Tremaine hides a wealth of anger, hurt and jealousy inside her cruelty. She may not be sympathetic, per se, but it's possible to understand why she behaves in the way she does. There is a heart to break after all, somewhere inside this fierce, scheming woman whose eyes still fill with tears when she realises that her new husband doesn't care for her as much as she would like him to.The same amount of thought is lavished upon the relationship between Ella and the Prince, such that it unfolds less as a fait accompli and more as a credible love story. They may fall in love almost instantaneously, but it's not because of the love-at-first-sight pablum that tends to plague such fairy tales. Instead, they can clearly see the kindness and goodness in each other's hearts. It's a mutual connection that feels wonderfully real.James and Madden slip quite well into their roles, which are deepened but remain cut from the same stereotypical cloth of many age-old fairy tales. James, in particular, has a tough time keeping Ella charming, as the character frequently strays into the realm of manic optimism - she's so full of faith in humanity that it's hard to believe she's real. But James pulls it off, most of the time. Madden is appealing in a subtle way, infusing his Prince with quite enough intelligence and honour to make him really come alive. On screen, they share a chemistry that's sweet and ardent, if not particularly electric.It's a shame that Branagh doesn't expend as much effort in telling his story as exploring his characters. Character work aside, Cinderella pretty much goes through the motions of telling its tale. It's all predictable stuff, lifted right out of the animated film and liberally sprinkled with extra sequins and gold dust. There are literal bursts of colour and magic, courtesy of Helena Bonham Carter's loopy Fairy Godmother. Ella chatters cheerfully with the mice who share her lonely attic. The CGI is beautiful but heavy- handed, chiefly when Ella's dress swirls around her or her glass slippers sparkle. There's no underlying twist of irony here, not even a hint at the darker aspects of the original fairy tale. (Ella's stepsisters can be thankful that they retain their heels, toes and eyes.)Anyone new to the story of Cinderella will find Branagh's film entertaining, sweet and even enlightening in parts. It tells this age-old story faithfully and harmlessly, while applying a welcome bit of modern polish to its quainter ideas. But this charming incarnation of Cinderella is good, not great: it sticks too closely to safe ground, and thus remakes rather than re-invents the wheel.",Cinderella
116,jawneyfloros,an updated take on the disney classic,10,13 November 2018,Review: I loved this movie because it is a great companion piece to Walt Disney's 1950's classic of Cinderella.

117,happipuppi13,Cinderella 2015/2016 : Another Wonderful World from Disney,10,22 April 2017,"I read some the very negative reviews and came to this conclusion.....These people went to the movie but didn't really see it or they didn't even go to see it and just created a Trollish (and very short) review with no substance to it at all.First off. Too many Cinderella remakes? Well, guess what? It'll be remade probably 20 years from now too. What does that have to do with how good or bad it was? For that matter,who cares? ""Disappointing indeed"", is something another said. What are the ways it was disappointing? No explanation,just an empty opinion.""It is made for kids only and not for adults"". Really?! I'm 46 and my girlfriend in her 30s. We saw this last night and enjoyed it just as much as the kids and (guess what?) their parents were enjoying it too.A girl losing both of her parents? How in the world is that ""for kids only""? I was amazed they dealt with it that directly and in a very mature manner, without making it too disturbing for very little kids.""This movie was so boring."" Okay again,""how"" or in what ways was it boring? Just another blanket opinion.""Nothing new?"" It's a re-make of a 200 year old story,they have to tell it in mostly the way it was written but they did add something important, they gave all main/central characters real human qualities and emotions and even back-stories about who they are.CGI animation & special effects are amazing & seamless here. The costumes and attention to how people would dress in that era is flawless. Every actor in this film is 100% into their role and best of all this movie ""does"" have heart,otherwise there'd be nothing to like about it.A rip off of others or a ""copy & paste"" job : There's only one real storyline for Cinderella and that's (again) from the original story & book itself. Director Orlando and other filmmakers did not create Cinderella. He and they only made their own versions.As for some alleging ""Disney steals ideas""...aside from ""a few"" Cinderellas made before 1950, Disney pretty much made the definitive and animated one that year. Any later versions are remakes either good or just okay.In case any haven't heard ,the movie industry is 112 years old,there's only so many ""fresh"" ideas anymore.""The acting is/was so tasteless"". What is that statement based on? There's nothing tasteless in the film at all. As for acting, does anyone really think it's easy to play such a ""nice girl"" as Ella and balance that against all the negative things happening to her? I'm not in show business but I certainly know the difference between a boring film and a good ,fun and entertaining one. This movie ""is"" a good movie,it has every element that it takes to be so.Good actors, good directing,a well fleshed out script based on something already done before. ..and again, incredible detailed costumes and sets & again great special effects, that bring the illusion of that time period to life. The music score is excellent as well.About the feminists. Ella is a very strong girl and then woman. To put up with all she did and went through after her parents passed on, is a testament not only to being a strong female but being a strong person in general.I say that as a man raised by two good yet strong women.It's far too easy for people to be negative in a review here on IMDb. It's easy to see, some come from just from wanting to be mean and negative because they want too,not because they actually saw the film.Making a bad or boring film is a very easy thing too,when all involved don't make a real effort and just want to make money.It takes a better use of one's mind to create a movie (and remakes) like Cinderella and have it be successful and as well done as this film.Ten stars? I'll give Cinderella (2015) twenty! An AA++ and 100% perfect score. I will say and add that this movie will be an Oscar contender at next year's Academy Awards.Anyone who rates it less did not open themselves up emotionally or even mentally to just enjoying it for what it is and always was & will be....a fairy tale. (END)",Cinderella
118,Trevor-Kerensky,One of the better live Disney remakes,8,10 June 2018,"I didn't get a chance to watch this one in theaters, but I did rent it and enjoyed it. It's a nice spin on the original and it takes some creative liberties, but otherwise it's not too predictable and there were many scenes I did not see coming. I enjoyed the original but this was even better. It's good for those of you who don't care for animated movies and wanted a live spin on the original fairy tale. Sure, the names are almost the same but it's good for a new generation. There are some parts that were different from the original fairy tale (before the animated film) but it's still good. It's also one of the better live Disney remakes out there, along with The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon.",Cinderella

I have seen the story of Cinderella in my childhood. It is simple and beautiful. I believe that good and evil will be rewarded. Many years later, the girl has become a mother, with her daughter to experience this dream country, warm and wonderful. Beautiful castle, good comely rilla, evil snobbish stepmother, silly and naughty sisters, ancient fairy godmother, handsome and elegant prince, beautiful princess dress and glass shoes, golden and magnificent pumpkin car... When I saw the words of the past leap out of the paper, and become three-dimensional and full of imagination, I also like a moment back to childhood, intoxicated in the fairy tale world.",Cinderella

Right from the first viewing of the trailer I knew I wanted to watch this film. Let's face it, what girl doesn't want to be swept off her feet by a dashing Prince on a beautiful horse, (does it matter that I was taking more notice of the beautiful horse?). This was the excellent live action adaption of the animated Disney Classic I remember so well from my childhood and beyond. Everything was included, from the grumpy hissy spitty cat, the friendly mice, the hysterical ugly step sisters and a menacing austere, but mostly stuck up step mother played exquisitely by Cate Blanchett. Cinderella was played by Lily James, who you will remember as Lady Rose from Downton Abbey, she was joined by her DA co-star Daisy (Sophie McShera) who was outrageously simpering as her step sister Drisella. Equally dastardly was Holliday Grainger who played the other step sister, Anastasia. The Prince was handsome as a Prince should be and had a deep sexy voice to match. Nice to see Derek Jacobi as the King and Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother. The score was magical, however, my biggest shout out however must go to the costume department, not only for the simply outrageous dresses worn by the three female villains but for the amazingly fluid, sparkly quite ravishing blue dress that Cinderella wore to the ball, oh to have a waist that small.....sigh.....oh and look out for the goose.",Cinderella
122,troyputland,Safe but Pleasing,8,10 April 2015,"Kenneth Branagh's directing career is diverse, stretching far and wide, from action and classical, to fantasy and now the magical. His live action version of Cinderella plays it safe, following the 1950 animated classic to the letter. Cinderella is on the very predictable side, offering nothing new to the story, but it does hone in on areas an animation would have trouble finding. The scenery, characters and clothing are incredibly glamorous and aesthetically pleasing that we find our eyes attempting to drink it all in. Ella (Lily James) is a fine mix of innocence and purpose. Having a pure heart and a soulful nature means we want the best out of her. Her time is spent under the control of her evil Stepmother (Blanchett). Blanchett is brutal to Ella, testing our anger, raising our temperatures to boiling point. We want nothing more than to see sweet justice, even if we already know the outcome. Sparks fly between Ella and Richard Madden's Prince (Game of Thrones' Rob Stark). They make it easy to believe love at first sight. The film starts to bleed magic when Ella meets her Fairy Godmother (Bonham Carter), who turns the impossible into reality. Disney fans will relish in this wonderful remake because it doesn't try to outdo expectations.",Cinderella
123,eberkerbatur,Lily James is a great actress but not beautiful enough to play Cinderella (7.1),7,29 March 2020,"A very famous fairy tale that everybody knows, it is very difficult for this fairy tale to be a bad movie because the story is good any way a bad job can't occur when properly transferred.
The movie was fine I think it would be the most.3 rules should be in a fairy tale movie these are the best choices of costumes, the fact that the images take you to a fairy-tale world, you really feel inside that fairy tale and finally the casting team and especially the prince and the princess or the leading actors.
I think this movie was the only bad thing about actors the Prince is a little older and Cinderella is not very beautiful more like a normal girl but in fairy tale very beautiful.
I didn't like Cinderella in particular, but the movie was great in general, I watched it 3 times and never bored. and the director is good.",Cinderella
124,monstermayhem32,Faithful adaptation of a Disney classic,10,18 March 2015,"I will say that being a big fan of the animated fan, I will say that the film did a rather decent job being faithful of the material but adding a few twists and spins of its own. In this version it expands more upon Cinderella's family family and having a chance encounter with the Prince. When Cinderella's mother and father pass away, she is left under the cruelty of Lady Tremaine played wonderfully by Cate Blanchett who makes the character rather cruel but somewhat sympathetic who wants to keep the money to her and her sleazy but dimwitted daughters Anatasia and Druzilla. Another surprise is Helena Bonaham Carter who looks stunning as the fairy godmother. Lily James version of Cinderella retains the kindness and strong will but manages to have a bit more backbone and courage. Richard Madden does a decent job making the prince likable who loves Cinderella for who she is. Overall I would say overall a great film for those of all ages.",Cinderella
125,squirrel_burst,"Probably not destined to be a classic, but quite enchanting nonetheless",8,31 March 2015,"When I heard that they were making a live action remake of Disney's classic 1950's film ""Cinderella"" I thought to myself ""Why?"" There's nothing wrong with that film, and I think it's aged surprisingly well for a picture that was made before man even made it to the moon. Nevertheless, I heard good things from critics so I decided to check it out. I was surprised at enjoyable it was. Even if you're intimately familiar with the classic, there are plenty of elements that make 2015's ""Cinderella"" stand on its own.If you don't know the story I don't know what to tell you, but let's not skip out on the formalities because most people out there are familiar with this fairy tale: Ella ""Cinderella"" (Lilly James) lives like a servant/slave in the service of with her step sisters Drisella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) as well as her wicked stepmother (Cate Blanchett). Despite the unjust servitude, she keeps a heart full of hope and is kind to all. When the kingdom's young prince (Richard Madden) throws a royal ball to find himself a bride, Cinderella is prevented from attending... until her fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) shows up.I want to reinforce once again that while obviously this is based on the same story as the film you grew up on, there are enough differences to make this update worth checking out. The first and most obvious difference is that this is a live action film. I'm not really into dresses and costumes, but even I have to admit that this is a gorgeous film. As with the other Kenneth Branaugh films you've seen in the past, this is a lavish period piece filled with beautiful costumes, elaborate sets and wonderfully intricate props. The Prince's party, for instance is a real feast for the eyes as you observe the enormous ballroom, the hundreds of costumes and, at the center of it all one gorgeous looking couple dressed in clothing so fine it will make your dresser hide in a corner out of shame. I wasn't really looking for them too much because my interest was in the story and not the clothes being worn, but I found several of the outfits memorable and particularly attractive, including some of the day-to-day outfits worn by Cinderella's tormentors, or the occupants of the royal palace. There's also something to be said about the iconic pumpkin-shaped carriage. It's a real thing of beauty and you can tell that expert craftsmen spared no effort into bringing this magical vehicle to life. In every frame, there's something for your eyes to drool over.The plot sucked me in, and not only because I like the fairytale this is based on; because I liked the characters as they were set up in the movie. You don't just cheer for Cinderella because she's the underdog; you fall in love with her because she's so sweet and kind that you can't help it. You want to see her have a happy ending because she's a good person who refuses to have her spirit broken no matter what injustice is dropped on her shoulders. She's nice but that doesn't mean she's flat or bland. Additionally, I feel like as if the picture makes a point to show that when it comes to the love plot, people don't just fall in love at first sight for no reason, it's because something between their personalities connect. It's a delicate balance of a more realistic approach, while still feeling true to the source material. It pleased me to see more of a journey for Cinderella, from the promising young woman into the servant at the beck and call of her wicked new family and then, when all seems lost a glimmer of hope. The Fairy Godmother's not in this movie a whole lot, but I enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter's performance too. I think she was in it just the right amount and I appreciated the fact that our charming Prince got a good slice of the running time as well.What's a hero without a villain? I feel like Cate Blanchett did an excellent job filling the role, slinking into the shoes of an ice queen that is needlessly cruel while having just a hint of humanity and a few moments to ""justify"" her actions. I also like that the stepsisters were presented bad, but they're not quite harpies. They're not unattractive, but their personalities make them completely unappealing even to the shallowest of audience members.It occurred to me during the film that I didn't mind knowing where the plot was heading, because I like fairy tales. I think that there's something about them that appeals to all of us. Call it your inner child, or your lizard-brain, but there's something that makes these stories endure. People want to see worlds where princesses are beautiful and princes are charming, where evil is absolute and must be destroyed, where you can have happy endings, magic and there is no cynicism present. They teach you that if you hold onto your dreams and you're good, happiness will come to you. It's something that I'd like to believe in as an adult, not just as a kid. It's light and it made me feel good, and isn't that the reason why we go see movies? To be entertained and to leave with a smile on our faces? You won't find any of the classic songs from the 50's ""Cinderella"" in this 2015 film, but that's alright, this movie is doing its own thing while staying true to its roots (and they have new renditions of them playing during the credits anyway if you want to be technical about it). It's a well made film, particularly in terms of the look and the characters and I think that if you go in the theatre wanting to be enchanted, you will be.

127,nicolechan916,Disappointing,4,31 May 2015,"Pretty much everyone knows the story of Cinderella, so this remake would not have been about the story but about how it was told. Regretfully it was kind of boring. Disney is famous for having songs in their movies, and I know I have complained about them before (Frozen had a bit too many), but for classic films that have already established their songs why would you remove them?! That is a major flaw of this film, for me personally.The acting was pretty good, but it felt lacking. James does a good job with being cheerful and bright most of the time. (I liked how James and McShera are both from Downton Abbey and their roles are reversed somewhat) Carter does a great job as fairy godmother and I wished she had more parts. Blanchett was believable as the evil stepmother and her expressions really help with the character. However it felt that the character's didn't really have much of a personality to them. I mean they are stock characters, but their personality doesn't come off as more than that. They act and speak in certain ways, and seem more 2D than actual characters. The prince especially seems pretty dull, and doesn't have much princely charm.It might have been the script too that made the film seem pretty boring. There isn't much to entice the audience. The talking was quite a drawl and there did not seem to be much chemistry between the characters.However, I did enjoy the costumes and the animation. Filled with bright colours and cute animals, this part was well done. The goose was especially entertaining. The only magical element is with the fairy godmother and it was limited, but that was probably the best part of the film. I was really looking forward to the songsoh well.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Cinderella

130,Spideyfan-963-246215,Cinderella Review,9,9 September 2016,"Cinderella(2015) Starring: Lily James, Richard Madden, Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, Holliday Grainger, Hayley Atwell, Sophie McShera, Stellan Skarsgård, Derek Jacobi, and Nonso Anozie Directed By: Kenneth Branagh Review Midnight is just the beginning. If their is any spectacle at the movies right now it's Disney's live action Cinderella. It resonates the same princess movie you know and maybe love with something the same but with director Branagh's style. Look I'll be straight with you I personally don't like Disney princess movies but this won me over. When her father unexpectedly passes away, young Ella finds herself at the mercy of her cruel stepmother and her daughters. Never one to give up hope, Ella's fortunes begin to change after meeting a dashing stranger in the woods. The story is nothing new their is no twist like Maleficent, but I like that your giving me a good movie and making it great by getting a stellar cast, beautiful costumes, and making it live action. There are also no songs in the movie which is the only difference which for me is good because I am not a fan of musicals. The opening is with narrating from the fairy godmother about Elle's childhood with her mother and father until disaster strikes. Lily James(downtown Abbey) is so good as Cinderella and she was my favorite part of the movie her acting made me give a crap about the character and anticipate all the things we knew would happen to her. My second favorite cast member from the movie was Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother which is surprising to me because other then the harry potter movies and Big Fish I just usually don't like her. Cate Blanchett was amazing as the evil stepmother and very funny. The rest of the cast did good and each had a moment to shine. The movie was made to experiment with live action fairy tales/princess movie and see if they can make something special the lady's and kids while providing that sense of nostalgia and well I think they got it right. The story also does have a message although it's been misconceived for to be accepting for who you are, and while yes that is one thing to take away from this movie but I believe the message is to have courage and be kind. Cinderella boasts to the highest part of the live action princess/fairy tale kingdom as being the best princess movie I have ever seen. It doesn't need music, it doesn't need memorability, it needs a good story and to be a beautiful spectacle. I'm giving Cinderella a five out of five.",Cinderella
131,eldreddsouza,An average affair.,6,26 September 2021,"I've never really been a fan of the Cinderella story as it is too basic. Only the crux of the entire story seemed interesting. However with this move, I had to bear all the other parts as well. Nothing seemed all that interesting. This movie has no songs like other Disney movies. Just one which was nice but a lack of songs in a Disney movie just renders it dull and dry as was the case with this one. Lily James made a great Cinderella and her acting was one of the few things I liked in this movie. The visuals were nothing special and nothing we'd never seen before.This is only an average film. I avoided this film for the longest time and it's only now after 7 years that I thought of watching at. That too because of the new Amazon film that is apparently even worse than this. Now I know why I avoided this. It seemed uninteresting from the trailers and everything and the film itself is nothing special.",Cinderella
132,CleveMan66,Branagh and Disney - a pretty good combination if you want to reinterpret a classic fairy tale.,6,13 March 2015,"As I walked into the theater to see the 2015 ""Cinderella"" (PG, 1:52), I had to ask myself: Did we REALLY NEED another Cinderella film? After all, a quick internet search reveals five DOZEN full-length movies with the name Cinderella (or some form of it) in the title, with 1/3 of those using the exact one-word title ""Cinderella"". The list of Cinderella-related movies stretches back over 100 years and includes about a dozen in the previous decade alone. None of this even counts short films, TV specials, TV series, kids' videos – or stage productions. However, the one thing that none of those earlier versions had is Kenneth Branagh directing, and only a few others (most notably the classic 1950 animated feature) had Disney pedigree.This version of the much-loved story begins with a series of short scenes showing the little girl Ella growing up on her family's country estate. They're not exactly rich, but they're comfortable – and happy. Ella is fortunate enough to have two doting parents (Hayley Atwell and Ben Chaplin) and is able to while away the hours just being a kid – enjoying the world around her, her parents' company and the companionship of a number of animal friends, especially four very special little mice. Unfortunately, as the movie's narrator points out, even happy families have moments of sadness. Ella's mother suddenly falls ill and quickly dies, but in her final words to Ella, she has a profound impact on the development of the young girl's character. Ella's mother makes her promise to always ""have courage and be kind"". It's simply an encouragement to continue being the person she already was, but now carries the added weight of a beloved parent's last wish, meant to carry Ella through the rest of her life.Ella (played from this point on by Lily James from ""Downton Abbey"") and her father still have each other, but, as much as he loves his daughter, Ella's father is lonely and eventually marries the widow Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett), bringing her and her two daughters, Drizella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) to live with him and his daughter. From their first day in the house, Ella's new stepsisters treat her rudely and Ella's stepmother treats her with barely veiled disdain. Things go from bad to worse when Ella's father dies while away on a business trip and she is now at the complete mercy of her stepmother and stepsisters, who are more than a little short in the mercy department. Ella becomes a servant in her own home – and a very poorly treated servant at that. She even has to suffer the indignity of being referred to by a name that mocks her cleaning woman life, a life that the very women who gave her that name imposed upon her in the first place. Still, as lacking as the others are in compassion and decency, Ella is overflowing with courage and kindness.A chance encounter in the woods between Cinderella and the kingdom's prince (Richard Madden) leads him to invite all the maidens in the kingdom to join the local and foreign ladies and princesses to a castle ball where the prince is to choose a bride. He hopes that mysterious country girl will be there, but his father, the loving but old-fashioned king (Derek Jacobi) and the scheming Grand Duke (Stellan Skarsgård) are counting on him choosing a member of another kingdom's royal family, to strengthen, and possibly enrich, their own small kingdom. Now, unless you've been raised by wolves, it shouldn't be a spoiler to say that what follows includes a fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter), a magical coach, a beautiful dress and a pair of glass slippers – and a VERY strict curfew. I won't tell you how the rest of the story plays out, even though you probably know about that too, because each Cinderella tale works its ending a little differently.The first half of ""Cinderella"" is rather ordinary, but eventually redeems itself. Cinderella's growing-up years are necessary for character development, but are a little overdone. The portrayal of her suffering under the reign of her stepmother is also longer than necessary and portrays an over-the-top cruelty and suffers from a lack of realism, as compared with the rest of the film. Magic transformations aside, once we get to the scenes at the ball, the characters seem to begin behaving more like real people might, within the context of this particular story. The acting is passable, with just a few exceptional moments. Carter is perfectly cast as the fairy godmother and made me wish she could have been in more of the movie. Blanchett unnecessarily relishes her meanness as the evil stepmother, but then manages to infuse the character with an almost sympathetic humanity in the film's third act.In the final analysis, I guess each generation could benefit from a straight-up retelling of the centuries-old tale. After all, values like selflessness, remaining positive, never letting go of your dreams or who you are as a person and the desire to see good things happen to good people never really go out of style. And who better to reinterpret poor Ella's story for this generation than this particular creative team? The names Branagh and Disney each mean a lot on their own and, together, they were able to infuse their Cinderella with modern meaning – and strong entertainment value. ""B""",Cinderella
133,wildlife-ptech,8/10,8,11 December 2017,This sweet good-natured film is practically a live action version of the original Disney animation. it improves the original by making Cinderella a bit more outspoken. And of course the visual effects are excellent and add to the magic. Cate Blanchett is good in a villainous role with a hint of complexity. Some may feel a bit let down by the fact that most scenes are repeated from the original. Still its a pleasant and at times magical experience.8/10,Cinderella
134,robsta23,Good Use of Color and Set Design - That's It,3,21 March 2015,"Well I went in with no expectations since I had not seen one trailer for this film. What a boring film packed with clichés, performances that practically showed the actors were only in it for the money, and so many pauses or beats that made the film seem overly long for such a simple story.What astounds me about the story of Cinderella in general is how the stepmother and stepsisters even gain ""power"" over the titular character. Just because they outnumber her and one of them is a full-grown adult? I thought the narrator in the film even said the stepmother was no longer connected to the estate once Ella's father passes; it was confusing terminology but I thought that was what was said. In any logical situation, the estate would have gone to Ella, but I guess those rights do not hold up in an older time period.I found it really disappointing to see an actress with great acclaim like Cate Blanchett fill the role of a terribly acted stepmother. She just won an Oscar a few years ago, and now she plays such a dull villain who can only gaze, smirk, and laugh (sort of) to portray ""evil.""I knew it was going to be disappointing when they went with the cliché ""you have more kindness in your tiny finger than anybody blah blah blah blah"" towards the beginning of the film. And to top it off, a line that became a motif went something along the lines of ""courage and kindness make you strong,"" and it was rather annoying and cheesy.I thought the vibrant colors made the film look visually appealing, especially for kids, and the costumes and set design were spot on. It made sense when I saw that Kenneth Branagh is the director of the film since these aspects are strong in his films.Disney, please stop rebooting stories you have already animated. You're making them worse.",Cinderella
135,pinkarray,Was reasonably well but falls short,6,24 March 2015,"I was really excited to see this new Cinderella movie as I liked the 1950s one and this was just disappointing. There are some sad scenes to it, a lot of attempt at humor, and it just felt very different from the original. I was excited that Disney was remaking this from the 1950s version but it just falls short.So, they used CGI effects for the animals, but never bothered to paint the people-lizards green until towards the end.Cinderella's acting was near-perfect expect for some clichéd scenes and I think that they could've picked a better actor to play the beautiful Cinderella. The stepsisters were not so good, as they looked too pretty rather than ugly and evil. Just like in the script, they weren't so evil to Cinderella.There were just too many silly action scenes and fantasy scenes towards the end. And there were a couple scenes where I cringed.I also didn't like the beginning when she was a little girl, it was saccharine. Her mother teaches her how to have courage and be kind and towards the end, she loses her faith when her sisters go to the ball, which was preachy.Still, it has a lot of good moments.",Cinderella
136,blakiepeterson,A Pretty But Unnecessary Re-imagining Of A Classic Fairy Tale,6,2 May 2015,"For someone who has endured the plights of Stepmommie Dearest, the quick- to-expire gifts of a bonkers fairy godmother, and the obsessions of a Prince Charming that won't back off even if you ask politely, Cinderella is probably the nicest girl you'll never meet. She seems to be on a mission to prove that nice guys may finish last but nice girls will gladly take the top spot. Ever since Disney made her an icon 65 years ago, Cinderella's appeal has hardly faded; she's the rags-to-riches story for little girls. Just because you have a stepmother with the vengeance of a Greek monster doesn't mean that you can't eventually climb up onto the golden throne of the kingdom, sitting next to the spouse of your dreams. When parents complain that Miley Cyrus is a bad role model, all you want to do is wag a finger at the tots in line for 2015's Cinderella in order to prove a point. Donning the gown of their favorite princess, hopping with excitement, they don't care about twerking or questionable poses or controversy; they care about being a glamorous saint who gets to live in a castle and dress extravagantly, for crying out loud.That being said, this year's live-action take on the classic fairy tale is neither an improvement nor a disappointment; it is faithful to its animated predecessor, retaining that same Disney magic while adding lavish decor and stunning costume design. It wants to be a square, not a rebel without a cause, ultimately feeling safe, predictable, and long (a characteristic most likely heightened due to the fact that the original was a mere hour). But girls (elementary and under) will find plenty to dramatically gasp at (The dresses! Cinderella's hair! The prince! The Castle! The !), and fans of the original will nevertheless be astonished by the scope of it all.You know the story: Cinderella's (Lily James) parents die tragically. She endures years of slaving away to the rhythms of her conniving stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and birdbrained stepsisters (Holliday Grainger, Sophie McShera). She is glammed up by her fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) so she is fit to go to the kingdom's prim-and- proper ball. She rides over in a carriage made of a reject pumpkin, meets (and steals of the heart of) the prince, loses a precious glass slipper in a breathy exit, goes back home at the stroke of midnight, is pursued by the prince, and, eventually, lives happily ever after as queen of the kingdom.I walked out of Cinderella with my expectations unmoved. It's exactly what you think it will be: a live-action version of Cinderella, only this time Cate Blanchett is Lady Tremaine, Helena Bonham Carter calls dibs on bippity-bopitity-booing a high paycheck in trade of narration and spell casting, and the budget is skyrocketed to Ben-Hur levels. Everything looks incredible; but the film is lacking personality (James is slightly creaky and Blanchett isn't given nearly enough scenery to chew), and that's why I still prefer the animated take. Short, sweet, and unavoidably magical, it was simple enough to attract even the youngest of viewers while proving to be lustrous enough to keep fresh for over half- a-century. This 2015 version is maybe a little too eager to earn some dough, but don't let that stop you. The excitement of a princess adoring tyke can only be resisted for so long, after all.

Never one to give up hope, Ella's fortunes begin to change after meeting a dashing stranger. The question is: Do we really need another live adaptation of this tale while we can watch the original animated still? In fact, Cinderella is another live action telling of the well known tale of Cinderella brought to us this time by Sir Kennegh Branagh. This movie is exactly what you remember the story being. Though it shows more of her parents and her relationship with her father especially. This film is in no way like Snow White and the Huntsman or Maleficent: updating tales in an edgy and darker way for the 2015 young generation. It's actually good. There's no big surprises, it's the old good and kind Cinderella we all knew before just told in the best and most grounded way it could, while still maintaining the Disney Magic of the original. However, it drags on a little bit at the beginning but they're settling and building characters so I can understand that. Still some of the characters are a little cartoony at times, such as the two step-sisters, which can make the movie awkward for grown ups. Children are going to love it but from time to time it is quite uncomfortable. However, the movie does a good job showing that she is the best person ever in the worst possible situation, living with the worst people ever. As I said before, it's an accurate representation of the tale I (and most people) grew up with and now it's another live action movie and it is what it is, but there's not much twists and turns. Moreover, Cinderella brings back the traditional Disney experience and I liked that it actually took me back and prove that they still can create Magic. Indeed, shots all look great and performances are functional: Lily James is good and Cate Blanchett is also great in the evil step mother role. This movie teach things like in the Classic Cinderella story, it's about accepting a person for who they are and not because of some title or a whole bunch of riches and objects that they own which is a pretty good message for children. It maintains that message and tells it in a respectable way. Finally, children will love this movie but adults can actually come and have a good time as it's not too childish and there are a lot of emotion towards the end that doesn't feel phony or superficial. Overall, nothing is new or ground breaking in this film but you don't need it to be. It will bring the tale to a new generation in a very good way.",Cinderella
141,stephendaxter,Good retelling of a traditional Disney tale,7,8 April 2015,"Cinderella was the next live-action remake of a classic Disney film. I wasn't a huge fan of the direction they took Maleficent, all of the changes they made from the original Disney story made the film less enjoyable. Thankfully they stuck very close to the original story and didn't make unnecessary changes. But even though they stuck with the same story it didn't take away from the enjoyment of the film. Even though I knew how the story turns out they executed the major events well and even had some new scenes with a little more focus on the Step-Mother. They even did a good job at transferring the mice into the live-action environment without making them too much like cartoons.The casting for this film was all great, Lily James did a good job as Cinderella and was very believable as the princess. Even Cate Blanchett as the Step Mother did such a great job that you just love to hate the character. Even Helen Bonham Carter for the short time she was on screen was amazing and really gave a very positive and uplifting tone to the film. In the end this film really captured the tones of the original film and was a good translation from animation to live- action. As a family film it was entertaining to watch for pretty much the entire time. - 7.2",Cinderella
142,tapio_hietamaki,A pretty but needless rendition of the classic feature animation,7,6 July 2015,"The very existence of Cinderella (2015) surprised me the moment I heard Disney was producing such a movie: I was aware that there was a trend of making fairy tale movies, but after lukewarm outcomes I thought that fad was dying. And Cinderella, really? What more could there possibly be to say of that story? Not much, it seems. Kenneth Branagh faithfully adapts the classic Disney feature animation into a live-action movie. His choices are playing it safe and he treats the story and the original animated movie with respect. He even keeps the little pet mice in.The movie largely rests on newcomer Lily James' slender shoulders. She delivers an adequate performance but is by no means stellar. As expected, the show is stolen by Cate Blanchett as the Evil Stepmother. I also liked Richard Madden's Prince - you might know him as Robb Stark from Game of Thrones. His scenes are the best in the film. The anachronistic Helena Bonham Carter is her usual weird self.The castle is a little overdramatic with its CG-rendered courtyard, but the mansion where Cinderella lives is furnished beautifully. The famous dress is good-looking, too, although it's ridiculous to claim that the Fairy Godmother kept the old dress (supposedly just making a few improvements to it). I also noticed that Lily James' waist is impossibly narrow, especially compared to her chest.I preferred Drew Barrymore's Cinderella movie with its simple rural charm, but I suppose this is worth a watch too if you really like fairy tales.",Cinderella

Found it infuriating to watch Cinderella be treated like that; just stab them with a fork, poison their food or something!Kudos to the casting crew with casting Lily James and Hayley Atwell as mother and daughter; there were some scenes where Lily James looked a lot like a younger version of Atwell.The sets and the costumes were absolutely amazing and beautiful but I did find the carriage to be ugly and overdone.The highlight of this film would most definitely have to be Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother; to see her playing such a good fairytale icon but still with her quirkiness.I've seen it once and don't have any intention of watching it again.",Cinderella

145,rprince-832-6294,"A good update, but not an altogether outstanding film",6,14 March 2015,"-Cinderella (2015) movie review: -Cinderella is the latest live-action update of Cinderella by Disney. I really should not have to explain much more than that. Really. If you do not know the story, look it up.-As far as live action remakes of cartoon/animated films by the same studios go, this one is comparably better than Maleficent.-The story is the same. With some minor backstory and a well-treated love story, nothing much varies from the original 1950 film. So on the bright side, no iffy changes like Maleficent. On the down side, this film took no chances to be impressive beyond visuals.-The film took a while to get moving, but was pretty well-paced after that.-The acting was really good all around. Cinderella stars Lily James, Cate Blanchett, Richard Madden, and Helena Bonham Carter, who all do an on-point job.-The characters are a lot less shallow than the original, which I really appreciated.-The music was very fitting and had some really magical moments, but it is still a generic soundtrack.-It had no musical numbers, which was nice. Nothing against musicals, but the chance to deviate from other Cinderellas helped it.-The CGI was not great. But the costume design and production design made up for it.-As a whole, Cinderella was a good remake. It had good acting, good production value and art direction, and the way they changed some outdated elements worked very well. It is nothing that impressive on its own, but because it has the original to be compared to, Cinderella is worth seeing in theaters, for those who are interested. If you are not, you won't care about the film.",Cinderella

The prince is more developed as a character, the step-mother is still great, and Cinderella is great too. I think this Cinderella is more quiet and with that a quiet beauty and strength comes through her and it really shines. I love this movie and I will always love to watch this one and the original one.",Cinderella
148,danielharden,Another One,6,3 July 2016,"Everyone knows the story of Cinderella. She's treated like a slave by her evil stepmother and ugly stepsisters, she goes to the ball, meets the prince and leaves her slipper which the Prince then uses to find her again to live happily ever after. The End. This remake of the 1950's Disney classic tells this same story only this time in live action. Although the film isn't going to gain any points on originality, the film is beautifully made and does more than enough to gain points elsewhere.Firstly, the acting is great. The casting interesting as it shows off the best of British, from well established names such as Helena Bonham Carter and Derek Jacobi, to relatively new, up and comers such as Lily James and Richard Madden. The cast is great but a special mention would have to go to Lily James. James is perfectly cast as Cinderella and does a great job with this film proving to be one to watch out for as she will be going places in the future. Alongside the British majority is Cate Blanchett as Cinderella's evil bitch of a Stepmother. Blanchett does as you would expect from a two time academy award winning actress, she knocks it out the park. The acting as a whole is superb and plays a huge part in the enjoyment one can have with this feature.With a mostly British cast also comes a British director. Kenneth Branagh stays behind the camera to direct this adaptation, and he does so brilliantly. The visuals are beautiful, from the settings to the costume you can tell that a lot of hard work has gone into making the animation literally come to life (or at least live action). Branagh's vision is a mesmerising one that is made complete with great acting that I'm sure Branagh is responsible for also. Who better to deliver great performances from their cast than a fellow thespian acting as director.Overall Cinderella is well made re-telling of the classic Walt Disney tale. With great costumes, acting and direction this remake is one that will astonish little girls of today as the original would have done back in 1950.",Cinderella

Cinderella feels like a retread of the classic original and as a result has me wanting to watch that more than this one.

150,diand_,Mechanical update,5,13 April 2015,"This version is based on the original Cendrillon from 1697 by Charles Perrault and the animated Disney-movie of 1950. It is a standard movie with little risks taken in order to satisfy all age groups. Although most fairy tales were much grimmer than the watered-down versions we now present to children, here it neatly follows the formula and is almost painting by numbers, as you can expect from a director like Branagh. Pacing is however well done and two scenes stands out: the moment when the fairy prepares Cinderella for the ball and the reverse at 12 midnight have a lot of energy and drive and are well executed.The true excellence of the movie lies in the work of cinematographer Dante Feretti, who gives a rich and interesting color and lightning palette to several scenes and the wonderful production design of (his wife) Francesca Lo Schiavo. Actingwise Helena Bonham-Carter has the best role as the fairy and Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine has some scenes where she surprises, but a more villain-like interpretation of her role (when allowed) would be more interesting as her talents are wasted here.The movie played out very well with audiences in Berlin, but then they are usually in favor of mechanistic movies with a clear story, which this movie certainly is.

153,paul_3-960-896774,Does justice to the animated but stand on its own,8,14 April 2015,"At first, I was not necessarily convinced that a Cinderella live action film would be interesting but Kenneth Branagh at the director's chair & Cate Blanchett as the stepmother made me rethink my position. The project became less of a silly little film with these two on board.Cinderella was a beautiful film, very tasteful, colorful, touching and classy. It's a very different Cinderella but it had the spirit of the animated film. The stepmother, Cinderella herself, and the prince were different, they had more substance, they multidimensional and that's mostly true for the stepmother and the prince. They are not filling up space, they were more than just window dressing the Cinderella show. The stepmother made more sense, you could actually understand how she came to be that b*tch in Ella's life. The prince is no longer a pretty boy whose name no one bothers to mention, he's a character with hopes and dreams, and sliver of personality to make him interesting. They even played off the fact that a girl confined to the attic, who likes talking to animals is a bit weird - cute weird but weird still -, which made the movie feel real while managing to keep the magic and the wonder intact. The ensemble cast really elevated the film, they embodied the characters we came to know and love but portrayed them in quite a unique way. @wornoutspines",Cinderella
154,JPfanatic93,Updated and outdated,7,10 October 2015,"Okay, so this movie serves us a most old fashioned fairy tale imaginable and displays a shockingly conservative view on the role of women. Nobody will deny it. But if you can swallow that, it's indeed quite as magical a movie experience as it aims to be (and not even in obnoxious 3D, for a change!). I don't think the studio is excusing reverting to old social values, it just acknowledges a classic tale without feeling the need to utterly change it by updating it to appease a modern audience. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, as this movie proves much more enjoyable than similar recent rehashes of old glory like Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland, which were quite bland and forgetful despite making the female protagonists tough and independent. Both qualities are sorely lacking in the victimized Cinderella, I admit. But this movie seems to say 'Oh, the heck with it! Let's embrace such ridiculously backward gender patterns for a change and acknowledge our true classics as they used to be, not as they should be today!' If Disney meant to say explicitly that women are either weak willed victims or total bitches with this movie, you honestly think grand dames of cinema like Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter, let alone promising new faces like Lily James, Holliday Grainger or Sophie McShera, would voluntarily have signed up for this slap in the face of their sex? I think they just recognized the obviously outdated romantic plot for what it was and decided to run with it just to enjoy getting a chance to play such outrageous roles, so seldom seen today. And for the better, since if they occurred more often, that would indeed be suspicious and uncalled for. But it's not wrong to indulge in reactionary storytelling every once in a while, to appreciate just how much female roles have changed since the days these types of women were seen everywhere on the big screen.Plus, the movie is at least a little modern in other regards. There's a black guy playing the captain of the royal guard in a court full of white folk. And him and the prince certainly seem like close chums. That wouldn't have happened in the original animated classic for sure. What a long way we've come!",Cinderella
155,lucasversantvoort,Unexpectedly wonderful,7,11 May 2015,"It's a curious thing; a remake of one of the most well-known fairy tales of all time. I doubt anyone's going to see it expecting a gripping new storyline. I'd seen Disney's 1950 version, but to be honest, I never really cared for it. I've always felt it lacked a certainsomething. Maybe it was just too bland. So, naturally, I went into the 2015 version with mixed expectations to say the least. Fortunately for me, I found the end result to be incredibly surprising and, most importantly, quite heartfelt.I doubt a plot summary is needed, but just for the sake of reviewing: Cinderella is a happy little girl who lives with her mother and father. Instill in her, are (naturally) virtues of innocence, kindness and courage. Her mother takes ill and dies however and this changes her father. He tries to kindle a relationship with a certain Lady Tremaine (aka The Wicked Stepmother) who turns out to be a mean, nasty woman. When Cinderella's father unexpectedly dies during one of his business trips, Lady Tremaine practically takes over the household and forces Cinderella to do all the work. Cinderella of course, out of the kindness in her heart, agrees and finds solace in the little pleasures in life. One day, however, she's had enough and flees with her horse. There she meets Prince Charmi-uhh, Kit, as he calls himself; he's reluctant to reveal his identity as a prince out of fear this will change her behavior towards him. The prince is instantly smitten, not just by her looks, but (importantly) by her way of thinking. They both return to their fortresses of solitude, where they endure with what's expected of them versus what their hearts truly desire: Cinderella is eager to see Kit again and vice versa, but Kit's expected to marry a princess for the good of the kingdom. Then, Kit announces a ball where everyone, both royalty and commoner, is invited. There, he will choose his bride. Naturally, he ardently hopes the girl whose name he doesn't know will be thereWhat I find most heartwarming about Cinderella is the earnestness with which the story's presented. In a time where you can't make a film without including the requisite winks and nods à la Tarantino, it was very likely Cinderella would be treated the same way; those annoying winks and nods through which the director basically says 'haha, I don't truly believe in the story and I'm hiding behind thinly veiled cynicism and references to show how clever I am.' Thankfully, director Kenneth Branagh and co decided to play it straight. They present the story without cynicism, apart from that supplied by Lady Tremaine of course, and in doing so create an experience that's unexpectedly involving which is especially impressive considering pretty much everyone knows this story like the back of their hands.It also helps that the acting's quite good, especially that of leading lady Lily James who truly succeeds in conveying Cinderella's innocence, kindness and courage. It's also nice to see that Robb Stark successfully fled Westeros and found a new kingdom to lead. Seriously though, despite sporting teeth whiter than a Colgate commercial, he adequately conveys the prince's amazement and sheer wonder at having discovered a girl who goes against the way things are, which of course is what he subconsciously desires, to rebel against the rules enforced upon him (marry for profit vs marry for love). And of course there's the lovely Cate Blanchett who gets to ham it up as the Wicked Stepmother, though the film does allow her some room for nuance. Speaking of whichEven more interesting are the little changes in the narrative here and there. The two most significant changes are the fleshing out of the stepmother and the addition of politics. Rather than having the prince be some faceless nobody with a handful of lines, the film fleshes out his situation a bit. We see how everyone around him, including his father, pressures him to marry for the good of the kingdom. This not only adds a layer of political intrigue, minor though it is, but it allows us the opportunity to get to know the prince a little and cheer for his success in reuniting with Cinderella. The stepmother is fleshed out as well. Not significantly so, mind you, but just enough to suggest a tragic backstory. The film occasionally hints at her reasons both for wanting to marry for wealth and for despising Cinderella.So yeah, I'd say Cinderella's a massive success. I highly doubt a live action version of the classic fairytale could've been executed any better. Whether it's the highly appropriate lack of musical numbers, the comic relief which is quite good and not intrusive, Patrick Doyle's score, the acting, the more fleshed-out characters, it all works. Ironically, what I remember most of the 1950 Cinderella is how little I remember of it; this one, however, I think I'll remember for quite some time.",Cinderella
156,SivakumarBalachandran,A flawless remake of the classical timeless tale which is visually enchanting,8,14 March 2015,"Cinderella the timeless tale of a beautiful girl and the magic involved in her life. Over the years we would have heard this story so many times in so many versions like in form of cartoon, plays, musical drama version, character march in Disney land etc. But this movie that was made the original custodian was promising and seemed like a perfect or definite live action version of this lovely story. The movie coming from the house of Disney looks so authentic and the first point came to my mind was the production design and values. Awesome art works, make up and fashion design throughout the movie.Story! – Really who in this world doesn't know the story of Ella? In short the lead girl Ella's life turns upside down after her parents' death she gets tortured by her step mother and step sisters. But she continues to be kind and courageous towards life. Unwilling to leave her family home and not anywhere to go Ella tries to make the best with her situation. Everything was miserable until she encounters her love the Prince Charming known to her as ""Kit"". With help of the fairy Godmother's magic she attends the royal ball (arranged by the king to find a girl for his son prince Kit) and the prince falls in love for her. With this head over heels situation he hunts his love of life with the crystal shoe that she left with him during the ball. Then all ends well so called 'Happy Endings'. With top notch performances the movie is a safe transition from classical animation to live action movie. Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett was so convincing in her role as Lady Tremaine the step mother of Ella. Anastasia and Drizzela step sisters were also portrayed well by the ladies. These sisters turn the ""Ella"" to ""Cinderella"" when Ella wakes up with coal ashes in her face which literally means ""Cinder"" hence her name Cinderella. Lily James as the Diva performs well in her role. But some where I felt Amy Adams or some other female talents of Hollywood could have been considered for this title role. Richard Madden as Prince charming looked really charming in his role. Last but not the least the main part was the shoes was created beautifully using Swarovski crystals. Overall this was a perfect adaptation of the timeless tale on screen. Well done Disney!! Looking forward for some more timeless fairy tales in live action form.Over all I would rate 8 on 10 for the authenticity of the tale and the flawless remake.

159,rjsf96,A Suitably Magical Retelling of a Fairy Tale Classic,8,6 April 2015,"A 'Cinderella' reboot does not exactly touch on new ground for Disney. But at least Kenneth Branagh's 2015 live action adaptation is filled with enough heart, warmth and magic to see it through to its spectacular end. It is perhaps an all too familiar tale that is not changed or mixed up in the slightest. Yet, this does not mean that 'Cinderella' is less magical for it. In fact this adaptation is so well realised and made that it might just be the best adaptation of 'Cinderella' yet. I certainly was not expecting to say that and remained sceptical. But I need not have worried. With Branagh behind the camera and an impeccable cast in front of it, 'Cinderella' rarely slips up.We are drawn into this fairy tale world from the off. Ella is a young girl of fair and pure heart. Her family simply adores her. When her mother takes ill she encourages Ella to be ""kind and have courage"", this becomes Ella's ongoing motto when turmoil and distress befalls her. So time passes by and her father informs her that he has wed a new wife who has two daughters. He says that he must leave her, but will be back soon. Ella now played by an extremely talented and stunning (in terms of acting and beauty) Lily James who greets her stepmother and two stepsisters with a warm and welcome heart. But, when her father falls ill on the road Ella finds herself alone with nothing except dreadful company.Her stepmother (a wicked and cruel Cate Blanchett) and her stepsisters (the sinister Sophie McShera and evil Holliday Grainger) make Ella's life a living hell. They even rename her Cinderella because her face is covered in soot and ash from the fireplace. Cinderella is given endless chores much to the delight of her stepmother, who only sees her as a reminder of her dead husband and what he has left behind. All that Cinderella wants is to go to the Royal Ball, where the Prince (a charming Richard Madden) has extended his party invitation to all in the land. He does this so that he can meet Cinderella again whom he only saw briefly in the woods. His father though has other plans. He wants his son to be wed a Princess of wealth and not an ordinary girl. But the Prince's heart lies elsewhere.Cinderella's Fairy Godmother is played by Helena Bonham Carter, one of Hollywood's finest actresses. Of course she overwhelms us here, even if she has a role that amounts to the briefest of cameos. She transforms Cinderella with a gorgeous dress, a grand pumpkin carriage and lizards for footmen. She warns Cinderella that the magic will wear off on the last stroke of midnight. Cinderella says joyously ""that's more than enough time"". Yeah. Sure it is. So Cinderella does go to the ball (that her stepmother tries to stop her from going to) and I am sure that you know the rest.'Cinderella' never looks anything less than exquisite. The colour palette literally bursts out of the screen and engages an assault on your very eyes. The costumes themselves are wondrous and fittingly elegant. One could simply stare at every frame of 'Cinderella' with nothing but the highest contempt. Although, Kenneth Branagh does not take many, if any risks, he directs the film with formidable talent. This is no doubt helped by the fact that he has helmed many Shakespeare adaptations for the big screen. Branagh was definitely the right choice for Director, so I am praising Disney very highly because they gave the job to the best man for it.'Cinderella' represents everything that a modern Hollywood reboot should be, with an engaging and ever so likable cast, an immense blossoming romance with enough impact to make you feel sweet sixteen again, jaw dropping cinematography, magical music and the highest order of Directing on offer. Although, the film could do with taking more risks and changing the story to make it more unique, 'Cinderella' is suitably magical and for a Disney film that is more than enough. Accept your invitation forthwith to this Royal Romance.",Cinderella
160,vistheindian,A good fit,7,24 March 2015,"After the death of her father the kind young girl named Ella (Lily James) is tormented by her evil stepmother and stepsisters. Ever hopeful, Ella's life is changed forever when she meets her love with a little help from a fairy godmother. With the current trend of live-action remakes of Disney classic animation, it was only matter of time that Cinderella was given the same treatment. Rather than making the story grittier like other recent remakes, this movie sticks to bright fairy tale tone. This tone is both the source of its charm and hindrance to being exceptional. Cinderella may not be the perfect fit, but it'd be hard to deny the Disney magic of the film brought to the big screen.Full Review:After the release of movies such as Snow White & the Huntsmen and Maleficent I was surprised to hear that Cinderella would not go dark and gritty. This story certainly has the possibility to do that but I was appreciative of the bright and light tone. As much as I enjoyed the tone I suspect there will be few people who won't find that as appealing.One unexpected thing I found to be great about the movie was Lily James as Ella. Most of the time when I see an actor playing a Disney princess role it comes off as some Disneyland act on one of their streets. However, Lily James embodied what the animated Cinderella would be like. If I was a child I'd be convinced that she was a real princess the way she floated, moved, and also was strong enough to not lose hope and be kind despite the evil in her life. Additionally I really like that Cinderella felt like a fairy tale. Colourful costumes, animals that act human, the pure evil vs. good, magical fairy godmother, all of that helped the escape into this bright world. Director Kenneth Branagh brought realism to the story while keeping the fantasy intact, much like what he did with the first Thor film.A problem that no one would dispute is how predictable the movie is. Yes, of course everyone knows the story of Cinderella but doesn't mean a new twist could be added. For instance in the recent Disney remakes we got to see the point of view of the villain. Now I don't want the whole movie about the step-mother, but fleshing out her motivation would've added something new to differentiate it from the animation. There's only one line that hints at something deeper with the step-mother, but it feels like a throwaway. Essentially if you've seen the animation, you've seen this movie. As I mentioned before what might be a hit or a miss for people is the tone of the movie. I personally liked it, but I wouldn't be surprised that if people complained that the film felt campy. That may be true at times, but I saw that as a result of making a faithful adaption of the animation. So I just mention this for you to consider when deciding to watch this movie.Obviously if you have a daughter that won't stop singing ""Let it go"" this is the perfect movie for her to go crazy over (in fact there is Frozen short playing before the movie). At the same time I think this is a movie that even adults can enjoy and escape to a fantastical world. The faithful adaption does mean it is very predictable and there is a level of campiness to expect. Still, Lilly James as the titular princess and Kenneth Branagh directing helped make this a charming film to watch.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Cinderella

I had a little trouble inserting myself into the wold of the film. Except for perhaps one or two scenes, we're to believe she's some kind of perfect angel and it felt a bit strange.

162,Barev2013,Lush lavish fairy tale for kids and adults alike,10,23 March 2015,"Branagh's Cinderella is a grandiose Children's film for Adults. Viewed at Sunday Matinée (March 15) at the Capitol theater, KASSEL, Germany, dubbed into German. I saw this a month ago at a Berlin press screening in English and did not appreciate it for its splendid entertainment values because one sees a film differently with a press audience than with normal people ~ which is to say ~ analytically, instead of just enjoying it and letting it wash over you. Moreover, subtitles tend to distract!This time around I was fully engrossed on the entertainment level and found the Cinderella character (fresh young fair-haired English Rose Lily James) to be quite touching while hating the stepmother and not giving much of a hang if she was being played by a great actress like Cate Blanchett. I even liked the laid back Prince Charming (Richard Madden) this time and all the secondary characters were more in focus, especially the heavy set black orderly (Afro-English actor Nonso Anozie ) so supportive in his many scenes, while Swede Stellan Skårsgard was a classic dying King, father of the Prince. The mice who are Ella's constant companions were now more important and the big dance scene, Prince and Alice, at the first çastle ball took on a more important meaning as an extended bravura set piece. The early scene in which Ella, out for a solo horseback hike in the forest, meets the Prince, also on Horseback, and their ensuing saddle to saddle flirtation, was absolutely delightful. Not wanting to intimidate her he claims that he is merely a subordinate worker at the palace, not the heir apparent to the throne, and so the stage is set. And let's not forget the magical glass slipper that fits only one foot -- the incredible crystal work on this prop of the year turns it into a nearly living character of the tale. What a fantastic piece of footwear! The castle settings and surrounding countryside were splendorous -- how much real location and how much special effects hard to tell because it was so we'll done that it all blends together seamlessly. The final scene, after. the prince finds Ella imprisoned in the attic and slips the glass slipper onto her waiting tootsie to confirm what we already know, and then makes her his princess up on the castle balcony before a vast crowd below is almost on the scale of the Pope appearing on the balcony of the Vatican. Magnificent close to a totally enthralling fairy tale. Credits roll to the satisfaction of all. Even the detestable stepmother and disgustingly amusing step sisters. When Ella is walking off from her house with the Prince, now King, and the evil stepmother, Blanchett, suddenly appears on the stairs as a pitiful figure -- Ella, remembering the words of her father -- always be kind and friendly -- says In German airily ""Ich verzeie dich"" = I forgive you -- the moral high point of the film -- when she could easily be have said ""Have her beheaded"" -- then the final clinch on the balcony.Some hard-nose critics have derided the picture on the grounds that it is too lush, too saccharine, and that Ella is much too submissive, but that is something like complaining that The Shootout at the O.K. Corral had too many guns .... I didn't hear any complaints from the packed house of German kids and mothers I saw it with in the provincial city of KASSEL",Cinderella
163,stefstars,Only Live Action Remake Worth Your Time,9,8 December 2019,"This was the one that started it all for the recent back to back Disney live action remakes. However, all the remakes that followed can't capture what this one did, nor hold a candle to it. The message throughout the film about the importance of being kind, patient, and good despite the circumstances is put to action so wonderfully. Everyone is fantastic in their roles, I loved Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother - can't imagine any other actress bringing the proper whimsical quirks to that role. As recent films have shown, Disney has a habit of fixing old ""plot holes"" from their animated classics in the live action remakes. This one has that too, in the part where the prince is searching for Cinderella, as well as how the stepmother and step sisters don't instantly recognize Cinderella at the ball, but these little loose ends are fixed in such a subtle way. They're not forced or cheesily done like in the live action 'Beauty & The Beast.' I highly recommend this one, it was done in a really fantastic way. As my title to this review mentioned, it's really the only live action adaptation that Disney has made (in recent years) that's really worth your time. Wish they had accepted the success with this one and left it as their only live action from the decade.",Cinderella
164,mwcrunner,A great adaption of the animated classic,8,7 April 2016,Cinderella was one of the many great Disney movies I've seen as a kid. Cinderella has a great lesson to all good children of the world. Never stop dreaming cause it may actually come true. Lily James makes a great performance as Cinderella in this. I still really dislike Cinderella's stepmother in this just as much as I do in the original animated classic. Cinderella's stepsisters are kind of funny in this but I still dislike them too. Richard Madden also makes a really good performance in this as Prince Charming or Prince Kit is what he's called in this version of the Disney classic. Also Fairy Godmother is neat in this too. The dress that Cinderella wears to the ball in this is really beautiful and so are the glass slippers. The ballroom scene in this is great too and it really warms little children's and their parents hearts just like the original animated version. Also just like at the end of the original animated classic Cinderella and the Prince live happily ever after. Definitely a great Disney story.,Cinderella

Cate Blanchett plays the evil stepmother so well it amazes me and I love the little cgi mice they are so adorable
oh and the blue dress was the main highlight of the film I mean I'm so used to ever after from the 90's but now this has branded me in the heart and became my favorite
it also has great character development to a story we know so well just love it and will buy it next time I get paid",Cinderella
166,drawlife,"It's good, nothing more.",7,12 March 2015,"Now I am not the target audience for this film, but I quite enjoyed this film. Compared to Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella gets the cartoon to live action adaptation correctly. Though I haven't seen Into the Woods, but judging based on just the two I listed, Cinderella is worth the admission. What made me intrigued was the fact that Kenneth Branagh was directing. I went in with mediocre expectations, and that also probably has something to do with the fact that I enjoyed it. I have to say Branagh does a better job directing this film compared to Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit and the first Thor. This feels more immersive and more epic in terms of scale. Branagh also gives the characters as much as many layers he can, and does it quite well. I don't watch Downton Abby at all, but Lily James is quite good in the role. She brings a lot of charisma and is overall just a sweet person who has a lot of kindness within her, but also stands up for herself when she needs to. Now I really hate love stories and romances in mostly all films, but I found that Lily James and Richard Madden had pretty believable chemistry. I know people always talk about chemistry this and chemistry that, but it's true. If the chemistry isn't there, then it doesn't work, and thankfully in Cinderella, it works. Give credit to writer Chris Weitz for allowing Prince Charming(Madden) to meet Ella before the ball, allowing for some growth. Cate Blanchett is excellent in the role of the stepmother. She's quite despicable and the film kinda dives into why she is so cruel. I didn't particularly enjoy the stepsisters, I found them to be too over the top. Helena Bonham Carter also gets a good role as the fairy godmother as well.From a production standpoint, it's quite impressive and one could tell they put a lot of attention to it. Now this film is heavily loaded with CGI and special effects, there are moments where it looks gorgeous and they weren't too distracting, only because the narrative is engaging here and there. The film really does take it's time to get started and can get boring, but when it gets started it gets a lot more consistent in the pacing. I did have some minor issues with the mice. I found them to be distracting, mainly because it is live action. By all means it's very faithful to the cartoon source material, but just seeing her hanging out with rodents, it took me out of the film. This is by far Branagh's best looking film. Pure eye-candy, with surprisingly some layers and depth to the characters and the story. It's very earnest and it's very straight forward and gets to the point. It doesn't do anything completely new, but it's a well crafted and can be entertaining here and there. Most fairy-tale adaptations, more often than not have a new spin on the character, making princesses an action hero, but here in way, despite it not bringing anything new to the table, there's something refreshing about a princess not turning into a sword-wielding action heroine. It's an old fashion film, but to quote Agent Coulson(Clark Gregg) in The Avengers, sometimes we all need a little old fashion. 7/10",Cinderella

168,fdbjr,Visually and Auditorially Sumptuous -SPOILER,8,20 March 2015,"I was reluctant to see this movie, as I sorta know how the story turns out. But it was Friday night, the critics had been kind to it, and what the hell.As it turned out, I liked it quite a bit. With the exception of Cate Blanchett, the actors were nothing to write home about, and the roles hardly challenging in any case. There were jokes, but too few of them. What gives the movie its value, however, is that it is visually and musically magnificent. There is one visually striking scene after another, and the lush score by Patrick Doyle is a certain Oscar nominee. It was terrific.The spoiler really isn't much of one. Kenneth Branagh realized that the appeal of the story lies in two places, the entrance of Cinderella at the ball, and the recognition scene with the slipper. I don't have much to say about the second, but as to the first . . . no one ever has, or ever will, stage Cinderella's entrance as effectively as in this movie. It realizes every girl's fantasy, a daydream come to life. (I write this as a solidly heterosexual male, but the father of daughters).As for those reviewers complaining about lack of originality or repetition . . . really - what did you expect when you bought a ticket for a Disney production of Cinderella? 'Pulp Fiction'? Come on . . .",Cinderella
169,daviddaphneredding,extremely heart-warming,10,24 April 2015,"This Disney movie, based on Charles Perrault's 1600's ""Cinderella"" story has magnetic appeal; yes, it is one of the most heart-warming movies I have ever seen. And while it is ""fun for the whole family""(which is good) this movie is not necessarily ""Kids' stuff"". It is a wonderful love story for people of all ages. The young, very pretty Lily James portrayed well the young mistreated girl who was, in her own way, very sweet and very strong, when circumstances would have discouraged her along those lines. Definitely too, though calmly so, Cinderella was very brave. You wanted to choke Cate Blanchett who was Lady Tremaine the mean, horrible, and horrible-looking stepmother; she was convincing. As for Helena Bonham Carter, though she was a pretty and sweet fairy godmother, she was also a nut.(!) Robert Madden not only had the looks of a young prince, but also acted well in this cinematic piece that part. The countryside is beautiful, the music is warm and endearing, so for all those reasons it ought to be acclaimed as an outstanding production.",Cinderella
170,blackwidowis7cool,Magical and charming,10,6 November 2019,"It's a more emotional and engaging movie than the original and one of my top favourite remakes of all time. Lily James does an excellent job of playing Ella ""Cinderella"". She sings excellently (as I found out in Mamma Mia 2) and she brightens up every scene she's in - a true joy to watch. She also makes the character very relatable and I was crying at several of the emotional scenes.
Cate Blanchett is perfect as the Evil Stepmother. As my brother put it - she owns the character. She brings a slight humanity to the character, but at the same time makes you utterly hate the Stepmother.
It has some similarities to Ever After, another adaption of Cinderella, but only minor and is different to all Cinderella adaptions that I have seen.
The Stepsisters were great comic relief and everyone does a great job in their respective roles. The movie even gets away with not revealing the names of some of the important characters.
The person who plays the Fairy Godmother (I've forgotten her name) is perfect for the role. She makes the character funny and lovable.
Awesome and amazing movie! Highly recommended.",Cinderella
171,YJLcool,A gorgeous remake of the classical fairytale for the new generation,8,13 April 2015,"Cinderella has always been a love fairytale about the courage and kindness of the human spirit that we all familiar and love. It's been a very long time since a fairytale has been told as it is. There have been many mediocre or disastrous results when the filmmakers took creative license with fantasy fairy tales to make it more 'exciting' or action-packed. Still remember Snow White and the Huntsman, Maleficent, Into The Woods, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, Red Riding Hood? That's what I mean.This film is a straightforward live-action remake of the classical fairytale without the musical aspect. Yeah, there's not much singing this time around, just drama...Rather unusual for a Disney film. It was faithful to the original story, with some wonderful additions or improvements to the story as well. The film does a great job in showing us an enchanting, mesmerizing, fantastical world with its spectacular costume designs and special effects. Every scene of the film is a delightful watch, filled with beautiful, vibrant colours.The love romance between Cinderella and the Prince Charming is more than just 'love at first sight' and not just for looks and status after meeting only once. The Prince was captivated by Ella's ability to see the world as it could be, with heart, courage and kindness. Ella was amused by the Prince's humility and courtesy without knowing that he is royalty. The film also showed that the Prince has a loving and respectful relationship with his father, the King. Their relationship is built on love, trust and mutual respect for each other. Moreover, I was quite surprised that the film actually includes the origin of the name, 'Cinderella' - a cruel nickname for Ella by her stepmother and stepsisters by adding 'cinder' to her name because she used to clean the cinders from the fire and sleep near them to warm herself when her attic room is too cold.Lily James does a fine job as titular heroine Cinderella, a kind and innocent girl who's true to herself from beginning to end. If all of us could see the world as Cinderella did, the world would be a far more better place. I believe that Richard Madden managed to charm a lot of female audience's heart (not just Cinderella's) for his humility, chivalry and relentless pursuit of happiness and love. Cate Blanchett plays a convincing role of the evil stepmother, Lady Tremaine. The film added a bit of depth to the character, by portraying her as a woman who's changed by hardships of reality, eventually believes that status, power and wealth is everything and that kindness or love is not free.In the film, Ella asks the Prince whether he is willing to accept her as she is, and it's her goodness and sincerity that truly made her happily ever after in the end. From someone who grew up watching and reading classical fairy tales, it's great to see this old fairytale being brought back to life with such charm and beauty. A gorgeous remake of Cinderella for the new generation.Frozen Fever: A Frozen short film about Elsa desperately trying to prepare the best birthday celebration for Anna despite her not feeling well.

172,georgecoffeynewyorker,Fabulous,10,5 May 2015,"The film starts off with a new born Ella(James) and as she grows up, and a very joyous young daughter to a Mother(Atwell) and Father(Chaplin). Sadly the mother or as the story starts with ""Sorrow"", passes away. Her mom leaves her with these wise words: ""Have courage and be kind"". The father asks for Ella's permission for ""Happiness"". The father wishes to remarry. Hence the evil stepmother(Blanchett) and her two step sisters Anastasia(Grainger) and Drizella(McShera) one being ""Intelligent"" and the other ""good looking"". Sadly the father then passes away, So Ella is then made out as a slave. During one of her chores, she is in a fire pit. Something like that. She is then called ""Cinder"", Ella, hence the name of the film. She runs out on the horse and encounters a Stag(Male deer), that is being hunted by the Prince(Madden) and his crew. Cinderella reminds them: ""Just because it's what's done doesn't mean it's what should be done"" Wise words as I says on my Facebook. Then afterwards, the prince goes back to his father, the King and tells he would like to extend the ball invitation to ""outside the noble"". So Cinderella hears of this, and wants to go to the ball, however, the Evil Stepmother doesn't want her to. She attempts to sneak. So the ""Hairy Dogfather"", ahem Fairy Godmother(Bonham-Carter) appears and transforms her mice into Horses, a pumpkin into a Carriage, and 2 Lizards to Frontman. The Fairy godmother(Bonham-Carter) asks if she has an object, Cinderella replies ""dont know what that is"". The Fairy Godmother warns that the spell will be broken by ""stroke of midnight"". Cinderella and the Prince are dancing and walking the grounds of the Castle, when the stroke of midnight occurs, so the spell begins to be broken. So Cinderella runs out on the Prince. The prince attempts to search for her and extends a Royal search. Through the help of her pet mice and her BEAUTIFUL voice, he finds her. The film ends on a Happyily every after with ""Have courage, Be kind and Believe in MAGIC"".So overall a very emotive film, with great comical performances by the Goose, especially when the human says ""I can't drive the carriage, i'm a goose"". ahahah. Very well done. The music in it, fabulous. I can see it will do very well. I would expect an Oscars 2016 nomination. No doubt.",Cinderella
173,g-87877,The movie basically restored the story.,7,14 April 2020,"Cinderella is one of the stories that little girls all over the world often hear in their childhood. It can be said that the movie basically restored the story on the basis of the fairy tale, from the casting to the scenes, costumes I think are satisfactory, a childhood dream is fulfilled. By the way, Disney's female villains are more stunning than each other.",Cinderella
174,Gelaos,Old classic with modern look,8,18 September 2018,"Before I begin my review, I must state my ""Cinderella bias"": There is a Czechoslovakian version of Cinderella from 1973, called Tri Orisky pro Popelku (Three Wishes for Cinderella). It is different variant of this ancient tale than the Disney version. To this day lot of Czechs and Slovaks consider it ""the best Cinderella"", it has aura of timeless classic and has benn broadcasted on primetime every Christmas Eve in last 10-20 years, attracting millions of viewers each year. For long time it's been the only Cinderella I've ever seen. Sure it's nice, but I never understood why so many people love it sooo, sooo much. When I came across Brannagh's Cinderella, I happily expected something different. Well, characters in this version are weak (but that's typical for many fairy tales), Cinderella seemed to me a bit too extroverted and cheerful, her stepsisters could've played bigger part in the story. But the cinematography is fabulous, central duo is immensely loveable, the music is nice, and Cate Blanchet does fine job as a stepmother. My only problem with this movie is Cinderella's passivity - I liked more the dynamic, provocative approach of the ""czechoslovakian"" Cinderella. Anyway, I was really happy that even in 2015 someone can take old traditional story and recreate it into modern, beautifully crafted movie, yet still keeping that tradition in it's heart. From now on, this is my favorite Cinderella. Well done!",Cinderella

I can only assume that the people who write those mean spirited and spiteful reviews are mean spirited in nature and they are likely to be raising mean spirited kids too! Maybe they should avoid watching
fairly stories altogether. This not a sort of movie I would normally watch, in fact I have not watched such a one since my distant youth, but I found it truly moving. The acting was skillful especially Blanchet's. The only odd note was the captain, I suppose it is obligatory to have at least one Afro American actor in a movie these days but I did not see any others!

178,StregaAsuka,Bibidi Babibi Boo !!,7,18 December 2018,"Not my favourite Disney cartoon pic but I liked this version much more, it's more real, cause we all know that animals don't talk! LOL! Yes, we all know the story by heart and if you had a childhood I bet you've seen the 1950's cartoon version, so you shall watch this one too.The story is (almost) the same as the cartoon one but is has been changed a bit. We get to see Cinderella's mother and we get to see that she met the prince before the ball, which it makes more sense. Cause would you marry someone who just met at a ball and dance with them for like one minute? NO! Here they story is more developed, which is gratifying. There are no talking animals, but the mice are still there in their way. We get to see the iconic pumpkin scene, wich is quite hilarious by the way and also the iconic ball scape scene which I think is brilliant made, cause if you are on one side of the castle and the exit is at the other side of course you must run all the way!! Not simply puff, appear at the exit.If you pay attention you will observe that there is a colour pattern for all characters, like Cinderella always wearing Blue and her sisters pink and green (like in the cartoon). Moreover, all things have bright colours which make it all more magical. Then, there is also the music, some tones form the original version and new versions that will keep you humming through all the film and after (not like a Let it Go kind of thing but still).As for the performance, Lily James is terrific as Cinderella, cannot imagine anyone else playing her, plus, this Cinderella is more independent that the one of the cartoon version (thank god). Opposite here the is Cate Blanchett, who as always is awesome in her bad-ass stepmother role! So could please keep giving her mean characters? Then we have Rob Stark err I mean Richard Madden with his brightly blue eyes as the Prince who is definitely charming and we can forget the part where he falls for the prettiest one( if only for one second!!).Above all, that the cast is mainly brits gives it last touch to this classic fairy tale and for 100 minutes you will forget about anything else.

The moment when she tells her stepmother ""I forgive you"" gives me chills and brings me to tears every time we watch it.The casting is perfect, and all of the actors pull of their roles flawlessly.

180,BatBanks,Once Upon a Time...There Were Wonderful Cast,7,23 September 2015,"Even though I don't care for Cinderella story, this was a good live-action adaptation of the 1950 classic animated film; They add some of the original tale into the film and it beautiful. The entire ensemble cast did good job (except Lily James) especially Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother who channeling Joan Crawford and also the entire cast is British (except for Cate and Stallan Skarsgard). Richard Madden (aka Robb in Game of Thrones) is cute as Prince Charming he also did a good job with his relationship with his father the king(Derek Jacobi), the captain, and Cinderella and his character development. They had beautiful costume design especially Lily James costume it really Oscar-worthy. Kenneth Branagh did good job of direct the new version of Cinderella. Lily James is miscast as Cinderella, she was not pretty enough and can't act (remember she just came out in British soap opera Downton Abbey) Her crying and surprise is not convince. Drew Barrymore is still the best looking Cinderella. The role of Cinderella is difficult, it true they should've have cast AnnaSophia Robb, Elle Fanning, or Taylor Swift (but she can't act) as Cinderella.

Her step sisters look better than her, hell her STEP mother looks better. The woman prince Charming was supposed to marry looked better. I mean is Disney trying to make a statement? It's what's on the inside that counts? Well, then why did they keep saying in the movie that Cinderella was so beautiful?When they make actors say something that FORCED it's sad. Bad writing and casting. Did the costume department do the casting? Did they hire this actress since her waist fit the dress? Did they hire the prince since he had thunder thighs? None of the main actors looked good. I'm sorry they looked deformed....maybe I am so used to flawless movie stars....BUT if you are going to hire homely actors don't have people in the movie constantly pointing out how ""handsome/beautiful"" they are.....Oh the rest.....well it was really boring. I doubt a 5 yo child would find this entertaining. It was just so sad. Drek all the way as well. Disney is so desperate making this movie.

182,russellingreviews,A refreshing take on a familiar tale,7,22 March 2015,"Does the world need another Cinderella film? Cinematic rating: 3.5 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 3 starsWho has not heard the story of Cinderella? It has been told throughout the ages. In written form, animated, told on stage and as live action films. For those select few who do not know the story, here is a summary or refresher. Cinderella is a tale of Ella (Lily James) who lives a charmed life, but inevitably it takes a few tragic turns. The dire consequences of her father's poor choice to remarry after the loss of her mother causes Ella to suffer through the abuse of her step-mother Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters. She finds herself as the indentured servant of this evil trio and despite promising her mother to ""have courage and be kind"", Ella begins to lose hope. In a twist of fate, she comes in contact with Prince Kit (Richard Madden), who is immediately entranced by her inner and outer beauty and makes it possible for all the maidens of the kingdom to come to the castle for the ball to choose a wife. This is where the magical spin begins to unfold. What would a fairy tale be without a fairy godmother, the love of animals and creative usage of garden vegetables? Ella makes it to the ball, but will this be a modern day retelling of this fairy tale that twists the story of love, kindness and evil stepmothers or will it remain true to the Cinderella tale told throughout the generations?This telling of Cinderella can be summarised in one word, refreshing. Director Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Hamlet) did not try to make a big political statement with his telling of the Cinderella story, no feminist rants or judgement of the political systems of the time. Also, there were no grand surprises, it was a sincere telling of a fairy tale. Love, beauty, kindness and evil were all portrayed without apology and straightforward. Men are allowed to be men and women are allowed to be women. Ella was a strong and appealing character, but managed to be portrayed with refreshing innocence. Lily James (Downton Abby) managed to toe the line between strength and beautiful fragility. Richard Madden (Game of Thrones) was masculine and delivered as a prince charming that did not take himself too seriously, but understood his obligations. Cate Blanchett pulls off villainy at a level that shows the greatness of her acting range. Also, even though she was briefly on screen, Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech) was perfectly cast as the fairy godmother. The rest of the cast, who are all regulars of Branagh's previous films, supported this lovely tale of young love and overcoming tragedy. The acting was supported by gorgeous sets and cinematography which allowed for a journey into another world. A world of recent European splendour and a magical forever ever after. Within all of the grandeur and beauty, there seemed to be some confusion defining the target audience. Sitting in the theatre with a multitude of little girls in blue dresses, it was hard not to notice that they were not captivated by what was on the screen. Why? Branagh's interpretation of this familiar fairy tale is for a mature audience. It seemed intended for an audience that would appreciate the deeper considerations of life, love and family. Which did not make for a bad cinematic experience, merely a shift in expectation and the provision of lines for many would be Prince Charmings in the future. For the sake of the audience it was intended, Cinderella has no objectionable material, but the mature themes of death and abuse might be a bit much for younger viewers. There is overarching themes of kindness and courage in lives of the characters. Thankfully there is a balance to these themes and a reality that not all things will go your way in life. With the inevitability of these difficulties, the lesson can be found in how you choose to respond to them. Including the highs and lows of family, which is a deeper theme that is opened by Cinderella. It is seen in the portrayal of Ella and her parents, the prince and his father and even in the contrast of the treatment by Lady Tremaine and her daughters. Throughout Branagh's depiction of family, he is able to show that the deep love of family helps throughout the most difficult of situations. Love, kindness and family are not new elements to this sort of film, but there is a freshness to these familiar but classic elements. If you go into this film hoping for a new or darker portrayal of Ella's adventures, you will be disappointed. This is a fairy tale that delivers a magical journey that requires a suspension of disbelief, but will help to revive the most pessimistic in the audience, if you are willing to believe. Leaving the cinema... Do we need another Cinderella film? Sure, it was worth the time. This Cinderella tale is for mature audiences that desire a bit of escapism. It will not be for those looking for a harsh dose of reality, but it was a refreshing telling of a familiar tale. Kenneth Branagh has found his key directorial niches. Shakespeare and fairy tales. Bravo, Branagh, Bravo! Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about death of a loved one? (Psalm 34:18, Revelation 21:4) 2.

183,maxastree,"Conservative, over-polished movie featuring top actress Kate Blanchett",6,27 April 2015,"This movie was overrated by film critics in the US, insisting that its charms were somewhat conventional, but that Cinderella was 'great' in some way.It isn't - the only great thing about the movie is its occasional sense of surging melodrama (none of which is too real or hurtful, of course) which is pretty much run-of-the-mill for Hollywood major releases, and of course Kate Blanchett, playing a scheming, overindulgent and nasty woman of privilege. While her performance is great as usual, she's literally being paid to recreate a character she's done better elsewhere.The problem with the movie is that its overproduced, and its lack of modern social values make the whole affair oddly embarrassing and suffocating; Cinderella - a charming, wholesome girl - is orphaned and doomed to a miserable life at the hands of an evil stepmother etc, you know the story and thats EXACTLY how it happens in this movie. Every CGI scene, set dressing and costume design is professional, slick and notably overproduced, perhaps to maintain the attention of younger viewers, but it also adds to the impression that this is an expensive movie made by market research stats and previous sales data, not any attempt to make a convincing creative product.Much like a good period drama, each set design is painterly and well-composed, and the acting is all dreadfully earnest, with an occasional twist of self conscious humour in the script to appeal to older viewers as well.What you tend to realise after leaving the cinema is that Cinderella is a fable about a young girl accepting the status of caregiver and secondary character in the story of her own life, and that basically, her glamour and beauty are the only traits that might lift her out of disadvantage toward 'the good life', in this case a fairytale reimagining of the glamour of old English royalty.",Cinderella

185,prospectus_capricornium,Faithful and Loyal: A Retelling That Brings the Magic Into A Whole New Level,8,13 March 2015,"What sets ""Cinderella"" apart from the string of movies adapted from fairy tales and other popular literary works these days, is that it pays tribute with utmost respect to its original source material. The movie bears little effort to deviate from the animated classic of the same title, and obviously eyes young children as its target audience, making it hardly a reimagining, but plainly a retelling. Through this simplicity, though, the attempt works with immense success.Cinderella, unlike last year's Maleficent's dark take, is sprinkled with bright, vivid glistening colors. Even the stepmother and stepsisters are not as brutal and heartless as we've always remembered them from the fairytale. Well, of course, one can't expect these antagonists to be as kind as we'd like to imagine them to be, but still, that wicked stepmother we always knew, is missing.As always, central to any fairytale, is a lingering message of love, and all other similar anthems radiating around it. Surely, the same can be said with Cinderella, as it emphasizes courage and kindness. Perfection may not be totally applicable, nonetheless, Cinderella's flaws are the very things that let those small yet perfect moments shine: the short yet magical encounter between Ella and the fairy god- mother, the first time she met the prince, and the royal ball dance. Added to that, is a little humor too, courtesy of the fairy godmother and the little creatures that assumed bigger forms (some in human) through her magic, and, surprisingly, the step sisters.Cinderella is barely something new, but what makes it memorable is that it brings something we've always only imagined, into life, taking nothing from it or adding something to it to push the story off its original course. On moments when Ella and the prince are put into the spotlight, the musical score conjures its own magic to bring the magnitude of romance into magical levels. It will come across as just another story we love, but maybe that's what makes it strike a chord, an experience worth going through again and again. Visually stunning and emotionally-charged, Cinderella hits home in delivering this universally loved story.",Cinderella
186,Lee-107,Fairytale eye candy,7,4 April 2015,"All the people crying hoarse about what a bad role model Cinderella is seem to have forgotten that this movie is actually, you know, based on a fairytale and is a fairly literal adaptation. It's not like Disney or Kenneth Branagh promised to make anything revisionist and then shortchanged the audience on that count. If people did not want to watch a story of an ill-treated girl whose fortunes change when a prince falls in love with her, then maybe they shouldn't have stepped inside the movie theater to watch 'Cinderella'. It's not like they did not know the story already.And actually, I don't even think Cinderella is such a bad role model. Sure, she's mesmerized by a handsome dude she spoke with for five minutes and is most happy to leave her family home which she vowed to protect her whole life when the prince comes to take her away. But I think the real message of the movie is to be positive. In spite of all the misfortune and ill-treatment that's meted out to her, Cinderella stays optimistic and hopeful. It's easy to feel negative and defeated, especially when, in our times, bad things happening in the world far outnumber the good. It's easy to get affected and feel indifferent. But to shirk that negativity and continue on takes courage and shows real character. So instead of whining about how not a feminist role model Cinderella is, can't we not focus on the real takeaway of the movie - Be positive and affirmative and let karma take its course.Why do we expect every movie to be moralistic, anyway? Just watch it for the beautifully lush faux Scottish-alpine landscape, the gorgeous sets and even more gorgeous people. I found Lily James as Cinderella to be less annoying than her as Lady Rose in 'Downtown Abbey'. She's not that bad... Richard Madden is a perfectly serviceable prince charming. He actually managed to not get killed for marrying for love and not for advantage ;) Oh, the Freys will be so disappointed! I love Cate Blanchett and can't help but think she was under-utilized. I know they couldn't have shifted focus from the main character but I still wouldn't have minded some more of Blanchett's delicious wickedness! I think for Stellan Skarsgård this was a 'one for the paycheck' role. Perhaps, like Derek Jacobi, Skarsgård took up his role because of his previous association with Branagh, but he deserves so much better...Anyhoo, there are lots of movies to look forward to taking umbrage at, people. So cheer up!",Cinderella

188,shinedowness,More Emotion and Humor Than the Original,10,27 May 2017,"The original Cinderella film when Disney was fairly new had less feelings, humor, and talking involved. Sure, this 2015 version of Cinderella's personality has her weaker. But, she goes against her Stepmother's wishes in a politely pathetic way. Richard Madden is a stellar performer in the sense that he can alter his facial expression, vocal tone, and move in a way that is believable to me. Then, you have Cate Blanchett who has a stunning physique that entraps me into her gaze... almost. Lily James, on the other hand, needs to branch out towards broader roles to show people she is capable of portraying various characters in different lights to me. The father of this film was made by an actor that did enough as much as they could given that they had a very restricted time in doing so unlike the more main characters that were more focused. Helena Carter did a splendid job in playing as The Fairy Godmother as she always is handy dandy when acting on set whether it is a cinematic or theatrical one to me. I felt more humanity was put into this film because of the work that Kenneth Branaugh did. Also, Patrick Doyle, the music coordinator, gave me satisfaction within this film. Patrick and Kenneth usually work together, so I assume that is probably why this film worked from those 2 people's familiarity with each other. Otherwise, this film is top notch overall. Some people may not think so and put negativity within the midst of anything Disney-related. I sense negative vibes of Disney are growing, because some people are becoming ""jaded"" from seeing all there is to see in the film business from it being 2017.",Cinderella
189,dutchs-1,Sparkles Like a Glass Slipper,10,30 March 2015,"What a masterpiece. The craftsmanship is superb, from the way Cinderella's dress swirls at the ball, to the magnificent if CGI scenery, to the camera angles. The pace is brisk and never bogs down, and there are no superfluous musical numbers. (Now if we can only get Disney to do their animated films that way) The characters reveal themselves the way they should, by how they relate to others and to events, and not through long-winded exposition. When Cinderella and the Prince meet for the first time in the woods, just from the few words he speaks, you can tell he's a good - and humble - person. Derek Jacobi is great as the old, sometimes grumpy, but wise and good king, and his death scene where he tells the Prince ""find that girl"" is intensely moving.Nonso Anozie is appealing and imposing as the Captain of the guards, and having a black actor in a major role as one of the heroes was a wonderful piece of casting. The back-story of how Cinderella became a servant in her own home is well told in enough detail to make you feel the tragedy. And how I love Cate Blanchett. I'd love to see her in a heroic role, but when she plays a villain, she gives it her all. As the wicked stepmother, she created one of the great Disney villainesses. She oozes arrogance and menace with every word and gesture. The scene where the Captain finally punctures her balloon takes but a second but is intensely satisfying.But the show-stealer was Helena Bonham Carter as a klutzy fairy godmother (""I'm your hairy dogfather,"" she introduces herself) The creation of the coach and the metamorphosis of the animals is beautiful and comic. One of the footmen, a changed lizard, helps Cinderella from the coach, and when she says she's just an ordinary girl, he says ""And I'm just a lizard. Now go!"" Then a bit later, when a bug flies past, he may be human in form but he's still a lizard at heart. The poster shows Cinderella with ample cleavage in her gown, but at the ball, the swirl of her skirt was so mesmerizing I never noticed at all. You might think it's odd to emphasize the swirl of a ball gown so much, but watch the movie and see it for yourself. And yes, we all know how it ends, but there are a few twists thrown in to make you wonder how they're going to pull it off. There are just so many things to like in this movie. And just to ice the cake, the end credits reprise some of the songs from the original animated feature.",Cinderella

191,thomas-w15,Have courage and be kind!!!!,8,16 March 2015,"Over the last ten years, at least ten films included some form of the classic tale of Cinderella. Maybe one or two of those was decent. What so many of those films tried to do that was the overall cause for their demise was they each tried to change the story in some way. What this Cinderella film did was stick to original story without any big changes. All Disney had to do was implement there never-ending charm into the movie and it worked perfectly. With great directing from Kenneth Branagh, great performances from the entire cast, and perfect production design to top it all off, Cinderella turns into pure magic.The only thing I conceived that might have made this movie slightly better was if they just created one more obstacle that Cinderella has to overcome before her happily ever after. It seemed to me it did not take much for her to achieve her fantasy ending, but this is a minor error from my perspective and this movie was still gold without it. There are so many great things that all came together in this movie, it is hard find a good one to start on. The directing is a good place to start I guess. Kenneth Branagh to me always has a style to his directing, in fantasy movies, where he takes a screenplay that nearly any other director would make look horrendously stupid on the screen, and make it work. Watching Thor(which was directed by Kenneth Branagh) to Thor: The Dark World(which was not directed by him), it was apparent to me that they switched directors because I could not get over how all the scenes in Thor: The Dark World that took place in a mystical land looked so stupid. Branagh makes a fairytale such as Cinderella which many consider to be silly and turns it into a breath of fresh air. Branagh also hired the perfect production, costume, and make-up and design teams for the movie because the whole look of the movie was exactly what it needed.The acting in this movie was the best I have seen in a while. Everyone played their roles down to a tee. The one who really stole the show was Cate Blanchett, who played the evil step-mother of Cinderella. She owned every scene she was in and it was amazing how fast she got you to hate her. Lily James, who plays Cinderella, also did a fantastic job. Not every girl can play a role where the character has to live her life with kindness and courage no matter what comes her way. Richard Madden(from Game of Thrones), who plays Prince Charming, was truly just charming in every single scene he was in. He got the audience to fall in love with his character immediately and never let it go for one second. I would also like to point out how great of a message this movie had. The message was to live your life with kindness and courage no matter what and just to be positive in general. It is a great message and it is one I wish more films would make. If you do not like fairy-tales at all, I suggest you steer clear of this one. For the rest of the people, I highly recommend Cinderella as your first choice walking into the theater.

192,jchen-07237,A Fairytale to Remember,9,20 March 2019,"Cinderella is certainly a truly beautiful masterpiece. It doesn't matter what other people say. No matter how old I am, I am going to cherish this movie. The costuming was beautiful, very elegant. I love the unexpected twists and how Cinderella saves herself. I did not approve much of the classic Cinderella story, because the prince needed to determine a shoe size to determine his true love. But this movie, it shows that true love comes in any kind of love, and it's just an amazing, simple but elegant story.",Cinderella

194,ssra_25,Surprisingly pleasant,10,18 January 2019,"I was never much into the whole Cinderella story, no matter how it was told. Sure, I know the story because I read it when I was a kid, but it never impressed me.However, I really enjoyed this movie. I don't care it's cliché (most fairytale are), I don't care it depicts the classical story (I despise ""original"" remakes anyway).What I do care is that it's well played, it has good costumes, good effects, good lines and if the actors are also beautiful (which they are btw), than all the better. :) Besides, Cinderella ought to be beautiful, otherwise she wouldn't be Cinderella. :)And now I can't believe I waited almost 4 years to see it. :)",Cinderella
195,Astralan,Not the Grimms Ashputtel I know.,6,21 March 2015,"Sorry, people, this is just a retelling of Disney animated version. Having been a kindergarten teacher early in my career, I read through almost the entire unabridged Brothers Grimm books and had many of my collected memories of fairy tales crushed. I have to give them kudos for the beautiful way this version was retold, produced and acted. Everything was polished like a new penny and served with a very fine score by the wonderful works of Patrick Doyle. However, for some reason the CGI seemed a bit stale specially with the rodents. They really didn't need to bring the original animated mice names back for this performance or give them special characters. Only older people would have this association, not the younger children that had flooded the theater on this rainy day in Austin. I was surprised there wasn't more chitter chatter and squeals of delight from 3-8 year old group. Actually, they seemed more impatient and restless though the theater was fairly quiet. Now, I'm not one to put down a movie production from changing the story. What Jackson did with Lord of the Rings was nothing less than genius in my opinion, but nothing comes near the original books. Same with Harry Potter. For me, the script was already written, and I was hoping for more. I'll get over it. And I didn't flunk the movie!",Cinderella
196,Sweetigal85,A beautiful improvement of the original fairytale,9,29 May 2017,"This movie is what the original Cinderella SHOULD have been. It provides excellent backstory and is much darker than the at times silly cartoon. Ella is more of a believable character in this version and her extra encounter with the prince prior to the ball is very poetic and wonderfully done.I had never seen Lily James in anything else before and I honestly hope that this leads to a wonderful career for her, she deserves it. She was a truly beautiful Cinderella and portrayed the poor, optimistic girl perfectly. The expressions on her face spoke volumes, almost more so than the actual dialogue. Very moving.It goes without saying that Cate Blanchett was an incredible wicked stepmother, but I will say it anyway. She was chilling at the part, at times it was jaw dropping just how cold and cruel she was to poor Ella. I thought the step sisters were wonderful as well. They were exactly what they needed to be. Stupid, cruel and selfish. The complete opposite of Ella. I really liked the origin of how she came to be called Cinderella too. Very telling of her terribly tragic life.This movie will make you wish that you were closer with your family than you probably are. Ella's love for her parents who pass is palpable and your heart breaks with hers when she loses them.Her chemistry with the prince was great as well as their exchanges of dialogue. I love how she basically nags him the first time they meet, such a nice modern twist. Whereas in the original cartoon, he simply sees her across a crowded room and deems her the most beautiful woman at the ball. This version gives Ella more substance and shows that the prince is intrigued and appreciative of her unique personality and not just her stunning features.Helena Bonham Carter is fabulous as The Fairy Godmother, just as she is in everything else. The visual effects of the dress and all of the magic are absolutely dazzling, very well done.The only reason I am not giving this a perfect score is because I really wish they would have dropped the mice for the live action version. I really felt that they cheapened the seriousness of the story and that their presence pretty much made Ella seem like she was losing her mind. In the cartoon it was whimsical that she enjoyed dressing and singing to mice, but in the live action version I found it just strange and sad. I wish creators would realize that certain things just do not transfer well from cartoon to live action. But that was my only issue with the whole movie! This film is a definite must see for people of all ages, especially those who believe in true love and happy endings.",Cinderella
197,johnbirch-2,"Way, way better than most reviewers make out!",9,13 February 2016,"This is actually a pretty decent retelling of the Cinderella story - and that from someone who is clearly not the target audience. Some extra background, amusing jokes, some quite neat special effects. All fun stuff.Clearly, as a production, it has been heavily influenced by the way Cinderella pantomimes are done in the UK, which is no surprise as almost everyone associated with the production is British. Arguably the sisters are no ugly enough (in panto they'd be played by men, but I imagine that would have been a step too far for American audiences), but the wicked step-mother is glorious, but also has more of a back story which is a bonus.As for the detractors...A large group of them do not like it because its not like the Disney cartoon, like a Disney cartoon was ever the epitome of accuracy and interpretation. Quite what the heck these people would make of some UK pantomimes where Prince Charming is played by a woman I have no idea... but seriously come on!! You'll be complaining about live action versions of Alice in Wonderland next.And yes Cinderella is not exactly the model of modern feminism, nor does she defend herself and take on her sisters and step-mother as some reviewers would wish. But what do you expect from Cinderella, for heaven's sake? It's a several hundred year old fairy tale. If you want a modern, self-possessed princess then go and watch Frozen.No - this is a perfectly enjoyable, bright piece of candy-floss, and there is nothing wrong with that. The acting hits the nail on the head, the design is great, the special effects more than passable. Sit back and enjoy. I did.",Cinderella
198,katiefanatic-791-306918,fantastic!,10,20 September 2015,"this is probably the most beautiful film you'll ever see in your life! despite that, i can't believe lily James and Richard madden never did a chemistry test! their chemistry was out of this world, so much so they're collaborating with Kenneth brannagh next year on 'romeo and Juliet'. I don't understand all the people that say this film contributed nothing new! were you asleep during the film? they did a whole backstory with the prince and his father, we actually meet Cinderella's parents, AND we're given an explanation of why Lady Tremaine hates Cinderella. it's not a good one, and certainly no excuse for her poor treatment of the girl, but an explanation nonetheless! as for the people comparing this to 'ever after', i loved that film as well but Danielle can be considered a huge biotch compared to Cinderella. i would much prefer Cinderella as a role model to my future daughter. she is humble, she is thankful. at least she has a roof over her head and food on the table. would you rather her leave and live on the streets? i wouldn't. survival is key. all in all, a fantastic masterpiece that shows good really does triumph evil.",Cinderella
199,divyanka,"Nothing new in this movie and very lame characters, but plot is alright",6,5 February 2017,"The trailers for this movie made the Cinderella seem extremely annoying and a really bad actress for the movie. However, the movie itself was not as bad. It is disappointing that it is just a remake of Cindrella with no other twists, turns, or interesting ideas. I'm not sure why so much money would be spent on a literal mimic of what's already been done. It could have been so much more interesting with an actual change of plot, etc. Also, the character choices were very bad, especially the fairy godmother. She was wearing disgusting, naked clothes that are inappropriate, the makeup wasn't even nice and soothing, but garrish. It's like they couldn't recreate them to look like the time they belong to, but instead, made them look like today's morons. Cinderella was an annoying character and the juvenile 'be kind, have courage' was also annoying, because it is not applicable in the world. This movie should have been new and different. *6/10*",Cinderella

Kate Blanchett (the Stepmother) played her role excellently. The story is as enchanting as ever, the handsome cast doesn't miss a beat, while the costumes and set design are wonders to behold. Anyway its the 4 or 5th remake of Cinderella, and its fine. Everyone knows what to expect. Its certainly a family movie..One thing to watch with young kids are the 2 death scenes when the mother is dying and the King is dying. Nice scenes, will have you in tears.

201,Shadowking1001,Typical fairy tale fare,6,2 March 2020,"It's pretty much what you would expect. Although we all know the story of Cinderella, I was hoping for some plot or character twists that might make the story more interesting. One thing I really disliked was the interpretation of her mother's last words. Although a good message ""Be courageous and kind"", this was interpreted as ""Be a wimpy doormat"". You can be courageous and kind while still standing up for what's right. Cinderella unashamedly allows ""the house that her parents loved"" to be abused by obviously evil outsiders without saying Boo. What an insult to the memories of her parents. Mind you, unlike the traditional fairytale, Cinderella here is not a small child, but a young woman who was outgoing and popular in the village, so I am disappointed that she lacks any sense of boldness or justice. The CGI was adequate. Story is predictable. So in summary, it's a good light-hearted family movie where you can walk away with a smile. However, this is not a movie for you if you are seeking new interpretations or interesting plot twists.",Cinderella
202,annlevtex,Cheesy With Terrible Message For Girls,5,29 July 2020,"I can understand wanting to do a ""post modern"" take on a classic. Stick to the fairy tale, make her sweet and loving, bring in the Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother and the Magic, yada yada, happy ending. But this takes it too far. I know from watching ""Ever After,"" a far better telling of the story, that Cinderella can be a warm-hearted, kind girl who can fall in love and be vulnerable and romantic while STILL being strong and smart and red-blooded enough to feel anger, fight back, defend herself and fight for things that matter. This one is just a sappy, passive victim. Not just ""kind,"" but squishy and kind of a simpleton. For all her talk of having ""courage,"" she doesn't use any of it to protect herself or even the Prince for that matter. Toward the end when she is locked in the attic, presumably forever, she just dances in circles and hums to herself.....she ""isn't sad"" because she is just sustained by her memories of dancing with the Prince and her happy childhood! Oh, ok then! Her little rodent friends have to engineer for them to hear her singing, just like her Fairy Godmother had to get her to the ball, etc. Ugh. The movie is well-crafted and the acting is pretty good in terms of suiting the style and target audience, I guess. The (not so ugly) stepsisters are fun. The animation is well done, though there is too much of it and it just makes the whole thing feel phony and oddly claustrophobic. I thought the dance scene was well choreographed. But overall, it felt simultaneously over-stimulated and tepid. This is not the heroine I enjoy watching or would want my daughters to watch, even for a fun romantic escape movie. Also, while I certainly don't agree that the character or the actress who plays her is ""ugly"" as a few reviews said (seriously?), she's not particularly beautiful either. Generically pretty with nice hair (which probably isn't hers) and smile. I actually kind of like that because she's more relatable and it shows you don't need to be a 10 to be lovely and lovable. Still, I'm not blown away by the character's beauty or her personality. Or her clothes. The ball gown is a garish color. It's clear a lot of thought and work and MONEY went into it so it could and should have been a bit more spirited and memorable.",Cinderella
203,jonathanmark-77048,Best film of the year so far,8,7 May 2015,"Plot: Ella lives in a farm with her lovely parents. After her mom dies, her father fells in love and marries another woman who has two daughters. When her father leaves on a business trip, he passes away and Ella stays with her stepmother and stepsisters who treated her very badly and named her as Cinderella. However, she stills being brave as her mother told her to be. Luckily she meets a man and her life changes forever.This retelling of the classic Disney story is done very well and classy. The costume and set designs are amazing. Lily James does a very good job of playing Ella surprisingly giving her a stronger character than any adaptation of Cinderella has ever done. Cate Blanchett is great as the evil stepmother, she is vicious, greedy, and overall stubborn which was what the character was. The actor who played the prince also did a fine job as well, bringing stability to his role and had good chemistry with Lily James.The special effects are very well done albeit fake looking sometimes because of the CGI, but not too bothering to the point of annoying the audience. Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother is very miscast. She is basically playing the roles of every character she played in Tim Burton's films, it's nothing new and nothing original.While not a perfect film, Cinderella captures the original's heart and tone and never attempts to be darker like (Snow White and the Huntsman). The film is worth seeing with your family whether it's at the movies or on home video, you should at least watch it once.",Cinderella
204,AdrianOlonan,"You Shall Go to the Ball with 2015's ""Cinderella""",10,15 March 2015,"Trailer releases for a 2015 remake of ""Cinderella"" by Disney has been met with some negative comments, such ""this is a cash grab"". I have to disagree with it. This is miles away from the 300-page book ""The Hobbit"" which is turned into a film trilogy at almost 3 hours each.Yes, there are similarities from 1950 Disney's version because this is basically a remake. But if you're like me who can barely remember that animated film, watch this without comparing this live- action version to the earlier version.There's actually a universal form of the fairy tale, so there's really nothing that can be spoiled. This French fairy tale is one of the most popular tales of all time, so most of us know the story. Looking at its entertainment value, it's very good. You can really feel Cinderella's inner conflict. Her mother tells her to have courage, which is to know your enemies and face life's challenges. But at the same time is recommended to be kind, which is to find some goodness in your heart. Yes, you can kick your enemies' asses with kindness, but not all times.Visual effects are great and wide shots are spectacular. Some changes are added up to catch up to the 21st century, such as the CG effects, push-up bras, cleavages, and the sexy Fairy Godmother. With ""Frozen""'s influence, the romantic meet-up is considerably revised.There are black characters in the film, and please don't be shocked. Blackface had been done before and it's horrible. ""The Last Airbender"" and ""47 Ronin"" did the same thing to Asians and they suffered an ill fate.I think this is a progressive move for Disney itself, which has a historical string of racism. Well, it's nice to know that Disney is becoming sensitive and open-minded for its global audiences (Hello, ""Big Hero 6""!)This is some of the best remakes I love, aside from the 2011 ""The Three Musketeers"", which is also set in France.

205,agblum,"Not Outstanding, but a Charming Film",8,14 March 2015,"""Cinderella"" is the new live action version of the story from Disney, based on both the classic Animated Film and Novel. In a nutshell, the movie has a lot of charm, and some moral lessons for the younger viewers, and though not outstanding, enjoyable. The movie is not a musical like the classic animated film, telling it's story straight dramatically, being mostly family friendly with a PG rating. Lily James plays ""Cinderella"", with a lot sweetness, as you watch her title character keep her cheery disposition as she goes loss and a lot of trial. The film features a lot well know actors in the supporting cast, including ""Game of Thrones"" Richard Madden as the Prince, Cate Blanchett as Cinderella's Stepmother, and Helan Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother. There are a few moments in the film where I wish they would do another take of certain scenes– The acting isn't always consistently good from scene to scene, but as I mentioned, the film has a lot of charm about it, that you mostly forgive that. For kids it's wonderful. There is some adult flavor, but you need to go in accepting it's mostly a kids or family film, and you'll enjoy it. 3 out of 4 Stars - 8 out of 10.",Cinderella

(There are certainly plenty working class people in this version of Cinderella, but no one is in rags or going hungry in this well run little kingdom.) Forgiveness protects you from bitterness, hatred and the need for revenge. Be kind to strangers. They might be angels in disguise. You can be a decent person without letting people walk all over you. Being good natured is not a weakness, but a strength. Speak truth to power. Exploiting people will backfire in the end. Strength comes from within. The ends don't justify the means. Surround yourself with true friends. Be kind to animals. They are also your friends. Face adversity with courage. True beauty is within you! Accept your child for who they are. Be honest with those you love.I could go on and on! There are so many good messages in this version of Cinderella you could actually make a contest out of it!Isn't it amazing that Hollywood can tell a story with zero physical violence and without going overboard on being too campy or boring? Here's a fairytale where you actually care about the characters! I have to admit, tears welled up in my eyes more than once, and I'm a grown man!",Cinderella
207,yannigk,Excellent magical fairy tale for girls of all ages,8,18 March 2015,"‪Cinderella‬ was colorful and magical right from the first shot of the randomly-flowered-colorful meadow. The tone of the whole film is warm and dreamy and very much like a classic BBC series.I kept wondering who Richard Madden (the prince) was. I knew Cinderella's mom was marvel's agent Carter (in case you were wondering).. And almost didn't realize Stellan Skaasgard as the Duke. Now I know that Prince Charming is actually Prince /king Robb of the Game of thrones!And how did they make that humongous blue dress look so light? (hint: it's magic!)Cate Blanchett is awesome as always. Her stepmother's laugh was spot on. Helena Bonham Carter's teeth looked a bit weird.. I'm being really picky here.The BEST part is that it sticks to the original of the story. God bless Kenneth Branagh for not changing the story of the first feature animation/fairy tale movie I've ever watched in my life! (I had it on VHS.. or was it hifi beta.. when I was a kid.) No plot twists, no kungfu fighting, no turning the baddie into the fairy godmother (*cough* Maleficent *cough* I hated the fact they ""updated"" the story by not really telling the story and in fact telling another completely different one). It is actually HARDER to remake a movie without changing the story, and still give you a new images and impressions of the same story. Sure you know what will happen, but how it happened, why, that's what this story tells. Not, ""Oh, actually it didn't happen that way, here's my version"".Branagh's Cinderella delves a little deeper into her relationship with her father, their love for each other as they depend on each other for courage and kindness (a message strongly delivered in the film). At the same time, prince Charming (Kit) also gets to show his motives and relationship with his father, another loving and wise figure fit for a king and we see his wisdom being passed along to Kit.Stepmother's cause was also implied, leave it to Cate to bring the subdued emotions and motives to us viewers. We don't hate her, we sympathize her. (And she can still be evil at the same time! Marvelous! Sorry Maleficent, i used to like you when you were unapologetically evil)The actual magic only really happens when Fairy Godmother appeared (i'd prefer an older, more mother-like version, but Helena was fun). Unbelievably beautiful horse carriage and glass shoes! This is live- action fairy magic at its best.I must say that I still preferred the cartoon version of the dress transformation. This one felt a bit too long and melodramatic. The cartoon one was short and to the point but still magical and always made me wondered how they animated the sprinkle effect (did they really draw the sprinkles frame by frame.. They probably did). No wonder it is Walt Disney's favorite scene.The ending was also a little short of thrills for me. The cartoon version had the cat chasing the mice who were trying to save Cinderella from the attic. This added a lot more suspense, which is a bit lacking in this version's ending. The overall length of the movie was a bit too long as well.Conclusion: It's a charming Disney classic, thanks to Kenneth Branagh. If your child hasn't seen Cinderella in cartoon form, this is the updated version to instill a sense of magic in her mind.",Cinderella

Cinderella was never a favourite of mine, but this new version certainly is. The step-mother was given depth and background to her character. All the acting was brilliant. The story had emotion and had me in tears a number of times. It was just sweet and beautiful. Warmed my heart.",Cinderella
211,filmfanperspective,"An excellent re-telling, made with love (****)",8,5 May 2015,"We have all seen this film, in one way or another, at least a hundred times over. How I could possibly get excited for, and then decide to pay for, a retread is beyond logical comprehension. However, trailers for director Kenneth Branagh's new version of Cinderella hinted at a serious side. For that matter, Branagh's involvement alone was enough to take it seriously, and the film upholds my faith. The film is honest and quite earnest, sweet without being saccharine, and heartfelt without being corny. That, in and of itself, is a compliment to all involved. For all of the wallet fleecing they engage in, Disney seems to be aiming higher with their live-action re-imaginings. While they may not be necessary, it is at least refreshing to think that they want to make quality films whilst fleecing your wallet. Cinderella never felt like a fleecing; in actuality, it is one of, if not the, best film of the year thus far.Lily James (Downton Abbey) stars as the titular character. She may not actually be a natural blonde, but make no mistake- she's very much a natural Cinderella. We're introduced to her as a little Ella, as her parents (Ben Chaplin & Hayley Atwell) raise her in a gorgeous country cottage. Her parents instill in her a great deal of kindness, and she exudes the type of grace and beauty one would expect from such tutelage. As fairy tales are wont to do, this all begins to go awry. She loses her mother (Atwell) to death as a child, leaving her father lonely for many years. When Ella is all grown up, her father makes the difficult choice to move on and marry, as he discovers a widow (Cate Blanchett) and her two daughters (Sophie McShera & Holliday Grainger).The new family comes together in the cottage, and there the problems begin. Ella's stepmother is indeed cruel to her, but her motivations are different from we're accustomed to. Sure, her daughters are spoiled brats that treat Ella like a servant and not a sister, but they have motivations as well. This is where the film takes off. By grounding the wicked stepmother and giving the ""villain"" true reasons for her actions, we don't sympathize with her, but we understand. The stepmother and Ella are not inherently opposite people, but they have had inherently opposite experiences. The stepmother sees a great deal of herself in Ella, and naturally, is jealous of her youth, optimism, and beauty. Ella knows nothing but to ""be kind and be courageous"". This sort of interplay may be what drew classically trained professionals in Branagh and Cate Blanchett to the project. The Shakespearean angle of this story, with dreams unrealized and the dynamic of the fractured family must have been just complex enough to interest them. It may help that Blanchett is nothing short of amazing in almost every film she's in.I want to be completely fair to what Branagh and crew have accomplished, for Cinderella is so accomplished that it belongs in the top tier of period dramas and romances like Pride and Prejudice or Jane Eyre before it. Everything from the costumes, set design, and the brilliant score from Branagh regular Patrick Doyle are top- notch, and made this thirty-something male viewer feel comfortable and moved in a world normally reserved for the fairer gender. To that point, other reviews for this film have given the proverbial 'finger wag' to Disney for seemingly moving backwards in the urgent race for narrative gender equality. With Frozen, and apparently everything following, all women must be independent and never wont for a prince or male, if I'm to believe some of the goofy reviews for Cinderella. The prince in this film (Richard Madden of ""Game of Thrones"") not only is completely enchanted with Ella, but pursues her in such a way that he's but a respectful buffoon in her presence. I'm not sure how that translates to Ella being subservient or desperate.Lily James has created a Cinderella performance that allows for the fantastical and still grounds her confidence in a realistic fashion. There's nothing wrong with the romance in this film, and shame on other critics for trying to dig something up that simply isn't there. I applaud all involved for their efforts with Cinderella, and they should be quite proud. What seemed at first like a simple Disney cash grab is actually far more realized and mature than I, or anyone likely imagined it would be. This new version should be the new 'standard', if there needs to be one, for all 'Cinderella stories' that came before and will likely follow. Maybe I am up for more live action 're-imaginings' from Disney.",Cinderella
212,shadowyx12,At least it's beautiful to look at...,6,3 April 2015,"I'll be honest: 'Cinderella' has got to be my LEAST-favourite Disney animated-classic (and least-favourite Disney character). The problem largely stems from the fact that I'm not particularly fond of the source material. In fact, I think that 'Cinderella' might actually be one of the worst stories to adapt to the screen. The only reason why I even saw this movie was because I had a coupon that was nearing expiration (and that this was the only movie playing that would give me Disney-Reward points).That said, Kenneth Branagh's live-action remake of Disney's classic 1955 animated film is breathtakingly beautiful; I wouldn't be surprised if the production designer and costume designer were nominated for their respective categories next year.The story, surprisingly, actually dives into the back-story of Cinderella. In this film, we get to see 'Ella actually interact with her mother and learn the lessons that eventually become instrumental in the development of her personality. Props to Chris Weitz for actually bringing something not yet seen in past adaptations! Aside from that, the rest of the story is as straightforward as can be with a few twists placed in for good measure (that I'm sure you can see coming a mile away). The only thing that kept me even remotely interested in the story was the fact that it was being told from different perspectives and that the Prince himself was given a character arc.Lily James is okay as 'Ella; there is nothing exceptional nor memorable about her performance. She played the character exactly how she should be... RANT: ... And this the main reason why I hate the tale of 'Cinderella' so much: the protagonist - she's unable to progress the story by herself. There is almost always someone else to who takes over the plot just to advance it at its most important points. Speaking about this film specifically, I just hate the fact that she cries like three different times; I honestly stopped caring about her after the second time. I was like 'I know your mother taught you to be nice and all that, but stop being a coward and STAND UP for yourself'. Ugh. (Now that I think about it, I don't think any 'Disney Princess' is as pitiful as Cinderella - maybe with the exception of Aurora, but she's asleep for most of her movie).",Cinderella

214,youyuzhen-07323,good,8,18 April 2020,"Cinderella is one of my favorite fairy tales. First of all, thank Disney for making him into a live-action movie. I believe many little girls have a Cinderella fairy tale in their hearts. They hope to have a prince to marry themselves, or after their parents quarrel, they are afraid to find a stepmother who is as vicious as Cinderella's stepmother, and then lead the same miserable life as Cinderella.
The casting of the film is very successful, Cinderella's",Cinderella
215,beardedmovieguy,"Not Quite Magical, But Not Bad",7,17 March 2015,"Disney seems to be running out of ideas for new movies so they keep going to the well of their classic fairy tales. Now, after how they completely changed the story of Sleeping Beauty in the live action film Maleficent, I was pretty tentative about seeing their live action version of Cinderella, but to my nice surprise, they did not actually change the core story. The Cinderella that you grew up with and for many know and love is pretty much all there, and in truth looks beautiful. Kenneth Branagh does a very nice job directing this terrifically casted movie. Cate Blanchett is in full effect as the evil step-mother, showing off how ugly such a beautiful woman could be. Lily James is great in the title role, personifying kindness and courage as is the theme of the movie. Richard Madden is quite good as the Prince, and the rest of the cast performs adequacy. In fact, the only acting I did not like was Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother, it just seemed a little to on the nose, but thankfully she only is in the movie for a few minutes. Overall Cinderella is a beautiful, nicely shot film that most families will like and most little girls will absolutely love. I can only hope they do as good a job on the live action Beauty and the Beast movie that they are planning to do next. 3.5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://youtu.be/bQR5BJnkn2k",Cinderella
216,j-00900,A beautiful fairy tale,7,20 May 2020,"The story is still an old story, beautifully dreamy, fashion design and art director praise, Cinderella transformation and dancing two scenes are too beautiful. Blanchett really steals the show, Lily James is also quite cute, Helena has less drama, but what other fairy godmother is as interesting as her.",Cinderella
217,JelenaG890,"Well, it looks pretty...",3,9 April 2017,"Well, to start with, I don't think this story's premise is unfamiliar to everyone, but this version tosses in a new message: ""be kind and have courage at all times"" which the title character keeps repeating throughout- even though she is really neither brave, nor even really kind unless it's to the mice she keeps feeding. Nope, instead this Cinderella is just a pushover and also kind of an airhead who actually starts calling herself ""Cinderella""- a cruel nickname her evil stepsisters came up with to mock her, thus truly giving her ""evil"" step-siblings power over her. This Cinderella also has a weird, wide-eyed expression throughout the movie as if saying ""you're so mean to me, but I'm such a good person I'll take it"" to everyone who does her wrong. I'm not sure if that is Lily James' fault, or the writing. For me, the best re-telling of the ""Cinderella"" story is ""Ever After"" with Drew Barrymore. In that film, Cinderella IS actually both kind and brave, saving the prince's life and even using a sword to fight her way out of a sticky situation. The bravest thing Cinderella does in this film is not wear any makeup in front of the prince. If you're looking for a better Cinderella re-telling, I'd recommend ""Ever After"" or even just stick to the original animated film since ""Ever After"" uses no special effects or CGI to create magic.The film does look very pretty, and costumes and sets are beautiful. However, it relies far too much on CGI, if you ask me. Acting-wise, Cate Blanchett is by far the best thing about this movie, then of course she is pretty much great in anything. Lily James, IMO, is just not a very good actress and not charismatic enough to have a lead role in a film. Also, I wonder who decided it was a good idea to put her in a blonde wig without dyeing her very dark eyebrows? That looked strange to me. Richard Madden as the prince for me just did not work.All in all, I'm glad I watched it since I got to see the great scenery, costumes, and a great performance from Blanchett. However, I wouldn't watch it again.",Cinderella
218,PandoraProductions4,The Traditional Cinderella,7,18 March 2015,"The most refreshing thing about this film is that the makers have not added any ""contemporary twists"" to it. It seems to be a trend nowadays to update every old story and give it a modern interpretation. So movies like ""Hansel And Gretel Witch Hunters"" get released, where the characters are ninjas flying around ridiculously and blowing things up.I believe that the makers of this made the right choice in not changing any aspects of the original story of Cinderella.As for the movie itself, it's actually better then you might expect. Kenneth Branagh's direction is predictably over the top, but it actually lends itself quite well to a genre like this. Lily James fits the role of Cinderella nicely. She has a sort of full-hearted geniality that makes the audience like her. While the other characters don't exactly become three-dimensional, they at least have some motivations that make sense. In some movies, it's clear that we are supposed to feel a sense of wonder, almost as if it's being forced down our throats: ""Look at that! Isn't that wondrous!"" But in this film, I actually did feel a sense of wonder and magic, especially during the Chariot scenes. The special effects in this film are not overused; they only become very noticeable in a few key scenes. The cinematography is very lush, as to be expected from a Branagh film. The camera movements tend to be predictable, though. At the screening, I was thinking to myself: ""Okay, they're going to follow the couple to the patio, and then pan down to reveal the crowd of people. Then they'll cut to a shot of the two of them and have the camera slowly move out as far as possible."" And, what do you know, that's what they did! Special notice should be given to Patrick Doyle's beautiful score. Few film composers have his deft touch and it's always a pleasure to hear his music.All in all, I'd say that Cinderella was an enjoyable watch. It's a better then average kids movie that adults will be able appreciate too. It may feel a little underwhelming, but you have to realize that it's a fairy tale movie faithfully and well adapted. Nothing less, nothing more.I'm glad they passed up the opportunity to put in some modern stuff, like Cinderella becoming a feminist and learning karate.",Cinderella

223,VickiHopkins,Fairy Godmothers do Exist,8,13 March 2015,"Oh to be ten-years-old again -- innocent, impressionable, and mesmerized by the idea of meeting my Prince Charming.Cinderella. How many adaptations can this story have? Apparently, not enough. One of my favorites is ""Everafter"" with Drew Barrymore, but this Disney version is pretty much a starry-eyed spectacle of beauty that bedazzles the childhood in everyone.The perfect audience are females young at heart, girls five to twelve, and young teenage ladies. Although this morning on the radio I heard a middle-aged male critic gush over the movie too. Will little boys love it? Probably not, except perhaps for the mice and cat.The Cinderella tale is slightly modified and extended, but it does the story absolutely no harm whatsoever. For the first time in a long time I give Disney kudos for putting together a movie with a message that drills down into your soul. It's the words of Ella's mother before she dies encouraging her daughter to, ""have courage and be kind."" The theme resounds throughout the entire movie and is played out with such precision that the message stays with you. In an age where kids are bullying one another or being the victims of bullies, it brings a beautiful message of the meaning of courage and kindness and the good that it can bring into your life.Your wonderful Rose from Downton Abbey, Lilly James, portrays an endearing innocent and kind Cinderella. Daisy the cook from Downton Abbey, Sophia McShera, plays the stepsister Drizella, accompanied by Holliday Grainger as the other mean sister. Gorgeously attired and mean to the core stepmother is played by Cate Blanchett.Some of the cutest scenes are the fairy godmother transforming the pumpkin, lizards, mice, and the duck into the carriage, horses, footmen, and driver. Their undoing at the stroke of midnight is an hysterical scene of undoing with fantastic special effects. Cinderella is turned into a gorgeous beauty in a blue dress, who twirls around dancing in a fantastic choreographed waltz with the prince. If I were ten, my eyes would probably be bulging out of my head. At sixty-five, I had a huge smile on my face watching the transformation, the ball, and the undoing of the spell.All in all, it's an entertaining movie that is visually stunning. The anchor that holds it all together is the theme of ""have courage and be kind"" that is said time and time again until you believe it to be truth, witness that good prevails, and realize fairy godmothers do exist.Oh, and Prince Charming isn't bad looking either.",Cinderella

The characters were okay (no one was annoying) but if you're going to do a remake why not add new things? Make the characters more interesting and more 3 dimensional. That's why people make remakes. 3. The romance is pretty much the original. I wish they added in a little bit more in to make it really breath taking.This movie pretty much wasted away and forgot what the purpose of remakes are.

226,clearthinkernow,prefer no children see this,7,13 April 2015,"While this is fine for telling the story of Cinderella, several things bothered me immensely. Ella's dresses are too low cut and combined with the use of a corset, give us 'heaving bosom' every time she attempts to show emotion. I'd like to say I never want 'heaving bosom' in a children's movie. The fairy godmother's bosom was pushed so far up that it nearly met her collarbones. Makeup was mostly terrible and a huge distraction. The stepmother's lower eyeliner in the early scene where Ella and her father are talking before his trip, looks like someone without any knowledge or skill did it. Fairy godmother's fake nails looked exactly like that, fake. Her lipstick was applied poorly; look how it's smeared at the crease between lips. It's also applied past the lipline. Overall, it's just a bad representation of a Disney movie. I did appreciate, though, that the stepsisters were not 'ugly'.",Cinderella

However, when the king (Derek Jacobi) hosts a royal ball in order to find a suitable wife for his son (Richard Madden), who should appear but that servant girl dressed in a dazzling gown and glass slippers that were given to her by her very own fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter)? From the romance to the slightly altered plot, this movie was spectacular! The screenplay, although based off an old fairytale, still managed to be original and entertaining. The characters were wonderfully developed and the actors were able to play off of each other so well. As for Cinderella and Prince Charming, the romance could not be more believable. You could practically see sparks flying around the whole theater as they meet for the first time. The costumes were gorgeous and the music, beautiful. Everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job.

And Helena Bonham Carter shows that she is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and accomplished actresses of our time...she is hilarious as the fairy godmother and seems to have been sent down from a higher league...she has something going on that is more than excellent acting skills - she's the ""'It' girl"" of our day. Lily James as Cinderella is great eye candy, but much, much more - she has a purity of soul that shines. Her chemistry with her Prince Charming is strong. The CGI, costumes, set design and all that, is top notch - a vastly creative effort by the Disney team. Still, the movie's innocence and purity will not go down with some viewers, no doubt.

232,RemusGrey,"May strictly be for fans only, but fans can stick to the classic instead.",6,18 March 2015,"After this movie's trailer was released, I thought of it becoming an awful movie. But it turned out that it was just a mix of good and bad giving me mixed feelings about this, but most of them are positive. You need to know that this is for the Disney Princess movie fans only. I am not a fan of Disney Princess movies (mostly because I am a man), so I wouldn't really enjoy this. Even you will not enjoy this if you aren't a Disney Princess fan. But some fans may be disappointed since they know the story really well and can stick to the classic instead.Obviously this is only a retelling of the story. Most retellings of a story in a movie is better than the original one while some fails. Cinderella is one of the movie remakes that is better than the first storytelling, but like I said earlier, it is strictly for the fans only. You will be tired of stories being told again, but remakes are just like that. You might one to stick to the original instead of this.Since this has more origins of Cinderella, we get to see a bit of her childhood which was never told in the story. Even the death of Cinderella's father, how she got raised by her stepmother, etc. You even get to see more parts in the retelling. It's really improved and complete. Cinderella's stepmother was also made more menacing. It's good, but if you like old things better, you might find this remake just improved, and nothing else.The soundtrack is played beautifully, perfect for a Disney Princess movie. Highlights are also the acting. Lily James is a good Cinderella. Cate Blanchett felt menacing in her role as the wicked stepmother, and it was done perfectly, although her role doesn't really match her.Cinderella is just a retelling of the classic story. It is indeed beautiful, but sticking to the classic is much better. You do get to see some more from the story, but the idea of seeing the classic instead of this is much better. Sometimes, remakes can get boring, not only if you are a fan, but also if you have heard that story repeatedly. It's not that remakes are a bad idea. It's just that, you already know the story very well and don't need this at all since you can stick with the classic.6/10Plus, if you are a Frozen fan, you might want to see this because a new short titled ""Frozen Fever"" plays before Cinderella. Kids will love it. Even you will love it, but don't see this only for Frozen Fever.",Cinderella
233,IanAJohnson,This film was a decent update to a classic story.,6,15 March 2015,"Cinderella is yet another telling of the classic Disney fairytale. I have to be honest; I was not looking forward to seeing this movie. I am very tired of all the remakes out there and I feel that Disney is in a little slump right now. So how did I feel about this one? Just wait and see (or read the title of this review). This is definitely a retelling of Disney version of this story. There are several glimpses at people and animals that are obvious throwbacks to the original cartoon. While some were rather nice and small, others were too obvious and detracted from the film. I am mainly talking about the mice. They have a somewhat pivotal role in the film and there is quite a lot of focus on them. If you have never seen the original, I feel like it would feel out of place. All the animals are normal, but there are four mice that eat in a table setting and act more like people. The characters are much more developed. In fact, there is some emphasis on certain people that make the events that transpire later mean more. This gave the film some much needed impact. I was actually impressed with this. The romance was believable and even though it was still a little shallow, there was good chemistry there and I feel like it could have blossomed into a real relationship. There was good reasoning to why these people were attracted to each other. The acting was fine. Kate Blanchett, the evil- stepmother was very good and stood out against everyone else, who all did a pretty good job. There are a few liberties taken from the original. They are all acceptable to me because don't drastically change the important parts of the film. However, some of them were supposed to add tension to the film and almost all of them failed. Some of the dialogue and humor was off. I feel like a few sentences were added for some affect but don't mesh well with the rest of the film, or even the same scene (If you've seen the movie, there is a good example of this when Cinderella gets the blue dress). I must congratulate the film, though, on reviving that old fashioned Disney magic that so many modern adaptations have lost. Many scenes really brought me back to when I was just a kid and watched the classics on V-H-S. In terms of being a remake, I think it is just okay. It paid homage the original, and added a lot to it and updated it to a modern audience. Plus it has been over sixty years since the original was released.",Cinderella

If an anime, like ""Cinderella Monogatarie"", is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? If you insist on tampering with perfection, why then do you have to try to recreate it in it's whole? There is nothing original here. Kenneth Branagh put nothing of himself into this film.They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this is ridiculous. There are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as Cindarella, and I suspect that Branagh may have wanted to explore them. Instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap live-action imitation of the popular anime.In the end, Kenneth Branagh set out to pay homage to a great anime. Instead he cheapened it, and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cable.",Cinderella

As it is I need not have worried as the rendition could not really have been much better. The classic way of updating a family standard I loved the way it was put together and the sheer polished professionalism of the end result. My only very minor gripe was the use of CGI which, while although overall superb, was in my opinion weak when used for the crowd scenes and the ships in the harbor, where object copying seemed a little too obvious for me at least. Really good cinematography and incredibly smooth direction coupled with excellent sound effects too made this a delight to see.",Cinderella

243,BrendanMichaels,A very quaint film,6,1 April 2016,"When I heard they were going to be making a live action remake of the Classic Disney Animated film Cinderella all I could do was shake my head. But then I heard more info about the cast with big names like Cate Blanchett, who's in the excellent Carol, and Richard Madden, from Game of Thrones fame. The director, Kenneth Branagh, was a very interesting choice too. His previous films, Hamlet and Thor, were critically acclaimed and varying films that showed that was taking this remake seriously. Cinderella is a film that doesn't do anything extremely different with the story. While there are a couple of interesting changes it doesn't do anything to separate itself with the original.But once Lily James is introduced as the titular character the film really brightens. She plays the role of Cinderella well and gives a great performance that shows a little bit more characterization of Cinderella. But the character of Cinderella is still as bland as the cartoon. The only new information given to us about her is that she rides horses. She's still the same Cinderella, kind, caring, and perfect to a fault. I would have liked it more if they strayed a bit more away from that character and made her a bit more relatable to the target demographic it's appealing to.It may seem like I'm trashing her but her performance was great as Cinderella but get character needed a bit more depth. But the humanizing of the other characters is amazing. The Prince has some touching moments and the Stepmother is shown in a very different light and not just this woman that hates Cinderella for no reason. Another good attribution to the Stepmother is Blanchett's performance. Blanchett plays the character as so many things that she steals the show. But that's to be expected from a Cate Blanchett performance.The technical aspects of Cinderella are worth the price of admission by itself. The sets look fantastic with big vibrant ballrooms and serene looking grasslands. The cinematography has great shots of the environment but some of the beauty is taken away by the horrifically noticeable CGI. While it's not used frequently and only with mice, ships and carriages it detracts from the wonderful cinematography. Very shocked this wasn't nominated for best costume/set design at the Oscars.Overall, Cinderella isn't the travesty I was expecting but it also isn't dismissing my worries about the upcoming remakes of Beauty and the Beast, Mulan, Dumbo and Winnie-the-Pooh. The performances are great, especially Madden and Blanchett, even though Cinderella could have more depth. If you want to see a better version of this than sticking to the original Disney animation is the best bet.",Cinderella
244,thependragonscribe,Cinderella is truly a magical offering that established itself as the most superior of all Cinderella adaptations.,8,12 March 2015,"It was a big pawn for Disney to remake their animated properties to live-action since almost all of them had sunk to notoriety. (Hello Maleficent and Alice in Wonderland.) And it was also a big pawn for the audiences to get invested in these stories that had been told better. So, with that in mind, I lessened my hopes for the 2015 Kenneth Branagh version of Cinderella, since the source material had been beaten to death many times; heck, Disney previously released a version of Cinderella in Into the Woods, two months prior its US release. But that pessimism had all faded when I was so blown away by what the film turned out.First of all, this Cinderella is a retelling of the 1950 animated classic that AFI touted as one of the finest animated films of all time. To top it, this live-action take must have something substantial to make it memorable. And indeed, it has a lot more substance, making it a companion piece to explain lots of gaps from the animated version. Cinderella's back-story is further fleshed out, gaining investment for her character as we learn of her parents and their uneventful passing. Then, the story explains how she ended up with her stepmother and stepsisters, filling up more motivation from the character of Lady Tremaine herself. And, until the end of its by-the-numbers retelling, there was a sense of struggle and character for Cinderella. And justly what separates this from the 1950 animated film is that there was more substance to get invested, especially to its almost stereotyped characters.Cinderella's character here may not convey the usual female-empowering figure that Disney celebrated increasingly (for the better) but she knows her worth and purpose; and Lily James (of Downton Abbey) portrayed her with sincerity, conviction and charm. The character of the stepmother, played outstandingly by Cate Blanchett channeling Kate Winslet in Divergent, as well is fleshed out to make her cruelty explicable by expressing her vainness and jealousy towards Cinderella. The stepsisters (played by Holliday McGainger and Sophie McShera) were thankfully not reduced to bothersome, although forgettable characters. But the best update was from the Prince, who is now a three-dimensional character, unlike the quickly-forgotten ""Charming"" of the original. This guy had a back-story, from being an apprentice for royalty to a loving son to his careworn father/king. Schmaltz may seem to be smothered, but there was a hook since the Prince's character is lifelike and common. Although Richard Madden's casting is distracting (for those of you who don't know, he is Robb Stark of Game of Thrones), he still pulled it off. The other characters were given a modernized treatment, in rather effective and ineffective results. Branagh regular Derek Jacobi as the King had a decent portrayal, instead of giving him the hammed-up performance from the original. Stellan Skarsgard is kind of unrecognizable as the Grand Duke. Nonso Anozie, another Game of Thrones regular, as a new character, the Captain is nice, like the way Andre the Giant did in The Princess Bride. And Helene Bonham Carter as the iconic Fairy Godmother is irresistible.Everything in the movie is almost flawless from the way it is executed. The sets are heavy in detail and period. The production design is strikingly stunning. The costumes (by the Academy Award-winning designer Sandy Powell) are elegant especially the glass slipper. And the score (by other Branagh regular Patrick Doyle) is rousing. Almost, there is nothing to criticize here since this is a faithfully accurate adaptation. But that sits as the major problem. Since this Cinderella goes in the same pattern as the 1950's Cinderella, nothing really new surfaces, aside from some twists and turns. It does not offer the unique edge that made Enchanted and The Princess Bride an audience runaway winner. But setting that aside, Cinderella is truly a magical offering that established itself as the most superior of all Cinderella adaptations, alongside the original 1950 version. Now if you are asking my reaction about the Frozen short called Frozen Fever, I have mixed feelings about it, but most of it is positive. On a running time of 7 minutes, the story continues after Elsa and Anna's last adventure took off, now during Anna's birthday. Elsa and company are throwing a surprise party for Anna, but Elsa's unexpected cold (get it?) causes trouble. Truly, it is a simple synopsis but it delivered a lot. The characters are still charming. The humor is consistent. And the musical number ""Making Today a Perfect Day"" is another perfect accompaniment to Frozen's playlist.However, the story has many plot holes to recognize, like why little snowmen pop out when Elsa sneezed, how come Anna never realized her sister is catching a cold, how was Elsa aided in the end and how Marshmallow the snow monster survived after falling from the ice castle in the first movie. Though, all these nitpicks never took away such an exhilarating experience to see Frozen's endearing characters once more.",Cinderella
245,fidraisle-1,Once upon a time....again....,1,24 April 2015,"It could have been worse. It could have been a musical. If you want a good live action Cinderella, I suggest you try ""Ever After"", or, if you want a slightly different take on the story, I highly recommend a book. ""Witches Abroad"" by Terry Pratchett. One of the great failings in this film is the costuming which didn't seem to know where and when it was set. Georgian and medieval rubbed shoulders with modern prom dresses and 40's chic. It would have been interesting if any of the designs were any good. They were not. It's a bit too long and a bit too dark for children, and a little too light in the script for adults. There were lots of Disney references, if you care to watch it repeatedly to find them all. I won't be bothering. Thank goodness for streaming, say I. All I lost was time.",Cinderella

Reading the tale I just accepted that the stepmother is just evil and Cinderella gets the treatment as said.Here on the screen it was not convincing at all. C looked fit enough to just shake off all the bullying and do better. By the end there's a feeble attempt at explanation that make it even worse.On the bright side the picture is really beautiful, I especially liked the castle and the pumpkin-cart.

248,natashasarin,Have Courage and Be Kind,9,28 July 2019,"A lovely, sweet take on what is possibly the most well-known fairytale. The changes that were made in this adaptation were necessary and helped emphasise the storyline. I don't think anyone could have portrayed the innocence, wholesomeness, and genuine embodiment of Cinderella more than Lily James. The original movie is one of my favourite Disney movies of all time, and I believe the live action does both the film and the princess justice. The animated Cinderella is kind and compassionate, but also low key sassy and does her best to stand up for herself and never loses sight of her worth - and I appreciate so much how the live action Cinderella kept those same qualities, but added even more to her personality. I also really appreciate that both her parents are quite a big part of the film and help influence and encourage Cinderella to always be kind, no matter what.
Cate Blanchett was (not surprisingly) also phenomenal as the stepmother.
This is definitely a Disney remake done right, and is the only remake thus far that has the special Disney magic and doesn't feel solely like a cash grab.",Cinderella

I also like Lily James's singing of ""Lavender's Blue (Dilly Dilly"" in a cappella in its original form as a nursery rhyme. This is a very sweet romantic movie.",Cinderella
251,gfrasmd,Should admire Kenneth Branagh artistic sensibility and courage.,10,2 November 2021,"It is an enormous task to retell a story, a gentle fairy tale, at that, that has been re-proposed zillion times. The typical Hollywood approach, in the effort of being different, has educated the audience to expecting an increasing dose of violence, crudity, gore and perversions at every remake.Branagh has chosen to to restore the the tale to the original innocence, an imaginary story of kindness and a little magic, as it was meant to be. I guess he knew this would be much harder than throwing in sensation generating garbage as Hollywood would have dictated, nowadays. And this is the mark of a real artist, with integrity and courage.The movie retains a rich, impalpable feeling of a fairy tale, that flows naturally and graciously to the expected end. The production is lavish, with great actors and beautiful colors. Even the music is perfect. The choice of the traditional children's song ""Lavender Green"" adds a wonderful touch of real and shows the attention to details employed in the production.Overall, the movie is wonderful and offers quite a pleasant surprise for adults and children, as well.For those who have been so critical in reviewing this movies, I may only suggest they keep trying to find a little magic the lurid appeasement of senses that Hollywood prefers to offer to their audiences.",Cinderella
252,Pheeke,A timeless fairytale with a great deal of Disney magic,9,8 December 2015,"I absolutely loved this movie! It is pure Disney fairytale magic.I wasn't a fan of the previous Disney live-action remake Malificent. I thought Malificent did a disservice to the original story of sleeping beauty, changing so much but replacing it with a story that wasn't as good as the original.This movie stuck very close to the original Disney animated story, making it an instant classic. However they changed the story just enough to make it more relatable and believable for an audience today. I was amazed at how the very small changes impacted the story and how you view the characters. It makes the characters actions more understandable and gives them more backstory. I actually thought there was a lot of character development for a straightforward fairytale.This film was very romantic story-wise and visually, with elaborate dresses and sets. It all feels very classical and theatrical.Lily James was great as Cinderella. It is good that they cast a relatively unknown actress, this way you don't get distracted from the character by a familiar face. Cate Blanchett has the role of evil stepmother down, even giving her a relatable side, without making he less threatening. Richard madden is cast as the prince. I love that they gave him much more character and backstory than in the animated version. The relationship with his father was very touching and gave him a vulnerable side, making him much more interesting. Richard Madden also has the undeniable royal good looks, making him a perfect fit for the role as charming prince.I enjoyed this movie immensely. Its timeless and fairytale-esque with a great deal of Disney magic. Any Disney fan will love this and it makes me excited for more live-action Disney classic remakes.",Cinderella

254,seannasuti,A quite beautiful adaptation of a Disney classic,10,1 September 2016,"Right now Disney's current trend with their live-action films has been a series of live-action re-imaginings of their animated classics. Obviously this has proved to be a rather polarizing tactic amongst certain fans, namely because they believe that these are intended to replace the original films. Well I can assure you that this ain't the intention. You see the internet has this mentality about remakes that they're supposed to replace the original when that's not the case. Hell, even if they don't end up being very good, the original is not tainted in any way. And that's been the case with Disney's live- action remakes, even the ones that haven't been well-received like the 'Alice' films and 'Maleficent'.'Cinderella', however, was the first of these remakes to actually be well-received by critics and rightfully so as it truly is a beautiful new adaptation of the story that Disney first told in their 1950 animated classic. The original 'Cinderella' is easily one of my all-time favorites when it comes to Disney's animated films so I was really excited to see this new version and I absolutely loved it. Sure it's basically just the same story as the original but it manages to update it by doing some things better than the original. Namely, the relationship between Ella and the Prince in this version is much more developed compared to the original where they immediately fall in love and only share a few scenes together. Lily James is absolutely fantastic in the role of Ella while Richard Madden proves to be, for lack of a better term, a very charming Prince Charming. Of course the rest of the cast is fantastic as well, from Cate Blanchett's excellent take on Lady Tremaine to Helena Bonham Carter's scene-stealing turn as the Fairy Godmother.But like the original, the film has gotten some flak from feminists over its title character, Cinderella. The argument is that the character is too passive of a protagonist who only sits around waiting to be rescued. Now this is an argument I've never really agreed with. Sure Cinderella doesn't really do as much compared to some future Disney princesses but there's more to her than that. She really deserves credit for being able to put up with all of the crap she gets thrown her way by her evil stepmother and stepsisters. The film very much maintains the theme of encouraging people to 'have courage and be kind'. And let's face it folks... those are good words to live by in today's age.Like I said before, these Disney remakes aren't replacing the originals. They're just here to serve as interesting new takes on their original source material. And as much I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this by those who are opposed to the remakes... I think this new Cinderella is better than the original. Don't get me wrong the original is still an animated masterpiece but as a whole I feel that Kenneth Branagh delivered a fantastic adaptation that both reflects the original while also being its own thing.",Cinderella
255,FilmFestAsh,Other DIsney money-spinner lacking style or enchantment,2,7 August 2019,"Kenneth Branagh has inexplicably been chosen to take the helm for the latest in Disney's money-spinning line of live action versions of their classic princess stories.
You know the drill storyline-wise but special mentions go to Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham-Carter who pop up (not quite enough, however) as heavily stylised manifestations of the wicked stepmother and fairy godmother of the piece.
Branagh hasn't done a Tim Burton, whose fairly recent retelling of Alice in Wonderland was dripping in his signature style, nor has he matched the dizzying enchantment of Disney's Oscar nominated fairytale, Into the Woods.
Cinderella is just a straight-up reissue of a classic children's story with perfectly charming actors, sets and costumes, but nothing by way of modernisation or reimagining.
The original 1950s animation had more by way of sassy one liners and a sense of mild peril, and if it's older children in need of entertainment, they're better off with one of any of the retellings of the last ten or so years involving dowdy waitresses/library geeks/bowling alley attendants 'rescued' by the seemingly unattainable jock/millionaire businessman/rock star.
Branagh's Cinderella seems more like a festive TV special than silver-screen worthy and it's now clear why Disney have had to tack an exclusive Frozen short film onto it as a trailer to lure cinema-goers.",Cinderella
256,Muhammad_Nd,Magic Cinema,10,14 July 2016,"When they announced that there was going to be a live-action adaptation of the ""Cinderella"" fairy tale, I was a bit concerned. There was something special about the Disney tale, simple, but magical, full of lovable characters and memorable tunes. Still, Disney and Pixar had been producing some very good animation lately, and with the excellent teasers, and the mention that Cate Blanchett would be in charge of bringing the wicked stepmother to life, I was hoping not be disappointed.After having two hours of cinematic pleasure, I am glad to say that this is one of the best movies that Disney has ever released. With Branagh at the helm, and a very capable cast, excellent special effects, a clever script that adheres to the Disney cartoon text and has added a few philosophical touches to highlight the virtues of good versus evil, we're on for a great ride.A few things change, but Cinderella is stuck with the family from hell, as the stepmother and her two stepsisters strive to make her existence a difficult one. The stepsisters are caricatures, but the stepmother is a character to treasure in the hands of Blanchett. She's grand, spectacular, bitter, and ready to do what is necessary to survive. She has evolved from an innocent girl to a woman who realizes that women don't have it easy in this particular world, and she uses whatever strategy is needed to get what she wants.Most of the joy from the film is in the chemistry of the leads, and this is essential to keep the romantic and magical angles alive. It's perfectly obvious from the beginning that the princess and Ella will be together forever, happily ever after, and are a match made in Disney heaven. This film succeeds because it's not overdone, and it keeps matters simple (for the story), but when the visual magic is unleashed, we'd better hold on to our hats.The transformation scene is absolute perfection as the fairy godmother delivers the goods and gets Cinderella to the ball, and as if this moment wasn't enough, things are truly spectacular in the ball. Cinderella makes a grand entrance, then she dances with her princess, and we're then taken to the palace gardens in a moment reminiscent of the Gazebo scenes in ""The Sound of Music"". It all fits beautifully, and then it builds on to the expected resolution, when the gorgeous slipper fits her foot perfectly.Dante Ferreti, Patrick Boyle compliment each other with the superb work done in the production and music departments. Every detail is exquisite, and I will never be able to find a carriage more magnificent and delightful as Cinderella's ride. Then there the costumes, each fitting the personality of the women who wear them. Blanchett's are strong and seductive, powerful like her personality. Her daughters' bring out the confused personalities of each sister, and Cinderella's might appear simple but are truly elegant and beautiful. Nothing can prepare you for the flow of that blue gown, and jaws will drop when the bride's outfit is revealed.And they say fairy tales don't exist?",Cinderella
257,rimagage,It was a decent popcorn movie,6,31 December 2019,"When I saw that the stepmother had found the glass slipper in the trailer I was excited to see where this would lead. I was disappointed. I don't know what I was expecting but her to simply want to strike a deal for her and the stepsisters wasn't it. Cinderella herself was such a goody two shoes it's honestly surprising she didn't agree. The one annoying thing is the constant overuse of ""Have courage and be kind."" Which in this films case translates to be a doormat and don't do anything about your living situation.In the animated Disney version, Cinderella was a child when she became an orphan. Her stepmother kept her confined to the property. She was isolated and alone with no one but birds and mice to rely on. She's likely never been beyond the property line in years and the ball is her one and possibly only chance to get out even for the night. Then the family rips her dress to the point of being unrepairableIn this one she was at least 16-18 when the father died. So she's often traipsing off to the market to meet up with a friend. A friend that literally asks her why she stays! Implying she could leave at any time. She wants to stay as it was her family home. A home she literally leaves in end. Also if she's upset about something she goes for a ride on her horse. Which is where she meets the prince. Which honestly makes his the whole I need to find my mystery girl stupid. Announce that the prince seeks out the pretty blonde he met in the woods.The whole dress scene is stupid as well. They...gasp, horror rip her sleeve. Instead of running off crying about it, she could have run upstairs sewed it back in a couple of minutes. Then tells fairy godmother not to change it much. Proceeds to completely change it.At the end of the animated one while locked up Cinderella tries to open the door banging on it and gets her mice to help get out.This one goes back to doormat status. Instead of trying the door begging, something. Nope sits down at the window and instead of opening it and calling out for help just sits there and sings. Only saved because the mice feel sorry for her and open the window. She never knew or seemed to care that the prince or anyone was there. And the care she had for dad's house she couldn't leave because of?Gone, forgotten off to the palace to live.",Cinderella
258,sarizonana,Style over substance but it's worth it,10,27 September 2017,"OK I have to admit this is a film with great style but not much substance and yet I loved it.The original Cinderella is one of my least favorite Disney romances for how plain it is and nothing has been fixed here in that aspect but it's almost impossible to fix Cinderella so not much complaining here. Nothing they would have done could have worked.But what it lacked on substance was compensated by great style and the getting the perfect actors for each role.for the first time the actors they picked for Cinderella and the prince look like people coming from a Disney Fairytale.Lily James is such a beautiful actress with a lot of Grace and Richard Madden is really dreamy and well Charming. Cate Blanchett was very well cast as the very classy but evil step mother and so were the actress picked for the evil step sisters. Now the spectacular visuals and the scenes which made this movie a masterpiece. Looking like real Disney Fairytale. 1 Ella Meeting her fairy godmother and preparing to get to the Bawl Elena Bonham Carter was a great pick to play the fairy godmother who was very funny at being not that expert on her magic and having a few mistakes at the beginning giving it some humor to that scene.The transformation of the mices To horses and lizards to human beings were just perfect Ohh and the transformation of the dress was jaw dropping, you see Cinderella being impressed and feel like she was in a dream having such a beautiful gown which does look like one made for a princess. The glass sleepers were the perfect touch to such a beautiful dress. The Bawl scene it was more than perfect. Cinderella arriving, kit recognizing her and their dance just perfect. The chemistry between them and the way they dance looked effortless. Just that scene scene gives the movie 8 points. Cinderella and Kit had great chemistry you see them happy and enjoying every single second they were togetherLast but not least. Cinderella Trying the glass slipper and proving she was the girl who danced with the prince to latter them getting Married and Ella having another beautiful gown which makes her look like a Disney princess. As you can see This a film completely saved by three great moments which make you feel The Disney Magic and why it gets a 10/10 even if the story is a dull and plain as they come.",Cinderella
259,Njkinny,Cinderella ~ Old fairytale with a new twist...Loved it!,9,13 August 2015,"Cinderella is a fairy tale romance that we all have grown up reading about or hearing the story from our parents or watching on TV. Adapted into multiple movies and TV shows, I was yet again enthralled when I watched the latest Disney presentation of this age-old fairy tale teaching hope, kindness and courage!Directed by Kenneth Branagh, the Cinderella movie is colourful, elegant and full of emotional play with an exciting touch of magic. The star cast includes actors shown in the below picture (starting from left to right) like Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother, Lily James as Cinderella, Richard Madden as the Prince and Cate Blanchett as the evil Stepmother. Other actors include Hayley Atwell (who also plays the role of Agent Peggy Carter in Marvel's Agent Carter TV series) as Cinderella's mother, Stellan Skarsgård (who also plays the role of Erick Selvig in the Thor movies) as the grand Duke, Ben Chaplin as Cinderella's father etc.The actors do a great job of reliving the Cinderella tale on the screen. Lily James as Ella or Cinderella is realistically kindhearted, courageous, knowledgeable and yet a naive country girl who believes in seeing the good in people and happy in her own world. Richard Madden as The Prince is handsome, just and a true fairy tale Prince.Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother is bubbly, slightly eccentric but nevertheless totally adorable with her quirky ways and feel-good magic. Cate Blanchett as the evil stepmother is beautiful, conniving and yet very humanely portrayed in this movie. She is a woman who ""too had known grief"" in her life ""but she wore it wonderfully well."" and also experienced love once but is now determined to marry off her half wit daughters and live luxuriantly while also making beautiful Cinderella's life hell!The screenplay is again admirable and introduces some twists and surprises throughout the movie which manage to make this already well known story feel new. Helena Bonham Carter's (also the Fairy Godmother) lovely narration makes the story more appealing and I loved her engaging narration style with just the right amount of voice modulation to elicit the right emotions from the viewers.The dresses and costumes in the movie are absolutely gorgeous and kudos to the designer, Sandy Powell for designing such eye catching dresses which made me want to switch places with Cinderella and even the stepmother whose ball gown looked so lovely! The Prince made my heart flutter in his crisp, royal costumes in vivid colours that set him apart.The lovely glass slippers yet again made me yearn to own one myself and hope for a fairy Godmother just like Cinderella's!The music and sound score by Patrick Doyle is melodious, if not very memorable. It had me enchanted throughout the movie and I felt like anything was possible while I heard the melodious tunes and watched the magical love story unfold on the screen!All in all, this movie had me feeling hopeful, courageous and hopelessly happy. ""The End"" on the screen left me believing in magic and completely inspired with a new enthusiasm to try and achieve anything because just like Ella, I too felt anything was possible when we had kindness and courage in our hearts!This movie made me happy, had me entertained with never a dull moment all through the picture, brought some new twists in the story to heighten the interest with some great acting from the actors and I just loved the dresses and music. 5 super shiny stars to Cinderella from me and highly recommended that you watch it. This movie is meant for everyone whether you be young or old because a little magic and hope is all we need to live happily! :)This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff",Cinderella
260,SaarahN,Could be better,8,21 August 2016,"The film came across as a 'film' version of the 1950 cartoon version, especially because of the inclusion of Cindy's mice friends. I admit, it was funnier, better dresses and there was slight changes which made the film more believable. For one thing, we learn more about the prince (played by Game of Thrones star Richard Madden) then there's how we see more of Cindy's childhood. I liked how the prince was never called 'Prince Charming'. He was an ordinary man/ prince, given the semi-ordinary name Kit. And there's a lovely speech (I think it was part of the narration) that anyone can be a princess, you don't need a tiara, or a title.Another change was how there was an introduction between Cinderella (played by Lily James) and the prince, prior to the ball. I always found it ridiculous that anyone can marry based on 'first sight' or 'one night' together. So I was pleased by this change- I love when people meet for the first time.Honestly, I watched this film because it was the only 'half decent' thing on the telly, and then there was my friend who did a 'Cinderella' movie marathon the weekend prior- so I figured it was a fitting choice. I had actually seen the ending a while before, with my siblings- during family night which they had conveniently moved to 'day- time'. I had missed out the beginning since I was out gardening with my mum, while they were huddled on the settee watching Cinderella. At the time, I had no desire to watch it again, based on the ending. Even right now, I'd say the beginning of the film was my favourite part.The film begins with the happily ever after of Ella's family (her parents and her). We meet her mother and then we hear of the illness. Right before she passes, we get the idea that her mother was fantastic and couldn't have possibly been any better. Then, we see Ella and her mother having a conversation, Ella promises her mother that she will 'have courage and be kind'. That's the message at the centre of the film.A beautiful message, no doubt. But I feel it was overused quite a bit. If you've seen the Cinderella films before, or had a read of the fairy tale, you'll already know the story line. You'll know that shortly after Ella's mother's passing, Ella's father marries again. To a widow, with two daughters. You'll know that this woman and her children are cruel and wicked to young Ella so, as you can imagine, the message 'be kind' (in particular) is a very difficult one. But still, Ella never falters. I liked how this presented the strength of a promise, how it should be honoured. But it was such a high expectation, she never rages, says something mean, it was boring (and unbelievable- she only asks the reason for their actions). I view the vow she made to her mother as an overwhelming burden, it's not healthy to repress emotions. It was a ridiculous message, and she an unhealthy, unreal, role model.I recently learnt that Lily James had to read about the Indian peace activist such as Ghandi to develop patience and properly prepare herself for the role. I still felt it was too forced, I wanted her to feel some hate and resentment. For me, Ella was the kind of girl my parents used to compare me to-as a way of asking, ""why can't you be like her?"" I wanted emotion: not just tears, happiness and indifference. What about anger? Fear? Wait, there was also love and compassion. After all, she forgives her step mother. On second note, all the characters were really one- dimensional. They were either good or bad, is that common of all fairy tales?I know there's the whole 'corset, tiny waist' drama about the film. I suppose if that worries you, maybe don't watch the film with your children. Personally, I never noticed-I'm oblivious to such tiny details. I only found out when my friend told me about how the Cinderella actress Lily James had to go on a liquid diet because she couldn't eat properly in the corset. My friend, though, had actually heard that the actress went on the liquid diet in order to attain the tiny waist. This isn't true at all. And sure, the idea of a liquid diet idea sounds disgustingly difficult, but really the tiny waist isn't exactly flaunted (well, Cinderella does dance around in the dress). But it's not exactly shoved in your face. In cartoons, all the characters have tiny waists-as unhealthy an image as it is. I wouldn't overly concern myself with it, just stress to your children that people come in all shapes and sizes, nothing bad about it.I recommend this film for families- particularly if watching with older children or with adults who don't like animation/cartoons any more, or looking for something little different.",Cinderella
261,WinstonNoCGI,Too much CGI,3,12 March 2015,"In this movie there's CGI in every shot. Even Cinderella's shoes are but CGI. Hard to believe, yet true.I can barely watch so much visual boredom lacking real props.In the acting I can't see fairy tale type of acting, too. I would have expected to see the acting being at least as intensive as in The Wizard of Oz or Cinderfella. The actor's mimics are close to nothing. I don't comprehend on why press reports are reporting Cate Blanchett's performance as overacting. Gee, if anything else than a Botoxed face is already declared as overacting, these guys should definitively stop gazing at mannequins.I'm a huge fan of Kenneth Branagh from his Shakespeare movies. But this time he set the bar too low.",Cinderella
262,lisee_lulu,Perfect portrayal of Cinderella!,10,22 September 2015,"I love the original cartoon of Cinderella and I feel this movie adaption was perfect. The whole point was to bring to life the original cartoon and they did.As I've read through some of the other reviews, I've noticed one thing all the negative views have in common. They can't accept that good people like Cinderella exist. The 'have courage and be kind' line is not a bad thing. It's sticking to what people ignore. Bible principals. To be kind and love everyone, even your enemies. Not to get angry but to be calm and treat people with respect. There is nothing wrong with that. Yes it may appear that Cinderella is being trampled on but by not retaliating she's proving to be the bigger person.A really fantastic movie. The step-mother and step-sisters well well acted and I really loved the actor who played Cinderella. Definitely one of my favourite movies of 2015. Stuff what everyone else says, they just don't know how to be kind. All they know is how to be rude. Well, this is a good lesson for all.",Cinderella
263,Mahmood-Buttrumps,Ripping Off A-plenty,1,10 March 2015,"It seems Kenneth Branagh have been trying to recreate the success of their first 90s anime ripoff, Dead Again , with little or no success for over a decade now. Sometime even going so far as to credit the original, as is the case with ""The Magic Flute "", no attempt was made to distract from the plagiarism. But here, they decided to pull out the stops and make their films as wild as possible.Some may defend Cinderella (2015), as some have defended The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, but trust me, this is worse than The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1. I don't know where to begin with the awful-ness of this film. It's so corny, mind-dumbingly so. All of the dialogue is ridiculous.Wow. How low do you have to be? What kind of sociopathic creature stoops that low to wantonly and ignorantly destroy beauty, and by this I mean Kenneth Branagh. Who? Simple Jr and his boyfreind, that's who.",Cinderella
264,teozabeth,Beauty Cinderella story,8,21 December 2015,"Ella loses her parents and has to live with her stepmother and her daughters. Her stepmother is cruel and her daughters are ugly and bully Ella. She feels grief, however she remember her mother's words and tries to keep kind to everyone, therefore she does not complain about the situation and keeps positive. One day, a prince declares that he decide his wife in a dance party. Her stepmother tries to make her daughter to be a princess and tells Cinderella not to come to the party. Cinderella cries out holding a torn dress which is a keepsake from her mother. Then Cinderella finds out someone is sitting close to her. She is a fairy godmother. She helps her go to the party and spells her. This is a most famous Cinderella story, therefore I does not feel difficulty understanding this story. Instead of this, I watched this film focusing on music, costume and scenes. At first, its songs is so beautiful. I like, especially, ""Lavender's Blue,"" which is sung by Cinderella. In addition to this, Cinderella's blue dress is also beautiful and attracting. The scene where Cinderella puts on the blue dress by spell is astonishing. I like this film so much and I expect the later films to be also the great ones.",Cinderella
265,jbullivant,Ive never really liked Cinderella,5,19 February 2018,Lily james is really really really anoying as Cinderella not very good humanisasion of the cartoon characters. and quite a bland adaption,Cinderella
266,dforster,Stepmother portrayed with modern depth,9,4 February 2017,"Although this is about the stepmother, I want to first say that I found all the characters well portrayed and supported by an excellent script, cinematography, and of course a great director. I scanned some of the user reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to me that they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to be an action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children want today and should not become such.I particularly appreciated the stepmother's portrayal because it included clear justification for her anger and bitterness. Not to say given that justification she was correct to have done what she did. But a worthy lesson for us and particularly for children.The specific scene I am referring to is when she overhears her husband telling his daughter how much he misses her mother, i.e., where is the love and support she desires - a more modern understanding of the difficulty of joining an existing family. This and other related scenes gives the stepmother a depth that makes her more real in place of the one-dimensional cartoon version - but what a joy that version was for me many years ago.",Cinderella

Worth to watch!!!",Cinderella
269,theincrediblehong,Wonderful,8,18 March 2015,"So there are basically 3 Cinderella films now that will be forever referenced: the original animated Cinderella, Ever After and this live action Cinderella. I wasn't a fan of the original animated film when I saw it as a grade school kid but I really enjoyed Ever After when I saw it as a college student. Now, as a grumpy middle aged man, I was reluctant to see another retelling of this classic story. But my wife really wanted to see it, so I gave it a shot. Glad that I did because I believe this Cinderella is the best of them all. This film does an excellent job of blending the realism of Ever After with the fantasy/magic from the animated film. It also truly excels in showing you the depth of the relationships between Cinderella and her parents and the Prince with his father - even thought the on-screen time between the parents and kids is limited. Lily James as Cinderella does an excellent job of showing frustration while maintaining her promise to mom - to be kind to others. In other words, she showed her humanity and wasn't just some sort of animated caricature. It's a shame movies like this don't often win Best Picture or Best Actor/Actress because the acting is that good in this film - all the way around. Go see it, but bring some tissues with you!",Cinderella
270,raynaking0,Above and beyond expectations,10,2 April 2015,Cinderella is one of my favorite fairy tales. I especially love the Disney cartoon. I had very high expectations for this movie and was not disappointed in the least. I wouldn't say it was better than the cartoon but the cartoon isn't better either. They're both fantastic in their own ways. The live action wasn't a remake of the cartoon. I loved all the colors!!! The step- sisters were very annoying but their dresses were so beautiful. The clothes had so much detail. Even Ella's rags were pretty! The costumes people (I don't know their official title!) definitely need to get some sort of recognition. Cate Blanchett was AMAZING as the step- mother. She was pure evil but I liked her at the same time. Lily James was phenomenal as Ella. Helena Bonham Carter was brilliant of course. Honestly the whole cast was wonderful. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. After this I'm really looking forward to the live action Beauty and the Beast.,Cinderella
271,Krusader_Donkey,DHKR: Cinderella Re-Review,1,21 September 2016,"Before I begin, I must give the movie's biggest message, that of ""Having Courage and Being Kind"", a word of apology. Having a courage and being kind, even in the face of the great hardship, is a good message, especially to those who have fallen on harsh times. Being someone who went through a parental divorce and having a hardening heart have jaded things for me personally, making it hard to have such courage or even being kind. Also, I feel as if I need to redo this review because my original one did not really delve deep into the film itself but rather became a personal soap box of my un-backed opinion. However, even with all that said, Cinderella (2015) is still a very bad movie, and I think my burning hatred at the message was misguided. I don't hate the message at all. I just explained how it was actually a good one.I hate the message because the movie does not even follow it to heart.Yes, Cinderella is guilty of being exactly what many people perceive her to be; Feeble, Weak, and Passive. Sure, she says the message like it's gospel, but she strangely doesn't practice what she preached throughout the movie. Everything she does that should be like how any person with half a brain could understand seem to be dumbed down to an almost infantile way. Cinderella, who should be at least frustrated with each break down her, instead acts like a woman in an abusive relationship. She just smiles and just lets it all happen like it's supposed to happen.The movie seems to confuse ""Having Courage"" and ""Being Kind"" with simply ""Being Passive and Have Good Luck"". Being kind is not the same as being passive, in fact it's the complete opposite. Just as having courage is clearly not the same as having luck. Kindness is sometimes hurtful to one, but it's for the better in the end. Instead, Cinderella here has no such feeling, no rationale. Instead of being courageous, she clearly hides all her emotion and never actually rises up by her own merit, but rather only through the magic of luck. As well as sickeningly sweet and clearly ""chick-flick"" clichés that makes The Proposal look like a romantic classicObviously, it's not of the same quality as the 1950's Animated Classic, which was actually a pretty good film dealing with such themes better, if only bogged down with that classic Disney schlock(and those annoying bloody rats kinda ruin it for me, too). However, at least Cinderella there was actually more complex and someone you sympathized with. Here, the remake beats you over the head, not just with the message, but with how it makes you forced to sympathize with a flat, clichéd character played by a remarkably uninspired performance by Lily James. By contrast, in what the movie actually got right here, the evil Stepmother is actually where most of my sympathy went. While that does break some of the dark characteristics from the 50's version, I think it makes for more character development, if only very briefly in the beginning and in the very end. However, the movie ruins that too, by having her pretty much axed off in the end along with the duke because....well, because it needed that sickeningly sweet ending for a happily ever after.I still hate this movie, even if I believe that the message was a lot better than I thought. However, with how they portray Cinderella, along with a very super-saturated design choice that tries way too hard to be whimsical, the 2015 remake does not even pass the original Disney classic. Heck, I'm willing to bet that a Cinderella movie that has little to do with Cinderella would be better than this. When you make the evil Stepmother more sympathetic than the main character of your story, then you really screwed up as a movie.",Cinderella
272,sepwaltz,beautiful scenes,9,14 October 2015,"This movie is amazing! I love this. I was very moved by Cinderella's beautiful heart. Many times I was moved to tears. I was most surprised scene is transforming. Some animals for example rats, lizards, are transformed into horses and butler, and pumpkin changes into a beautiful carriage by Fairy Godmother. Cinderella changes into more beautiful lady wearing blue dress and glass shoes. This scene is fantastic. I can't forget this beautiful scene. I think most of all people had known the Cinderella's story, but I recommend all people to watch this movie. Cinderella has a sincere heart. In contrast, her sisters are mean. They are villains but I think these two characters are attractive. There are many different characters and animals in this movie and CG technique makes them more beautiful. It is beautiful and exciting movie.",Cinderella
273,mtjohnson-18549,Be kind and have courage,10,30 August 2018,"Be kind and have courage was the moral to this film adaptation of the original fairy tale. I won't go in depth and there isn't a real need to give any spoilers because if you have ever read, had the original fairytale read to you as a child then you already have all the ""spoilers."" This was an original fairytale brought to the big screen. There isn't some modern day twist, a different perspective but just the wholehearted goodness of the fairytale I loved as a kid. It was a reminder that though we may suffer if we endure with kindness are day will come. Cinderella isn't just about landing the Prince, it was about being kind and having courage even to those who don't treat us as they they should. If you have gotten to cynical for this concept or no longer can enjoy the original fairytales you heard as a child or worse didn't hear fairytales as a child this may not be for you.",Cinderella
274,skipp-5,Terrific Movie - Feast for the Eyes,9,2 May 2015,"I am really not sure why anyone should not like this movie. Its a visual feast, with a simple and honest story that should appeal to the kids and the adults. I went to see it without Children, having enjoyed this story as a pantomime when the kids were younger and I was not disappointed. Visually its stunning, with detail and colour that kept me enthralled all of the way through. I am in awe at those that made this movie, as the visuals are so striking.I have read some of the less positive reviews, and to be honest, those people must have seen a different movie to me. They clearly don't get it.OK, so a five-year old, would not appreciate the movie in the way that I did - the colour and glamour of the costumes, the breathtaking interior scenes, and the spectacular visuals, but its still a great story and should still appeal to the younger audience, however, as an adult if you want a feast for the eyes and a feel- good movie, I would highly recommend Cinderella.Well done Branagh - a great film!",Cinderella

276,lhrlinha,Back to the classics,8,2 April 2015,"Cinderela tells the story we heard at least a thousand times before about the gentle girl who is mistreated by her stepmother and thanks to the blessing of the fairy godmother goes to try and live her dreams.So, when you go into this movie, unless you are a small child seeing the story for the first time, and if that is the case you'll probably have a good time, you already know what the story is about.However, in this age of gritty reboots and realistic versions, it is actually refreshing seeing a film that doesn't try to be better by thinking that dark-serious equals great. Cinderela is as whimsical as the cartoon. Dreamy happiness is what Disney is known for and, from time to time, is exactly what we look for when we go to the movies. We want to live in a world where magic is possible, at least for a few hours.The story went through a few changes to make it more reasonable for a live action movie and it does fell more reasonable. The characters are good and are portrayed by competent cast. I actually liked the girl Cinderela. Perhaps kindness is not a trait always valued in the real world as it can be seen as weakness, but there certainly is strength in being kind, even to whoever do us harm.Kid's movies can be a overwhelmingly sweet with their ""once upon a time"" that can make some eyes roll, mine included. But this is Cinderela in a Disney movie, and I want it to be magical.And there is nothing wrong with that.",Cinderella
277,ChristianTylerHannah,Cinderella review,7,21 March 2015,"I saw this film last weekend, & I gotta say, it was pretty good. Recently, Disney has made many films recently that could go either way at being good or bad. Luckily, I was satisfied. If you wanna know the plot of this movie, you already do. I mean seriously, this IS a REMAKE of Cinderella. I guess if it's not broken, don't repair it. The performances were pretty good, especially Cate Blanchett as the mean step mother, she reminds me of a lot of people I've met. Also, the comic relief characters of the film weren't as annoying as I thought they were going to be. In fact, they actually succeeded in making me laugh. Helena Bonham Carter's performance as the fairy godmother was very likable & she too was funny. If your children are over Frozen, this is one Disney film you & your kids will like. Plus, you might wanna stick around at the end of the credits, you won't regret it. Cinderella gets a 7/10",Cinderella
278,msecaur,Pure Disney magic...,10,24 March 2015,"While most live-action re-imaginings of classic Disney films fail to capture the same spark of wonder as their source material, ""Cinderella"" is a rare case of reinvention that is actually more satisfying than the original.Created during the tight post-war years, Walt Disney's ""Cinderella"" (1950) never quite reached the same pinnacle of fairy-tale story and style achieved by gems like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" or ""Sleeping Beauty."" Director Kenneth Branagh's live-action confection is the film Walt Disney would have made if he had had the budget.Rather than attempt to modernize the story à la ""Frozen"" or ""Maleficent"", Branagh instead looks for inspiration in Perrault's original tale, lending the film an appropriate storybook look and feel. For all the criticism being leveled at him for sticking to the traditional path, the truth is that the world loves a good fairytale, and when you've got a timeless story like Cinderella with five-hundred years of love behind it, there's really no need.With that being said, ""Cinderella"" is anything but stodgy in its presentation. While the basic story isn't fundamentally changed (aside from the removal of the songs), the presentation is so fresh that it's like seeing it for the first time. The combination of screenwriter Chris Weitz's excellent script and the top-notch British cast allow the characters to be properly fleshed out and emerge as much more than the usual cardboard archetypes. It would be hard to find someone better suited to play the titular character than Lily James, who retains Cinderella's optimism without becoming saccharine. Richard Madden is appropriately dashing and handsome as the Prince, while Cate Blanchett is equally sinister as Lady Tremaine. But my favorite of all is Helena Bonham Carter, who brings a wonderfully dotty, doting presence to her woefully small yet spot on portrayal of the Fairy Godmother.While this is the first film version of Cinderella I've seen that wasn't a musical, I can't say it's a bad thing. Patrick Doyle's regal and romantic score more than adequately fills the void, and the lack of character's suddenly bursting into song allows more time to develop the characters and storyline, something that further grounds the story into a more serious kind of reality. Following Walt Disney's maxim that ""for every laugh, there should be a tear,"" it is virtually impossible to get through this film without shedding at least one tear.Visually, ""Cinderella"" is one of the most lavishly beautiful productions I've seen in a long time. The whimsy of the animated version is kept well intact, yet magnified to an impressive scale. From the gilded splendor of the palace to the otherworldly beauty of a moonlit garden, there isn't a single shot that doesn't succeed in taking your breath away. The transformation scene is a major highlight, as is the ball scene, which showcases Sandy Powell's gorgeous costumes to perfection.Far more timeless and enjoyable than most 21st century attempts at fairy-tales, ""Cinderella"" is a more than worthy addition to the Disney canon, and one that I hope will be appreciated by generations to come.",Cinderella

280,legspinner,"Ashes to Ashes, Cinders to...",2,2 April 2015,"Every so often there comes along a 'U' rated film one must see. These 'U' films, I am quite sure, will be found to have had an inordinate effect on developing the language of the motion picture. This is not one of them. It doesn't deserve very much more than the minimum specified verbiage.The good thing about this film is that hideous glass slipper is photographed so it reflects light in a really attractive way. The bad thing about this film is, you, the viewer, are never allowed to settle and develop your own way of making sense of the film - essential for children of our generation. Whether today's children think a more studied coolness and efficient, regularised, apportioned mechanisation is better is another thing - almost. You still have to give people fun, and this rather dull little flick leaves nothing for people to grasp who aren't addicted to expressing on the surface of the joke how funny the author finds the actual joke. Helena Bonham-Carter does her best to give this the kiss of life some of the cast and crew's career will no doubt have deserved despite, but she is there and gone so quickly, it's not in the least bit worth it. Many of the lines actually hurt.The curious thing about this film is the way it does her name, but not the slippers. The controversy of fur/glass may not look fruitful at first, but the challenge surely should have been how to work-in existing details of ""story variance,"" rather than reach straight out for a very heavily-laid-on joke about fifteen not-very-engaged minutes into this film.

283,et-89,Bland and beautiful,6,9 April 2015,"The movie is a simple retelling of the Disney version of the Cinderella fairy tale. It tries to make the story make more sense, and largely succeeds. Problem is, there's not much humour or drama, so the story ends up being pretty dry. Ella's mother dies, and a moment later time passed enough for Ella to be over it and the father to have found a new wife. Then the father died, and that's pretty much glanced over too. The step mother's cruelty is also understated, more told than shown.So the movie ends up feeling watered down, yet at the same time it's reasonably well told and beautifully rendered. It's also still a heartwarming tale of how a woman of simple origins can end up marrying a prince with just a bit of help from magic and how a prince gets to choose a wife he loves due to her kindness and not one that's appointed to him. It's kind of like Aladdin with gender reversal and a lot less interesting stuff happening.",Cinderella
284,RonnyisRDX,Awesome Movie!,9,9 April 2015,"A beautiful magical experience! I'm so glad that they stayed true to the classic tale of Cinderella instead of changing the story completely like they did in Maleficent which for the record, I think is a good movie. A star less because I felt that some scenes were a bit rushed & I would've loved it for the movie to be a bit longer. Also it lacked the musical element that the classical Disney Princess movies have but it can be easily forgiven since it is a Live-Action movie. I felt the CGI in this movie was really good, I loved the costumes, Cinderella's dress & shoes were amazing! :D I honestly don't understand people calling her weak, she was only keeping her promise that she made to her mother, to have courage & to be kind. Remember, sometimes being good & kind is much more difficult than being rebellious & it really takes courage & resilience, so she wasn't weak, she was actually stronger. I really enjoyed watching this movie & I wouldn't mind watching it again.",Cinderella

I wasn't very excited to go see this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised as I came out of the movie theater. I'm not the biggest fan of fairytale movies, but I must say this movie was a fun and enjoyable ride for all ages. Whether you be fairytale enthusiast or just a general movie goer, I think this movie will please all, with its great cast and wonderful story. The first act of the movie is a little slow, but soon gets better as the movie progresses. The actress who played Cinderella put on an awesome performance and I can't wait to see her in more movies in the future. This movie kept me entertained throughout the whole experience. Kids will probably enjoy this movie a little more than I did but the movie does tell a great story and provides a good message.",Cinderella

""Taking care of the house"" is a very lame excuse.Cinderella was basically trapped in that house and abused by her step mother without any resistance and fight. She has a horse and she can escape. I know it is a fair tale, but please make it logical and sends out the correct message to kids around the world about how to fight back the bully and abuse.If you want to make a NEW movie, make it New with new messages and new plots, otherwise leave it be.It is such a boring and uninteresting movie with nothing new.

Before we have seen many versions of Cinderella, and we were expecting some new twist in story, till the end waiting for that, but it surely disappointed me very much. For acting lovers this movie can be good, but for story lovers or i well say some unexpected twist or sudden climax lovers will be disappointed by this classical touch of story. Many classical fairy tell stories are made with new taste of twists and climax are very well enjoyed world wide. It could be one of them. Even my child got bored seeing this movie as all they saw was they already enjoyed in previous versions of Cinderella.",Cinderella
292,Swanson87,This is how you do a remake,10,11 December 2018,"Cinderella is one of my favourite Disney cartoons and this movie do good justice to it.They maintained the taste of the original cartoon and they combined it with something new and more modern. Visually stunning, both for the bright costumes and for the rich environments. The costume design in particular is truly amazing. It doesn't address an accurate historical period, but is inspired by the style of the 40s.The whole movie looks like a theatrical adaptation of the cartoon. Kenneth Branagh definitely knows how to do adaptations due to his long experience in theater.The only thing I didn't like is Cinderella's ball look (and her horrid eyebrows). She looks like a blonde Scarlett O'Hara going to a picnic. I mean, the dress is beautiful, but it doesn't do justice to the elegance of the cartoon's one. A higher hairstyle would have been better (like the one they chose for her wedding).Apart from that, I can't help myself to give a 10 to this wonderful product. So far, the best live action movie based on a Disney cartoon.",Cinderella
293,wpedmonson,A Non-Revisionist Fairy Tale With Depth and Wisdom,9,16 March 2015,"This is the most refreshing, and downright best movie I've seen in 2015 so far. After having been in theaters every weekend at least for one new release movie, Disney's Cinderella has delivered the best performances and all around film I've seen since December. The story is exactly as we know it with a few extra bits and rabbit holes with certain characters, but overall the plot points are the same. What's remarkable is how it's a fairy tale that isn't revisionist. Fairy tales in recent memory have become either poor reproductions that are straight to DVD quality, or they're dark revisionist that offer the ""true"" or ""real"" story of whatever fairy tale it is, as if audiences ever thought these things happened as they were told to happen in the original. Chris Weitz, however, writes in the same spirit of the original, with all the best Disney studios has to offer, and with surprising restraint. Performances on all counts are excellent, and nearly all scenes that seek to carry a tone or mood do exactly what they intend. The star of the show, as she should be, is the actress that plays Cinderella. I was completely convinced by her humble, courageous, and gorgeous presence in the film. In every scene of joy she emanates that emotion, and in every scene of grief you feel it. I have yet to see a better actress play the part, and her performance here will define the image of Cinderella for this generation. But onto the story. The movie offers a full, unflinching account of the loss of Cinderella, something previous takes of her have glossed over for either darker ends, or to seemingly avoid being too dark (I'm thinking of the animated 1950 Disney production). This movie shows her connection to her mother and father, and the pain she feels at losing them. There are adult emotions here, even if they are simple, but the beauty is in seeing a character feel it all, and with utter courage and humility.The heart of what makes this movie work, however are in the emotional depth of the full story of Cinderella, particularly the loss of her parents and thus her stabilizing family structures. And it happens to her at a young age. What makes it worse for her is that her stepmother treats her poorly, being outright abusive toward her in several ways. Surprisingly this hasn't been done in a movie depiction of Cinderella to my knowledge, and it adds a whole new facet and power to the movie. Without it, you have the story of her meeting the prince and that being what ""saves"" her. This movie tells it as her overcoming the debilitating loss of her parents who she loved tremendously. This aspect of the movie will make it appealing to audiences outside of the young adult range. As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but think how this movie will annoy feminists of a certain strand. The protests will go like, ""She depended on the prince to be saved"" or ""She didn't assert herself enough, thus she is a bad model for young girls and women of all stripes."" I couldn't disagree with them more. Cinderella's strength lies in her purity of heart and her humility, and it has a refreshing take on virtues and habits women can take on other than the usual ""strong"" traits like assertiveness and power plays. She's basically a saint princess in the vein of St. Therese of Lisieux with small tasks done with all her heart, and the loving acceptance of having to live with annoying roommates. She is patient, persevering, and forgiving. Those are deeper and more lasting virtues for women than mere assertiveness. I can't help but think on certain points that I haven't seen in movies like this, that her stepmother's behavior could easily be identified as abusive, and CPS could come in and find a better home for her as a solution. While these are remedies for real life problems, they don't solve the emotional hurt that happens through life in an unstable or abusive home. And on a more minor level, we're faced with obstacles and annoyances every day, and the question is the life of holiness is played out more in those moments than the big ones simply because there's less seeming reward and they are far more common. Cinderella is a wonderful story for a generation whose families have failed them more than previous homes, a generation where parents leave, divorce, and children become objects in the swap. Having a small background in psychology and therapy, I noticed that they don't have a kind of ""process"" for Cinderella to work through in dealing with the pain from her loss. This could be seen as a weakness or one of it unrealistic and misleading parts, but what it has to say about it is that we're not bound to a set of ""process behaviors"" because of what's happened to us. We still have a choice to forgive someone, and it's OK to walk away from them. I noticed that immediately at the end of the movie. She leaves her stepmother's house and moves on, never returning. If that were real life, I'm sure there would be some in the kingdom that criticize her for abandoning her stepmother after she went into royalty, and would see it as a contradiction to say she forgave her yet left her after going away with the prince. But it is forgiveness. Cinderella shows courage in absolving her stepmother of her wrongs to her, and leaves it at that. There's something to be said for that, and a powerful wisdom that's understated in the movie.",Cinderella

295,smilefumble,Stop it Disney!!!!,4,15 March 2015,"Two years ago, when I heard that Disney was going to focus their energy on making live-action re-imaginings of many of their classic animated films, I rolled my eyes and thought ""Why would they waste their resources telling us stories that we already know? Considering some of the really smart and creative animated films that they've turned out in the past decade, such as Tangled (2010) and Wreck-it-Ralph (2012), it seems like they should be working on more of those. On top of that, I was quite disappointed with last year's spin-off of Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent. So, when I heard that they were indeed planning to keep the trend going with Cinderella, I was like ""and so it continues *sigh*. However, when the trailer came out, except for some obvious over-the-top CGI effects, It didn't look too bad, so I decided to make the trip to the theatre yesterday and see it. What's the final verdict? Well, apart from some quite nice-looking sets and costumes, Disney has once again made another CGI-laden cash-grab where it's obvious they spent more time and money on how the film looks rather than how the story is executed!It seems pointless to summarize the story, seeing as it's one everybody knows, so I'll just get right to talking about where the film falls flat. Its biggest flaw is that while it's clear that the writers tried to give some development to the characters by extending their roles and/or giving them more interaction with each other, but none of it ever lasts for more than a few minutes. For example, they have Cinderella and the Prince meet in the forest before the Ball in order to try and give them some believable chemistry, but the conversation they have only lasts for about ten minutes, so it comes off as rather odd when the Prince is raving about her and insisting that she come to the Ball the next scene. Similarly, we get a subplot near the end that involves the Wicked Stepmother making a deal with the Grand Duke that if he keeps quiet about Cinderella and raises both her and her daughters statuses, she will reward him. However, the Duke almost never speaks in any of his previous scenes, so we never get any indication as to why he would betray the Prince as he does. Also, there is something that happens near the end of the film, which I will not reveal in case you haven't seen the movie, but it's something major that comes completely out of left field and doesn't move the plot forward in any way, so it's completely pointless!The movie also fails in how it constantly tries to show off the lavishly-decorated sets and expensive CGI effects at every turn. While, they do look nice as I already said, they often shove their CGI creatures right into the camera and even have some shots where they zoom in on specific pieces of the set when really they should be focusing on the characters!Cinderella has really turned me off to all future live-action re-imaginings that Disney may come out with. If I have to, I'll get down on my hands and knees and say ""Please, please, pleeeeease go back to making original content again!""",Cinderella

It has held a beautiful place in my heart ever since. I've seen many adaptations over the decades. None have ever matched this. This non-animated version for me was spectacular visually, moving, romantic, and sparked the flames in my heart from this legendary fairy tale I've held since I was seven. I was especially enamored with the special effects animal metamorphoses. I believe they were as creatively done as Disney's original bedazzlement in 1950. Each character's uniqueness was as sharply drawn as the animated prototype meant them to be. As a matter of fact I believe them to have been better because some of the buffoonery innate to the classic were filtered out. This was perfectly appropriate without the animated environment.

I have been a fan of the animated classics for years and years and am looking forward to seeing many more re-makes.

She was mesmerised the whole way through (standing up for most of it!). It is a fairly accurate direct remake of the Disney cartoon version but wisely reducing the screen time for the annoying animal characters and (perhaps not so wisely) removing the songs. It expands the earlier part of the story and shows how Ella became a servant to her stepmother and stepsisters logically. The sets, costumes and cast are all excellent and whilst sumptuous it is not completely over the top like the remake of Beauty and the Beast. Lily James is lovable but not in the sickly way the cartoon Cinderella was. Blanchette is fabulous, hissable but damned attractive at the same time. The ugly sisters are not ugly but provide some of the laughs. Madden is actually a Prince that is handsome enough for the role (loved his costumes) and as usual Bonham Carter steals the film in the 10 minutes she is on screen as the fairy godmother.For once the live action remake is better than the cartoon original and I was teary eyed at least 3 times Those who gave this a low rating probably didn't see it in a cinema with a little girl.",Cinderella

306,Seltheus,From the perspective of an adult without kids.,6,8 April 2015,"If you watched recent real action adaptations of Disney classics, like Alice in Wonderland, or Maleficent, who tried to highlight a new perspective of these well known stories with new angles that are targeting not just kids, but also young adults and adults alike, don't set your expectations too high.While real action adaptations like Alice in Wonderland or Maleficent tried to entertain demographics of all age, Cinderella is a classic take on the original fairy tale, close to what the original animated Disney cult classic tried to portray. It's a very subtle approach to basic values like kindness and equality towards all individuals, no matter their background or heritage.It doesn't try to find common ground with values that are in debate right now, or ""problems"" that we have in our society at this point, rather it is a portrayal of the original Cinderella story as most already know it.If you are off age and are familiar with the original Cinderella animated movie, or the fairy tale in general, there is gonna be nothing new you get out of this real action adaptation.For me as an adult in my early 30s there was nothing I got out of this movie experience that I haven't seen or witnessed a dozen times already. If I had kids though, preferably in the 6-10 year bracket, I would definitely recommend watching this adaptation though. Despite it having nothing new to offer for ""older"" audiences, it is a genuine adaptation of the original without trying to blind you with stupid CGI effects, or explosions and unnecessary action. It is an ""old school"" fairy tale portrayed in a genuine fashion, that will most likely be very entertaining for young audiences and your own kids.While it has nothing much to offer for experienced adults, this is a great movie to show your kids, without having to worry about the ""now a days action/superhero movie"" kind of thing, which is a two edges sword. Cinderella is a kid friendly and well portrayed adaptation of the original we all got to know and hopefully love and your kids will hopefully too with this adaptation.If you want a satisfying movie experience or a nostalgic journey back to your youth, give it a try, otherwise this is definitely suited for young audiences and your own kids without having to worry about todays focus on action and style over substance.You got kids (especially in the one digit area) go watch it with them, you won't regret it.",Cinderella

Lily James.Never really knew who she was, but after watching Cinderella, I won't forget her.I thought this movie was fantastic. A straight forward retelling of the tale, great acting by the whole cast, wonderful cinematography.There were many children in the theater. I wouldn't say it's a perfect movie for children though, as they probably wouldn't enjoy much other than the cute little animals and ""magic"" and so on.More for teenage and adults.But what really impressed me was the chemistry between Cinderella and the king. So much charm. So much innocence. There's a certain spark between them so lacking in most other romance movies.And simply watching Lily James being happy, dancing around, singing to herself, it just comes across as believable and unimaginably endearing.I'm not embarrassed to say I was absolutely bewitched :)Finally, some reviewers say that Lily James doesn't have a Cinderella ""look"".Well, to be honest, I thought she was perfect for the role.So happy they didn't instead cast a more seductive, sultry, slutty, sexy looking actress, because it would have ruined the innocent feel of the movie.Straight forward retelling of the story.But so, so, SO well done.The audience also clapped at the end of the movie.Loved it so much, I'm gonna catch it one more time!",Cinderella

There was nothing new or unique about it except for the wonderful CGI(?) sequences of the making and unmaking of the carriage and retinue going to and from the ball. The stepsisters, while not being ugly, which is more PC, but less fun to watch, had nearly identical clothes, so that we really only got one version of their bad taste each time the two were shown. They also looked quite similar physically. Cate Blanchett wasn't really as evil as I had expected. Helena Bonham Carter seems to always take these quirky slightly older women's roles, i.e. fairy godmother, red queen, etc. and doesn't bring anything new anymore. Lily James as Cinderella had a lovely moment singing from the window. There should have been more of those moments. Cinderella's home was so stately and tasteful as to be boring. Finally, the Prince really had nothing special going for him. He seemed so ordinary and lacking in charisma.

This is a remake! This is the remake! The remake that was missing last year when Maleficient came into theaters and just, by structure, contradicted every value and theme of its original. Alas, this masterpiece brought to us from the director of Thor and Henry V, clearly illuminated every single nuance that necessitates and justifies the pure eloquence of a real Hollywood remake.

In 2015 however, it's just boring, uninspired, and every single bit uninteresting. Given that Cinderella is a story that has been done to death, and there's probably all kinds of twists introduced to spice up the story, this movie is as disappointing as eating a boiled potato after knowing the taste of french fries, curly fries, potato chips, and other delicious potatoness. Maybe Disney thinks it's a good idea to 'go back to the basic' and maybe they think that the audience is bored of all the flavorful potato dishes so they tried to sell this boiled potato as gourmet, but it didn't work. It's still a boiled potato. Bland and boring.I keep waiting for something exciting to happen because surely Disney can't just take Cinderella and serve it as is, but alas they did. Cate Blanchett did an amazing job, as always, but even her acting couldn't save the whole movie where everybody's character is one dimensional and (sorry for repeating myself) BORING. Did I mention boring? Because they are. It is. If you want to see a Cinderella movie that sticks pretty close to the story but still manage to be not boring, watch Ever After: A Cinderella Movie instead.I guess this would be good for little kids that's never seen Cinderella in their entire lives, but even the animation is better for that purpose.",Cinderella

Cinderella herself Lily James was a perfect choice for the lead with her soft voice and lovely smile she had the innocence of the original Cinderella we know and love but also had the strength to stand up to her stepmother and stand up for Prince Charming which was a brilliant addition to the fairy-tale.Overall, the story feels very true to the original whilst giving a modern feel too.

All I can say is that the little girl inside me loved it!! So did my 20 year old daughter that I watched it with. It was magical and beautifully filmed. The acting was superb. It was all that a fairytale should be.",Cinderella
318,sjpradeepk-957-93652,Ella Ella Ella,8,25 April 2015,"It is a tough bet to retell a story which has already been told not once but many number of times. We all know what happens in Cinderella, but it would take Disney to make an already known story to be interesting. The way this version of Cinderella has been told makes all the difference. Disney and Fairy tales are made for each other so much, that no matter how many times they tell the same story, it is still as interesting as watching it for the first time. Throw in some top class CGI to the fairy tale, and voila you have a stunning movie, and yes the movie was stunning, be it the palace, which i believe was CGI, the performances by the artists and above all the screenplay had been extremely well written all over the movie. Thankfully this one is not a musical like its predecessor, from Disney.So full marks to the director Kenneth Branagh, and full scores to Lily James for portraying the most loved character of all times. Also a special mention to the characterization of the prince,played by Madden, that rather than being portrayed as the lover boy Prince Charming, who just falls in love over Cinderella, in this version he shows his character by standing up for his love. Great work Disney, no matter how many times you retell a story, it is always as fresh as the first time.",Cinderella
319,nusrathowardmoore,Haute Couture Complex,8,29 October 2016,"That classic fairy tale girls are indoctrinated with in childhood about the charming prince, the metaphor that men are good and dependable, which ironically and cruelly actually set-up them up for utter disappointment in latter life when many women will eventually discover that almost all men will eventually fall short on the charming scale, is of course the basis of this film which is brilliantly directed by Kennath Brenagh.The screenwriter probably had in mind the idea of the 'Cinderally Complex' first postulated by Colette Dowling that surmises that women have an unconscious desire to be taken of, usually by men, to deal with and perhaps thus steered the modern version of Cinderalla less Trumped-up and more women- friendly. So it is Ella's father who is the flawed man STILL not satisfied with having had one perfect marriage but just had to have a 'second chance at happiness' after Ella's mother departure. And who did he choose to remarry after the demise of his first wife he missed 'all the time'? It just had to be someone he chose by her looks even if she was his business acquaintance's widow. And that is quite enough to put the glass not on the ceiling but on the foot.Cate Blanchet delivered a sterling performance of a perfectly evil stepmother whose laughter alone can't have been what Ella's father was drawn to to marry. The only reason he did marry her, apart from being in the common male nature never to be satisfied, must have been her look. Yes she was evil but she 'wore it very well' since Haute Couture can indeed make a women.Cinderalla is a tour-de-force of Couture Parisien. From the camera tilt from the train of the first gown of the stepmother to the long shot of her silhouette seconds later that screamed, Vogue Italia, you knew the film was going from quaint to serious red-carpet.Anyone who appreciates beautiful costumes would adore this film. Cinderalla was after all nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume. Kit, the Prince alone, who was metro- sexual enough to appreciate a smart woman's advice and fenced instead of playing something idiotic like soccer, never wore anything not cool and suave. Though all the best dresses except one was worn by the stepmother, Cinderalla wore the most beautiful dress of them all- not at the ball but at her wedding. We certainly did not see enough of that gem! Apart from being an Haute Couture feast for the eyes, this film had its absolutely hilarious moments. In particular was when the pumpkin was turned into a golden carriage. It takes a director with comic timing to execute the hilarity of the godmother and Ella leaning back as the pumpkin grew before it exploded. Then there is the memorably funny scene of everything magical turning back organic. Even the score was delightful and nominated for an award.The writing was of course lovely not only for spinning a modern women-cherishing film from a sexist fairy tale but for hilarious one-liners such as 'I can't drive, I'm a goose'.Then there is the 'perfect' casting and priceless chemistry between Lily James and Richard Madden. Now that is a pairing to be immortalised. Only because of chemistry could the first dance look so enchanting and make even the most ardent believers in the Cinderalla Complex put their guard down long enough to realise that women do have an innate desire but only to struggle to be appreciated and hopefully cherished by a man, even if that man in reality is rarer than a man choosing this film over The Avangers. In its own genre, Cinderalla is a 9.5/10. In the open field it is a guilty pleasure of 'serious filmmakers' of the female kind. A film to watch again and again to keep having FAITH in human goodness when men disappoint you in more ways than you can wear Haute Couture. When everything is in place even fairy tales come to life.",Cinderella
320,3DSpecs,Disney Excels Again,10,1 February 2017,"My disappointment was hearing that critics had found fault with this work of perfection.The characterisation has been thought through carefully and the temptation to make caricatures of the step-mother and her daughters consciously resisted.The retelling of ""Cinderella"" (apparently known, in the 19th century, as ""Cinderslut"") with the benefits of modern techniques and processes is impeccable.Often, films that are 'great works' suffer from some minor weakness or other, a detail not followed through, a hasty bit of editing, a clipped or overly long scene but never did I feel that could be said about Disney's film.

The kids really enjoyed it, the central characters are all very well-cast in my opinion. One thing I really enjoyed was how positive and uplifting this film was. Family was central to this one, which was nice to see. It kept the magic of the original Disney animated film, yet made it more emotionally satisfying and I felt more involved with the characters. The music was beautiful and made me want to buy the soundtrack. The whole audience clapped and cheered at the movie theater we were at, which made it a more memorable experience.

324,solomani,A real female hero who remains feminine throughout.,8,24 April 2015,"I watched this yesterday with my eldest daughter on a Daddy Daughter Date. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Kudos to Disney for not trying to turn Cinderella into an action- hero of some kind. They stuck fairly close to the original story which was excellent. It is a perfect example of a female character being heroic without surrendering her femininity. And since they did not change the original story much the original Biblical overtones come through still - the king pursuing and redeeming his wife.It did seem Disney couldn't resist placing the story in Sofie the First land with odd mix-up of kingdoms from Japan, China and Africa bumping shoulders in a place which otherwise looked like 18th Century England. Right down to the accents. I suppose the PC police had to make some intrusion. But these are minor quibbles in an otherwise excellent film.",Cinderella
325,loveovel,"Disappointing, and the weakest of the live action adaptations so far",6,9 July 2019,"To be fair, Cinderella is not the most complex or interesting in terms of plot or character development. This version is cute, beautifully created, and very family friendly. However, it was disappointing that the music of the animated version was not included, and it was an utter waste of Lily James as Cinderella that they only had her sing a song during the end credits. Take note, Disney- the iconic music of your films is a major draw, and not including it really diminishes the quality of your adaptations. Beauty and the Beast was way better, in part because of the music.",Cinderella
326,lilyplusplus,Stunning and Heartwarming,8,31 March 2015,"I don't often see movies in the cinema, but when I do it's usually when I go back to the city. I suppose you could say it's a tradition between me and my mom – it's one of the ways we like spending time with each other. I, as most other people, did not have extremely high expectations when going into this one. That stems from my experience last year with ""Maleficent"", which I thought had so much potential and ended up turning into a everyone-is-a-good-guy-only- girls'-kisses-can-revive-you circle jerk. Furthermore, I was aware of the new Frozen short clip at the beginning and was interested in checking it out. Lastly, hello, Richard Madden (Robb Stark finally got to marry his common girl *tear*) and I cannot deny, Lily James's face is quite flawless too.The movie had its flaws and whatnot but I found it a significant improvement over Sleeping Beauty's retelling. I loved all the actors and I wholeheartedly disagree that Lily James does not fit into the Cinderella image – I thought she was absolutely beautiful and her smile is just so radiant that it made me smile as well (I sound like creepo but I'm sincere over here). But the thing I liked the most were the visuals. I don't know how Disney does it but their visuals are always above everyone else's in my opinion. I enjoyed the change of color scheme as the movie progressed; you could see the emotions in just the lighting. Of course, the plot itself was something we've all seen before, nothing new, but this was a retelling after all.Overall, I found this movie quite stunning and it most definitely left an impression on me. Make sure if you watch it to do so in high definition, or most of its charm would be lost (don't go watching the pirated cinema copies online, they don't do it justice). If you like sweet stories and one helluva sexy villain, don't hesitate to go and watch it, whether it's with someone young or old.Final word: Purrty. | Date watched: 2015.03.22 | Rating: 8 | 10",Cinderella
327,flagmichael,A good Disney family movie,8,16 March 2015,"(Minor spoilers in second paragraph.) Adults who expect an edgy movie in the Maleficent mold will be disappointed. Cinderella is a movie in the modern Disney format; age-old fairy tale told in the family-friendly Disney style. It is suitable for adults but not optimized for them - instead, parents can take their small children without being subjected to Barney the Dinosaur saccharin. My wife, our adult (38 yr. old) son and I watched it yesterday for ourselves and to determine which grandchildren could watch it. We decided all three, from 3 to 8 years old, would love it.We liked it a lot, too. The cinematography/CGI was gorgeous, casting was very good, the story flow was hurried but interesting, and the systematic cruelty of the step-mother was muted just enough to avoid children's nightmares. Cinderella's parents die (separately, of unspecified illnesses) in the course of the story but each leave her with a legacy of love and kindness. The whole audience laughed out loud at least a dozen times and many families were chattering happily when they filed out of the theater. Helena Bonham Carter steals the show with her portrayal of a brash fairy godmother. The happy ending includes merciful treatment of the villains and nobody suffers actual violence.",Cinderella

It's so pleasing to the eye, I adore the dress, the scenery, everything is just so perfect. It's an absolute visual delight. My favourite Cinderella re-make, in general, though, is Ever after with Drew Barrymore. I can never get tired of re-watching that one. Whereas this one, I would watch for the aesthetics, which I simply adore. In my opinion, the storytelling could have been stronger in this one, they could have added more comedic, mystery elements etc ...something to make it a little different (just as Ever-after did). Unfortunately, it doesn't stray that much from the original animated Cinderella and having some sort of twist or a different interpretation/ other elements added to it would have made this film more interesting and elevated it to a whole other level. I still recommend it, however, if simply for the aesthetics alone, it's a live animation that's absolutely beautiful to watch.

Cate Blanchett holds nothing back depicting a beautiful villain. Lily James is the fairest, kindest Cinderella as is Richard Madden the handsomest, kindest of princes. Their chemistry is intoxicating for us all as our hearts leap along with theirs at the sight of one another. The movie is a visual feast in every moment with the most magnificent scenery and special effects! The making of the princess and her carriage by a wonderfully played fairy godmother is cleverly done with a nice nuance shed in the possibility of reaping a reward for doing an act of kindness for a stranger. We found the movie whimsically entertaining in the most joyous of ways with a smile on our faces much of the time unless peril for Cinderella seemed imminent. My husband even blurted out, ""hurry for Pete's sake, get down there before it's too late,"" during a suspenseful moment when it seemed certain that Cinderella would miss her chance to try on the glass slipper!

I adore how the story is told and by whom, but that is revealed at the end of the movie. No spoilers here. If you are expecting to compare this to Ever After, then just stay home. There is no comparison. Helena Bonham Carter did a wonderful job as the fairy godmother; quirky as always, and funny! This movie is one that I want to see again.

The acting feels very true, the score is just classic and the cinematography is wonderful.I spent my childhood with Disney movies and I can surely tell: no one tells these stories better than Disney does, they've mastered it to perfection.Finally, it is incredibly fulfilling to see nowadays a classic fairytale such as this with a female heroin who is just kind and sweet (by the way, Lily James seems to be born to play this role) and does not have to be spunky and outgoing to be admired.",Cinderella

I did not like their casting choice for Cinderella, although may have liked her more had they dyed her eyebrows to go with her hair. The prince however, was exceedingly handsome and very well selected. I also was quite disappointed that there was only 1 song throughout which was not in the animated version and wasn't even that great. Although it is not a musical, I felt Disney could have stuck with at least one original song for those who are Disney classic fans. I did enjoy watching the movie but I'm not sure it's something I would watch again. i have only just watched it yet I find it a struggle to think of something memorable other than those beautiful glass slippers and that stunning carriage which I have been lucky enough to see in person. Sadly it is proof that live action does not live up to the original animation. I feel in order for it to succeed it would need to be the same story line with all the animated characters coming to life, rather than missing them out because they are not 'realistic'",Cinderella

I really just wanted a nice simple classic remake of Cinderella. This was complicated. Cinderella was ugly. Her makeup was ghastly. Her dress had these cheesy butterflies on it, like why? People had weird English accents but then there were some black people around & an exotic princess at the ball who wanted the princes' attention -- I mean, what planet & century are we in? There was way too much death everywhere. Despite her obsession about kindness & courage, she barely displayed courage & she was most definitely not kind at the end. The writing was a put-off, just sadly elementary. Then there was the out-of-place secret garden -- Did I accidentally stumble into the wrong book? What just happened? While she was dancing, there was way too much moaning. Honestly, I think they should have titled this ""Cinderella's Secret.... Garden"".",Cinderella

345,davejephcott,Can't see Cinderella being topped in 2015! What an experience!,10,25 March 2015,"It's hard for a man to admit to watching Cinderella. It's even more humiliating to be the one who dragged his wife along to watch it. Yet, the final straw in the haystack of humiliation came after the movie had finished and to my astonishment found out that I had enjoyed it more than my wife did. With that confession out of the way, let me tell you a little about this wonderful retelling of the classical tale of Cinderella.If you have watched the original 1950s cartoon or some of the many other renditions based on the Cinderella story, then there shouldn't be much to surprise you here. Kenneth Branagh chooses to stick to the trodden path and retell the story almost exactly as it had been told in the original. However, you must forgive me for not remembering every detail from the original which I haven't seen in decades. This latest live-action version bears no surprises, twists or turns. Everything is as it was, and to my surprise, I was completely okay with it. It was truly a refreshing and rewarding experience to watch a movie untouched by the crude and base content so many movies these days are smeared with. Not even family movies are free from scenes or language that is entirely inappropriate to the little ones and unhealthy for the old. Thankfully, this tale chooses to tell the story in as clean a manner as possible. Bravo, Kenneth.The acting was superb. Every part was well-acted and every moment the main characters shared together felt special and meaningful. Lily James as Cinderella and Cate Blanchett as her wicked step- mother were particularly good in their roles. They gave the film true class, and I believe in less capable hands, this film might have been far less endearing and praiseworthy. The guy who played Kit, the prince who falls in love with Cinderella, was also likable and believable in his role. The colours, sets, decorations, costumes and music were brilliant. It seemed that almost every scene had something in it that deserved further inspection. Therefore, there will be many hankering for another trip to the cinema for another dose of this buffet of wonder.I can't lie. One reason that can explain why I really enjoyed this movie was because the day before I had seen Into the Woods, which is quite simply the worst fairytale movie I have ever seen. That was the main reason why we wanted to watch Cinderella, to simply get the bad taste out of our mouths from that travesty of a movie. And it did that in spades. Please go see Cinderella if you have young kids or if there is a little bit of romance in your heart which you hope to be rekindled. Your little girls will especially be enchanted with the story of this lovely princess whose motto in life was to ""have courage and be kind,"" which she truly lived out. This movie succeeded in something which few films these days rarely achieve, to inspire me to love my wife more and appreciate her for the lovely woman she is. A woman's courage and kindness is truly a wonderful thing to behold, and we men often forget to value such things as we should. Don't miss out on this gem!",Cinderella
346,texastay,Made me fall in love with fairy tales again..,10,23 March 2015,"I'm in my 20s and it's been a long time since i've actually enjoyed watching a fairytale. Cinderella helped me fall in love with fairy tales again. I actually think that now as an adult I can appreciate fairy tales more than when I was a kid. What I love most about the movie is that it promotes kindness and courage, which may sound cliché but in the movie we see that kindness attracts the right kind of people, without kindness Cinderella would have never attracted the prince that first day in the forest, and she would have never attracted the fairy godmother. If Cinderella had become bitter and angry like her step-mother and step-sisters, she would have not only made herself no better than them, but she would have pushed away the prince and the fairy godmother and her life probably would have stayed the same or even worse, she may have ended up just like her step-mother and step- sisters. I never realized it before, but Cinderella is more of a story about kindness and forgiveness. Although it is a romantic story too, I think the romance element of the story is not the most important part of this story.",Cinderella

348,ShudderMight-186-823352,An unoriginal story so well-packaged the plot almost seems redundant,8,12 April 2015,"Cinderella, a retelling of Disney's 1950s animated film of the same name features Downtown Abbey's Lily James as the title character and Oscar-Winning Cate Blanchett as the wicked step- mother, Writer Chris Weitz offers the safest script of Disney up-to-date, following the critical failures of 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and 'Maleficent'.The film opens with classically engaging narration and a few scenes of cinematographically enhanced realism, alongside with the lovely soundtrack which felt just a bit too much with its almost perpetual presence, overshadowing Haley Atwell's short time as Ella's Mother, whose skill to convey the face of a dying yet loving woman left a bit to be desired, thus unlike the father who met his demise much later failed to make much of a visual impression for the audiences to remember reminiscently. However the ongoing motif of kindness and courage prevails beyond the over-linear storyline, presenting itself constantly throughout the film as an ongoing moral which was at times lacking in the aforementioned two darker adaptations. More great scoring ensued including the build up to Cate Blanchett's appearance, who instantly grabbed the attention and became the master of sarcastically delivered wickedness. Along with the adequate and often astoundingly-mismatched-yet-somehow-worked costumes and not to mention the set decorations, one soon could see that Lily James was a suitable if not perfect cast, for her appearance can be greatly altered to appeal both in ashes and in gowns, and her acting, though not as polished as fellow co-star Blanchett, was acceptable in a fairy-tale styled production such as this. Art direction/Production design was perhaps one of the finest of this year so far, I would even say daringly that the Academy Awards Costume Designing or Production Design will have a slot for Cinderella to fill, alongside later films such as makeup master Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, In the Heart of the Sea and Pan if no other new comers barge in for a steal. Both in the grandeur of the palace & the carriage and the intricate details such as the contrast between horses' hair in the forest scene, these visual elements succeed to amaze. Scenery portrayal also complements the motion picture nicely with open shots of the forest and the impressive bird's eye view of the palace; with satisfactory editing, the technical side was mostly without flaw either, particularly the sound mixing from the singing scene which demonstrated proficiency in the rendering of the audio, to sound distant yet remaining unintrusive to the vital dialogues. Aside from the rigidity of Richard Madden (Prince) in some scenes, the acting overall was reasonably good given the genre it's in, where actors/actresses would be overshadowed by visual effects, however the few that doesn't do a great job at fulfilling their characters, adding a certain spice into the film; aside from Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter (Fairy Godmother), despite the relatively short screen time was a genuine laugh.There isn't much to say about the flaws of Cinderella, nonetheless the one there is is easily recognizable and fatal to many audiences- the conservative and simple plot Branagh and Weitz chose to present the modern adaptation with.It's understandable why Disney would choose a safer way to go after the highly criticized Maleficent, and frankly the slaughtering of the musical 'Into the Woods' where a great deal of the plot was shifted to secure a PG rating. Such method is what left much to be desired in 'Cinderella', however it also secured a smooth trail for Ella to walk upon, for the viewing pleasure of modern audiences it chooses to expand in the details rather than altering what's before; new segments such as the King's 'marry for love' encouragement, the bitter realist Grand Duke and the brief back story of Lady Tremaine proves this point.ScoringPerfection 0.1/0.5 -Capable of sustaining through multiple viewing-Deliver genre specific impact (high dramatic tension, emotional impact, stunt action etc.)Cinderella delivers what a fairy tale is supposed to offer, voicing life with a moral of kindness and courage and also, a bit of magic. -Satisfactory soundtrack -Acceptably original plot containing originality even if the film itself is an adaptation-A standalone masterpiece requiring no sequel Musical Composition/ Sound track 1.3/1.5(Genre Specialties) Additional visual effects, additional costume and hair 1.4/1.5Makeup, Costume, hairstyle 0.5/0.5 Adapted Script (on the basis of Grimms) 1.6/2Acting 1.2/1.5Casting 0.4/0.5Technical works (Visual editing, Sound editing/mixing, Cinematography) 0.3/0.5Production Design1.5/1.5Overall: 8.3/10",Cinderella

Oh yeah, the Cinderella bonus feature after the movie was pretty good too, I guess... Similarly to many others, I was bribed into viewing Cinderella full priced because the movie producers kind of forced us only be able to see Frozen Fever if we saw Cinderella afterward. I got to the theater super extra special early, plotted my seat out for the optimum viewing experience with my jumbo $14 popcorn and my $6 16oz drink and I sat through the duration of the previews until finally I saw the logo for Frozen Fever and literally everyone in the theater sat forward eager to see the short. It was amazing and totally worth my $10.25... I didn't really have any money left so I couldn't actually go see another movie (hence the $11 dollar ticket and $20 worth of snacks) and I didn't have a ride yet so I was kind of stuck there awkwardly with these strangers and the movie started playing so I decided to just watch... Allow me to just say that I wasn't completely bored out of my skull, but Cinderella (2015) just didn't do the 1950 version justice... My favorite part was watching the animations of the transformation of the carriage and most definitely looking at her dress in general... Besides that I am really impartial towards it.",Cinderella
350,bohem5,A wonderful feel good movie!,9,26 March 2015,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this film. I began watching the film feeling terrible (after having a bad day) but by the time the credits began rolling in, I was feeling like I was back to my ten year old self.The movie in one word was, beautiful. We all know what the story of Cinderella is. The movie focused less on the ""what"" and instead, it does a brilliant job in portraying the ""how."" The movie is told beautifully with amazing soundtrack, cast, setting, special effects, costume design and acting. I felt like I was being told the story for the first time.It had the perfect mixture of fantasy (the fantasy of this ""far away land"" in nature with all the castles and forests) yet the characters were somehow so very modern and hence, very surprisingly easy to relate to. Lily James was wonderful as Ella - I felt like she really remained pure throughout the whole movie. She was so likable! It was really genuine and authentic - likewise for the Prince and I think the authenticity of the two characters was what made us love them so much as both individuals and as a couple.The transformation scene - the scene that really is the ""dream"" for every little girl out there - was done superbly. Every effect and every detail was so well done. The costumes of course did not disappoint.The story was like one long wave - it had such a ""flowing"" feel to it - just like the floating characteristic of Cinderella's beautiful gown. I have never really felt the urge to write a movie review but for this one I had to.A wonderful and beautiful feel good movie - that brought back so many of my young memories when I still dreamed of beautiful balls, gowns and fairy godmothers.",Cinderella
351,michaelarrens,Cinderella Is A Rubbish Movie Even For Kids.,1,30 March 2015,"Cinderella 2015 is a rubbish movie even for kids.This is not a new creative movie, but rather a dull copy of Cinderella's fairytale.Once again Disney tries to warp the minds of children into believing that fictional creatures can create the impossible. (The scene when the lizard used his tail to close the gate was one of these scenes which delude kids that Lizards could perform miracles.Disney has been exposed of using hidden sexual images in their drawings in order to corrupt and pervert kids. Search for hidden sexual images in Disney's animation.Honestly, I don't have anything personal against Disney,but I have found out that they had already lost the glamour.The acting was poor in general and the cinematography was too ordinary.No innovation whatsoever in this remake.I advise you to save your money and time and to avoid this film.Disney's massive advertisement of Cinderella simply aims at deluding you and tempting you to see a worthless movie and to make profits at the expense of naive children who always believe the manipulatory media.",Cinderella
352,Bethandavis,Cinderella - a simpering simpleton,1,1 June 2015,"I was disgusted by the disparaging portrayal of Cinderella in this film, and the weak role model she represents to children. Throughout the film there were frequent times when Cinderella could have stood up to her step-sisters and step-mother who bullied her. But instead she takes the rather dubious moral high-ground of ""I must be kind and courageous"". Since when did being 'kind' equate to being a dupe and a push over? Of course it all works out well for Cinderella who is rescued by her fairy god mother and prince - a great lesson to teach our children...not. With her continual chatting to animals and air-headed behaviour I was inclined to believe that her step-sisters were correct - Cinderella was a simpleton. At which point I lost all interest and rather hoped the prince would marry the wicked step- mother, who at least had a backbone. The film ended with the surmise that Cinderella was courageous (in case you had any doubts) as she faced the prince without makeup and a flouncy dress on - well done Cinderella. I too can't bear to face a man without looking my utmost prettiest and best. Oh, one last thing Cinderella - if you had really wanted to wear your dead mothers 'pink' dress to the ball, what were you thinking when you let the fairy godmother turn it into a blue meringue? Oh sorry I forgot...you have to be ""kind"".",Cinderella

I could connect with Cinderella and the design was absolutely stunning. The dress was beautiful and I loved how Cinderella changed from the beginning to the end but still held on to her values as a person. I also loved how I could understand the Stepmother and why she does what she does. When I finished this movie the message stayed with me. I don't usually like movies with ""true love"" but this movie made it work. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.

And yes The acting was so good i cried like so many times..my fave was Prince Kit and the King's scene,Lily crying when her dress was ripped and the first dance oh god it was magic! and the gown transformation was so epic! The lead actors chemistry is so strong.. i fell in love with them. This movie is so uplifting makes me do kind deeds every time! People saying it was boring have a heart of stone for real.

But of course, that's not all what's to love about it. Cinderella doesn't lack the heartbreaking feel as most movies would, and could bring most people to tears as it gives an explanation as to why she is called ""Cinder"" Ella. We get a clearer backstory of Ella's past and Cate Blanchett rocks the role as Lady Tremaine. Not to mention they've shown that even the prince deals with his own family issues unlike the 1950s version. A great remake, in my opinion.",Cinderella

Every time I get done seeing this movie it has the same effect on me, I have seen it so many times and I never get tired of watching it! Guys you have got to watch this! The animated version is nothing compared to this movie. I also liked the fact that they outdid themselves with Ella's dress and that her hair was kept down instead of putting it being up in a bun like it was in the animated version.
The actresses who played the part as her step sisters did a great job as well as Cate Blanchett playing the role of the step mother. The crew who edited the movie outdid itself on the graphics, the magic was perfect! Thank you for making such a wonderful remake!",Cinderella

Sixty years ago, Walt Disney's painters, story-writers made the mice and the birds come up with a plot to unlock Cinderella, get her dressed. They communicated, they ran, they tricked the cat, they climbed the chairs, they sewed the dress. That's how fairy tales are retouched, which pleased both children and parents. I'm sure we don't mind real actors doing exactly that, with the help of computer graphics.I'm giving this movie 2 stars because the lizard used his tail to close the gate.

362,mace-roache,Timeless Classic,9,16 March 2015,"I was a little apprehensive to see this movie as I pegged it for a ""chick flick"". It was a date night with my girlfriend and usually i'm bored by these kinds of movies. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how captivating the movie was! I felt the pace in the beginning was a bit slow though, and these folks talking about ""oh, I saw the trailer so I knew what was going to happen"", are idiotic. Of COURSE you've seen the movie, the Cinderella story has been around for twice to three times our own lifetimes if not MORE in many cultures out there. *******potential spoilers************I think the the screenplay, actor(s) and actress(s) casting and the slight differences made this a ""kids movie for adults"". We grew up watching these movies as children in some capacity, so therefor myself and my girlfriend had a bit of nostalgia while not having to watch a ""cartoon"" per say. I did say, in a joking manner, if they don't have the singing mice i'll be VERY disappointed; although they didn't exactly have that, they defiantly nailed it very tastefully throughout with her ""creature companions"". The one thing that does get me about this version, is I wish they could have somehow re-written was the fact her very loving father who only wanted the best for his daughter, somehow married an evil stepmother, then left her to fend for herself while he was away. I know the writing can't always take off down that road as it would be hard to bring it back to the title person in the movie. The evil stepmother showed up evil, had evil daughters. How could Cinderella's father NOT see these people are awful?! I feel as though he should have maybe had some similar ties like the prince to potentially be ""forced"" to marry the evil stepmother in an attempt to make his fortunes or business stronger. In the end the strings I feel are tied up and the movie is brought back to its center stronghold of Love, Kindness and Forgiveness.",Cinderella

The beautiful principles, the compelling story, cinematography, and acting (I could go on and on) ... was phenomenal!!! Lily James truly brings Cinderella to life the humility, honesty, and authenticity to stage. There are so many great morals and lessons to learn from this story as well... I was tearing up through major parts of it! When trials come, the central characters are truly tested and the heroic qualities of the protagonists become more genuine and authentic than ever. The filmography was truly magical & musical scores were on point. I have not seen a movie this excellent in so long and it was such a breath of fresh air. A stunning take on a timeless story. Also, this movie is not just for girls... There is something in it for everyone, guys or girls, young or old... everyone can glean from it. Please do yourself a favor and go see it with your loved ones!

365,filmclassics44,Disney's Most Beautiful and Crucial Live-Action Adaptation,10,23 June 2017,"There are SO MANY adaptations of the most iconic fairy tale of all time, whether it takes place in modern time and stars Hilary Duff or Selena Gomez, and of course everyone knows the original 1950 animated Disney classic. Disney is bringing many, MANY of their most iconic animated films to life on the big screen, and I'll say this: if they can all be as good as Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella (2015), then please, Disney, continue making them.Cinderella (2015) stars somewhat newcomer Lily James, who could not have been more perfect as Cinderella (Ella); Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine (Wicked Stepmother); Richard Madden as the Prince (Kit); Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother; Derek Jacobi as The King; Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera as Anastasia and Drisella; and Ben Chaplin and Hayley Atwell as Ella's parents. This movie, and I cannot emphasize this enough, truly brought to the screen the MAGIC of 1950's masterpiece. I truly don't believe that any other actress could have been more charming in the title role as Lily James. This really was the first time I've seen her in a movie, and I became an instant fan. Her voice (singing and speaking), mannerisms, charm and beauty make you wonder if she really is born into a family of royalty. She was everything Cinderella is supposed to be, and definitely a wonderful role model to young ones. The chemistry between Lily James and Richard Madden was like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, well, a family version, they were so perfect for each other. Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham Carter were so wonderful (of course), the whole cast gave tremendous performances. I loved how we learned and sympathized a bit more with Lady Tremaine overall.Now, the highlight of course of any Cinderella movie is the ball, or maybe the transformation. I can't even describe how beautifully the movie executed Ella's dress transformation, you feel like you're in the air, dancing along as her moment of freedom grabs her. And Sandy Powell, wow, that blue dress, I hope that she continues working more and more on the best films, which she mainly does; that dress was literally another character in this movie, that's how magnificent it is; I have never seen a more beautiful dress in my life, this dress is going to be a major part of film history.This is (in my opinion), Disney's best live-action adaptation of their classics, some may argue The Jungle Book (2016) is, but I'm going with Cinderella (2015), it has such great messages, especially for kids about having courage and being kind even during the worst of your sufferings. Why is this such a spectacular movie? Because anybody with a heart will want to commit an act of kindness after watching this movie.",Cinderella
366,dfbairn,"To view, or not to view? That is the question.",8,27 March 2015,"After reading through a few reviews I thought it best to give the full picture, with regards to whether or not Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella deserves your precious time. Before we examine the film itself, we must first look at the short that precedes it. 'Frozen Fever' is a wonderfully silly short, bringing back the lovable characters at Disney's biggest ever money making film; so if your a fan of Frozen it's worth going just for that. If you're still struggling to get your friends and family to stop singing 'Let it Go"" then don't worry, it's only a short and the song is fairly unmemorable anyway.The main story of the film is essentially the same as any other version of the timeless tale, with perhaps a few small additions. At any rate it's not winning the award for best original screenplay, but, let's be honest, what did you expect? While it does not propose, explore, and expound profound philosophies, it's simple message of kindness, albeit slightly ooshy-mushy, is worth a second thought; however fleeting it may be.The acting particularly has been criticized and admittedly it's not Shakespearean. But unless you are a theatrical connoisseur whose sole purpose in life is to write shunning reviews, and only finds pleasure in leaving the cinema discontented; then you're really not going to notice. Nor care.Should you be unfamiliar with the story of Cinderella, then you should be warned that it involves magical elements, and thus requires an audience with something called: ""IMAGINATION"" If this word is unfamiliar to you then I suggest you avoid this film like the plague, for it is grossly impractical to believe a fairy godmother will come to your aid. However, if you do possess this most wondrous of traits then by all means, watch the movie! Although the audience comprised of mostly young girls in princess dress, the film caters for slightly older audiences too. And not just girls at that. So if you are prepared to risk your dignity, the G rating, and the possibility of accidentally enjoying yourself; then go for it. So if you're prepared to have fun, relive your childhood and get caught up in the magic, then this is the film for you. And above all, make sure you stay till the end of the credits...",Cinderella
367,rezartamevia,This Cinderella reminds me of when I was little,7,18 March 2015,"This movie reminds me of when I was little. When I was a kid, I really wanted to be Cinderella, met with a fairy godmother, met the prince and happy ending. It's been a long time I did not watch Cinderella until finally there is the human version, not the cartoon. Cinderella dress worn when the dance, was amazing. There are some different from the cartoon version (1950). In the cartoon we see Cinderella itself that makes the whole dress with the help of her friends rat. But, in the human version, Cinderella just fixing her mother old dress. Overall, this movie is very nice to watch. Nothing bad to watch movies back to our childhood. This movie, make me want to be Cinderella again. Thing that I like from Cinderella is her kindness, humbleness and she look smart in this movie. At one part she talk with another language (French or Italy). Actually, In this movies you will find something that we do not know about Cinderella.

However The movie lacks originality and it adds nothing new to the original story, it's pretty much just a live action remake of the original. If that was the aim than they did a remarkable job, seriously it was very well made, but I found that the lack of originality made it kind of boring, and although I know cheesy dialogue kind of comes with the territory I found some of the lines in this film corny as f**k. I also didn't find the story that interesting mainly because I knew how it ended.

Everything was at the top of the rating scale.Yes, Branagh directed Thor(which I very much enjoyed and was proud of his accomplishment). But Branagh must have been on a mission with Cinderella, making this movie unforgettable and totally memorable. It must be said that all the actors were supreme.While I sometimes rate movies with a ten because I enjoyed the movie so much, I do not think I have ever rated a movie with a ten, knowing nothing could be done any better to satisfy me any more, until now.

I just knew that a movie that describes the real story is not recently made, so I thought that it would be great to watch it. I have been watching movies all my life, and indeed this was the first time I really felt that magic really exists. It was because of many factor. First the story, presented in such way, the costumes the details all designed to felt so real. The act by all the actors and the sound.

Enter into the world of innocence and enchantment. Every actor/actress played their role perfectly. Small details of importance add to the story and gives it life. This would have to be the first modern classic of a Grimms fairytale in my view. Nothing was over done or too extravagant. I felt emotional through out the movie going through each experience with Ella. She was pure delight and the perfect actress was chosen to play her. Each emotional journey I was there with her and feeling her pain and joy. Very rarely have I experienced this from a movie. The whole atmosphere of the movie built up every critical scene to truly capture the innocence of a child brought up in a loving home with loving parents.

We have a right to feel that way because we don't want a re-make to be ""less than"" or really bad. Even though you knew what was going to happen, it wasn't a drag to watch, or anticlimactic.

In a politically correct society, it is refreshing to see a true fairy tale, that can take you away from the world for a couple hours, but also is believable told, minus the fairy godmother of course. We found this movie full of heart, and I was especially touched by the relationships between Ella and her parents and the Prince and his father. Our heroine does not need to have an attitude or get revenge on those who have wronged her to come across as strong. She is a great roll model to women of all ages that you really can be the hero by killing them with kindness. Thank you Disney for this gem that we will treasure always!",Cinderella
374,dixonbixon,My kids hated this overrated movie.,1,14 March 2015,"I don't know Why Walt Disney movies have become so dull and tasteless.The story of Cinderella is a great story,but the acting is simply terrible and the movie is so boring.The story of ""Cinderella"" follows the fortunes of young Ella, whose merchant father remarries following the tragic death of her mother. Keen to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother Lady Tremaine and her daughters Anastasia and Drizella into the family home. But when Ella's father suddenly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella since she works in the cinders, Ella could easily begin to lose hope.Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words to ""have courage and be kind."" She will not give in to despair, nor despise those who abuse her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really the prince and not merely an employee at the palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears as if her fortunes may be about to change when the palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming ""Kit."" Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand as a kindly beggar woman steps forward and, armed with a pumpkin and a few mice, changes Cinderella's life forever.Disney failed to make a masterpiece from this cliché.Most kids including my children hated this film and found it boring and uninteresting.The story of Cinderella has been extremely overused.I don't know why Disney insists on making a new modern version from this cliché!.

The glass slippers, made of crystal, reflecting light, gorgeous. Some people are complaining about pumpkins and lizards and things. Well, the movie is for kids, too. I took my 5 year old the first time and she loved it. Its really not that much at all, but it's for the kids. It also teaches kids to have courage and be kind and I love that Disney always has a lesson for kids to learn! I recommend this movie to everyone. Even just to see that gorgeous dress that is to die for. The dance scene was breathtaking. I also loved how they added a few things to the storyline that wasn't in the cartoon Cinderella. More on her parent. I loved that they had more of a Cinderella/Prince love story as well. Overall, Disney knocked it out of the park, as usual. They never disappoint.",Cinderella
376,grace-doody,Midnight is just the beginning.,7,13 April 2015,"Everyone knows the story of Cinderella. If you don't then here is an overview of the story. The story is of a girl called Ella (Lily James) who's mother dies when she is young. When she is older her father decides to remarry. While her father is away he is taken ill and sadly passes away, leaving her at the mercy of her cruel step mother (Cate Blanchett) and her step sisters. Having been bought up to have courage and be kind, she does everything her step mother and sisters tell her to do, until one day her step sisters gives her the nick name Cinderella. Feeling upset she goes for a ride and meets a handsome stranger, who little to her knowledge is the Prince (Richard Madden). The Prince wanting to see Cinderella again invites all the maidens of the land to a ball, in which he is supposed to find a wife. Her Step Mother forbids her to go, however with the help of her Fairy God Mother (Helena Bonham Carter), she goes to the ball and sees the Prince again. At midnight she leaves to get home before the magic runs out but leaves one of her glass slippers behind, the prince then finds the slipper and demands that she is to be found.So first things first, whoever's idea it was to make Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy god mother is a genius! She was amazing, I honestly couldn't think of a better match! I was very happy because considering that this is a film for children it was still really good as an adult. it was like reliving my childhood.

377,crimsonnaire,A Revamped Adaptation!,10,29 March 2015,"There are plenty of love-themed movies out there, but this Cinderella boldly stands out. It touches on all the different types of love that are experienced through friendship, family, and romance. Most importantly, it gives a strong emphasis for why loving-kindness should be maintained, even in an environment that lacks thereof. Ultimately, because this film uses a magnificent combination of outstanding performance, stunning visual effects, and elaborate settings to incorporate all the original elements of the story, it is a fully revamped adaptation that embodies all the profound themes of love in all its forms and is sure to leave a lasting impression on people from all walks of life.",Cinderella
378,mpowers-27478,Beautiful Remake,10,16 September 2019,"This movie by far is my favorite Disney live remake. The movie is visually stunning and captures the very essence of what makes Disney so magical. James, Blanchett, Madden and the rest of the cast were superb and Branagh hands down brought the magic ten fold. Best Cinderella (Barrymore's Cinderella a close second) film made to date and will remain timeless it was that well made.",Cinderella
379,MaryamAlarraby,Enjoyed every bit of the movie!!,10,25 June 2019,"This Cinderella movie is the best, I love how her character is stronger than the old Cinderella we used to hear about. Great casting!",Cinderella
380,lucia-chi,This film is for my future children,10,11 October 2018,"I loved this film. Although I hated to use the word- it is lovely. I really enjoyed the bravery of Cinderella and her determination to find good in all situations. She is quiet but kind and a perfect role model. The special effects are not overdone and beautiful.In a world where being silly and bizzare is celebrated - like Anna and Rapunzel (which is not a bad thing), it's lovely to see the old classic fairytale being revived. I hope more follow suit",Cinderella
381,ellacinderlla,Just,1,13 June 2021,"I hate the fact that she looks nothing like the Cinderella. Not her eye color her smile she looks like she wears dentures. In all of the new Disney movies with real people the stepmothers are the ones better looking than the princesses lol. Excepts on Maleficent Elle Fanning should've represented Cinderella even though she fits Sleeping beauty perfectly Lily Collins fits Snow White perfectly too not Kristen Steward. I am a big fan of Cinderella I just hate this version where the step mother is a lot gorgeous than Cinderella. And this actress always looked out of breath for almost all of the scenes way too dramatic and the godmother was awful too why not keep it more like the cartoon movie and look for someone who will fit even on her age? Not to mention the actress who does godmother was off too, and the prince has a wrinkly face I'm sorry I know lots of people will react to my comment but oh well they can agree or disagree.Maybe if they would've kept it more traditional to the cartoon movie would've been so bad.",Cinderella
382,Selenela,Fresh and New,9,15 March 2015,"Everyone knows this story, it's been done to death but this film feels new and fresh. I went to see it based on many people I knew who said it was good. I loved the costumes and the cast. For once Disney has cast perfectly for a iconic character. I wasn't a little kiddie movie it was fun and for all ages. I will own this on Blu Ray once it's out. I don't buy many but this is once I'll keep for my future kids to see. I left the film feeling happy and believing in love and magic. It was cute outside the theater while waiting for the next showing I saw a dozen little girls waiting to see it. They were all dressed up like Cinderella and were so excited, that was also a bonus to see a audience enjoy the film with smiles on their faces.",Cinderella
383,areies,Lame and boring,6,16 March 2015,"This movie was as boring as boring could be. They invested a lot in visuals and did a great job at that but the plot was absolutely plain and offered absolutely no depth. Kate Blanchet's was the only interesting character and still could have used some more space. Cinderella's constant smiling was sickening. This girl had absolutely no personality despite all explanations provided in the movie why she acted the way she did. The prince was charming, indeed. But that's about it. My 7 year old daughter loved it, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Even Maleficent, which is as far from a masterpiece as it could be, was much much better and more enjoyable. I'll stick to older versions of Cinderella.",Cinderella
384,brittneysaid,Great movie,9,1 December 2015,A very good new version of Cinderella. They showed the backstory of Ella which I liked because I believe a lot of these types of movies don't tell enough to really get you into the movie even though it is a classic. Obviously nothing beats the original but this cut it really close and can't wait to sit down and watch it with my family. It is good for both young and old and will keep everyone interested. For once I do not have a complaint about a movie I have watched. For a remake they have done a very good job at keeping the original story line and adding some new features and laughs without taking away from story everyone loves. This is a movie that I would be able to watch over and over again.,Cinderella
385,LongMovieLover,Brits Again Prove To Be Superior Fictional Storytellers,10,17 October 2015,"Simply ignore all the bad reviews. Those individuals were looking for some adult angst revamp of Cinderella and veteran director Kenneth Branagh would have none of it. Branagh has a knack for infusing fictional work with charm and pizazz (see ""Much Ado About Nothing"").Unlike ""Into the Woods"" and ""Maleficent"" which were unfortunate interpretations of adult American disillusion, ""Cinderella"" perfectly captures a sense of hope and that childhood love of ""happily ever after"" that all of us who read the story as children remember. The other movies style ""happily ever after"" as some sort of lie that is fed to us that can never be achieved, whereas this version of Cinderella shows that happily ever after can be exciting again. Branagh caters to the fun-loving, fantasy, and hopeful side of life rather than succumbing to the dark shadows which ruined the other films I mentioned above.Casting was picture perfect. Brits have a better appetite for ethnic diversity than Americans and the movie, particularly the crowd scenes in the marketplace and at the palace would satisfy any person's desire to see a more ethnically balanced depiction of a fictional kingdom. The star-studded main billing couldn't have been better. Each person seemed born to play that role and did so with elegance. Cate Blanchette blew me away. At first, I wasn't even sure it was her! Her makeup, costumes, and carriage made her seem like the elegant, but embittered stepmother she became. Bravo Cate!Cinderella (Rose from Downton Abbey) conveyed the perfect balance of innocence, even as her life becomes more miserable. One IMDb critic said that she was a pushover. However, he missed the point that she was trying to be good to her step-family according to her father's wish, but all of her attempts were like throwing pearls before swine. The point was that both Cinderella and her stepmother had both lost loved ones and suffered hardships. But Cinderella's character did not become embittered, selfish, or grasping.The other actors, Prince Charming and his entourage, are all Brits so I don't know all their names (which might be a good thing). But from what I understand they are all well known actors in the UK and they worked together seamlessly. Stellan Skarsgard (Bootstrap Bill from Pirates of the Caribbean) is not even recognizable as a devious nobleman. Helena Bonham Carter delivers a truly glamorous and stand out performance as the slightly unbalanced Fairy Godmother!The Cinematography truly arrested me. The blues are just so, so blue! Great care was obviously taken to make the eyes of the characters shine and the intricate detailing of their gorgeous wardrobes sparkles and jumps off the screen (without 3D). The lush greens of the natural world simply absorb you. Those glass slippers (sigh) are available on the Swarovski website. Their radiance was truly the way glass slippers were meant to be seen.Some have criticized the story for not having any ""new"" elements. Again the writer and director stayed true to the original tales by Charles Perrault, a Frenchman (Google his works). There are many versions of Cinderella. I still have one called ""Ashputtel"" where the young lady is blessed to have gems come from her mouth when she speaks, while her stepsisters get cursed and have frogs and snakes come out every time they talk! The point is that the story shows the horror of an unloving, abusive step-family whose pointless jealously does them in. That's not a ""new"" story unfortunately- many people continue to live through that.The key CGI scenes are the transformation of Cinderella and the subsequent race against the clock before the magic ends. Both are so spectacular and magical that you just get completely caught up. For you jaded adults out there, we KNOW that magic isn't real in that sense, but the power of this story to make you WISH it were is what the true magic is.But the key emotional scenes are when Cinderalla's stepmother mocks her for trying to eat at the table (instead of in the ashes) and when Cinderella confronts her for her cruelty. If you don't have an instance in your life when you've been deliberately made to feel unwelcome, then you are lucky. I got very choked up. SEE THIS MOVIE. I'm sorry I missed it in theaters but I got the DVD. Also watch the Behind the Scenes. There is a new ""Frozen"" short included as well.Cinderella doesn't make any attempt to modernize the story so that jaded Western audiences can ""relate to it."" Do we see movies to see what's real or what we want to be real? It's about being pulled in to an absolutely stunning fairy tale world where your ideas of what's possible or ""real"" will absolutely collide with the power of imagination. In other words leave your reality behind and embrace your dream instead!",Cinderella
386,agnes_j,Pure magic! This is classic Disney at its best!,10,19 March 2015,"I went into this movie without any expectations, just curious about how they would remake the animated movie with real live characters. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is an instant classic. It's beautiful from start and finish, a masterpiece. It retells the story as it was, without any ""modern"" twists which would have otherwise ruined the movie. The directing is superb and each scene is beautiful and magical. They really pulled it off. The only thing I didn't like was the casting of a black character in this particular historical setting. This is not racist at all and the only reason it bothered me was because it was historically inaccurate and done to ""diversify"" the movie to the audience. This is set in England maybe in 1600 or 1700s and at that time they would not have a black man in the royal court as an aid to the prince. Overall, this movie was great and would watch again in an instant.",Cinderella
387,morieartym,"Pumpkins, Lizards, and Silly Things",4,14 March 2015,"Like it's protagonist, Kenneth Branagh's live-action adaptation of the Disney animated classic Cinderella proves to be little more than a dull, vapid mess covered up by a sparkly blue dress, and no amount of computer-generated mice, slapstick pumpkins, or good old fashioned Bonham Carter charm can save it. Once again, director Branagh shows that the only thing he does better than Shakespeare is soulless CGI spectacle. Everyone is familiar with the Cinderella story, and being that this particular iteration makes no effort to diverge from the tried-true fairy tale anyway, this critic shall not waste any time in summarizing it. To be brief, heroine Ella – Cinderella being a derogatory nickname cooked up by her endlessly irritating stepsisters – is left in the care of her heinous stepmother after both of her parents contract a horrible case of plot device and die. There is a prince, a fairy godmother, a slipper, and a happily ever after. The entirety of the story is narrated incessantly by Helena Bonham Carter's Fairy Godmother character, and while I do not mind listening to the sound of Ms. Carter's lovely voice for two hours, this demonstrates the film's absolute obliviousness to the tenant of ""show, don't tell."" To Branagh's credit, it must not be easy to craft a sensible film while working off of such a droll script – under the pen of Chris Weitz, esteemed writer of such masterpieces as The Golden Compass and The Nutty Professor II – while simultaneously being wrung through the dread corporate machine that is Disney. Still, the composition of this film displays a surprising level of incompetence. People slide down doors in despair, slippers can be shattered by stepmothers but left unscathed by a tumble down the stairs, and the characters seem to feel the need to babble incessantly about their feelings. Our Cinderella is here a blubbering, counter-feministic clod who spends an inordinate amount of time either weeping or pining over her man. Lily James embodies the very image of a breathless, exhaustingly optimistic idiot with her constant empty smiles and flighty gestures. Ella lives her life under her mother's dying tenant to always ""have courage and be kind,"" which evidently translates to ""be a cheerful and willing servant to your abusive step-family."" Thus Ella is enslaved not only by her wicked stepmother, but by her blood mother as well. Ella puts blind loyalty to authority figures over her own happiness and well-being, thus becoming a perfect role-model to young women. Speaking of wicked stepmothers, Cate Blanchett as the evil Lady Tremaine lends a subtlety and nuance to the role that might be compared to that of a bull in a china shop. Of course, how else can the audience tell that the stepmother is bad if she doesn't follow every act of over-the-top, wanton cruelty with a smirk and a malevolent chuckle? The film's saving grace comes, unsurprisingly, in the form of Helena Bonham Carter, whose light and incredibly fun portrayal of Ella's Fairy Godmother makes for a very watchable ten minutes in the middle of the film. Carter fills the screen with her presence and certainly woke this critic out of his near-catatonic state of boredom, even making Weitz's trite, wooden dialogue feel clever. Of course when it comes down to it this is a spectacle movie, and on that end it lives up. The use of CGI animals is obvious and often unnecessary – I'm sure that they still make real deer, Mr. Branagh – and the magic of the movie is unfortunately limited to the Fairy Godmother's standout scenes in the middle, but the effects are nevertheless detailed and fun to watch. The film is an absolute parade of lovely costumes designed by Sandy Powell, especially the endless supply of bizarre yet beautiful outfits worn by Blanchett. Patrick Doyle's score is grandiose and seems to be struggling to carry the emotional weight of the film, as the actors clearly are not making any effort to do so. In all, this is a largely forgettable flick that trudges on through an uninspired and clichéd retelling of a story that has been told far too many times already. Without any fresh offerings or inspiring role-models, even children are sure to be unimpressed by this obviously mechanical piece of cold corporate cash-in.",Cinderella
388,tory-s-anderson,An Honorable Refurbishing for Princess Lovers,7,11 July 2015,"Recently my wife and I benefited from our own stand-in fairy godmother who, infinitely preferable to glass slippers, fitted us with baby-sitting so we could see Disney's newest Cinderella, our first time childless long enough to attend a movie theater in seeming centuries. Amidst swirling dresses, gold-filigree carriages, and those dazzlingly prismatic slippers, I came to the conclusion the film was a worthwhile afternoon, especially with a hot date who can enjoy princess movies.I've heard previous statements to highlight that this princess story, unlike things like Maleficent, is not any dramatic re-spinning; it really is the familiar tale. At one point in the film Cinderella expresses to her fairy godmother (the ever-enjoyable Helena Bonham-Carter, for the first time brandishing a wand with a zaniness that isn't homicidal) that she wishes to continue wearing her mother's beautiful, tattered old dress; Bellatrix... er... Godmother tentatively agrees under the condition that she be allowed to perform some touch-ups. Such is this film: a magnificently re-decorated, re-finished, but not re-written, rendition of Disney's classic, complete with blue dress, helpful animals, and even a bipity bopity boo.The audience is obviously those girls young-and-old who grew up (and are now growing up) on Disney princess films; it is a female-centric film during which the air practically crackled with the excitement of ball gowns, blue-eyed princes, despicable step-family, and, in the case of my companion of choice, gorgeous horses. At this point I suppose men may fall into two categories: those whose artistic appreciation is inspired by the truly marvelous spectacle that this film is, and those who cannot stomach so many colorful dresses, lace, and inter-girl conflicts. As a father I enjoyed the complete cleanness of the film free of the innuendos or significant glances that have sometimes sullied Disney films (I'm looking at you two, Aladdin and Lion King). I also enjoyed the pleasant character that was developed for our courageous and kind Cinderella; the only action scene in the film is the carriage dash home, so ""courage"" didn't take the typical outlet but instead manifested itself subtly as the courage to be kind, something by no means trivial when confronted with bitterness and mistreatment that hunts Ella.There are plenty of strong cases against Disney's princess franchises and the damage they can do to girls independence, expectations, and self-worth, and many I agree with. The majority of Disney's princess movies are not ones I care to have in my home; but this new Cinderella passed the test. Though it chose to go with magic and spectacle over the deeper character-play that graces Drew Barrymore's excellent Ever After, I see this as an artistic choice that will tickle the imaginations of audiences young and young-at-heart.",Cinderella
389,sharmic1997423,Absolutely fantastic movie,10,14 March 2015,"I grew up watching the cartoon version of Cinderella so when Disney released the real-life version, I eagerly went to watch it. It was an absolutely fantastic movie from beginning to end. The short Frozen scene at the beginning was a really nice touch.Actually, I walked into the cinema with average expectations but was stunned by just how good it was. Let's start with the cast. Lily James is absolutely perfect for the role of Cinderella. Her portrayal of innocence and kindness was fantastic. She looked amazing and pulled off the role perfectly. Cate Blanchett was perfect for the role of the evil stepmother. I could actually feel her hatred towards Cinderella throughout the movie. Richard Madden as the prince was also brilliant because his romance with Ella felt real and not forced.Many a time I've seen a movie where the lead relationship looks forced.Finally, the CGI was spot on. It made the movie feel magical and it also gave the movie a nice touch. So in conclusion, I recommend everyone to watch this movie because we all need a little magic in life.",Cinderella
390,angel_of_love21190,A classic reborn in a magical new way-- with a few hitches.,8,19 February 2016,"I agree with many others who say that the classic tale of Cinderella did not need to be remade. Especially not by Disney, whose animated version of the story was a masterpiece by its standards. Young Ella's life was one of happiness until her mother dies. Still, her mother's last words remain with her, and so Ella strives to be kind, even when her father remarries to Lady Tremaine, a widow with two daughters who forces Ella to live the life of a servant, and refuses to recognize her. Ella suffers much mental abuse at the hands of her stepmother, and is often underfed-- this version of Cinderella seems to attempt to make the watcher feel even more pity for its heroine than ever before. I was happy to see that it kept in the portion of how ""Cinderella"" receives her new name; because of the cinders that would get on her skin and hair as she slept by the fire in the upstairs attic. The film is extremely well acted, however; Lily James' Cinderella shines, both literally and figuratively. It also managed to make me pity Sophie McShera and Holliday Granger's versions of the dim-witted ugly stepsisters. Cate Blanchett's version of the wicked stepmother is only a little less unlikeable than in the original tale since the film attempts to give a new spin on her character by having her share details about her past with Ella. But it is also not above making her purely evil; capable of lies, schemes and blackmail. I was not surprised that the film was directed by Kenneth Branaugh, which somewhat makes up for its' many sins in storytelling. There were also times when the film seemed to drag. If you want the classic, this will not satisfy, but it is an okay, somewhat revived take.",Cinderella
391,vicvdwell,Cringeworthy. I would not let my daughter watch this,4,3 April 2015,"I never wrote a review before, but felt like I needed to add something since I don't agree with the high rating (7.6) this film has at the moment. I caught this film on a whim so I did not have very many expectations, except those that come with the knowledge of it being a Disney film that features some great actors (Cate Blanchett, Richard Madden, Helena Bonham Carter). I certainly made the mistake of thinking it would have some entertainment value for adults, which was not really the case IMO. The characters are extremely flat, mostly because the dialogue is full of (cringeworthy) clichés. Characters are either pure good or pure evil, and they'll make sure you know this the second they are introduced onto the screen. If they're smiling, it's always with obnoxiously toothy smiles which look very unnatural. Honestly, there's this Keira Knightley quote I think applies here: ""I'm a total romantic- I love romantic films. But I don't like being raped by sugar."" I'm pretty sure this film was created for the sole purpose of creating a box office hit, and they didn't even try to hide it. It literally adds nothing to the original story everyone already knows, in fact it even fails to tell a complete story. Everybody's parents are fine at one moment and drop dead 5 minutes later, with no explanation whatsoever (besides Cinderella's father, who, we are being told, 'fell ill' during his travels). Little holes in the plot like that show the film doesn't really try to add anything to the story. Most of all what bothers me about this film is its outdated portrayal of women. What baffled me was that the narrator at some point implied that Cinderella was happy just to have spent that one magical night with the prince, and that she would be content to never see him again because her memory of their time together that night would be 'enough to keep her warm for the rest of her life.' Honestly, I don't think that's sending the right message and if I had a daughter I wouldn't like the thought of her watching this film. Being 'courageous and kind' is a noble way to live your life, but do we really want kids to think that if they let other people walk over them and take advantage of them, they will be rewarded for it in the end? That women only have to wait to be saved by a quartet of mice and a handsome prince? I know the premise of Cinderella is that she does the dirty work for her stepmother and -sisters, but the way in which she does all this willingly and convinces herself that it's all for the best (I LOL'ed when it was suggested she take up quarters in the nasty attic and she gets there all like: 'Stepmother was right, it IS nice and quiet up here!') is just disturbing. Even blessed with the eternal grace that is Cate Blanchett this film couldn't redeem itself for me. She does as well as can be expected with such a flat character. Couldn't say the same for Richard Madden, with his unrealistically smooth skin, white smile and constantly wearing the most revealing tights. I don't think he should really have accepted this role, I hope to see him play something more interesting next time. Helena Bonham Carter's short appearance was intended to be funny but I didn't really find it very funny at all. I think this is where it clearly shows it's not made to be watched by adults, but kids only (though Disney has shown before they don't have to be mutually exclusive). All in all, I just felt very conflicted by the message of this film. Apparently Disney has decided enough time has passed for the old fairy tales to be remade again, since I've heard reports of an upcoming Beauty and the Beast remake starring Emma Watson as Belle. I just hope that film will be more woman-friendly and fitting for the 21st century, but after seeing Emma Watson in action at the UN, where she gave a good speech about gender equality, I trust she knows what she's doing.",Cinderella
392,ryanrafuse,Amazing,10,16 March 2015,"Let me first of saying that I love the original animated classic. I went to see the film at a advanced screening at an AVX Theater. One of the best films I have ever seen! Everything about the film was spectacular, to the costumes and the performances. Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter and Lily James portrayed their roles amazingly. I thought they had explored Cinderella's past very well, as well as the princes character very, very well. This movie was amazing to see in an AVX theater, and I was so happy it was not in 3-D. The film is amazing and the only thing that could make it better is if Meryl Streep was in it, but she was to busy with Into the Woods (which was also amazing!) A MUST See!",Cinderella

It focused on the beauty with in, which I loved. Kindness, courage, and the power of forgiveness! Such a great message. Though she had a time of hardship she never let it change her.

The best of the movie: Cate Blanchet, even in this dull character, this wasn't a challenge for her, she acts wonderfully without sweating. The worst: the fake settings, come on Disney! you have a lot of money there are some beautiful settings in France or the UK, make an effort.

The actors did beautiful justice to their roles, the sets were stunning, the costuming delicious, the story line - perfect.For me, Kenneth Brannagh and the wonderful cast and crew have created another magical movie that my daughter and I will share together always. But I have to address all the negative, 1 star reviews - there seems to be a few and this is what has given me cause to write a review....Call me old fashioned in a crazy world, but I love some good old fashioned escapism. I don't need a healthy dose of reality in my movies to feel connected - I enjoy movies for their ability to transport me to a different time and place. And on reading some of the other reviews, I am sad to see how many people wish Cinderella - the character - was more spunky, more sassy, more outspoken, more this, more that.I loved how Cinderella was good and kind. I loved how she WAS strong in her integrity to have courage. I loved how she took every bad turn, in her own way and stayed true to her mothers guidance. Since when is integrity to self weak? I believe having integrity to who you are is just as valuable as showing courage in the face of adversity; staying kind despite ill treatment and having compassion when there is none given. Cinderella, the movie, delivered exactly upon my expectations as based upon the trailers, the shorts, the promos...whatever you like.

402,sailormoonfan-47282,The most anticipated film of 2015,9,15 November 2015,"Cinderella is my favorite fairytale, so I had high hopes for this film when I heard about it back in 2013 and after I saw the trailer I was hyped and the film didn't disappoint.The things that make it stand out to the animated are you know about Cinderella's childhood and her mother because in the original all you know about her childhood is that her parents loved her, after her mother dies her father remarries another woman that has two daughters, but here you see Cinderella and her mother and fathers relationship, you know when they die and you see the stepmother and stepsisters walk in to Cinderella's life and ruin it after her father dies and the house servants are laid off, the prince has a stronger character than in the original and has a better relationship with Cinderella.Most of the performances are pitch perfect, Lily James as Cinderella was likable, sweet and she had that angelic smile, Cate Blanchett as the stepmother was devious and threatening, Richard Madden as the prince was likable and strong willing, Holiday Granger and Sophia Mcshera as the stepsisters were also devious but funny especially when Drizella tried to sing I laughed out loud in the theater the only one that felt forced was Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother I mean she did well for the part she played but she kinda acted like she was on a Tim Burton movie, being crazy and kooky but anyone could've been cast for this film and they had to choose this famous actress even though the parts she's played in other films have been good because I'm sure no one knew about Lily James and she did great as the main protagonist, so they could've chosen anyone unknown and they had to choose someone famous.Even though I loved this film, I had a few problems with it like when Cinderella's mothers pink dress is ripped apart it's just a rip from one of the sleeves, a rip on the top fringe part of the dress and a small rip from the skirt I mean she could've sewn it back in 20 minutes and have her fairy godmother make her stepmother and stepsisters not recognize her at the palace because if you look at the animated Disney Cinderella her dress is completely ripped apart and she's wearing a piece of cloth just tattered around her, another problem I had with it was when she's locked in the attic bedroom she doesn't care what happens to her and starts singing and dancing, even though it was nice to have Lily James sing in an adaptation of Cinderella that wasn't a musical, but again in the original when she's locked in the bedroom she starts banging on the door and tells her mouse friends to quickly get the key before the duke leaves and the final problem I had with this film is the representation of mice I mean they don't make them talk so when Cinderella is talking to these mice that don't talk I didn't know if it was cute or creepy and made it look like her stepmother was going to put her in insane asylum because again in the original film the mice talked and it kinda made sense for Cinderella to talk to the mice.So beside those small problems this has been my favorite film of 2015 and is just as good as the original Disney Cinderella. So I recommend all Cinderella fans to see this adaptation of the Disney animated one.score 9/10",Cinderella
403,sarahpetersaa,Magic'less',4,18 October 2015,"Cinderella is supposed to be a sweet telling of rags to riches, a journey from utter sadness and loss to one of enchantment, fulfilment and eternal love. Sadly this retelling failed to ignite the magical spark that is so associated with Disney. Firstly her dress, what should have been a gown of unimaginable beauty, glitzy and dazzling, sadly her fair godmother visited the sales and picked a frock up from Tesco. For kids I thought the tone of the film was a little too bleak, it was pretty boring and would have done nothing to feed the imagination. Lily James is sweet, but didn't feel right as Cinderella. Thankfully the beautiful original will live forever.",Cinderella

405,townekri,"Beautiful story, beautifully told",8,8 October 2017,"This tale of Cinderella is not only entertaining but a brilliant study in jealously, insecurity, and being true to who you are. Young Cinderella is much loved by her parents and before her mother dies she is given the advice ""Have courage, and be kind"". Cinderella takes these to heart. After her father's sad death she is faced with fear and cruelty on a daily basis from her step-mother and stupid, spoiled daughters. How Cinderella deals with the irony of her situation in comparison to what her parents were like, is part of what makes the story line so entertaining. The movie is beautifully shot, with great care taken with costumes, colors and overall theme to each image. The actors play their roles with style (albeit Cinderella herself is a bit flat) and Kate Blanchet is restrained yet deeply malevolent in her role as the step-mother. Cool beauty with ice in her veins, a true Disney villain! How fun! The restrained approach to the personified animals in Cinderella's world is true to Disney's idea of ""probable improbability"". This is a movie that could be watched many times over and always be entertaining.",Cinderella
406,Lizardman85,"Another dull, uninspired. aggressively boring remake",1,12 June 2020,"I hold the opinion that every post-Maleficent modern live action remake of animated Disney movies is a soulless attempt at squeezing money from who are to one degree or another nostalgic for the original.
That by itself wouldn't be that bad, every remake wants to make money and by its nature preys on people's nostalgic feelings. However were all of these movies differ is that there seems to be no attempt to make an entertaining movie that can stand on its own.
Even making a shot for shot adaptation would be marginally more entertaining than what this movie delivered.For context I saw this movie because it was a friend's birthday. Her favorite princess is Cinderella.I am certain that she does not remember watching this film.What I got out of watching this movie was that it cemented my belief that Disney is making these movies on the cheap knowing that they'll get an immediate return and hope that people keep falling for the hype enough to make a fat profit. I've never met an actual person, including rabid Disney fans I'm friends with that have ever praised any of these live action remakes except maybe the original Maleficent (not very many good things about the sequel) which I consider as the only one to have substantially made any positive change .To sum up, take the plot points from the original. Remove half the cast (no talking mice in this one). Remove the song, remove anything remotely interesting. Add in some pointless backstory for the stepmother that told us, the audience, she's a bad lady and there you go. I can't say these are spoilers because every one of these remakes do the same thing.",Cinderella
407,mmdmeckert,Magical!,9,14 October 2019,"Magical to say the least! Cinderella was truly magnificent. Like the beloved fairytale, Cinderella (Lily James) is a servant girl to her two ugly step sisters (Sophie McShera and Holiday Granger) and her cruel and unspeakably vile step mother (Cate Blanchett). However, when the king (Derek Jacobi) hosts a royal ball in order to find a suitable wife for his son (Richard Madden), who should appear but that servant girl dressed in a dazzling gown and glass slippers that were given to her by her very own fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter)? From the romance to the slightly altered plot, this movie was spectacular! The screenplay, although based off an old fairytale, still managed to be original and entertaining.",Cinderella
408,alexdalby,Truly magical,10,22 May 2020,"I adore this film. It's so beautifully done. The aesthetics of the sets, the costumes are incredible! Especially the costumes worn by kate blanchett, Cinderella's ball gown and wedding gown were just gorgeous. The script is so lovely with lovely morals, especially 'have courage and be kind' which has really stuck with me, 5 years after I first saw the film. I am disappointed that it isn't more highly rated. Those who hoped this film would be similar to the original animation and are disappointed by it need to think of this film as an adaptation, not a remake. And enjoy it for it's alternative features rather than being disappointed by what they think is missing. In this adaptation I loved how we got to know the prince, especially as he had hardly any involvement in the animation. Kit's relationship with his father was so touching, I was in tears after their last conversation. Cinderella's relationship with her mother and father was enriching and emotional as well. Performance wise, Richard madden as always was captivating, charismatic and of course, charming. Lily James was poised, gentle and enchanting as well as stunningly beautiful. Kate blanchett was incredible, she was so convincing as the stern and emotionally scarred step mother. Helena was fabulous as the fair god mother, it is the first time I've seen her play a soft role and she did it well! She was fun, playful and kind. The inclusion of the animal friends was great, not as much screen time as the animation but just enough to keep you happy and increase the magic and spirit of Disney. Over all absolutely delightful film. It really fills me with a sense of wonder and leaves me feeling wonderful.",Cinderella

410,autumnfuller-34427,"Not ""wowed"" entirely...",5,11 September 2020,"This movie...is so far from the original story. Growing up in the 90's, Cinderella has always been a classic tale of ""taking someone as they are despite the glitz and glam of one night"" and this remake portrayed only some of that. The movie fell short of a lot of the original story that I was looking forward to and added a lot of fluff to stir up some commotion. In the original Cinderella, Ella's character seemed mature and honestly unbothered by the mistreatment from her stepmother and stepsisters, her vulnerability overpowered majority of the movie while trying to retain her innocent kindness that really read as weakness the entire film. The stepmothers role took on a more wicked personality showing a blatant disregard for the wishes of not only Cinderella but the King as well. Her easily manipulated sidekick the Grand Duke caved too easily to a threat leading our Captain to swoop in and save the day...cliché.Don't even get me started on the ""fairy godmother"" who spoke as if Cinderella was supposed to know who she was or what she was capable of...her arrogant tone when it came to her magic was frankly irritating, and not humble like that of the original film.Cinderella was prided on its musical additions and this remake showed no accommodation for that. It was a ""cute"" film, just very far off from the original.",Cinderella
411,niepniep-59501,Another life action that falls short,4,27 December 2020,The story of Cinderella is prety straight forward and we all know it. The actors themseles are for the most part competent but the script falls short in every way. cinderella is portaid as someone who literaly doesn't have the ability to stand up for herself in any shape or form. Even if she's given the change at the end of the movie. Wich I realy just can't relate to so I also had a hard time feeling sorry for the character. The final confrentation with her step-mom could have been so much more but it realy fell short. I also don't feel much for the CGI animals but that didn't realy bother me. This movie tries to be a movie for a young and older audiance at the same time. But it ends up hurting itself a lot in the proces while sending some mixed mesages and creating quite a few plotholes.,Cinderella

The character and plot development is well thought out and neatly executed.All the costuming and set design are wonderful. Cate Blanchett is the best casting choice imaginable, and Lily James is delightful as Cinderella.The only negative thing really is that Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother is an uninspired choice at best but she delivers.

416,erminestoat,A Solid Family Film,7,22 June 2015,"A well acted fairy tail. Beautiful scenery, beautiful costumes. The story stays very true to the original - for the most part this is refreshing, though I do think the film could have stood to add a few new elements to the story or expand on existing ones, just to have some surprises for the audience. Emotional depth is added to the stepmother character, which to me enriched the Cinderella story, but I believe they should have gone a step further into the stepmother's back-story. The CG is frankly bad, but I didn't feel it detracted from the over-all presentation of the movie as seem to be intentionally fantastical/cartoonish. Cinderalla is a very well-rounded character that manages to tow the Mary Sue line without ever stepping over it. She remains likable without being too sickeningly sweet or unrealistic. She even has moments where she questions her own creed of always being kind and courageous. A good family film. If you like classic fairy tails, check it out. If you're looking for lots of action and a story you've never seen before, it might not be the movie for you.",Cinderella
417,seanfrer,Surprisingly straight telling of Disney fairy tale classic,9,14 March 2015,"I went in blind to see this movie as my daughter had asked to see it. To be honest, I thought it was going to be insipid and awful. I was not expecting the caliber of the actors or the straightforward retelling - in live-action form - of the Disney Classic cartoon.I appreciated the inclusion of all the animal friends - and what liberties Kenneth Branagh did take were subtle or empowering.The theme - ""Have courage. Be kind"" - could've easily turned into a maudlin farce, but Branagh's steadfast presentation of a fairy tale as a fairy tale, not some moral treatise or critique, maintained the film's purity.Cate Blanchett was fantastic, and any time Derek Jacobi is in a film it is a delight. And Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother! (her character was the only one with a bit of a modern spin; although I appreciate the nice touch of providing the step mother with reasonable excuses - not reasons, mind you - for her cruelty.) The CGI was not intrusive, and the sets and cinematography were luxurious; as were the costumes. I'm a sucker for male characters wearing long coats and boots up to their knees if not beyond. Just ask my daughter. As for the female character costumes, I laughed out loud at the brilliantly atrocious and garish ball dresses of the two step sisters.Don't get me wrong; this isn't an Oscar winner, a cultural revelation, a masterpiece. It was, though, a magnificent retelling of a fairy tale with the nice added touch of an empowering moral undergirding.",Cinderella
418,itsmissmia-1,Very well done!,8,31 October 2021,"From the cast to the acting as well as the costumes, set design, CGI and even the narration, this remake of a classic Disney movie was spot on. Had me crying in the first 6 minutes.",Cinderella
419,owlpost02,The courage of kindess,9,16 March 2015,"""Have Courage and Be Kind""Going into the movie, one would not expect much more than the basic story seen in the animated feature. What Branagh has done is create depth in a story that many have derided as nothing more than an old fashioned and sadly outdated tale. This simple yet elegant theme, ""Have Courage and Be Kind"" is the heart of the movie. As the world clamors for more strong female role models, Cinderella would be the farthest from most minds as someone to share with their daughters. Too many times today, for women to be seen as strong they must be presented as bow-wielding, ass-kicking, leather-clad, tortured souls, yet this shows only one side of true strength. The greatest gift of this Cinderella is the reminder to the world that it takes the utmost courage to be kind, especially in the face of constant adversity. Most films give us sarcastic, mean-spirited people who use their painful experiences as excuses to treat people terribly. Crafted with a deft hand, though, Cinderella lovingly directs us to see that it's easy to be cruel and almost impossible to be kind, unless you have courage. Another wonderful addition to the story is the meeting of Cinderella and the prince before the ball. Their meet-cute takes place in the woods where the prince is struck not just by her beauty but her virtue and character. He falls in love with her, not because she looks radiant in a dress, but because her true self, her inherent nature, reflects generosity and kindness. Cinderella is never afraid to be anything but who she is– she remains true to herself and her belief that everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and grace. Her strength emanates from the inside out admonishing all of us that it is virtue and good character that make people worthy of being looked up to.ConclusionMost people walking into the movie will not expect any surprises, yet Branagh is able to construct something that feels familiar while at the same time fresh, relevant and new. As Disney embarks on this quest to craft live-action versions of its classic films, they've created a firm foundation with Cinderella. Not only should you see it, take others to see it and enjoy the delight of a simple fairy tale made new.",Cinderella

The effects and the animation parts were great, but the story was terrible. The only part that is worth to watch is those few minutes when Helena Bonham Carter shows up.It was boring and sometimes really awkward. I would rather just go and watch the one from 1950 instead.

There was enough humor, wit, feels, and pretty ball gowns to guarantee that everyone should like this movie. Lily James did an amazing job pulling off our favorite humble-spirited princess.

On my way home from the theater I started singing A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes. When I got home I asked my boyfriend to dance with me with no music and he asked why I was acting so whimsically!

424,trapperpk,Excellent representation of prior Story Tellling of Cinderella,8,21 April 2015,"Great casting, all players preformed well. Drawing you away from animated version into the life like format of people. The Prince indeed acted well and is charming. Ella had an appearance of a very pleasant country woman, and she fit her part well. She was not a stunning model reading lines, but she had acting chops equal to Prince charming's clumsy humanity when he was learning the lessons Ella brought to the screen. The theme statement from the script was ""Courage and Kindness"", is stronger than doing it the traditional way as the King would do it. However, Ella won the Kings heart. Her inner beauty radiated beyond her natural pleasant countenance. Kate Blanchette was truly marvelous and an evil step mother who you, or I wouldn't really like at all watching from an audience perspective. Brilliant acting by Kate. I hated her, and then pitied her as the movie reached Cinderella's conclusion predictably, as it remained true to the original screen play with Disney animation. I would see this again and keep it in my video library when it comes out on DVD. A worthy Family movie and enjoyably true to the original screen play story with its solid casting choices, and I observed a great an ""all-in"" acting performance with its members of the cast. Don't miss it if you loved the original Disney animated version from the last century. The Ballroom dancing scene was splendid. The viewer became awash in splendor of Prince Charming and Cinderella who were oblivious of all others while dancing. Brilliant choreography which also brought you to the state of fantasy with a wonder depiction of actual people imitating animation in a high art form. The Costuming should get an Academy Award!

I was really excited to see this film, I love fairy tales and the trailer looked quite promising! Unfortunately I can't say the final product lived up to this, unexpectedly Disney failed to please me. If your looking for a live-action replica of the 1950's animated classic, this will be right up your ally! But if you're like me and were hoping for something more, and rather a contemporary version of the tale, be prepared to be disappointed by a mediocre script and the misuse of a story and cast with great potential. Although, at least you get to see the short film ""Frozen Fever"", which was possibly more enjoyable than the feature film I actually went to watch! First of all, let me highlight that being a Disney production, and based off the success of recent films such as 'Maleficent' and 'Frozen,' I had fairly high expectations! Thankfully this was no where near as painfully terrible as the second half of 'Into The Woods,' but it is fair to say I was definitely let down. In the exact words of my two younger sisters ""that was boring, I like the animated one better,"" proving that I was not the only one upset....",Cinderella

Now, when I heard they were making another Cinderella movie, I was like oh gosh; but who knew I would be wronged. I knew about the Frozen Fever short and thought it will probably be what I'm most excited for then Cinderella! Frozen Fever was boring and Cinderella was amazing! I was blown away by it! You think that because you knew the story already and it being predictable to what will happen later on will bore you out but I was looking forward to what will happen next. It made you forget about what you already knew. The little differences that Kenneth Branagh added to the storyline, yet kept true to the Disney animated film was fantastic! There's been so many twist and darker plots to Disney films nowadays that to see something traditional like this being made really makes me happy. I was wowed by the cinematography. The production designs and costumes just blew me away. Everything was so detailed and perfect. The fact the majority of the sets were built and then you see the parts where you knew CGI was needed, was also well done. I only knew Helena Bonham Carter, Hayley Atwell, and Cate Blanchett going in (they were magnificent). I didn't know Lily James or Richard Madden, but their chemistry was off the charts! If the two people that was suppose to be in love did not have that going, I think I would of really not enjoyed it as much; but thankfully they were oozing with chemistry. They were perfect for the role. My complaint is they did not have enough screen time! I got lost in Prince Kit's eyes too many times. And the music was beautifully written! I had a ear orgasm if possible. I left the theater happy, smiling and feeling like I've been magically transformed back to when I was a child.""Have courage and be kind"" -- what a great message for young kids nowadays and even for adults. All my life, its always been hard to have courage and be kind but its something I strive in being day by day. I hope kids will take this message to heart. I believe this movie is one of the best Disney live-action remake and retelling of a classic story that we all knew as a kid, but maybe a little better. I still like the classic but I can tell you, you will see me watching this one over and over. What a great family movie, not just for kids but for adults too. My inner kid came out and I'm almost 26 now. Don't think too much and just enjoy the movie. Just be a kid again.",Cinderella
427,dapivicente,Just the right kind and amount of modern in a magical classic,9,14 September 2015,"After the live-action remakes of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, came the time to turn Cinderella into bone and flesh. I have to admit that I went to watch this film rather skeptical, not being really a huge fan of the original 1950's animated Disney version. I started watching it thinking it would be too childish or that they would change it up too much, mainly thanks to a not so convincing start of the film - the family being a bit too fake, too many cheesy lines, too much love, the innocent kind, I suppose. But soon as Lily James walked in it really changed.The film acquires a wonderful pace, presenting the classical story with just the right amount of ""modernization"". The characters are incredibly denser and sophisticated than the original ones without the need for big plot or personality changes. Lily James does a wonderful job portraying a kind, beautiful and wise Ella, Cate Blanchett gave me chills (in the best kind of way) and Richard Madden is simply great, making the prince a young man who's growing and learning like everyone else. You could not ask for better chemistry on screen. The story, as so well told by the actor themselves in an interview, is not of a prince who saves a girl but of two people who learn from each other.The cinematography and costume design are as good as it gets, building a period film that is at the same time timeless - you can't place it in a certain era for sure, due to the mix of period elements as well as fantasy. You can even see certain cheeky elements that will bring a smile to your face, like the presence of black people through the film. It is edited in this emotive style, with beautiful wide shots of opulence and romance - don't forget to mention the gorgeous dance scene - and creating nice picture-like frames. When it came to the end I found that I'd been sobbing for the couple and especially for the kind Ella thought the whole time. So, give it a go.

The meeting of the prince and Ella before the ball? Lady Tremain locating the shoe and breaking it prior to the arrival of the kingsmen who were seeking the maiden? Worst of all the barging between Lady Tremain and the royal adviser? WHY? My most disappointing note on the whole film was the music! Where was bibbity bobbity boo during the change of the carriage and the mice and DOG, and the beautiful song 'So this is Love' did not make it into the movie at all, they at least included bibbity bobbity boo into the credits, the dance scene between the prince and Cinderella featured a song that almost sounded like the song from sleeping beauty 'Once Upon a Dream'... I did not hate the movie but I am glad that I did not pay to see this movie in the cinemas ($20 for a ticket) instead I hired it for $3 from Hoyt's kiosk. For an adapted version of Cinderella and a great effort in casting I'm happy to give a score of 7/10 hope you enjoy the film if you choose to watch it!",Cinderella
429,TechnicallyInsane,"[★★★★☆] Stunningly Beautiful, but not Daring Enough",8,25 February 2015,"Disclaimer: Seen at a early free screening offered by AMC Theaters with my brother and 150+ other moviegoers of all ages.  I have to start my review by saying that Cinderella is a visual and aural delight. Man does Kenneth Branagh ever know how to direct a period piece. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, with sweeping shots of the wonderful Buckinghamshire landscape, and the natural film look along with the excellent costumes really make Cinderella a feast for the eyes. The casting is excellent also, with the standouts being Cate Blanchett hamming it up as the villainous stepmother, and the luminous Lily James delightfully portraying Cinderella. Helena Bonham Carter plays the same slightly off character like she always does, this time as the fairy godmother, but of course she does the character justice. The soundtrack by Patrick Doyle is enchanting as well, perfectly setting the mood, and the soundtrack together with the visuals makes Cinderella worth seeing on the big screen.  The only problem I had with Cinderella is that the sum of its parts are mostly visual and auditory.. The acting is great as previously mentioned, but the story is simply and safely told, with no chances taken, and the viewer can tell exactly when and what will happen. I suppose this is good in a way (especially for Cinderella purists), but personally I would have appreciated something more daring. Still, Cinderella is an extremely well done and charming family film, and is a welcome addition to the Disney canon. (B)NOTE: Review mirrored on my letterboxd account (CarltonDeleon)",Cinderella
430,cwtheophilus,Have courage and be kind,8,30 June 2016,"This was one of the best renditions of the classic tale of Cinderella with a powerful moral that comes out very strongly through the movie. Namely, to have courage and be kind even in trying and difficult circumstances is one of the main keys to finding or or rather making happiness in your life. (I think a few of the other malicious reviewers could take a lesson or two from the movie) The movie retells the classic tale of Cinderella while adding more depth to the characters and giving Cinderella (and the prince and stepmother) a proper back story that fits perfectly with the original fairy tale. It makes you really feel for the characters and understand them and their motives better. This movie is not a spin off of the original tale in a different setting or time and doesn't try to add plot twists that were not in the original which I think may have disappointed some who have heard Cinderella retold too many times and were expecting something different to 'spice up' the story or make the ending more unexpected, but that was not this movie's intended purpose and they accomplish their purpose and mandate very well. They are simply trying to retell the original story to a new generation (with excellent visuals and special effects) and add some more depth and meaning to it. And that they do very well and should be applauded for although some who were just looking for something new or some plot twist to change the story may be disappointed. I would definitely recommend this to my family, and think this an excellent movie for any little girl who has dreams and sees the world ""not as it is, but as it could be"" with a little faith. Although there is some sad parts in the movie that parents need to aware of and the stepmother is mean and cruel, but I do not believe that children should be shielded from loss and sorrow because it is a normal part of life and it creates teaching moments that could be very powerful moments in creating the makeup of who they become, and Cinderella responds in the best possible way to all the cruelty inflicted on her, which could teach them powerful life skills.Overall it was an excellent movie with above average morality and powerful lessons for both young and old. It preaches the power of perseverance and long-suffering with trying and difficult people and not allowing circumstances to crush your spirit, but to create your own happiness by staying positive no matter what circumstances you find yourself in or how much grief you have endured, but in all that to keep having courage and keep showing kindness even when the world is unkind to you.",Cinderella
431,ritadiz273,Stepmother for the win!,2,7 July 2015,"I never thought I would sympathize so much with the Evil Stepmother, but this movie managed to do it. Cate Blanchett did a terrific job, and besides you really have to feel sorry for someone dealing with raising three girls by herself, without being able to get any money except through their marriages, with two being utterly silly and her stepdaughter being such a nice pushover that she responds to everything with ""Have courage and be kind"", even when it is out of context. I wanted to slap or shake Cinderella several times, and by the end I was rooting for her stepmother to win, which is not the original aim of the movie. Another detail that bothered me, I liked Luscious Malfoy blond hair with dark eyebrows, but here it really doesn't work.",Cinderella
432,augee90,Beautiful but deep enough?,4,26 April 2015,"I loved the old Cinderella movie and was quite interested in seeing how this one turned out. It's somewhat more realistic in some ways but mostly follow the old storyline anyways. There is magic too, so no worry.. The last part of the story differs a bit though and feels more ""Disney"" than the last one. The feeling of a great Disney movie is there - but I would have preferred a more dramatic twist in the story.I feel like this was more of a children's story than the old movie,a bit too smooth for my style. I liked that the old movie was suitable for all ages - this one was interesting enough for adults, but not quite ""deep"" enough to make for a interesting story in my taste.",Cinderella

And I was impressed with the main character development. But overall, I feel that this film is a one time watch. The performances from Lilly James was excellent to say the least, and the other actors have done justice to their roles. The music had that grand feeling, that gave me goosebumps. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I might buy the film when it's released on Blu Ray. Overall, I give this film a 8 out of 10, which is far superior from it's original and I hope that for Beauty And The Beast, the bar that was set by the original would be surpassed.",Cinderella
435,mark19518-116-333484,An Immediate Classic For the Ages,10,26 March 2015,"This Cinderella movie is a triumph, thrilling children and the young at heart of all ages, boy or girl. The movie is faithful to its famed predecessor version by Walt Disney, but it much better brought to life and impact in this acted version. The movie should certainly be an Academy Award hog, graced by several acting standouts, spell-binding special effects, beautiful cinematography, spectacular sets, an inspired sound track and superb production values. I took my daughter's family, including two girls and one boy. They were transfixed throughout the movie,captivated and moved to tears and then joy. The movie posits a strong moral basis without any lecturing or condescending, it just demonstrates its truth through the re-telling of the classic story.Trying to nitpick this film would be foolish, it will be one of the most beloved and replayed movies of the current era for many, many years.",Cinderella
436,akisame97,Dim Film,2,26 December 2015,"It was difficult to enjoy Disney's live-adaptation of ""Cinderella"" when she - Lily James' Ella - was such an insufferably stupid and weak person, who allowed herself to be stepped on by her step-family all because her mother told her to be ""courageous and kind"" at all times.Well, if that means smiling like a dumb idiot whilst your step- mother takes pleasure in treating you like garbage, then such a teaching is morally reprehensible. There is a massive difference between being ""kind"" and being a ""doormat"", and Ella falls safely into the latter category. Whilst, in the 1998 film ""Ever After"", Drew Barrymore's Danielle is in the exact same situation as Ella because it is the same freaking, but she deals with her circumstances in a very different manner. Instead of just accepting her lot and dreaming that one day a man will come and rescue her, Danielle covertly rebels against her step- mother's tyranny to actively DO good.The message of the film to be ""courageous and kind"" was sickening because Ella was neither brave OR kind. She was simply a complacent dummy who did everything she was told to - even though she didn't have to because she was a grown woman when her father had passed (and I'm pretty sure her legal standing hadn't been reduced to that of a servant, like Danielle's was in ""Ever After""). Also, asides from talking to unresponsive animals and (stupidly) giving them whatever food she had, Ella never actually ever did anything ""kind"".Also, despite ""Cinderella"" having been released in 2015, it sticks to the age-old idea that ugly women must be evil and continues to pit women against each other based on their looks. ""Cinderella"" could have explored patriarchal confinements, of the time, that forced women to fight against each other in order to gain a wealthy and/or titled husband in order to better their standard of living. But, nope, ""Cinderella"" instead chooses to stick with a superficial conflict: the step-sisters hate Ella just because she's better looking than them. Its stupid and does nothing for female development and teaches impressionable children a completely flawed and outdated ""lesson"".Furthermore, the performances from the heroine and the hero were pretty weak. Lily James tried desperately to convey a sort of wide- eyed innocence that can only come with being a child, but she instead came across as a breathy airhead with intelligence issues. Maybe her step-sisters were right: Cinderella is a half-wit. Richard Madden, on the other hand, was decent in his scenes with the King but otherwise he was awkward and stifled - totally unromantic. The leads had barely any chemistry and any attempt at trying to ignite something romantic felt erotic and inappropriate instead (scene in the ballroom with all the bizarre panting).Cate Blanchett served the stand-out performance, but she's Queen Blanchett and rarely ever puts a foot wrong. I also thought that the costumes in the film were really beautiful, and I loved Cinderella's wedding dress (gorgeous!). The special effects were pretty good, but the CGI on Helena Bonham Carter was laughably bad. Those were really the only things I liked about the film, which justifies my score of 2 instead of 1. However, I do have two more complaints: firstly, the narration. Hearing Helena Bonham Carter's cheese-grater like voice that comes through her clenched teeth really, really bothered me. It was incessant and irrelevant. I don't know why constant narration has become the new-trend in film making. It completely defies the purpose of SHOW and not TELL - narration should be used as a framing device, not as a device to tell the whole freaking story when film is a VISUAL ART. From the very beginning, the narration put a damper on my enjoyment factor. Secondly, at the end of the film when Prince Kit asks Ella her name, instead of replying with her REAL name she responds and says that she's ""Cinderella"" which really upset me. She was basically allowing her step-family to claim ownership over her by using the name they gave her instead of the name given to her by her parents.If you want to watch a fresh reinterpretation of the classic story of Cinderella, you should just watch ""Ever After"" instead. Yeah, it might look a bit dated in comparison but it benefits from superior dialogue, storytelling and characterisation.",Cinderella
437,natka1985,Pretty average and quite annoying,3,9 August 2015,"I was expecting more from this movie. The acting is average, and the director could have chosen a prettier Cinderella, she looks like an average girl next door in this movie, but then her waist becomes unrealistically thin as she goes to the ball. What standards are they setting with this movie for young girls? Her stepsisters, on the other hand, are looking too ugly that it is almost funny. Another thing which annoyed me about this movie is that the evil stepmother had a cat, although there were no cats in the actual Cinderella fairy tale! Apparently the director doesn't like cats and represents them as evil creatures in this movie. I got terribly annoyed that such as impression is being created about these beautiful, lovely animals. Such movies might be the cause for cruelty towards cats too. Overall, I didn't like the movie. It was an attempt to create a beautiful story out of a beautiful fairy tale, which failed because of mediocre acting and numerous stupid annoying details. Shame on the director!",Cinderella

I never knew they were such cheats. Guys do check out Orlando corradi's anime version of Cinderella... And you'll know all. They've got whole storyline running from there. It's just that it's not an animation this time. Orlando Corradi's version is really old one. They needed people's attention and praises so cheated whole thing from someone else. How cheap, isn't it?Corradi is no more I guess... But still I think his works are worth an applause. Maybe it's just because am a big fan of animes but this is too much.

The acting was good! the editing was phenomenal, the special effects were amazing, the ART was so beautiful, the costume design, EVERYTHING! anyone can watch this movie and won't get bored.

The whole atmosphere of Cinderella made me have a warm, and fuzzy feeling inside, and I couldn't help but tear up during the dancing scene between the Prince and Ella, because the romance wasn't overdone at all!

441,jerrod-a-sneller,Drew Barrymore version was better,3,14 March 2015,"We were expecting a new perspective like Maleficent!Huge disappointment! We should have realized from the trailers, but that's what we get for assuming Disney was starting a reboot trend. I can't believe my wife leaned over half way through the movie and said ""I'm ready to go when you are."" We were not expecting gore and dismay, but we were hoping for a fresh perspective, other than adding more footage of the animals.If your kids (or you) have never seen a Cinderella movie, then it's great! If you're tired of movies being remade every few years, then this is not for you. The actors did an amazing job with this rendition, however I'm tired of seeing the same movie over and over with new actors. I'd imagine that it's like being a Drama teacher in High school.First time seeing Cinderella = 8 (Oh, nice job.) Cinderella again?! = 3 (What was Disney thinking?)So yes the fact that a company needs a revenue income provided by a script that they dusted off from the shelf will flock people to the box office, caught us hook line and sinker.",Cinderella

I seriously love everything: the actors, the scenes, the outfits, basically... EVERYTHING!! When I was small, I did not really like the animated version of Cinderella. However, the 2015 Cinderella Movie made me literally sit down and dream about true love all day!! The storyline was so romantic. The movie, however, was shorter than I expected. I thought that 105 minutes were ""more than enough"" (just like what Cinderella first thought :), but it turned out that I needed more! If there is only one sentence to describe my feelings at the moment, it will definitely be this one: I'M 200% ADDICTED TO THIS MOVIE! AND MAGIC! AND CHARMING PRINCE! AND Cinderella!

444,wazimp,"Disney's recreation is beautiful, charming and magical.",8,15 March 2015,"There is only one word that can be used to describe Disney's live action adaptation of arguably one of their most treasured and popular princesses to date, and that word is magical. I'm not going to lie. I was not all that excited for this movie. In fact, I was much more anticipating paying for the ticket just so I could check out the new Frozen short that brought back a sense of nostalgia to the older days of Disney and Pixar where they would show a short mini-feature film before the main feature. It was a cute add-on to Frozen that should not be missed, and had the audience in the theatre tapping their feet along to the feature song. I will say one thing I adored was the parallel between the source film and the clever uses of them in the mini-feature, clever and well executed. I'm afraid this outing was my first experience with the Cinderella franchise. I was born in the mid-nineties, and during that time, Disney was pumping out such classics as The Lion King (1994), Tarzan (1999) and Hercules (1997). These movies (and the stigma of a young boy watching princess movies) overshadowed the princess movies in my young male eyes, and it has only been recently that I reached out to actually watch them. That being said, I went into this movie fairly blind. I knew the gist of the story. In a hundred words or less, a young woman is trapped and abused by her stepmother and sisters. Meanwhile, the kingdom is holding a royal ball in which young woman wises to attend. Stepmother forbids young woman to attend. Fairy Godmother appears, and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo's the young woman into a looker. Young woman attends ball where the Prince spots her. The clock strikes midnight and she transforms back into her old state, leaving a slipper behind. Prince seeks woman with slipper. Slipper fits. Roll credits. What I was not expecting was an emotional and otherwise heartfelt opening half. Without revealing too much (though I feel as though I may be the only person in the world who had never heard this story), young Ella's life is golden until her mother passes away, followed by her father marrying her to-be stepmother, brilliantly portrayed by Kate Blanchett. This then sets forward the plot synopsis offered above, but with the tradition Disney charm I expected. This movie was gorgeous; I'd even go as far to say stunning. The landscapes were beautiful, although obvious use of CGI often surfaced. In this case however, I believe it worked. I did not go to Cinderella expecting to see reality, I went expecting to be awestruck with magic and sparkles, and I was. The costuming is fantastic, not over-the-top, and yet flashy enough to be noticed. The direction is outstanding, however I knew I would not be disappointed going into a film directed by Kenneth Branagh. The true masterpiece found in this film however is the casting.Kate Blanchett stole every scene that she was present in while portraying Ella's stepmother. Disney is doing a fabulous job of casting their baddies as of late, as Jolie's Maleficent comes to mind. Blanchett played a composed and psychological evil, giving this film a much darker tone than expected. Richard Madden's portrayal of Prince Kit was also well received, leaving the audience's eyes pierced with that charming smile and meek playfulness. The CGI mice were also up their on my list, as every time they were on screen, I had to put down the popcorn to smile. Finally, Helena Boham Carter plays a ditsy, charming rendition of the Fairy Godmother. Though her role was short, I was still expecting to see Johnny Depp burst out from behind a bush. This of course leads up to the newcomer taking the title role, Lily James as Cinderella. I had heard of James before he attachment to this film, but only because she is currently seeing retired timelord Doctor Who's Matt Smith. James brought Ella to life with her gentle views on living life, her dedication to her deceased parents, and her ability to make every one of her lines and movements sound exactly how you would think a Disney princess would sound. Not only was she able to play the part, but also she was also able to have the look. She enticed me with ever scene and was able to give even a Cinderella newbie a clear view of how the character looks and acts. When she cries, so do you. When she smiles, so do you. James took the character and gave her many dimensions, something I was worried may not happen. No doubt, this budding actress will be seen again, and I hope for many years and films to come. In all, this was a pleasant outing to the movies. Appropriate for all ages (and all genders), Cinderella sparks that magical charm that Disney has always offered, and does it rather masterfully. With emotion, comedy and clever callbacks to older Disney classics, this is not a film you will want to skip. The visual will have you wide- eyed for the entire feature, and the actors will keep you well versed and entertained for the surprising 112-minute runtime. Scratch off another win for Disney, and scratch off another brilliant classic brought back to life for new, and future generations to enjoy.",Cinderella
445,jonemmett2121,good movie with bad changes,4,15 March 2015,"Cons: I hated how the actor for Cinderella looked. Her eyebrows bothered me throughout the whole movie.She wasn't a true blond, had a fat jaw, small eyes, larger nose, and bluntly just not gorgeous. Cinderella was supposed to be pretty with all small facial features, except for big blue eyes. Her eyes were not even blue.There's plenty of beautiful blonde actors like Amanda Seyfried, Amber Laura Heard,Anna Sophia Robb,Chloë Grace Moretz,indiana Rose Evans.And her not having her hair in a bun, with earing, and gloves, really just helped destroy the whole Cinderella look. The step sisters were supposed to be overweight and ugly but both were skinny and one pretty. The child Cinderella had buck teeth and a big nose and forehead too and wasn't too pretty either. There's The step mom didn't seem so evil more hurt and greedy but not consistent with either. The movie wasn't too exciting or dramatized....PROS: the change in how she got her name was great, her being couragous and kind was good. The men that actually looked like a goose and lizards was great, the carriage ,blue dress, and glass slipper was magical. The price was perfect.the real mom was perfect and beautiful. The acting from most actors was good.the moral of the story was better..... and last but not least Disney MAKE A MOVIE WITH A HISPANIC GIRL.

If, however, you want the classic story retold in a beautiful, simple way, this will easily satisfy you. We all know the story, right? Why mess with it? There are a few small additions, mainly at the beginning to set the story we know and love, but the majority of it is a reproduction of everything we cherish. In my opinion, that's a good thing. My whole family thought Maleficent was magnificent in the way it turned a story we knew on its side. Cinderella, on the other hand, we all loved because it embraced the classic plot without twisting it into something it is not. Visually the movie was incredible. Both my girls, my wife and daughter, thought everything looked exactly as they dreamed it should. That is an enormous compliment. Probably their biggest complaint was that the trailers showed too many of the visual elements; they wanted to be surprised with the unveiling of Cinderella's dresses and the like. Other than that, there was hardly any complaints. Go ahead and see the Cinderella you know. It's wonderful.",Cinderella

Not because of the acting, which was quite good. You CAN'T pick up an actress that is more beautiful, elegant and charming than the protagonist of the movie in this case. I mean, Cate Blanchett is a stunning woman even in tatters, and the actress picked for the role of Cinderella can't reach her toe (Not even after the transformation given by the stepmother). Disney should have chosen another actress for the role of stepmother, because Cate Blanchett shadows Lily James for miles. This is the same case as Snowhite (With Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart). Although that movie is trash XD.",Cinderella
450,cosmicparadoxmc,Great movie with a few flaws.,9,4 April 2015,"What is with all the hate? I've seen so many one- and two-star reviews with almost no actual reasoning. It seems that everyone just was like ""This is a Disney movie, therefore it must be terrible."" And they never remember that they went into a Disney movie that gave no promise of being realistic in any way or being innovative in any way. Those seem to be why everyone thinks this movie is terrible, yet it was never advertised as having any of those qualities. It was advertised as being a live action version of the 1950 Cinderella.You walked into the theater expecting to see a Disney movie aimed at kids, just there to retell a timeless tale and make profit (that is how a business works). So why are you hating it for being exactly what you expected to see?Well, the rant is over and now for the actual review. This movie was amazing. It retold a simple story perfectly. The cinematography was amazing, and most of the cast seemed fit for their role and into the performance. Of course it isn't perfect and it has too much CGI, but it is good for making a 2-hour movie out of what can be told in a 5- page picture book.People need to praise it for what it is, a Disney movie, not for what it isn't.",Cinderella

Watched it during a family get-together, with children and grandparents, and everybody loved it. Sure, not much of the original storyline has been altered, but why should that be a bad thing? I especially enjoyed the beautiful scenery and interior design of the houses, the beautiful costumes and of course the magic of the fairy godmother. The story was told in a very sensitive way, even mad me reach for my handkerchief every now and then ;-) It is a nice alternative to some of the empty, noisy movies our children watch nowadays.

The set and actual picture of it was magnificent, but sadly lost in the mediocre acting and sappy sad story.I'd so much rather watch the original Disney cartoon. If you're looking for a Maleficent style re-do of the classic story then watch Ever After with Drew Barrymore.Honestly, there were parts of this movie that made me cringe to think my daughters were watching. Was Disney trying to redeem the story with the be brave and kind line? At one point, Cinderella states that spending one night with the prince would make memories to keep her warm for the rest of her life. Really? And they couldn't find a dress that would hold her breasts? I kept thinking maybe the target audience was actually 13 year old boys!! I was so bored I wanted to get up and leave.Even my girls, who watched intently, left disappointed and said afterward that it was ""okay."" Now that's an honest review of this movie!

Why bother making a movie that is less interesting than reading the story or watching the original cartoon? According to the announcement in movie, the prince invited all the girls in the country, they show more men in the ballroom than girls, unfortunately, the ballroom is small and looks like there are about 40 Women in the room. I say ""Women"" because they don't look like young girls. Too much makeup on the fairy good mother's face. Lacking details that made the audience feel ""WOW"".

I had heard such bad reviews about this movie, I already was planning for an hour and a half nap. But on the other hand, it was a Disney princess movie so. I got my ticket and grabbed some candy. Me and my friends settled in the highest seats right in the middle. I was happily greeted with the Frozen Fever mini movie. It was not- surprisingly amazing. When Cinderella came on, I was enraptured. I could hear whispers or laughs in the background, but my focus was entirely on the movie. I was kept in the emotions of Cinderella throughout the movie. I felt the happiness of the complete family in the beginning, which made me smile. I felt the grief when her parent's passed away, which made me cry. I felt the joy when Cinderella and Kit married, and I was crying-again-out of joy. I felt like it was me getting engaged. The movie was a great experience and I will definitely be going back again to watch it. I recommend it to all ages. The overall moral of the movie was great and I think that Cinderella's promise to her mother on being brave and kind is a great motto to live by. ""have courage and be kind"". I recommend this movie to all ages, to everyone. The typical Cinderella cartoon movie was great but I was completely blown away by this movie and all the great morals. My only suggestion is to not sit next to friends who will talk during the movie while the Kit is putting the glass slipper on Cinderella's foot or flashing the flashlight app in your face to see if you are crying. GREAT GREAT GREAT movie. Total 5 stars out of 5. I am 100% satisfied.",Cinderella

However, she stills being brave as her mother told her to be. Luckily she meets a man and her life changes forever.From my point of view, the costumes were perfectly made, specially the one that Ella uses at the ball. Its a family film that never gets you bored. Disney timeless story comes to life.The film perfectly appeals to Disney and princess lovers. I reckon its perfect to watch with family and friends.",Cinderella
458,neonmisty,Fun way to pass time - if you don't have unrealistic expectations,6,10 June 2015,"Cinderella (2015) is basically a faithful live-action adaptation of the original Disney animation. There are some extra embellishments, such as scenes with Cinderella's mother and father, the Prince's conflict with his father, and a very unique fairy-godmother acted by Helena Bonham Carter. This movie got awful ratings from so many users because they expected a true masterpiece. If you just happened to stumble upon this movie without any expectations, like I did, it was pleasant to watch. It was cute and simple, probably geared towards preteens who like that classic ""boy meets girl"" story.From an adult's standpoint, it felt a little too simple at times. To be fair, all the emotions felt like they could have been taken a step further. Cinderella's grief and her chemistry with the dashing prince were a little shallow. The evil stepmother and step sisters, while very comical, sort of diminished their ""evil"" appeal with the humor. They weren't as sinister as they could have been, although Cate Blanchett did a very entertaining job. The movie incorporated all the drama in the story, but the drama wasn't heart-wrenching, excluding the initial segment about Cinderella's mother.Overall, I wouldn't rate this movie too high or low. It was beautiful and fun to watch, despite its shortcomings, which aren't so bad if you're not expecting an Oscar-winning production. 6/10",Cinderella
459,echo-98872,I like it,7,28 June 2015,"Cinderella's dress is really beautiful, the prince is handsome too! it is a traditional fairy tail movie, and that is how i like it to be The pumpkin car was well designed too just the prince and the captain are cast from Game of Throne, sometimes it is really easy for me to think of Game of Throne when I am watching it. By the way, how obvious the Prince's crotch is! Whenever he shows up with the tight white pants, I can not help but noticed his crotch! I also like the way that Cinderella's high heel drops on the staircase ,which is exactly the way how the original fairy tail did! And I like the Godmother in the movie too, the glass heels she created are really significant! One thing that I do not understand is : why over the whole country , there is even not one girl who is in the same size for shoes with Cinderella? It does not make a lot of sense, does it? Another thing, when the time hit 12 o'clock, in the midnight, everything turns back, the horses turns back to rats, the footman turns back to lizard, the carriage turns back to pumpkin, and why in hell the glass high heels stay the same? That I consider as a bug! And, it would not be very hygiene for every and each one of the girls in the kingdom to try it on without cleaning it, would it?",Cinderella
460,shaw_kayleigh,magical & mystical,10,16 August 2015,"Such a great creation of bringing a annotated classic to life. Allows girls to feel romance, feelings and most of all dream. I'm a young girl at heart and this film really cheered me up on a sad day. It has enough content to warm the soul and she'd a tear or two, even at my ripe age of 29!Well done to the director! The detail in the graphics brought the old classic to life. The film fitted so snug without stealing childhood memories. A total must see for any devoted Disney fan.Some reviews suggest remaking the classics is dull, I argue that view as I love nothing more than seeing our digitally enhanced techniques we now have at this ray of age can really put a 'spell' on old favorites.",Cinderella
461,doaaqadri,"disappointing,cheesy, and a very bad choice of lead actress",2,31 August 2015,"i don't know where to start..this movie for me was so bad that it gave me motivation to make an account here on IMDb so i can review it 1)Cinderella is played very poorly by the actress who did not seem convincing at all, making the character of Cinderella APPEAR RATHER NAIVE rather than courageous comparing to one of my most favorite telling of the story Cinderella ""ever after"" played by the talented drew Barrymore where she represent a smart and ambitious Cinderella. 2)the scenario was boring..i expected that if no changes are made in the the telling of the story that there would be more comedy put into that..but no changes done..no comedy added..just another boring scenario 3)so much wasted talents of the great actors surrounding the main character like Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter & Richard Madden as for the kids ,yes they'll probably enjoy it but for me i rather have my future kids watching ""ever after"" a story of a brave strong and smart Cinderella rather than Cinderella who's just waiting with a smile on her face to be saved by someone",Cinderella
462,toby20_uk-1,Absolutely sweet and wonderful!,10,3 September 2015,"This is a fantastic family film for all ages.Lily James is a fabulous Cinderella portraying grace and dignity as well as kindness and courage in abundance. Cate Blanchett exudes glacial envy and cruelty as the wicked stepmother Lady Tremaine. Richard Madden was a revelation for me here (being one of the few who hasn't yet tuned into Game of Thrones), he is a strong, thoughtful Prince and his chemistry with Lily James and Derek Jacobi is wonderful. Nonzo Anosie is a wonderful addition as the Captain and Stellan Skarsgaard twirls his moustache brilliantly as the scheming Grand Duke.Helena Bonham-Carter makes the most of her almost-cameo appearance as the Fairy Godmother - a wonderfully weird character who seems surprised by her own successes. While Ben Chaplin and Hayley Atwell cut a sweet figure together as Cinderella's parents.Kenneth Branagh is a fantastic actor and director, this film is an absolute, definite feather in his cap.This film is a must for anyone who loves Disney or just loves a great film.",Cinderella
463,raquelduartealves,"Worst than the original, seems that was made in 1920",1,17 May 2018,"Yes, at least on the original disney movie cinderella, she was smart, adult, strong and she did fight for her happy ending! She called her friends, she ran with the other shoe, and proved who she was. The prince didnt come to save her, she did it herself with her friends.This movie is just stupid, omg, it's so stupid i can not describe this without laughing.... In this movie.... Cinderella WAITS to be saved while she sings... like an autist kid. It's just weird and pointless.When we do a remake of something, we expect do make some updates, like the values. wake up... the original cinderella was made in 1950!!!!!! Shameful, a 1950 cinderella has more useful and modern values for girls than a 2015 cinderella.",Cinderella
464,tuyutao,A Great Retelling Fairy Tale! It is suitable for children! Cate Blanchett is awesome!!,7,14 November 2015,"After watching this movie, personally speaking, it was a good retelling fairy tale. I think audience must have read this story during their childhood. People have their own Cinderella's image in their own mind. In this movie, it did not make a huge change of the original fairy tale. I think the Disney Company is a great team, which is good at directing the fairy tale. In this time, they used the most traditional way to help audience build their Cinderella. Because the film is a well made, it created the glass slipper, the pumpkin coach, the true love and happy ending, which satisfied with people's dreams of the Cinderella during their childhood. PRO: the movie is a well made in every aspect, which bring us back to the European classical beauty. The cloths, prop, and magic in the movie engage both the mind and the eye of audience. For the plot of movie, it deleted the plot of two stepsisters how to cut the toe off and cut off part of heal in order to wear the glass slipper, which is too bloody to children. I think this change is great because it not only protect the children, but also makes the hold movie more beautiful. Moreover, this movie weakened the value of vanity. In the story of the Cinderella, Cinderella meets the prince at the party. The prince was attracted by the Cinderella's dress and beauty. And the Cinderella lives happy forever because she married with the prince and she is beautiful. However, in the movie, Cinderella first meets with the prince in the forest. The prince was attracted by the Cinderella's kind. And the Cinderella also did not know the identity of the prince. Then, they fall in love. I think this plot is valuable because the original story makes audience feel that the prince loves the Cinderella because of her beauty and beautiful dress; and the Cinderella loves the prince because of his identity. CON: although it is hard for me to say some disadvantages of the movie, I also feel it is missing something. During the watching, my friends and I both felt a little boring. I think the reason people feel boring is that the story is famous. Everyone knows the plot of the story. Moreover, we were not children anymore. We will require more plots to attract our interests. Therefore, we will feel boring of the movie. Furthermore, I love the performance of the Cate Blanchett. She was the stepmother in the movie. She shows the vicious and evil of the stepmother, which makes me feel excellent. Because of her great performance, she controlled the whole movie and stole the show of the Cinderella.",Cinderella
465,voleakhim,Cinderella,2,18 November 2015,"Cinderella is a story talking about a young girl that come from a wealthy family and she had forces to be the servant in the estate by stepmother and stepsisters. One day, Ella's mother and father had passed away because two of them have some illness, also Ella had promised with her mother that she'll always have courage and be kindness to others. After that, Ella had meet Kit (the only one son of land's dying king) in the Hunting party. After dancing, Ella and Kit tour the palace and grounds together, then the clock strikes 11:59, forcing her to flee, and dropping one of her glass slippers instead. A days later, Kit Grand duke and captain of the guards had announced to all the maiden in the kingdom to try the glass shoe, but no one fits and they turn to leave. And then, they goes to Tremaine estate, the stepsisters has tries the glass shoe but the shoe didn't fits them even once. Kit hears Ella singing and he had found that the shoe was Ella's property. Ella and Kit are married and lives with a happy life. Many people says this story was pretty awesome and i started to watch it too and i realized that this story is very very perfect. This story is very interesting, about Ella dropping the glass slippers and the ending of the story. This story is very well-known and popular until nowadays. I seriously hate the stepmother and stepsisters so much because they like to forces Ella to do the work, locks her in the room and getting jealous on Ella. Anyways, this is the best story ever that i have seen.",Cinderella
466,silverlina-97671,Not so sure if the movie is good or bad,6,18 November 2015,"Since Cinderella is a famous story, everyone knows the plot of it so people know what to expect, except... they don't because it was a bit different in the movie.The first time I watched the movie, I thought it was really good because I was really excited to watch one of my favorite Disney's princess movie be remade into a movie with real live characters. Since I thought the movie was pretty good, I decided to watch it again. While watching it the second time I realized that the movie wasn't even that good. I noticed that the acting was quite cheesy and fake(?). I also felt like Ella (Cinderella) was only kind to everyone because her mother told her to. The ""we must have courage and be kind"" is said too many times and i find it annoying.Although, there were also some really good parts which were when she met the prince, when the fairy-god mother changed her old, ripped dress into a beautiful and magical looking dress, and when she arrived to the ball and everyone looked at her. But I would still say it was quite cheesy. That's the main thing I don't like about the movie. It doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it tho.",Cinderella

I thought that this film would have exactly the same storyline as the Disney original classic Cinderella and there would be nothing special, but no it was still beautiful and the cast are all amazing as the original. This film Is beautifully done with an amazing script, acting skills and with a delightful colors that keeps the audience entertain and fun. I actually really enjoy watching fairly tale they are fascinating and amusing and Cinderella is one of them. I've been growing up watching this story since I was a little girl and to see a remake of this make me excited and curious at the same time. I'm highly recommending you to watch this beautiful film.",Cinderella

Also show you about the kindness and courage that have told in the movie by Ella's mother that was a great secret that she wanted to tell Ella before she died. Ella always remember this secret to be kind and courage with her step mother and her step sisters. This made Ella became a very powerful and beautiful lady. I really like Ella in the movie. And also the Prince that tried his best to find Ella. At first, the movie was full of sadness but after all the problem had solve and the movie become more interest because it wanted to teach us to stay kind and courage and you will win everything.",Cinderella
469,kimmiller-91720,Not a Happily Ever After for Everyone,8,10 December 2015,"It's amazing to me that a story can be retold time and time again and still capture the attention of viewers worldwide. The combination of the bold costumes, beautiful cinematography, and memorable cast with the traditional story of Cinderella told with some plot twists makes this one of the most enchanting and endearing films of the year. However, the movie also gives the opportunity for parents to have some deeper conversations with their children. This movie seems to fit with the growing trend in Disney to add more depth to their villains. Cinderella's stepmother (Cate Blanchet) is no doubt still evil, but she actually evokes pity in viewers. In a scene towards the end of the film in which Cinderella (Lily James) and her stepmother are in the attic, the stepmother explains to Cinderella that she married her first husband for love only to watch him die, and with him, her ""light of life."" She then marries Cinderella's father for the sake of her daughters, only to watch him die, too. Even while he was living, though, she knew that he still loved his first wife and daughter more than he could ever love her or her daughters. Her hardships and trials have taught her that ""nothing is ever given, you must pay,"" and even ""love is not free."" Her treatment of Cinderella is by no means justifiable, but it is perhaps understandable. People rarely commit evil acts for no reason. Everyone has a story to be told, and Cinderella teaches us that evil is not to be dismissed or tolerated, but met with compassion, kindness, and strength.",Cinderella
470,mwestra,Depends on your personality as to whether you will enjoy or not,9,3 January 2018,"It has many similarities to the original DISNEY version, with some variable changes that I felt enhanced the film. I am not surprised at the poor reviews, as these days there are too many platforms for opinions to please everybody. I LOVED this movie and found myself buying it a week after watching it on cable. I loved the CGI, the cast, and felt it enhanced the magic of the 1950s Disney film version. I enjoyed Ever After (Cinderella film), but it did not feel as magical as this version. Cinderella was a favorite movie of mine, but not my favorite. This is my favorite live adaptation of a cartoon (and yes, I quite enjoyed Malificent - Sleeping Beauty remake). I loved it and it's possible you will too. If you are hoping for a new plot twist, or it being based on ideals that resemble (or should) reality, then maybe this isn't for you. If you are picky about things, like Cinderella having a small waist or other superficial things, maybe you should stick to a different type film. Nobody I knew who has seen it was bored once during this film, but I can see why it could be for people with different interests or ideals. If you really can't spare a couple hours to check out the film for yourself, but you have an hour or two to spend reading reviews, then perhaps you really aren't interested in seeing it after all. Nobody can tell you whether it it is good, but you....or maybe someone exactly like you. Hope you enjoy the film too if you do watch it! I loved it!",Cinderella

Don't waste your time on that and do yourself a favor and watch this.9/10 I loved it.,Cinderella
472,JordanCarrington,A beautiful retelling of a timeless story for the new generation!,10,26 February 2015,"Overview: The story of Cinderella can be traced back to early Egypt, China, France, Germany and many other countries from around the world. The most well-known versions were written by Charles Perrault, Cendrillon, and by the Brothers Grimm, Aschenputtel. There have been countless film, television and stage adaptations of the iconic story, but the most well-known adaptation is Walt Disney's 1950 animated film.I first fell in love with Walt Disney's animated film when I was just three-years-old. It was actually the first Disney film that I ever saw as a child. I can still remember being captivated by the story and singing along with the songs. It was as though a spell had been cast upon me, but the magic never wore off at midnight. There were no words to describe the level of excitement I had when I first found out that Disney was developing a live-action film of the timeless story.Review: Tonight, I had the opportunity to attend an advance screening of the live-action version of Walt Disney's most beloved animated film, Cinderella. What I enjoyed most about the latest ""animation to live-action"" treatment, is that it's a relatively straightforward telling of the classic story. While Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent were unnecessary dark and edgy re- imaginings of their animated predecessors, Cinderella is retold respectfully and refreshingly for the new generation. And yes... IT'S NOT A MUSICAL!The Cast: Lily James (Cinderella) and Richard Madden (Prince Charming) were rightfully chosen for their iconic roles. Lily truly captured the true essence of Cinderella's innocence, charm and beauty. Richard... those eyes... ahem... was truly charming in every sense of the word. I loved the chemistry between the Prince and Cinderella -- I don't think I've seen such chemistry between two characters in a Disney film for a very long time. It's very refreshing to see a fairy tale romance blossom!Cate Blanchett (Lady Tremaine) and Helena Bonham-Carter (Fairy Godmother) were perfectly cast for their respective roles. Cate not only brought a lot of depth to her character, but you could tell she was enjoying the role as the malicious stepmother. Helena not only brought a bit of comic relief to the film, but she was definitely fun to watch -- although you can't help but wonder if Mrs. Weasley actually zapped Bellatrix Lestrange into a parallel universe. Hmm?Director and Writer: I personally believe that Disney made the right decision to hire Kenneth Branagh to direct the film and Chris Weitz to write the screenplay. As I was watching the film on the big screen tonight, I could tell that they both approached the story with deep understanding and, most importantly, respect. I was genuinely relieved that it wasn't ruined by some unnecessary ""dark"" and ""edgy"" plot twist. Phew!Score and Costumes: I absolutely loved Patrick Doyle's score for the film and found it to be quite fitting with the story. It was perfectly timed and it drew you into the fairy tale world. I'm definitely happy that I bought the soundtrack. Sandy Powell's costumes, though silly at times, were excellent. I don't think I've seen such beautiful designs and vibrant colours in one film since the Golden Age of Hollywood. I genuinely hope Sandy will be nominated for an Oscar next year for those stunning costumes. Bravo!Sets and Special Effects: The film itself is a visual marvel -- especially for the fairy tale genre. I was truly swept away by the lavish sets that were designed by Dante Ferretti. I don't think I've seen such a breathtaking production since the late 1930's when Hollywood used to put a lot of effort into their sets. The special effects were equally breathtaking, with the dress transformation and the carriage-to-pumpkin scenes being two of my favourite visual highlights. Very impressive!Running Time: My only disappointment was the running time of the theatrical cut. I personally believe that it should have been 10 minutes or 15 minutes longer to flesh out the story more. The film flowed smoothly and didn't feel rushed, but there were a number of scenes and dialogue that were, unfortunately, left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully Disney will release an extended cut, or include those deleted scenes on the home media release. You hear me, Disney?!Verdict: Despite my issue with the running time, I genuinely believe that Disney did something right with their latest live-action film. While most people were probably expecting a sword-wielding action hero, I'm happy that Disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect. While the previous live-action films were all about style, they lacked substance and, unfortunately, heart. Cinderella, however, has style, substance and, most importantly, heart. I'm genuinely happy that Disney kept the magic alive in this film. If Walt Disney himself were alive today, I'm sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little saviour be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way. Bravo! Note: Make sure to stay during the whole end credits as it's accompanied by Lily James singing a beautiful rendition of ""A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes"" and Helena Bonham Carter singing a much humorous version of ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"". A wonderful nostalgic tribute to the animated film!",Cinderella
