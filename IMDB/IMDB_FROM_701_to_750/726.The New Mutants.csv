0,Leofwine_draca,Scuppered by bad writing,4,10 October 2021,"As others have said, it's the writing that scuppers this X-Men spin-off/reboot. The setting is a mental asylum, so we're in SPLIT territory, but the characters are one-dimensional and the antagonists almost non-existent. Thus we get clumsy exposition, random conflict shoehorned into the story, and a random mass CGI climax that feels perfunctory at best. Very sad, because Alice Braga, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton and Maisie Williams have all shown plenty of spirit elsewhere, but here they're floundering and all at sea.",The New Mutants
1,SnoopyStyle,mostly flat,6,23 January 2021,"Five young mutants, Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams), Illyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy), Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton), Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt), Roberto da Costa (Henry Zaga), are trapped in a 'hospital' run by its one and only resident, Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga).I get the elevator pitch right away. The problem is that the movie has almost no tension. It's trapped like the kids in something that is neither this nor that. As a horror, there is little to no intensity to the scares. There could be some romantic possibility but they don't spend enough time on it. Mostly, this falls flat. Braga is not the most threatening of actors. I do really like the younger actors. I want them to succeed and that by itself is enough for me to accept this movie. It has no real drive or tension but it has enough good will to push it through.",The New Mutants
2,Prismark10,The New Mutants,4,19 November 2020,"The New Mutants was meant to be released in 2017. It was held up for reshoots and re editing which implies that there were problems with the movie.It was 20th Century Fox that revitalised Marvel characters with the first X Men film. It mixed action featuring characters with mutant powers and grounded them with real life events.It began with a young Erik Lensherr being taken to a concentration camp as he is separated from his parents he makes the metal gates bend.The New Mutants is a quasi spin off from The X Men. It is The Breakfast Club with tenagers with mutant powers locked up in a shadowy hospital run by a mutant Dr Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga) who takes orders from someone unseen.The new girl is Dani Moonstar who arrives after a supernatural storm that wipes out her family on their reservation. She wakes up handcuffed to her bed. However Dr Reyes has no idea what Dani's particular powers are as Dani is also unaware of them.Dani is introduced to four other young teenagers. Sam Guthrie, Illyana Rasputin, Bobby da Costa and Rahne Sinclair. All have suffered a past trauma relating to the manifestations of their mutant powers.Illyana seems to have the strongest powers and the most abrasive relationship with Dani. Whereas Rahne and Dani are the ones that bond easily.Like Fox's reboot of The Fantastic Four film in 2015. This was a misguidedly drab film which is low on action and humour. It wants to ramp up some horror, the realisation of the Smiley Men comes across like an episode of Steven Moffat era Doctor Who.It is the Young Adult version of a Superhero movie with sullen teenagers and only perks up when some action sequences arrive at the climax.",The New Mutants
3,nogodnomasters,The one you feed,5,11 September 2020,The film centers on mutant Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) who doesn't know her powers yet. She is in a hospital prison with other teen mutants attempting to get control of their powers and hormones.Plot Spoiler: Dani has strange Freddy Kruger type powers that didn't really entertain me. Anya Taylor-Joy stole many scenes from her. Looks like X-men is dead. Marvel messed up the plot with time travel and social commentary plus expensive stars it was a natural to die and replace with something cheaper to make yet still possibly have the same box office appeal. Good luck. BTW out main character loves another female character. This appears to be an introduction of the characters. It repeats the bear story too many times.Guide: 1 quick F-bomb I missed. Teen talk about sex. FF kissing. shower tease.,The New Mutants
4,kosmasp,This is the end (?),6,16 September 2020,"The movie got delayed a lot of times. Actually before this was released now, there was another rumor of another delay. During pandemic/Corona times, it would at least have an excuse. But the sheer endless wait had an end. And while I guess this might have either heightened your expectations or lowered them, the movie will probably land somewhere in the middle. I could not tell if or what was reshot, even if some characters look generally older than the age they are supposed to be playing.Having said all that, this is the last X-Men movie that was made under the independent Fox logo. Disney bought Fox and therefor now holds the rights to their franchises. Which has good and bad sides to it. Disney can make and include even more Marvel characters in the MCU now. But it will also be more family friendly which takes away some of the edge some things may have had. Not X Men though, they were always on the PG13 side of things. So while this has some horror elements to it, it still isn't near an R-rating. If that matters to you.Surprising is that they took so much time and the end product is not really ... well it doesn't seem like that exceptional or worthy to be delayed. On the other hand it is not as bad as some made it to be on the day of the release, but I understand the anger or at least frustration. It's decent overall and entertaining, if you lower your expectations",The New Mutants
5,classicsoncall,"""She's in our heads now. She'll kill us all!""",7,14 June 2021,"This appears to be a super-hero movie for teenagers, much like the Netflix series ""Stranger Things"". I don't have a problem with that, but the story presented isn't all that novel or compelling. Some other reviewers on this board question the horror component as being non-existent. The whole time I was watching I didn't even consider this to be in the horror genre, even with the creepy and mystical things going on like the demon bear. The super powers exhibited by the five teens in the story didn't offer anything out of the ordinary that hasn't been seen before, and I was sort of looking for a mention or appearance by Professor Xavier at some point to link it more strongly to the X-Men franchise, although there were more than one mention of that relationship. Not having read any of the New Mutant books, I don't know what function the Essex Corporation serves in the X-Men universe but it's not intriguing enough for me to find out. Despite my tepid review, I didn't hate it; it was a decent time filler but would have served me better if I was back in my teen years.",The New Mutants
6,jboothmillard,The New Mutants,5,15 September 2020,"I heard the title of this movie quite a few times, I knew it was a dark superhumans film, but I didn't know it was billed as the final instalment in the X-Men franchise, or that it was meant to be the first in a trilogy. It was filmed in 2017, due for release the following year, but Disney acquiring 20th Century Fox, and the COVID-19 outbreak, caused the film to be delayed for a long time, directed by Josh Boone (The Fault in Our Stars). Basically, during a tornado, Cheyenne Native American teenager Danielle ""Dani"" Moonstar (Blu Hunt), escapes the destruction of her reservation. Dani's father William (Adam Beach) is killed by unseen entity, while she is knocked unconscious. Dani awakens in a hospital run by Dr. Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga), who tells her that she is the only survivor of the disaster. Reyes comforts Dani, telling her she is a mutant, and advises her to remain in the hospital until she finds out what her abilities are and how control them. Dani is introduced to four other teenager mutants: Samuel ""Sam"" Guthrie (Stranger Things' Charlie Heaton), Illyana Rasputin (The Witch's Anya Taylor-Joy), Roberto ""Bobby"" da Costa (Henry Zaga) and Rahne Sinclair (Game of Thrones' Maisie Williams). All of them have suffered tragedy; Sam brought down a whole mine on his father (Thomas Kee) and co-workers, Roberto burned his girlfriend to death, Rahne escaped her strictly religious village after being branded as a witch, and Illyana is haunted by memories of her childhood involving slavery, which manifests as otherworldly beings called the ""Smile Men"". All of them are manifesting mutant abilities; Roberto can manipulate solar energy, Sam can fly at jet speed, Illyana has inter-dimensional sorcery powers, and Rahne can turn into a werewolf. Reyes is a powerful mutant herself and keeps her patients from leaving the facility by surrounding it with an unbreakable invisible force field. The five of them believe that they are being trained to join the X-Men, hence the strict supervision, and Reyes reminds them that they are considered dangerous and should not leave until they have mastered their powers. Dani immediately befriends Rahne, eventually forming a romantic relationship, while Illyana, whose only friend is a purple dragon hand puppet she calls Lockheed, continuously antagonises Dani. Soon, the group all begin to have horrifying visions of their past tragedies, one of which results in Rahne getting branded on the neck. Illyana deduces that this is the result of Dani's powers manifesting; she has the ability to create illusions based on a person's visions. Reyes consults her employers, the Essex Corporation, who instruct her to collect Dani's DNA and have her exterminated. As Dani is taken away by Reyes, Rahne suspects that something is wrong. Illyana and Sam are attacked by the Smile Men while Roberto tries to break through the barrier, which has shrunken down. Dani uses her telepathic powers to learn of Reyes's true intentions before Rahne arrives in half-wolf form and attacks Reyes, forcing her to flee. The five regroup and realise that the only way to escape is to kill Reyes, eliminating the force fields' power source. Reyes traps them after they find her and reveals that they were being trained to be killers for Essex. Before she can crush Dani to death, Demon Bear, the entity that followed Dani and destroyed her reservation, arrives, and kills Reyes. Illyana uses her powers to create a real-life version of Lockheed to take on Demon Bear. Eventually, Sam and Roberto join the fight, overcoming their insecurities in the process. Rahne tries to wake the unconscious Dani, in limbo, until she is forced to fight the Demon Bear alone. Dani is visited by her father's spirit, who encourages her to face her fear. Dani wakes and confronts Demon Bear, calming it down and putting it to rest. As the sun rises, the group, now calling themselves the New Mutants, learn that the force field is down and head out together to face the unknown. Also starring Colbi Gannett as Young Illyana, Happy Anderson as Reverend Craig, Dustin Ceithamer as Smiling Man, and Marilyn Manson as the voice of Smiling Man. Rising star Taylor-Joy is good being nasty, Williams does well with her Scottish accent, Hunt is a reasonable leading character, and Braga is a good calm but secretly sinister villain. We have seen a movies like this before, characters trapped in a secret facility with others that fear what they are capable of, the story itself plods along slowly a lot of the time, but the special effects and tense moments get your attention, an average superhero horror. Worth watching!",The New Mutants
7,paul_haakonsen,"This is not just another ""X-Men"" movie...",6,9 November 2020,"Alright, well I didn't even know that they made a new movie set in Marvel's ""X-Men"" universe, so I thought that this was just another random mutant movie. Not that I am overly thrilled about superhero movies in any way, so maybe that is why I wasn't aware of this movie's existence.And as it dawned on me that it was a Marvel movie, I must say that while the promise of a good movies grew bigger, I can't really claim that it was something that had me thrilled or excited.I will say that ""The New Mutants"" didn't feel like a movie with any heavy ties to the ""X-Men"" as such. Sure, there were some references, but this 2020 movie felt very much like a stand-alone movie just lightly set within the same universe. And I think that is an aspect that will part the water; either you enjoy that or find it a nuisance. Personally, I enjoyed that part of the movie.Writers Josh Boone and Knate Lee actually managed to put together a wholesome story that proved to be entertaining and enjoyable, without the glitter and glamour of Xavier and superheroes in skintight outfits. And the fact that there wasn't an all-powerful nemesis to battle and no determined heroes is what worked well in favor of the movie for me.Visually then ""The New Mutants"" was quite the treat, as it was pure eye-candy when the CGI team unfolded their talents and brought the creatures and powers to life on the screen.The characters in ""The New Mutants"" were, for the most parts, actually enjoyable and interesting, and they had put together a good cast ensemble to bring the characters to life on the screen.One thing that didn't sit well with me was the fact that the movie just had to have a lesbian love story angle to it. Of course it did, as the sexism wave hangs heavily over Hollywood, and every director has to be politically correct and include gays, lesbians or transgenders in every movie. Don't get me wrong, as I have nothing against such people or such sexual preferences, but it constantly being painted out on the screen in new movies is just wearing thin and leaves you with a sense of 'what is wrong with being heterosexual these days?'I found ""The New Mutants"" to be an enjoyable movie and, for me, the fact that it didn't have that generic ""X-Men"" vibe to it.My rating of director Josh Boone's 2020 movie lands on a six out of ten stars.",The New Mutants
8,CinemaSerf,Adequate base-layer for more to come....,5,9 September 2020,"It's curious that this film has been rated 15 - most of the intended audience must surely be younger than that! The premiss is that Blu Hunt (""Danni"") wakes up in an institution where she is told that she has mutant powers and is being cared for until she can master them safely. Along with four other patients/inmates she slowly comes to realise that this is more of a prison than an hospital and the initially suspicious and antagonistic group start to bond. Maybe what makes this stand out is the fact that a Marvel adventure openly, and rather understatedly, depicts a same sex attraction between the heroine and Maisie Williams ""Rahne"" (pronounced rain) but otherwise it's a pretty lacklustre, character free 90 minutes with great special effects but little, if any, menace after an extraordinarily long build up. Clearly teed up for a sequel, let's hope they spend more time developing their personalities next time.",The New Mutants
9,Calicodreamin,Fairly captivating,7,28 August 2020,"A fairly captivating sci fi thriller, acting is pretty good and the storyline moved at a reasonable pace. The characters had depth, though the doctor Reyes wasn't much in the way of an antagonist. Storyline was well developed if not a bit predictable. Visuals/FX were amazing, stole the show, the right amount of reality.",The New Mutants
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A mix of what we've seen before and surprising changes,6,6 September 2020,"Dani(Hunt, reasonably promising newcomer, not ready to carry something this big, her role gradually forming an identity over the course of this, and sadly not quite compelling enough to get away with having little personality at the start, which is in part due to the script, as Split pulls this off) wakes up in in a creepy hospital, an old classic of a setting that this dusts off, only to not take much advantage of. She is told by Dr. Reyes(Braga, serviceable, as are other cast members, albeit some of whom mangle accents) that she's a mutant, whose powers have just manifested, and finds four others like her staying in the same institution. Soon after, their nightmares come to life and start hurting them(a very welcome deviation from other ghost stories and the like, where too frequently, the apparitions go ""boo"", and that's it). What is actually going on? And how do they stop it, before it kills them all?At the risk of being as cliche as the film itself is in its worst moments, I wanted to love this. I do want to be clear that I'm not bitter about the disappointment. And this review will not be warped by that. I'm going to try to cover both the good and the bad, as I hugely disagree(though I do of course respecting their opinion on the matter) with anyone saying that it's entirely one, or, more frequently seen, the other. First off, how wild is it that it took 20 years of the film continuity before we saw the release(note that I did not say ""development"") of an entry, that uses the X-Gene as a metaphor for puberty(which is part of how it originated in the comics, as those were the target audience), *and* that is so heavily focused on those going through it(instead of so many team members that are adults, for an emphasis on the allegory of minorities, which is extremely important, not that the two are mutually exclusive), and their angst? This is very much a teen movie(with the number of the tropes you'd expect from such) made for them, about them... and whilst it's not *by* them, clearly those behind the camera have a ton of sympathy and empathy for them. If I were to direct anyone to go for taking this in, it would be them. Either way, it's not worth risking Covid for. It seeks to emulate The Breakfast Club, and sometimes that really works. There's a clear passion for it and understanding of the material. However, unlike many other ""inspired heavily by someone else's work"" pictures(Sam Raimi got a lot of his visual style from the 1963 version of The Haunting, and while not everyone devoted to one of those will feel the same way about the other, I wholeheartedly encourage checking out both), here, I would honestly just say to go catch the original.Everything this does well, you've seen it done, at least a little bit, better elsewhere. The most you could say is that this is a very unique mix, and that if you're you're really into one or more of these, then this might scratch that itch. Before this, I didn't expect to see John Hughes mixed with Freddy Krueger. I admire that. Yet, I'm not sure I would say that they really gel. And the sense that these are five outcasts suffering detention, where ultimately the authority figure doesn't care that much about paying attention to what they're doing, goes against that we are explicitly told that the people in charge here, are well aware that these kids are potentially dangerous. On more than one occasion, the fact that they aren't always watched carefully(despite the omnipresent cameras...), leads to situations that could have gotten someone injured, badly. There are times where it's more luck than competence that prevents things from going horribly wrong. The scares are never all that effective, nor does this, at any point, even briefly, consistently maintain a sense of terror or suspense. I would personally chalk it up to a lack of experience on the (otherwise clearly talented) director(Josh Boone)'s part, rather than the often dreaded, and with good reason for horror, PG-13 rating. At the same time, this not being an R does take some of the bite out of most of the more potentially impactful material. Yes, by the end of this you have a very strong sense of each of these people you've been following are, still, there are better character studies out there. This suffers from a lack of focus. The lesbian romance is very sweet and I honestly have nothing negative to say about it. Outside of the the average at best climax, there is almost no action or tension in this, and the use of abilities is limited and not memorable. Knowing that this is unlikely to get a sequel(which, to be perfectly fair, it had great reason to expect to get, when it was initially in production) makes the small scale, and distinct setup for future installments, frustrating.This contains a little bloody and disturbing violence, suggestive material, and moderate to strong language. I recommend this to those who still find the idea appearing after all these criticisms - I mean, I'm not unhappy about my viewing of it. 6/10",The New Mutants
11,neil-476,Junior X-Men at Hogwarts,7,31 August 2020,"Five young newly developed mutants are receiving counselling and close scrutiny and monitoring at a secure facility. They think they will be moving on to an establishment like Xavier's school: they are actually destined to be product for the Essex Corporation. And there are nightmarish manifestations which have started to appear...The five teens are developed nicely as individuals, especially Maisie Williams as the religiously conflicted were-dog Rahne and the terrific Anya Taylor-Joy as the objectionable Illyana. The fairly leisurely unfolding of the tale holds few surprises, but the film is not the disaster as which it has been painted. The horror overtones are an interesting departure for a superhero film, and there are good reasons why these youngsters fear these manifestations.Alice Braga's Dr Reyes is functional, and that is probably a comment which could aimed at the whole film - it isn't particularly heartfelt, but it does a job.",The New Mutants
12,morrison-dylan-fan,Countdown to New Mutants-The end of the Fox X-Men era.,6,9 September 2020,"When watching Charting with Dan Murrell, I was interested to hear that after the outstanding Logan (2017-also reviewed) that a new Horror-based X-Men flick was to start filming. As the months turned into years and the release date kept being pushed back, I all but gave up of it ever coming out.Shocked to find out a few days ago that it had actually been released,I rushed to the cinema to discover what had been sitting on the shelf.View on the film:One of the last Fox productions and the final film to list Stan Lee as a executive producer (!), co-writer/(with Knate Lee) director Josh Boone & David Lynch's regular cinematographer Peter Deming claw open the original Horror intentions of this first in what was a planned (now canned) trilogy, via a long upwards tracking crane shot bringing Dani's nightmare towards her, breaking in a match-cut awakening in a hospital.Whilst the CGI has clearly been left far from finished since Fox was sold to Disney, the decision to film in the real former psychiatric hospital Medfield State Hospital still allows for some Horror sparks to fly, in long, clinical corridor shots where the bright powers of the mutants are dimmed by the grey hospital they are locked in.Misspelling New Mutants co-creator Bob McLeod's name in the credits, the screenplay by Lee & Boone is the subject left with the most wounds from the studio changes, from sub-plots going into the origins of each mutant appearing to have lost the establishing sequences,to a hilariously awkward final narration,where a ending setting up the second film should/had been in place.Similar to the visual aspect, the writers thankfully included eerie elements which have survived, a highlight being the passive aggression of Dr. Reyes and Sinclair facing the sins of her greatest fear. In a cast where fake accent attempts results in mixed results from scene to scene,Blu Hunt gives a terrific, sincere turn as Dani,who Hunt has being eager to learn more about her mutant powers, whilst bringing the curtain down on the Fox X-Men saga.",The New Mutants
13,siderite,"An X-Men veneer over a generic ""kids with powers face their fears and escape the evil controlling adults"" story",5,30 November 2020,"If someone would have told me that this film is a low budget student film, I would have been really happy. The acting is mediocre, especially from the main character, but not bad. The story is generic, but many have used it to hone their film making skills: do it justice and at least it's entertaining. The special effects are cheap, but hey, it's students, right? They have time to get it right when someone gives them a budget.But this film is not a student film, but instead a 70 million dollars production from Disney-Fox. The connection with the extended X-Men lore is tenuous at best, the horror element is very generic, copied from so many other C movies that it has become comical and the thing that they never seem to get right is characterization. Watch Maisie Williams in the first seasons of GoT, Anya Taylor-Joy in Queen's Gambit, Charlie Heaton in Stranger Things, even Alice Braga in one of the Spanish films and you will see quality of acting, relatable characters. None in this film. Movies like The New Mutants is where actors go to die.So it's a waste of time. Mutant X was better than this.",The New Mutants
14,thesar-2,The New Dream Warriors,3,12 April 2021,"Don't feel like writing a review, but suffice to say...it was just boring, mostly. Felt so oddly edited and out of place and the ""twists"" are so foretold, you can guess in them within moments of the movie beginning. Was it the worst movie I've seen? No. But, Fox jumped the mutant shark like 4 movies prior and this really felt like a Howling sequel. (Hint for those who never sat through all but 1 Howling movies like me: it's not a compliment.) And finally: much like my headline, this really felt like a Nightmare on Elm Street 3 ripoff.Final Thoughts: Oh, those terrible CGI ""funny men."" WOW.

No character development, mediocre performances, and everyone has strong accents that seem to come and go. The scale is very small and there really isn't much here.On the other hand, i didn't hate watching it, probably because i love the superhero genre. And there were some really cool parts.

16,Cineanalyst,The Already-Dead Mutants,4,12 April 2021,"And I thought ""Dark Phoenix"" (2019) was bad, and I still do, but ""The New Mutants"" is just as much so. What a way to end 20th Century (now minus the ""Fox"")'s X-Men series, with a dead-on-arrival spin-off after a remake that's somehow worse than what was formerly many people's most disliked X-Men film, ""The Last Stand"" (2006). Anyways, this one is Freddy Krueger as some young-adult variation on the X-Men series. PG-13 horror meets PG-13 comic-book CGI. Josh Boone, also of the putrid young adult fiction ""The Fault in Our Stars"" (2014) was the director here, but I can't really blame him for this one given that these franchise installments are so much by committee, and this one in particular, reportedly, went through a troublesome production and post-production, including as it was delayed for Disney, almost the last studio I'd want to manage a horror movie, to purchase Fox.The scenario of putting a bunch of twenty-somethings who can't control their superpowers into an asylum where they're attacked by their nightmares may be more promising than the result. It surely would've been better had someone made it so that it were frightening in the least, or at least made the characters interesting enough for one to care what happens to them, or one could just start slashing blood and guts and showing nudity in the shower and pool scenes to make this into trash that's at least a little bit fun. And, if it can't do that, I'd hardly expect any intelligent exploration or blending of fantasy and reality or the reflexive relation of cinema to dreams. They even have surveillance cameras to do something with the latter--I mean, ""Glass"" (2019) managed to make an intriguing meta construction out of a similar set-up. Oh well, time to incorporate the mutants into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I suppose.",The New Mutants
17,851222,Not bad overall and definitelly better then last big budget instalments in series,7,24 November 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.I enjoyed ""The New Mutants"" (2020) more then I thought I will be. Don't get me wrong - this isn't a great movie, and I enjoyed it mostly as a guilty pleasure. It had a nice plot that was mysterious and pretty spooky at the moments. It kept me guessing and I enjoyed it. This flick was also pretty nicely paced as at its running time 1 h 34 min it barely dragged. Performances were pretty descent by Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams - given the material. Unfortunately Blu Hunt wasn't that good.Overall, with lesser budget and a new direction this series took with this movie, I enjoyed ""The New Mutants"" as guilty pleasure way much more then lets say a terrible ""Dark Phoenix"".

19,The-Sarkologist,Another Disney Hack Job,3,1 December 2020,"This film has been a very long time coming, but as the producers have suggested, it seems to be cursed. Not cursed in the sense that people died while it was being filmed, but rather that the release date just seems to get pushed further and further back. Well, it's been released, but not to critical acclaim, one of the reasons being that we are in the middle of a global pandemic, and it seems that people, well, just don't want to go to the cinemas anymore (or at least that is what seems to be the case of late).The other issue is that this seems to have been redone by Disney, after they purchased Fox because, well, they don't do horror films. That was the thing with this film, and that it was supposed to have a lot more horror elements to it, and yeah, it sort of did, but in my mind it really didn't work. It fact, well, I sort of found it rather boring, but I guess that probably has something to do with the X-men franchise really starting to get quite long in the tooth.Yeah, the film is about this girl who has developed mutant powers, and because of it her entire reservation is wiped out. She then wakes up in a hospital where she is with four other teenagers and they are being taught to use their powers properly. However, there seems to be a lot more going on with this. It does sort of eventually come out, but the reality is that the film is more about them trying to escape - sort of.I guess the thing is that they are trying to learn their mutant powers, and much of the film is trying to guess what they are. They aren't being all that open with this, but things do start becoming more noticeable as the film progresses. In fact, it has a lot to do with trying to work out what Dani's power's are, and then with her trying to bring them under control.Honestly, I really didn't think much of this film. I guess in part because the trailer showed that it was going to be one thing, but many of the really horrific parts seemed to have been removed from it, which was a real shame. Honestly, I do have to admit that I was quite disappointed, but yeah, all I have to say is that there is really nothing new with this film, and it is likely to pass into obscurity.",The New Mutants
20,ops-52535,its like you...,7,21 December 2020,"Know them all from earlier, and that is i guess the weakness of super mutants/superhero flicks, because they are all delving over either religous/spiritual themes, or reachinbg over the topic of the natural element like earth wind water and fire and time and so on. so my impression is that there are nothing new to the genetics of the genre, just some new actors that has been introduced to the holy realms of ''super-iority''acting is what you expect and no more than that. the caracters a shallowly described, and its a mess of secret humbug thats of course put together by an organisation with the superoriginal name of ''essex ''.essex must be one of the most overused nameword used in history and its barely never used with a positive prefix to it. i do wanda like every fish what kind of sex they have in essex...production is a galore of special effects, loud sounds and a myriade of light, and the special effects aint bad at all, but its just not convincing and boring., so if a sequel to this should be made, do take some prehistory into the story, i like the idea of using and indian caracter in the story but that aint much original, to me an aborigin or same or innuit or maybe a down syndrome'er would have given some more weight to the story..but im just an average guy in an average world, and still grumpy man i am, shooting 7 stars for eternity to this flick.",The New Mutants

22,John6Daniels,X-HORROR (MY 1001TH MOVIE RATING),9,3 September 2020,"I never cared for this movie even upon development.
I only saw it because I was bored and everything else looked boring. Since I'm into the super hero genre TNM won the debate of what movie to see.The movie starts off dry and boring.Things heat up after the sunspot pool scene no pun intended.The climax and the final fight scenes were pretty good.Despite not enough fight scenes the movie was enjoyable.The acting was ok.
Magik reminded me of that old Angelina Jolie asylum movie called girl interrupted.Sunspot and cannonball were basically no shows.The movie was mainly about Moonstar. Her ability basically drove the whole movie.There is a lesbian scene. It was so obvious and rushed building the queer scene.Overall its a good simple 1 off movie. I wouldn't mind seeing these 5 in a future mcu movie.Verdict: it was a good foxmen closure movie. Not scary for me. It was a fun movie where if you are stuck on lockdown and bored out of your mind. The new mutants is a last resort if everything else is unattainable.",The New Mutants
23,Thanos_Alfie,Disappointment...,4,1 February 2021,"""The New Mutants"" is a Sci-Fi - Action movie in which we watch five young mutants held in a secret facility while they try to first discover and then control their abilities. After some time they will have to fight their hidden fears in order to save themselves.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie but I was disappointed by it. The direction which was made by Josh Boone, it was below average and some times even predictable, something that made the movie boring. The interpretations of the cast followed the pattern of its direction. I have to say that I expected more from Maisie Williams who played as Rahne Sinclair because she did not reach her potential, but I can understand why. Lastly, I have to say that ""The New Mutants"" is a bad opening movie due to its plot, direction and the interpretations of the cast. If you want to watch this movie, i advise you to lower you standards and your expectations otherwise you will be disappointed.",The New Mutants
24,cruise01,Coming of age superhero concept mixed with a little horror does end in a little let down.,6,29 August 2020,The New Mutants (3 out of 5 stars).The New Mutants is a fair coming of age superhero film that is a spin off from the X-Men series. Without giving away spoilers of the connections in the X Men universe. The film is its own thing. With new characters. About several teenagers who are in a asylum hospital being studied by Alice Bragas character. If her character is a good guy or bad. She is trying to help the teens take control of there abilities. Only except the teens face is there worst fears in the hospital.The film starts out with an intense bang with Dani and her father trying to escape from some kind of menacing beast. Until she wakes up in a hospital with others. The plot is an interesting spin on the mutants in the x men universe. It does have a let down climax and ending.The direction does build a little suspense with Anya Taylor facing against long faceless beings in the hospital. Which comes out like a horror movie. With the characters trying to escape. It does have a slow second act in the middle with Alice Braga interviewing each character.The cast ensemble was good. The script struggled near the end when the characters were facing against the villain. Which they could not have come up with a better idea. The New Mutants was entertaining and had some exciting moments. With a let down ending.,The New Mutants
25,Floated2,End of an era?,5,12 November 2021,"Seemingly this New Mutants film is tied to the X-Men franchise in a spin-off way and apparently this film is the final X-Men film to be released (and for the long presumably future).We see as to why this film suffered from many reshoots, and pushbacks. With a relatively intriguing story about five teenage mutants, the film doesn't quite feel great. Even with the characters super powers they were not that interesting. The lead character of Dani is someone nice to root for and to see progress but the other characters (besides Anya Taylor-Joy, whom was the standout) are uninteresting and bland.The New Mutants was supposed to be the start of a new franchise but as it turned out, it was both a critical and financial flop. Perhaps they could have waited a year later (in 2021) to release the film via theatres, due to the pandemic not being as effective compared to its August 2020 release.Overall the film isn't completely terrible, it does have some good moments of entertainment but overall quite a disappointment and nothing special.",The New Mutants
26,eddie_baggins,Should never have seen the light of day,2,14 December 2020,"The history behind The New Mutants making it to the big screen is far more interesting than the lifeless product we are left with at an end result of five delayed release dates that culminated in this unloved X-Men spinoff finally making it to the big screen in the midst of Covid-19 this year.Initially penciled in for a release date in late 2018, this Josh Boone directed outing which was supposedly aiming for a more horror orientated vibe than its more action orientated mutant counterparts and was subject to multiple reshoots and re-edits before it saw the light of day, is one of the biggest misfires yet in the up and down history of X-Men films and their spin-offs and while you can glimpse the film that just might've been with the right caressing and refinement, this version of Marvel's teenage anti-heroes isn't the version you'll want to endure.Wasting a talented cast that includes recognizable faces such as The Queen's Gambit/The Witch star Anya Taylor-Joy, Game of Thrones Maisie Williams and Stranger Things actor Charlie Heaton, Boone is unable to get much out of his performers who struggle to make his and Knate Lee's dull script come to life, while the stagnate setting of the facility these mutant teenagers find themselves in under the supervision of Alice Braga's Dr. Reyes (honestly why does she run such a facility by herself?) makes for a boorish set up as we and the films central characters get bored with what is laid out before them.There are glimmers of the horror aspects that may've at times been more prevalent in a film that more than likely was muddled with by studio executives before it finally saw itself unleashed on the public and these tiny elements of the film create some of the best moments in a mostly dreary and unenthusiastic affair, creepy Slender Man like figures and roaming priests such aspects but the rest of the films dramatic moments and character driven pieces all fall flat around a narrative that never lets its ensemble shine nor one that lets its audience find a reason to care about what is going on around them.Final Say -A blatantly pointless addition to the X-Men cinematic universe that may've become something worthwhile had it been allowed to follow up its horror angles, this sorry excuse for a film is a mostly dire effort despite some brief glimpses of what could have been.1 lonely facility employee out of 5",The New Mutants

That's what this movie is like, because it feels like pages of the script have been removed.The FX/CG as such are pretty good, but not always good enough. They are really the only thing in the movie which is worth while.The characters are OK, in some respect, but I think the casting was better. I didn't like the origin story nor did I care for the sub plots going on in between. I found only individual scenes which were worthwhile.The plot feels forced as if they are rushing through the messed up script, trying to reach the end quickly. I think this is because they cut out a lot of the script.Overall, the few good scenes aren't enough to carry the movie.",The New Mutants

30,southdavid,Just about Bear-able.,5,1 September 2020,"With some larger scale movies finally being released in the UK, following the Covid cinema shutdown, ""The New Mutants"" is finally being given a chance to be seen on the big screen. Was it worth this monumental wait? In a word, no.Following the destruction of her village, Danielle Moonstar (Blu Hunt) awakens in a small private psychiatric hospital. Doctor Reyes (Alice Braga) informs her that she is a mutant and this place is for young or troubled mutants to become accustomed to their powers. There are four other students, Rahne (Maisie Williams), Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy), Sam (Charlie Heaton) and Roberto (Henry Zaga). As Moonstar discovers that the hospital isn't all that it seems - each student comes under attack from their worst fears.There's nothing about ""The New Mutants"" that's irredeemably awful, from a technical standpoint it visually quite well done and the storyline is at least coherent. However, there's also nothing particularly noteworthy or memorable about it either. I appreciate that Josh Boone is saying at the moment that this wasn't the case, and it's the film he wanted to make, but I can't help but feel like the films been neutered somehow, with the horror aspects that we're purported to be in the film toned down. There aren't really any scares, even the cheap jump scares the might be in a similarly pitched film. There's some imagery that is creepier than anything we've seen in any other film in the X-Men universe but overall the experience of the film is that it's rather bland and generic.What doesn't help this is that the characters aren't very interesting. I'll leave Anya Taylor-Joy's Rasputin out of this criticism, as although that character feels familiar, she is at least having some fun with it (and it's nice that she gets to bring Lockheed onto the big screen). The rest of the characters are fairly interchangeable and are performed OK by their respective actors, but even if I was likely to be given the chance to see them play them again, I can't say I'd be too excited about the idea.Again, not the worst film I've ever seen, nor the worst in this X-Men canon, but its failure to properly flesh out any of its potential themes, characters or ideas hamstrings it from the start.",The New Mutants
31,subxerogravity,Very good! true to the source material. Not met to be a Marvel Cinematic Universe Spectacular so don't go into it with that mind set.,6,26 November 2020,"After three years of waiting for this movie to come out its finally here. My assumption was always that this movie was going to suck the way they kept pushing it back, but as it turns out it was not that bad.Very enjoyable if you are a fan of the comic as it attempts to be true to the source material rather than convey to the recent popularity of over the top superhero movies. I respect that because it gives the genre of comic book movies more diversity.The tone of the film is like a horror movie. I remember getting the feel from the trailer and it stays true for the entire feature. I will say that the tone is darker than the comic. As if becoming a teenager is not hard enough with suddenly having powers you can't control, the movie decides to turn these mutants original origins into a much more grim situation. I did not think it was needed but it does not hurt the film.I though all the actors were excellent in their parts, they truly pulled from the comic book and as a fan I loved that. Even the fair skinned kid playing Sunspot (who was a dark skin Brazilian in the comic) was cast perfectly for his role as a rich snob with everything who can't control his body.It's one of those teen movies that's dark and moody that works perfectly in the horror genre. That's something to remember because its nothing like it's X-Men counter part. Still, it's not a bad movie at all.",The New Mutants

I like the film makes you feel lock up with the characters. The effects are fun, so are the jump scare moments. Also a joy on how the mystery slowly starts to reveal itself along the way.
All the actors are pretty good, but it's Ana Taylor Joy that steals movie, has she chews up every scene she's in. I liked the way it let's the audience know it's in the X-Men universe, but standing on it's own at the same time. Still a an amusing way to spend 98 minutes.",The New Mutants
33,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,13 April 2021,"I walked into this thinking it was going to be three-ways of horrible. I mean, everyone was saying it stank three or four years before it even dropped, and let's be honest, if you saw Dark Phoenix you were going to have low expectations for an X-Men film anyway.And when you walk into a movie with expectations that low, and it turns out to be better than what you expected it feels like you are watching a really good movie.So what is it?Well it's very.... 1990s Gen-X teen angst horror isn't it? Which, honestly, I think might be a reason for some of the backlash. It doesn't really fit into the modern all action bloated FX, constant meh humor, no real story or emotions cliche. And it doesn't really fit into the modern all politics cliche either.... so it feels really very 1990s.There are women, and some of the women are nice to one another, and some are mean... and that doesn't fit the modern cliches, the women are written as individuals and not political stereotypes. And there is diversity, but they are written as individuals too, and not modern political stereotypes... and honestly we haven't seen that for a while.In other words, because it was written and directed before everything went insane, the characters all feel and act like they are actual people and not political stereotypes... which in 2021 is refreshing.And it's moody, and, honestly we haven't seen a moody picture for a while. The cinematography, the lighting, the script, the acting, it is very moody. And in 2021 we aren't used to seeing that. All we really see is flash and no substance. It's been a while since we've seen a film that conveys an actual emotion, that has a vibe, a feeling to it.The New Mutants has all of that, and that makes it stand out from everything else.It's not like they political lecture pop nonsense FX heavy trash we usually see, this film has substance to it.In other words, if you are looking for Dark Phoenix and movies that are all about Girl Power and special effects and nothing more... you won't like it. This movie has emotional depth.",The New Mutants
34,stevendbeard,Superhero Horror Film,7,29 August 2020,"I saw ""The New Mutants"", starring Maisie Williams-Game of Thrones_tv, Doctor Who_tv; Anya Taylor_Joy-Split, The Witch; Blu Hunt-Another Life_tv, The Originals_tv and Alice Braga-Elysium, Predators.
This movie is based on a comic book series that is kind of like a junior version of the X_Men. They are teenagers just discovering their powers. Alice plays a doctor that runs a hospital that is supposed to teach the youngsters how to use their new mutant powers and eventually graduate into the X_Men club, hopefully. Blu plays Danielle Moonstar/Mirage, the newest addition to the hospital. She meets Maisie/Rahne Sinclair/Wolfsbane and Anya/Illyana Rasputin/Magik, as well as Sunspot and Cannonball. Oh yeah, Lockheed shows up, too. Each of the teens had bad experiences with their powers when they first developed and they are wishing for the control that was promised them but soon learn that Alice and her boss may have more sinister plans for them. A hint for the comic book fans out there, the company Alice works for is called Essex and her boss' name is Nathaniel Essex-but he is never actually shown. I did read that they are planning on making this part one of a trilogy so they have room to develop the storyline a little more. Overall, this is a superhero/horror movie that drags a little at the beginning but finishes like a superhero movie should; with a big powers flashing fight fest.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes.
It could have been better but I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",The New Mutants

But the Asylum elements and creatures were very well done and the bad mutants were fairly well delivered.

37,alindsay-al,An Average Blend of Horror and Superhero Films,5,31 August 2020,"This film was meant to hit cinemas in 2017 but delay after delay has meant that this film has finally hit the cinema in 2020, when apart from Tenet there is nothing else out so I guess people might actually watch it. I have now watched it and here is my review for The New Mutants. The premise of the film sees a group of young mutants in a hospital, when they realise something is something sinister is going on.Main Character
Blu Hunt plays Danielle Moonstar and she is set up as the main character here. I thought she was fine, she does the best she can with the character, despite the fact that the writing isn't that great. She has good chemistry with the others in the film but there is just nothing particularly remarkable about her and the film doesn't give you a great reason to get invested in her story here.Supporting Characters
The main supporting characters are played by Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy and I thought they both did good jobs here, they are good actresses and they show it off here, especially Taylor-Joy who is the best character here for me. The rest of the mutants are fine too and the doctor played by Alice Braga does a fine job even if you know where the story is going with her. The issue is that there are some interesting things to do with the characters but the film doesn't take the time or effort to really explain these things and again it makes it hard for you to care because the film just gives you no reason to with it's lacklustre writing.Story
The idea of a group of mutants being stuck in a hospital is interesting, especially when it comes to their power sets and the way they are presented. It is at its best when it looks at how their powers affect them on an emotional level and how it led them to be in the hospital. The issue is that it doesn't give you enough time with the characters and really the characters have really similar backstories that it makes you think that they couldn't be bothered to come up with more then one backstory. Also the ending of the film is really abrupt, it's like the last action scene takes place and then the film ends, leaving you let down.Script
The script here has some moments, I mean especially with the horrors that the characters face. I mean Taylor-Joy's character has some really interesting moments here that you just want to know more about and don't. The intrigue is there and the film does a decent job of ramping the tension, but this film suffers from the obviously generic way the script is presented. You know how this film is going to go from the beginning to end and that makes it feel like a let down, with some pretty lacklustre dialogue.Style
The style of the film as mentioned above does a good job in ramping up tension and intrigue. I am not usually a horror film fan, but this film actually uses its horror elements well and makes it quite scary. It also doesn't rely on jump scares which is usually the reason I hate horror films so it deserves credit for that. But this film's first real 30 mins is dull and slow, which makes it a bit boring and a slog, which for a film that is 90 mins long that is quite a long time. Also there is a bit of a clash between the horror and superhero elements of the film and this does make for a clash of styles at time.Overall
Overall, this is an average film that will probably be forgotten about in the memory very quickly. This film had so much potential but fell short and isn't worth the time really.",The New Mutants

41,kirbylee70-599-526179,NOT QUITE X-MEN,7,21 December 2020,"The Marvel Universe films have basically taken over the film industry over the past few years, deservedly so. The films in the series have delivered on the promise to make solid films with strong connections to the comics they were based on. This was the problem that the DC films suffered from, producers and writers who thought they needed to steer clear of the source material as much as possible. But DC wasn't the only one.The earliest incarnations of Marvel films in recent history did the same somewhere. In 2000 the first major film came out, THE X-MEN and in 2002 SPIDER-MAN hit the screens. Both used the basics from the comics but twisted them a bit in costumes, stories and tone. But fans wanted to see these movies and more followed. Neither series at the time were made by Marvel, with X-MEN coming from Fox and SPIDER-MAN Sony. Successful as they were it would take Marvel getting back the rights to most of their material for the better films to be made.That being said Fox still retained the rights to the X-Men franchise and that included the New Mutants. Created in 1982 the comic was an offshoot of the original group that had grown up. This new team consisted of younger members and the movie follows that much of the comics as well as most of the original team. But like its predecessors it deviates and goes for a horror styled theme instead of what the comics created.The film opens with Danielle ""Dani"" Moonstar's (Blu Hunt) being awakened by her father as their reservation is hit by a tornado. Knocked unconscious she wakes in a hospital run by Dr. Cecelia Reyes (Alice Braga). Reyes informs her that her that everyone else was killed and she survived because she is a mutant with powers. This facility was created to protect mutants and to help youngsters come to grips with their powers.She is introduced to the rest of the teens in the facility: Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams), Illyana Rasputin (Anna Taylor-Joy), Roberto de Costa (Henry Zaga) and Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton). Each has their own power as well as their own difficulties in getting along with other people. Sam tends to be shy, Roberto acts like a flirt, Illyana a snarky teen and Rahne the quiet and thoughtful one. Illyana is so nasty that she tricks Dani into making a run to escape the facility only to run into a force field that surrounds it.As the story progresses we learn about the powers of each of these teens as well as their attempts to harness those powers. We also get the feeling things are not on the up and up here as Dr. Reyes watches all of them via closed circuit camera. In addition to these she gets readings on each of the teens showing their life signs and psionic abilities.After her run in with Illyana Dani becomes closer to Rahne. Eventually the two begin a romantic relationship. This builds a tie between them that comes into play later in the film when the climactic battle (face it all of these movies have one). But it will take time before that happens and just what it transpiring is finally revealed.So is the movie any good? I'd heard the film was troubled being pushed back 2 years from its initial release date. The first trailer I saw gave me on desire to see the film since it seemed to deviate so far from the source material. So I went in wary. If you push all of that aside, watch the movie on its own merits without tying it into the Marvel Universe it is surprisingly decent. The acting is well done, the story isn't bad and the directing is solid.But at the same time it doesn't feel like it adds anything new. We've seen the CGI creatures and powers done to death in recent years. And the choice to face off against a huge creature/bad guy at the end of the film has become all too common. This was one of the worst problems with the GREEN LANTERN film. So why make the same mistake here?All in all the movie is entertaining enough and those who aren't familiar with the comics will most likely enjoy it more than those who are. And some fans of the comics will accept this movie for what it is and be glad to at least glimpse those heroes they grew up with and loved hit the screen. While I enjoyed the movie well enough I'm not likely to buy a copy and add it to my collection. I doubt I'll watch it again. It was worth seeing at least once though.",The New Mutants

44,kluseba,A courageous superhero movie on the pulse of time,9,12 October 2020,"I'm not much into all those superhero movies that have flooded the market and the only live-action film of the X-Men franchise that I even recall watching is The Wolverine because it took place in Japan and this country's culture has always intrigued me. I decided to watch The New Mutants because there aren't too many movies shown at local cinemas during the pandemic but I simply wanted to enjoy a film on the big screen once more before another lockdown. The New Mutants came as a pleasant surprise to me and might even inspire me to explore more films of the franchise in the future.This film revolves around teenage girl Danielle Moonstar whose Indian reservation gets destroyed during a terrible snowstorm in the summer. She is saved from her burning house at night by her father who dies under mysterious circumstances soon after. Danielle Moonstar loses consciousness and awakes in an isolated psychiatric hospital where she is welcomed by a seemingly empathic woman who presents herself as Doctor Reyes. The young woman explains to her new patient that she has a hidden power inside of her that she needs to discover and control to find out what happened on that fateful night and to move on in the future without being and danger for herself and others. Danielle soon meets four other teenage patients. She slowly falls in love with Rahne who prevents her from committing suicide. On the other side, she clashes with rebellious Illyana who only opens up to her stuffed dragon. The two teenage boys in the mysterious institution are Brazilian womanizer Roberto and shy American miner's son Sam. The quintet is regularly observed, interrogated and examined by Doctor Reyes and unable to leave the isolated institution. The five teenagers soon discover, develop and control their hidden powers but Danielle's power seems to be uncontrollable and soon starts to impact herself and those around her. Things start to take a sinister turn when the organization behind the institution decides to intervene to control Danielle's power.The New Mutants has convinced me on numerous levels. First of all, the five teenage characters are quite diversified, dynamic and intriguing. They complement one another very well and have excellent chemistry. Depending on your preferences, you will end up rooting for your favourite character since all five teenagers are quite different and present divergent strengths, powers and flaws. My favourite character was indeed lead character Danielle Moonstar as a resilient, intelligent and empathic girl with an interesting cultural background. Doctor Reyes as unpredictable doctor is also a truly intriguing character. The acting performances are great and especially the actresses are very convincing. Blu Hunt incarnates the girl next door authentically, Maisie Williams convinces as shy girl from a religious family who is slowly finding her own identity, Anya Taylor-Joy has much charisma and plays the traumatized rebel so authentically that one gets the impression that she is simply being herself and Alice Braga shines as mysterious doctor whose different facets only emerge in the film's final third. The movie oozes with atmosphere thanks to excellent light techniques, gloomy locations and ominous soundtrack. The film has a claustrophobic vibe that increases tension as the film progresses. The movie fluidly combines teenage drama with dynamic fantasy vibes and menacing thriller elements. Despite offering room for a sequel, the film appropriately ends at a point when the development of the characters has reached its peek and the main story has concluded. There is no question that the excellent finale invites viewers to watch one or more potential sequels.The reason why most people despised the movie is because they expected an overwhelming fantasy spectacle with intense action passages, relentless fight scenes and impressive visual effects. This movie however focuses on gloomy atmosphere, character development and detailed plot. Only the final thirty minutes quicken up the pace and offer the fight scenes most people expect from superhero movies. The fact that this film walks off the beaten path is what appealed so much to me in the first place since most superhero movies have become uninspired, repetitive and predictable.If you are interested in watching a superhero movie that doesn't rely too much on special effects but focuses on sinister atmosphere, profound character development and clever plot, then you will certainly appreciate The New Mutants. The movie also has an empowering message to find your identity and stand by it no matter what. The fact that the lead actress discovers and embraces her homosexuality is certainly on the pulse of time. The idea to include Native American tales in this movie is also a welcome change. The New Mutants is a superhero movie that doesn't feel dated but on the pulse of time and that's why this film will certainly strike a chord with many teenagers and young adults these days. Ignore the harsh negative critics and enjoy this excellent film on the big screen while you still can.",The New Mutants
45,Pairic,Dark Teen Mutants,8,31 August 2020,"The New Mutants: Darkest of the X-Men films, straying into horror territory. Five teens are confined to an institute run by Dr Reyes (Alice Braga), they all have Mutant powers, some haven't manifested yet. Ostensibly Reyes is going to help them identify their powers and control them; the teen Mutants believe that they will then move on to Professor Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters. But it is soon clear that Reyes and her Superior have other plans for them, they are under surveillance at all times even when they think they are in camera free zones and the institution is surrounded by a force-field.The teens are impressive: Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) arrives after her Reservation is wiped out by a tornado and she is chased by an elemental entity; Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton) can fly at jet speed; Bobby da Costa (Henry Zaga) is literally a human torch; Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams) is a shape-shifter; Illyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy) has sorcery powers. They are united by the fact that they all have survived tragedies. Things turn dark when the new mutants suffer nightmares which have real world consequences. Masked monsters (voiced by Marilyn Manson) who are eyeless and grinning when unmasked torment Illyana; Rahne is attacked by a crazed priest who brands her.This is a grim film, even the institution which has cells and seems to have been a psychiatric hospital in the past. There are open fields but this freedom is curtailed by the force-field. It is a prison, not a school. The conflicts between the teens are lightened somewhat by the growing romantic relationship between Rahne and Dani but there are true scenes of horror if not downright terrors the mutants fight for survival.Release of The New Mutants has been much delayed and it has been through re-shoots and new cuts but I think this version works well. Many X-Men fans will probably not be please by it though and that might explain it's IMDb rating.Director/Co-Writer Josh Boone has delivered a fitting conclusion (?) to the X-Men series in this thirteenth film. 8/10.",The New Mutants

47,masonfisk,NEW BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH...!,6,5 October 2020,"Ah the Marvel movie that could almost never get released which deals w/five mutants holed up in a psychotropic wellness clinic under the supervision of a mysterious handler. I won't get into the minutia of how this film was made a couple of years ago & then reshoots (or non reshoots) & its studio being bought out by Disney hindered its release but the film was finally dumped onto theaters just as businesses were slowly starting to opening due to the Co-vid crisis. Is it a train wreck or merely a fender bender? What is essentially The Breakfast Club goes to hell (thanks to the Double Toasted guys for that comparison) finds mutants trying to get better in this mysteriously sparsely populated facility led by a sole doctor (Alice Braga from the Queen of the South TV series). Things seem to be on the mend for the kids interred here but then a new arrival (who has not manifested her powers yet) sets into a motion a series of ever increasingly realistic scares (each inmate's past traumatic faux pas comes back to haunt them in vivid set pieces) setting them all on edge where a big reveal soon is something they'll have to deal with. Doing what it can within the confines of a PG-13 mild scarefest, the film does okay w/the minimal cast (Anya Taylor-Joy, Game of Thrones' Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton from Stranger Things, Henry Zaga & Blu Hunt) & claustrophobic locale but its insistence of being something it's quite not (imagine a hard R of this material) from a director w/the right pedigree, success may've been achieved. Definitely not the worst thing I've seen but a lot of potential was left on the table somewhere. There is some intimations that these are possibly the newly mutated kids from Logan (clips from that film are shown) & the Essex Corporation (run by Mr. Sinister) is the company which runs this facility.",The New Mutants

49,aidanratesmovies,Much better than the reviews led me to believe,9,28 August 2020,"It has its fair share of problems, notably more so towards its beginning, but as the film goes along, it becomes one of the more unique and surprisingly well executed character driven films we have ever come to see from the X-Men Universe. With this film being in development for quite some time now, and rededits lasting nearly 3 years, it is hard to believe this film even came out, let alone is in any way coherent. And yet, I am here today, having seen the film, and having quite liked it. Like I said before it has its flaws, small inconsistencies towards the beginning of the film make for some minor mishaps in the whole scheme of things. There is also a bit of a tonal problem throughout parts of this film, and it's ending can feel a bit underwhelming. On the positive side of things, all actors really give it their best effort while making this film. Every performance seems authentic and everyone is entertaining to watch on screen. I appreciate the time the writers took for this film to delve into the characters, as well as the look and idea of this film. It lacks potential in spots, but for the most part, it is a rather exciting and interesting endeavour that I wouldn't' mind catching again sometime. The feel of the film, with its setting and plot ideals, gives me much of a similar feel held by the 80's horror flick- A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Warriors. However, the result doesn't seem as flimsy in its execution, nor as thin, and I found myself surprised at how appreciative I felt for this film when I left the theater. I expected it to be much worse than it was, but honestly speaking, it has much to offer for the franchise, and more Marvel has ever been willing to dare to go within the lengths of characters and situations that have unfolded- especially with Disney's prized Cinematic Universe. I won't spoil the lengths it goes to, but I enjoyed the things they did, represented, and callbacks to previous X-men flicks. In the end, New Mutants was a solid good time, and if you have the chance, a good film to go back to the theater to.
My Rating: 9/10",The New Mutants
50,questl-18592,"New Mutants, Old Problems",4,25 January 2021,"I feel as thought the story of this film is pretty common knowledge at this point. Started years ago and then trapped in a development hell until it's eventual release and boy does it show. The New Mutants is an all over the place mess of a film that fails to deliver solidly on much of anything and utterly wastes all this potential it clearly had. It's such a frustrating watch because it feels like a constant exercise in ""one step forward, two steps back"" as it will do things that are legitimately good, cool or interesting only to revert to a clumsy, underwhelming mess of a film.The acting is a great example of the aforementioned issue. Taylor-Joy, Williams, and Heaton especially are doing some really great work in here but are consistently hampered by the clunky writing and direction behind the camera. They are better performers than what is sometimes shown here and all I can imagine is that someone was telling them to be this uncharacteristically awkward at times. Williams really stood out to me as being very likable for the most part but then she's forced into this relationship that felt so manufactured and fake, never more apparent than in a shower scene where it looked like she was in the middle of a line, told to move to the next marker, and then continue speaking. It was so bad and she is so much better than that.Let's talk about that story, actually. Forced relationships, clunky narrative, loose threads that are never really explained or wrapped up and a movie that really needs to pick a genre and go with it. A group of mutants trapped in a mental hospital trying to recover sounds amazing, especially with some horror notes in there and we COULD have had that! Instead we get forced teen drama and angst that just doesn't work. A ton of little side things that amount to nothing and some very overt winking and nudging at the audience to try and get us to believe what it wants us to. It was so frustrating to watch this because while all of this is happening it's easy to see what a unique and great movie this could have been. The Smiling Man is a terrifying image and could have been used to much better effect but instead we have to try and tick too many boxes and cover too much ground.I know I've been hitting this pretty hard but I weirdly still had some fun with it and that's entirely because of the actors. Anya Taylor-Joy especially is starting to win me over because she just seems like she's having so much fun with this one and I think her take on Magick warrants more screen time in the future. That's the biggest takeaway, really. In a pass/fail world, The New Mutants is a failure as a single film but it succeeds in making me want more. I would love to see this cast, this group, this take on the Marvel Mutants return in something more fine tuned and focused. There is so much potential here and I really hope this gets another look by the studio and we can get a sequel that rights the ship. For now though, I think this is a quintessential 2020 film. It could've been awesome, ends up a bit of a disaster and now lets move on and try to put this whole mess behind us as quickly as possible.",The New Mutants

52,masonsaul,Average spin-off,5,29 August 2020,"The New Mutants is an average and derivative spin-off that's not committed to any of it's multiple genres and somehow manages to make the X-Men continuity even more convoluted. Blu Hunt gives a really good lead performance and Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton and Henry Zaga are all good. The CG is mostly pretty good and the music by Mark Snow is also good. However, it's brought down by being almost entirely reliant on jump scares which are not scary at all and extremely uneven pacing.",The New Mutants
53,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Despite the Delays and Issues with Development, This is a Decent Movie",6,16 September 2020,"This was a movie that I remember something close to 2 years ago seeing the trailer for it and was interested in seeing it. Growing up I was into comics and I knew this fell into the X-Men line. I didn't know much about it, aside from the fact that this was going to be a superhero film that bleeds over into the horror genre. I've finally seen it now as a 2020 horror film when I had a free afternoon when it was out. The synopsis is five young mutants, just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.We start this film with Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) being woke up by her father, played by Adam Beach. They flee out into the night as it is snowing, but we see fire raining down on them. He tells her to hide in a tree as he has to go back to help the others. She then sees him flung by something, dead. She runs into the night.Dani then wakes up in a hospital bed. In the vents she sees a face that disappears. She finds she is handcuffed to it and pulls her bed to the window. She doesn't understand where she is and then pulls her bed to the door. It is locked and she pounds on it. The voice of Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga) tells her to calm down and she will come explain what has happened.It appears that the event she saw was from an F-5 tornado. She is the only survivor of her tribe. She was saved and it appears she is a mutant. Dr. Reyes asks if she knows what that means and Dani seems to. The X-Men and their adversaries seem to be common knowledge. This teen is here as it is a hospital to figure out what her power is and once she is ready, she can leave to go to a school to develop and hone that ability. That is if she wants to.Dani then gets introduces to the others that are here. There is Rahne Sinclair (Maisie Williams) who seems to be from Scotland. She has the ability to change into a wolf and goes by the codename Wolvesbane. There is Illyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is from Russia and has a hand puppet that is a dragon. From what we will learn, she's the most powerful one here, but also has the most deep-seeded issues. There is Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton) who can discharge energy to fly and he's from the southern United States. Then finally there is Roberto da Costa (Henry Zaga). He is a rich teen from Brazil that won't reveal to the others what his power is. It seemed to have led to a traumatic event that landed him here, partially at his parent's wishes.None of this group really wants to share anything. Illyana immediately is mean to Dani while Rahne takes a liking to her. She tries to show her that things here aren't that bad. That is until something happens in the night, while they sleep. They start have to face their past demons that might be a bit too real. Dani needs to figure out what her power is before it is too late. Dr. Reyes might not be who she says she is and might not be working for who these teens think either.Now to delve a bit more into what I stated earlier, I was really into comics back when I was a kid. Marvel was more of my jam and I really liked Spider-man. That's not to say that I didn't have a few here and there of the X-Men, Venom, The Fantastic Four and others to just name some of them. I bring this up as I recognize some of the more important ones and few of the lesser ones. The New Mutants did not fall into my realm of knowledge.When I heard they were going to combine this with a horror film, I was really intrigued as I've been a fan of this genre since I was child as well. I tried to temper my expectations as this really had some development issues. It appears that they were going to allow the co-writer/director Josh Boone to make the film he wanted with more horror elements. It appears he may have made it and then the studio decided to change things. They then decided that wasn't going to work after some sales when through and it just kept getting its release date and then moved.The reason I bring this up was that this movie doesn't feel like it knows exactly what it wants to do. It feels like a superhero movie with some horror elements, but it doesn't necessarily lean into either enough to really be good in my opinion. The movie is also a bit too predictable as well.That's not to say that I didn't like some of what they were doing here. Dani tells a story from her people, as she is from the Cheyenne tribe of Native Americans, about there being a demon bear. Everyone has this with them as a child and if you let it feed on your fears, it will consume you. From this moment, I knew that her mutant power is to show people their fears. I'm sorry if this is a spoiler, but we learn this like 15 minutes in if you're paying attention. I did like seeing what each of these people's fears are as some of them are quite dark to be honest. I really wish they could have made their movie as this would have been better to be honest.Since they don't really go far enough, the movie as I said is just predictable and it made it boring as well. They also introduce the idea of this Essex Corporation. From trivia I read, this was planned to be a trilogy that would give us more about this group and their leader. This is like dark X-Men and the movies would get progressively darker. I'm not sure what they'll do now though since I have a feeling this isn't going to do as well.That's not to say that the acting is bad in this movie though, as I believe it to be the strongest part. Williams is solid here and I'm impressed she could hold her accent as well as she did. I like the development we get of her character and the tragic back-story she has. It deals with her religion and the darker aspects of it as she is branded a witch. Taylor-Joy is really good as well. She is harboring probably the darkest secret of all. She acts out and it is really hard to blame her the more that we learn. Her power is the strongest and it makes sense with what she endured. Heaton is solid along with Zaga and Braga. Hunt is good as well. For her being our lead, I really feel like she takes a bit of a backseat which is odd. I'd say the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed in their minor roles.The last thing to go over would be probably one of things most people worry about, the special effects. This movie doesn't lean as heavy into the CGI as I was expecting it to. What we got was good. From Rahne being part wolf, which I'm assuming is part practical and part CGI was fine. Illyana's was probably the most difficult and I thought it was solid. Sam and Roberto's didn't bother me. The big bad at the end really impressed me too. The only other thing would be that of the Smiling Man (Dustin Ceithamer). I'd be willing to watch a movie about Illyana dealing with that for how dark I think that story would be. The movie was shot fine aside from that, I had no issues.Now with that said, it is a shame that this movie couldn't be made how Boone wanted it as I feel what we got falls short. There are some really good ideas here that don't get fleshed out enough so the movie feels like a superhero movie that doesn't know if it wants to be that or a horror movie. The acting though is really good across the board as were the effects. It does end up being boring for the reasons that I stated above though unfortunately. I just wanted more as I feel if we got it, there other two planned films might have happened. I would rate this as just over average in my opinion.",The New Mutants
54,davidmvining,Boring,2,28 April 2021,"I always thought this movie was a great idea. You take an established franchise/brand, use that to open the film's box office opening weekend potentially even completely covering the cost of the film that was made with a smaller budget in a new direction. Instead of the fantasy action spectacles that have become de rigeur for the X-Men franchise, we were going to get a stripped down horror film starring a new cast. If it paid off, the studio makes money and they suddenly have a new cast to build off of and a new type of film to mimic within the context of this franchise. It would have helped if this movie knew a single thing about how horror works, or if it weren't interminably boring.I get why the studio would greenlight this film, but I also get why they would also shelve it for literally years, wondering what to do with it. Should they reshoot large sections of it to fix it? Should they release it as is, knowing that it's garbage and that their investment in a potential new direction for the franchise will be dead on arrival? Well, I guess Disney sorted all of that out when they bought 20th Century Fox and just released the film as is. They weren't going to continue with the Fox iteration of the X-Men franchise either way, so they might as well make a bit of coin on it and move on.A young Cheyenne girl, Dani, wakes up in the middle of the night as her reservation is being destroyed by a large, mysterious force. Her father gets her out of the house and hides her in the crook of a tree before he dies. When she wakes up, she's in a locked down facility with only a single doctor, Dr. Reyes, to watch over five mutant youths. The entire facility is voice controlled by her, and there's a mysterious invisible dome that surrounds the facility. Right off the bat this movie feels wrong. It's too literal. Being a horror film at heart, it feels like a more surrealistic take on the setting would have benefitted it. There's a certain mystery about the dome and whomever is behind the whole thing, but the dome gets answered quickly and the mysterious force behind the scenes is never really a focus (perhaps meant to be left to sequels that never came around).The five mutants are all somewhere between uninteresting and laughable. Rahne is a werewolf of sorts, abused by a cardinal (I'm assuming it was supposed to just be a local priest but no one knew that a cardinal's robes and a priest's robes look very different) but she's still praying all the time. Oh, and she's gay. Illyana has a terribly laughable Russian accent, can form a metal arm and sword with blue flames, and she can teleport to another dimension and back (begging the question about why she's locked in the place at all when it seems like she could just leave at any time). Sam ""blasts off"" like a rocket, and he's from Kentucky and was going to work in the coal mines. Bobby is the son of wealthy Brazilians who becomes hot and his skin bursts into flames. None of these characters are particularly interesting, and the movie spends a shocking amount of time with them. The problem is that they really don't have anything to do.They all talk about getting out, but not a single one of them tries. There's even a point where they drug Reyes, and all they do is do what they've always done, which is sit around and talk but now with music. Rahne even has a way around all the mechanical locks that only unlock at Reyes' command, and there's a solid chance that Reyes can't maintain the bubble asleep, and yet they don't even talk about the possibility. They just hang out like they always have. What do they want? Well, based on their actions, they don't want much of anything. They have no drive to accomplish anything, and in their drive to just hang out, the movie gets increasingly boring.Eventually something close to a plot develops as we discover that Dani's power is that she makes people's fears manifest in reality when she's stressed. I mean, we figure it out the first time it happens with Sam, a strange new event occurring with the addition of the new character to this mix, but it doesn't really become a thing until the third act when Illyana's nightmare comes to life. I will give the movie props for the design of the smiling men that attack the kids. They're creepy. However they also represent this movie's complete misunderstanding of how horror works.This ties into the movie's very literal take on the setting. Outside of the very focused bits of horror, nothing about the movie feels that creepy. There's the horror scenes, and then there's the kids hanging out. That's most of the movie right there. There's no impending sense of dread, just kids hanging out and then some random nightmares. I think making the hospital far less literal by excluding Reyes completely and making the escape impossible but also impossible to explain would have helped. Mixing that with an increasing sense of tension as the group tries to escape after this new girl showed up with no explanation and things have started going wrong, potentially building in a more concrete them vs her dynamic that may or may not be justified would have done a lot for it as well. As Dani gets more isolated from potential new contacts, the nightmares get worse, and the need to escape increases along with it. That might have worked better, and that might have been what was originally envisioned. It's not how it plays, though.Not only is the movie inept, but it's boring. That's one of the greatest sins in entertainment, boring your audience, offering up nothing for them to latch onto to engage with. I liked the idea of this film, but it would have been nice had it been made with an ounce of understanding of its genre, giving them film any sense of urgency instead of tedium.",The New Mutants

Robbie K back again to give you insight into the latest film as he reviews:Movie:New Mutants (2020)Director:
Josh Boone
Writers:
Josh Boone, Knate Lee
Stars:
Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie HeatonLIKES:Good Graphics
Haunting graphics brought to life with decent animation and styleA great setting that feels haunted, enclosing, and very much forebodingMutant powers that have the comic and movie atmosphere that comes through at the end of the film and reminds me of X-men series I loveSome Decent Acting From Young Actors
Talented cast brings out the teenage angsts of a hot headed mutant academy groupGood spectrum when they are directed too with Maisie Willaims and Blu Hunt who have the highest spectrumGreat chemistry together that many times feels very much like a group forced together into odd situationsSome Deep Meaning
Without ruining the plot, plenty of character development to address relevant topicsSome are done fantastically to really integrate with the story and will be the shining moments of the movieDecent Run Time
About 90 minutes, hard to beat that for a movie like this.Some Great Horror Delivery at times
The setting is truly haunting, with creepy shadows, feelings of being alone, and the chilling psychological torment of the colors of the wallSome chilling things that go bump in the night and may induce nightmares to young audience members (be warned)Some back stories are certainly deeply disturbing, a darker comic book splendor that may resonate deeply and certainly chill you at points.Rahne and Dani
Best part of the movie, as the two have great chemistry, the most character development, major growth, and a dynamic that works well.Great acting as I said.Okay climax:
Displays of Power come outA nice suspense of the movie, that is okay to say the leastSome of the funniest lines to date at this time.DISLIKES:
Predictable
Even without reading the comics can see so many things a mile awayMakes the movie boring at times knowing where it is going and took away the edge of the horror pointsSlow at times
Takes a little while to get off the ground, the first act in particular a long drawn out introSecond part feels very uneven, exciting at times only to drop to low, drawn out displays of quickly portrayed character developmentThe third act gets much better to offset, but again very quick, needed more action and conflict to offset the slow pace.A Little too progressive at times
Takes some political components into the mix and sort of makes it the focus, contributing to the slow paceThere will be some character moments that are a bit too millennial and drama oriented that some will not enjoy, can't say much without ruining things.Leads to some overacted moments.A bit too forceful in acting
The characters are a bit too overdone at times, the progressive themes forcing them to act a bit too cliché in drama momentsIllyana was the one whose tough attitude got a bit in the way, though several others have flaws greatly over exaggeratedPowers Come a Bit too late
Again I like my movies about mutants to have some better displays of power used in the super power way-This way was more drama focused and horror than the usual superhero part. Unique yes, but the slow none the same and a bit too bland.Addressing the deep roots a bit too easy and rushed
The strong character moments get rushed for most to overcome their weakness, randomly finding strength to defat their demonsOutside of one girl's struggles, the others surprisingly are less impressive and more shoved to the background, the constant struggle of multiple charactersNeeded to keep to the horror elements at the end to really bring the character out instead of jumping into the overdramatic action part.Illyana a bit too much for me
Understand she is supposed to be the overzealous one, but still a bit too much for meThe in your face, rogue element has its place, but often forces too much for my like that it gets in the way of progressing the characterHas the coolest looking power, but at the end drowned out by jokes and drama to really get the full effect.SUMMARY:After two long years I had my doubts about the movie having any sort of quality. However, the movie had some enjoyable components and was more put together in terms of the themes it was trying to deliver. Like Teen Wolf meets the Breakfast Club, the rogue like drama of this film manages to keep much of its characters interacting to make a heck of a drama. Some elements of the horror really are executed well and had they focused more on this element, we could have gotten one heck of a thrill ride. Sadly for me, the drama elements get in the way with a rushed plot, leading to overdone, in your face moments, rapid development for many of the characters, and some pacing issues that I hope to have settled in my comic movies. Still if you like drama/horror movies with a bit of a super hero flair, then check this one out, otherwise hold out for the bigger releases coming in a few weeks.My scores are:Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 7.0

I thought they were ruining ""The New Warriors"", my mistake, and I didn't realize they gender bent a character I was already familiar with. (Moonstar is basically another guy character from ""The Initiative"" in Marvel Comcs)What is really interesting, and NEVER ADDRESSED is what the facility is, who runs it, and what the point is. There just aren't answers to be had so simply during an uprising. Honestly worst part of the movie, but unless you're paying too much attention, you probably won't even notice.The characters are deceptively interesting, to the point where I was actually surprised at certain points, but they are what makes the movie. The discovery of the characters, they're evolution as a team, and their personal struggles are what makes the movie great.It is also FILLED with action after a certain point, beautifully rendered and weighted combat with something somewhat meaningful behind it.If you're into super powered action on any level, then give this a watch.",The New Mutants
57,vengeance20,Was Expecting More From This,5,29 August 2020,"So after 2 Years we finally get to watch this anticipated Fantastic 4 esque Horror Film. I heard many things about why this film didn't get released sooner to creative differences to it being made more horror like. Not to mention re-shoots, re-editing, re-writing & such which made me think this film was going to suck or be pretty butchered.The film follows a group of teens who are en housed in a mental asylum. Each of them have past traumas which are linked to their super powers they may or may not know about. That's the films plot which is in the sense of the word thin.I found the film to be ok, but was expecting more, a lot more given it's released date & development hell it languished in for the past 2 years. I seen some visuals & thought they would be in this film, sadly they weren't, while some which I had seen prior to this film were in & were pretty good & scary, there was a lot that didn't make it into the final cut which was a shame.The film seemed flat, dull & pretty droning for the first hour or so. The setting was bland & there was no music in the film, which I weirdly I didn't notice. The film also felt isolated given there was a cast of only 6 people. I also could smell some Left Wing Woke Agendas being inserted here & there... not to mention a few toxic digs as well... makes me wonder if that was one of the reasons for re-shoots, re-writing, red-editing etc. Who knows.Anyway the film did have some impressive visuals & was actually alright, the ending was a bit so & so for me but alright. The pacing & run time a 1 hour & 27 minutes wasn't too bad either to be fair, though I felt the film could've been beefed up more with scary visuals & scenarios.Overall it's alright, but I was expecting much more from this given how long we had to wait. 5/10",The New Mutants

The writing of the relationships never touched on the personal which made their resolutions untenable. The characters were poorly formed. On the positive, the special effects were spectacular and Maisie Williams can't give a poor performance even when she is given so little with which to work. I was delighted to see Alice Braga in the cast but even she couldn't make sense of the motivation of her character. I give the film a 6 (disappointing) out of 10. {Marvel Superhero/Horror}",The New Mutants
60,arungeorge13,The New Mutants is a disappointment in almost every way! [+36%],4,10 November 2020,"Neither a solid horror movie nor a decent coming-of-age flick, The New Mutants fails in what it sets out to do. The writing (by Knate Lee and Josh Boone, with the latter directing) feels rushed, not allowing any of the lead characters to gradually unravel their mutant powers. Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy are good actors but the material doesn't have enough in it to put their capabilities to the best use. Blu Hunt, I felt, couldn't carry the film on her shoulders all the way (her performance needed some refinement!). What we get is minimal character development, a boringly obvious antagonist (Alice Braga), subpar horror elements, and overall, a film that struggles to stand on its own two feet. Even with the lesbian angle and American Indian ethnic inclusion, The New Mutants is undoubtedly a mess from a storytelling standpoint.",The New Mutants

The movie is quite boring.

Trapped in a creepy facility run by Dr. Reyes(Alice Braga), Rahne, Illyana, Sam, Danielle & Roberto will need to fight their inner demons & stop an impending doom, before it's too late.The New Mutants is an amazing movie. Director Josh Boone has given us a unique, engaging & creepy superhero film. This film doesn't deserve the critical drubbing, it received from everyone. In fact, it's a really good addition to the X-Men franchise, tying into previous movies. It surpasses last year's X-Men: Dark Phoenix(2019). The action set pieces are minimal but, highly impressive. The horror elements of the film, make it unique in the long running superhero genre. The highlight of the movie, is the effortless camaraderie among its five leads. Maisie Williams is outstanding as Rahne Sinclair. Williams continues to grow from strength to strength as an actor, after her star-making turn on Game of Thrones(2011-2019). Anya Taylor-Joy is spectacular as Illyana Rasputin. Taylor-Joy gives us another unforgettable performance after The Witch(2015), Split(2016), Thoroughbreds(2017) & Glass(2019). Charlie Heaton is brilliant as Sam Guthrie. Alice Braga is fantastic as Dr. Reyes. Blu Hunt is mind-blowing as Danielle Moonstar. Hunt has a bright future ahead of her.

68,markthomassintek,Not helping the franchise,6,31 August 2020,"REVIEW - THE NEW MUTANTSRelease date 4 SeptemberSince 2000, the X-Men franchise has soared as high as X-Men: First Class and fallen as low as X-Men: The Last Stand.This film was actually completed in 2018 but due to a merger, Disney not feeling the horror theme fits into their family viewing and now covid this has finally been released 4 years later.I say horror because all of the trailers pointed that way, a much darker themed film which was welcomed by fans as a whole new way to tell the story, the only other horror genre film being the excellent Brightburn.Each character is given their own back story, some going into greater depth than others while each of the characters are in a hospital teaching them how to control their various powers.From the start it certainly looks darker but the scares simply don't scare, so I do wonder Disney had their way after all because whilst definitely an interesting and original concept for the X person franchise and from trailers seen looking really scary actually wasn't and unfortunately even the big fight sequence at the end just lacked the edge of your seat treatment because........no spoilers.Turn your brain off, sit back and just watch it for what it is, a coming of age movie set in a hospital, the brooding teens have powers and someone and something just isn't right.Not the best, not the worse but unfortunately not helping the franchise either.Rating 6 out of 10",The New Mutants
69,abisio,FAR BETTER THAN THE LAST X-MEN MOVIE,8,21 September 2020,"Of all the super-heroes zagas around; I always preferred X-MEN because it really had deeper themes on top of the sci-fi / entertainment aspect. Sadly DARK PHOENIX was such a disaster that I consider another lose under Disney reign.So with low expectations (and mostly attracted to the horror aspect) I came to see this YA version and to much surprise it was far better than expected.
The movie works a little on young adults conflicts; but mostly to stretch character development and in different levels it works.
The acting is outstanding compared to most of these movies; from Alicia Braga as the bad girl in a very controlled mode (like Oscar winner Louise Fletcher in One Flew over the Cuckoo nest), Anya Taylor-Joy and bully recluse, Maisie Williams as the repressed girl, Charlie Heaton, Henry Zaga and Blu Hunt.
Considering that most of the movie is only the 6 characters in one location, still the movie manages to keep entertaining until the very destructive ending.
The only issue for many could be that it switches between horror movie, romantic (LGBTQ) or Breakfast Club mode too much; but aside from being mutants and a few dialogs; nothing here is like others X-MEN movies.
Perhaps is time to be original.
In brief; it deserves to succeed and resuscitate the X-MEN franchise",The New Mutants
70,bob-the-movie-man,"""Glass"" - Half Full",6,9 September 2020,"So, I've heard a lot of bad word-of-mouth about this X-Men flick, but otherwise knew very little about it. As such, I went in with low expectations. And although there is nothing remotely novel about the movie, I didn't think it was too bad at all.The plot: So, my review title suggests that the plot is very closely aligned to M Night Shymalan's ""Glass"" - his ""Split"" sequel from last year. A Victorian-style hospital-cum-prison similarly forms the claustrophobic setting for the majority of the movie. This is where the troubled teen Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) is taken after being suddenly orphaned in dramatic and mysterious circumstances. The only doctor present, Dr Reyes (Alice Braga), says she is being held there for her own - and society's safety - while her puberty-driven mutant tendencies emerge.Locked away with her is Rahne (Maisie Williams), Charlie (Sam Guthrie), 'hot' Brazilian hunk Roberto (Henry Zaga) and the gloriously named Illyana Rasputin (Anya-Taylor Joy). Danni's arrival sparks a serious of escalating events that literally lead to all hell breaking loose.Blu is the warmest colour: What made this Marvel movie stand-out for me, from the normal glass-shattering standard, is that it is predominantly a character-led piece. We spend quite a bit of time (for a Marvel movie) in building relationships between the teens, including a sweet lesbian-coming-out 'will they/won't they' tension between Rahne and Danni.I was also very much attracted to the performance of Blu Hunt. I admit that this might not just be due to her interesting performance (the indigenous / LBGT angle is intriguing) but because she reminded me strongly of a girl at school who I had a mad crush on and completely failed to get off with! Blu is actually native American (from the Lakota tribe). Given she is the lead and has to carry the movie, it's a surprise that she is only about 5th in the billing: I'd have been upset with the director (Josh ""A Fault in our Stars"" Boone) about that.Maisie Williams is also effective in this, and gets top billing, although arguably Anya-Taylor-Joy has emerged - with her wonderful ""Emma"" - as the bigger star since filming.But it's Taylor-Joy's Rasputin that really stands out as the most interesting of the characters on show. There's a scene where she goes into action - eyes blazing and 'daemon' hovering - that would make a splendid PC screensaver! Stuff the ""Black Widow"" standalone movie: I'd go watch Illyana Rasputin kicking ass in her own follow-up movie! (Of course, Anya Taylor-Joy was also prominent in ""Glass"", which unfortunately cements the similarities between the films.)The movie has had a long and tortuous path to its final release, being made waaaaaayyyyy back in 2017. As an X-Men movie, it's appeared after the X-Men universe finally imploded (with the disappointing whimper of ""Dark Phoenix""). So in that sense it's a bit of a ghost of a flick.Overall, it's a mixed bag. There's a sense of great familiarity with the contents - particularly with the strong echoes of ""Glass"", actually filmed after this one (but with 'inversion', who knows anymore?). Even the ""Indian legend"" that runs through the movie swaps a bear for a wolf but ends with a familiar, rather groan-inducing, motto. (It was used in ""Tomorrowland"" I think?)But the young cast are attractive and entertained me for the (pleasantly short) running time. It's not going to win any prizes for originality, or indeed anything else. But it really wasn't the X-Men bust I expected it to be.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook. Thanks.)",The New Mutants
71,AngelHonesty,Better then Nothing,6,5 January 2021,"I was hoping for something grand and was greatly disappointed. I'm a big fan of the X-Men and with so few movies made about them, I will take anything. Unfortunately that's what I got. The plot is predictable, a few kids with powers in a creepy asylum trying to survive. The love story has absolutely no feel to it, it's very empty. The horror is very mild to almost non existent. There are some serious plot holes, such as, why is there only one woman working in the facility? Who is the organization? What exactly is the woman trying to do to the kids? just a few to name off. The accents were terrible! I love most of the cast in different movies I have seen them in, but somehow this film has turned the actors into something to almost cringe at which really shows you how bad the movie was. With all of it's issues I did enjoy it, just because it is about some kids with powers. More then anything I hope they do a part 2, I want to see what happens next and with the way it ended it leaves the movie very open to new and better unpredictable possibilities.",The New Mutants
72,kjproulx,This Premise Promises Far too Much for the Film to Handle,4,2 September 2020,"At this point, it's nearly impossible to not talk about the behind-the-scenes drama that surrounded The New Mutants, especially before diving into a review. Filmed nearly five years ago and given an original release date in the early months of 2018, it's finally playing in theatres as we head into the Fall movie season of 2020, which, in its own right, is already scarce for content. Before Disney purchased Fox, I had enjoyed many of the X-Men films, but I was also ready for a fresh take on the characters. X-Men: Dark Phoenix was the final nail in the coffin for me, and while The New Mutants is nowhere close to being as disappointing as that film was, I feel the effort to desperately find a slot to play this movie in theatres was very unnecessary. Here are my thoughts on The New Mutants.Held in an institution against their will, five young mutants who are being forced to control their abilities before being allowed to leave, begin to discover a dark truth about this place. Haunted by their greatest fears and learning that the prophecy of the demon bear may actually exist, they must learn to get along and face a greater threat in order to escape. That general concept has been done so many times in different variations that it just seems stale at this point. With that said, I have to admit that it was also this film's strongest point. The premise itself was intriguing and I enjoyed the first act of this movie quite a bit, but the rest of the film was a complete mess to me.The New Mutants' greatest downfall is the fact that it's very uneventful, given the story at hand. The majority of this film is a series of scenes with characters either being overly confident in order to cover up their past or just downright miserable and depressed, making for many long and slow conversations. Not to say long conversations hurt a film by any means, but it felt like each character sort of learned the same lesson on different occasions, making the film feel long and repetitive, even at 90 minutes. It really isn't until the final 20 minutes when any real action starts, and even the climax felt tame to me. Things sort of simmer down on their own before the credits rolled and I just didn't feel invested by that point.On top of the very glaring issues this film suffers from, I feel that the biggest culprit lies in the characterizations of each and every one of them. From Anya Taylor-Joy to Charlie Heaton, The New Mutants is loaded with a talented young cast, but they aren't given anything stellar to do, which will leave audiences believing these young stars didn't try hard enough. There are some truly cringe-worthy lines of dialogue here and while they were clearly intentional, this screenplay was just a mess. Right down to their backstories, I never once felt connected to any of them. They were all fairly typical stories of loss and grief. Nothing set these characters apart from one another.Overall, The New Mutants has a nice little concept that it does absolutely nothing with. The cast is very talented, but they all come off as bad here, due to what they're working with. Director Josh Boon directed the very well-made romance adaptation The Fault in Our Stars, which was a very quiet film and I believe those quiet sensibilities transferred over to this film and made it feel slower than it should've felt. For a film revolving around teenagers having superpowers and being billed as a horror, it should've been far more entertaining. It's not the worst film I've seen that's based on a comic book, but it not a good one either. Sadly, this movie went through a lot of struggle, which built more hype around it as a whole, which I feel gave people some false hope. I can't get myself to recommend this one.",The New Mutants
73,katyayan-12892,New Mutant,4,10 March 2021,"Review By Kamal KThe story revolves around a group of mutant teens being sent to a special institute to help them manage their powers but instead of being supportive and learning to live with their condition like Xavier's School from the X-Men films, this institute is oppressive and they are trying to control their powers for their own sinister purposes... Which never get explained. It's the series first foray into the horror genre and it gives it a decent go but I didn't find it scary at all if I'm honest. The characters are interesting but none seem that fleshed out so I struggled to have a connection with any of them. When the teens start to use their powers they certainly look cool, particularly Magik with her soul sword and teleportation abilities, but they just didn't use them often enough for me. It seemed these kids preferred to run away rather than fight when clearly they were stronger than the nightmare smiley face monster things. I was a bit disappointed in the character of Rahne Sinclair to, she was essentially a werewolf but the special effects to bring her to life didn't do it for me it just seemed a bit basic and simple. The Demon Bear at the end of the film was some very nice CGI work though and the fight between it and Magik was my favourite scene in the film.Final Verdict: It plays out like a teen horror flick but it's not really that scary and it leaves some plot points unanswered. When the characters use their powers they certainly look cool and overall it's not without some charm but ultimately it falls flat.",The New Mutants

The last X-Men movie before they're introduced into the MCU became one of the most delayed films ever, but it finally got released this week. Shot in 2017 with an original release date of April 2018, Josh Boone had reshoots planned, which postponed the movie for the first time. Disney began negotiations to merge with 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), keeping the film in a limbo state. A global pandemic emerged, pushing the movie even further. Final outcome: a worldwide limited release three years after finishing shooting, and without any reshoots. So, obviously, my expectations were pretty low...Surprise, surprise, The New Mutants isn't a horrible mess, it's... fine! I feel really sorry that so many people worked on this film and had to wait so long to see it being released to the world. I love how it's far from being just another generic, formulaic superhero flick. Sure, it has tons of cliches, and it does still feel like an X-Men movie at times, but I'll get there. I genuinely appreciate that Boone and Knate Lee wrote a narrative packed with significant and detailed character development, including a compelling romantic arc. Every young mutant gets their own story explained front-center. Each time the film dives into a character's past, it never feels like an irrelevant subplot. It all serves a purpose.The technical crew had a very low budget to work with compared to other movies in the genre, so I must praise them for transforming a small, one-location film into something surprisingly entertaining. The visual effects definitely don't have that quality that viewers are used to seeing now, but they're reasonably okay for the most part. The horror atmosphere is definitely present, but it feels like the movie could have benefited from a more assertive, bolder approach to these nightmarish sequences. The best aspect of the whole film is related to the indisputably talented cast, with just one exception...From Anya-Taylor Joy's rebel behavior to Charlie Heaton's experienced performance, passing through Maisie Williams' emotional display and Henry Zaga's charming one-liners, every one of these actors proves why they were cast in such a well-known franchise. Despite the ridiculously flawed accents, all share great chemistry between each other, including debutant Blu Hunt. However, the latter fails to be a compelling protagonist clearly due to her inexperience. I don't want to be too harsh on her because I did see some great moments when she shared the screen with her colleagues. However, I do need to state that every scene where she acts alone or against a green screen reaches cringe-worthy levels of bad acting.Boone and/or the casting crew must also take responsibility for choosing her as the main character, but honestly, she's not even my main issue. That has to do with her own character. While she gets the same focus as her fellow mutants when it comes to her backstory, she never really has to deal with her powers' consequences. Some mutants hurt or killed people, and they're unquestionably damaged because of it. Dani doesn't have a single moment where she feels sorry for whatever happened in her past or where she's confronted with it. It's quite hard to connect with a protagonist when both the character and the actress playing her lack that captivating personality.Finally, Alice Braga, as the doctor, is probably the most formulaic component of the movie. From the first conversation she has with the mutants, any viewer can guess where the story is going. Braga is good as Dr. Cecilia Reyes, but coincidentally or not, her character is the only one whose backstory wasn't remotely explored. Reyes' motivations and what lies beyond the hospital raise intriguing questions that, unfortunately, never get answered. Maybe the supposed reshoots could have solved some of these issues, perhaps they could have added some more. I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that The New Mutants is far from being an awful mess.All in all, Josh Boone and Knate Lee deliver a reasonably entertaining screenplay out of the generic zone of the superhero genre, packed with detailed character development and decent horror sequences, especially having in mind the low budget. The New Mutants features a marvelous cast, where everyone shares tremendous chemistry with each other. All actors deliver great performances, except for the debutant Blu Hunt who unfortunately lets her inexperience overcome her evident potential. Contrasting with the overall character treatment, Dani Moonstar fails to be a compelling protagonist since she's barely shown having to deal with the emotional consequences of her powers like every other mutant does. Despite the refreshing take on the overall story, there are still a few cliches and formulaic components throughout the film, especially related to the hospital. Overall, it's surprisingly okay considering the numerous production issues, so I definitely recommend it at least just to say goodbye to the last X-Men installment pre-MCU.Rating: B-",The New Mutants

Pestered by disparate issues; the execution fell short due to its feeble writing & fragmentary character developments. Barring few legit flashes of excitement, the conclusive outcome turned out to be insignificant.
'Superhero Horror' ever heard that phrase before? No? Neither did I!Frankly speaking, A horror treatment for a superhero/comicbook film, the conception itself has gone over my head. While I revere innovative ideas in this field, this time it seemed rather puerile. First two acts are inattentive, uneventful. Although by the commencement of the final act; things have improved quite a bit.
Only if they maintained a similar momentum all over, the aftermath would have been drastically differential.Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton; some seasoned performers on paper yet their acts lacked the usual potency we all bargain on.
Blu Hunt as Dani, failed to affirm her dominance as the protagonist. As a result, the story never built upon her perspective. Others had their fair share of chances to take over, but no one has been able to do so.I clearly remember the hype & anticipation from the franchise followers when the announcement came through.

80,MrDHWong,Provides an adequate amount of entertainment for anyone longing for that last taste of X-Men related fun,6,3 September 2020,"""The New Mutants"" is a spin-off superhero film based on the Marvel Comics group of the same name. Directed by Josh Boone (The Fault In Our Stars) and starring Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Charlie Heaton, it provides an adequate amount of entertainment for anyone longing for that last taste of X-Men related fun before they are fully integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.After losing her father and home due to a tornado, young Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt) wakes up to find herself in a mysterious hospital run by the equally enigmatic Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga). Confused by her new environment, Dani is informed by Dr. Reyes that she is a mutant and that her powers need to be studied and controlled before she is allowed to leave. Dani is soon introduced to four other young patients who also have mutant powers; Rahne (Maisie Williams), a Scottish girl with the ability to transform into a wolf, Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Russian girl with witch-like powers, Bobby (Henry Zaga), a Brazilian boy who can harness solar energy, and Sam (Charlie Heaton), a Southern US boy who can fly at super fast speeds. Each of them struggle to control their mutant powers and deal with the trauma of their past, eventually bonding together to conspire a way to escape the hospital.The X-Men series of films have had a spotty history when it comes to quality, ranging from a clever and ambitious way to fix previous mistakes (X-Men: Days Of Future Past) to a boring and underwhelming conclusion to certain character arcs (X-Men: Dark Phoenix). In spite of its status as a spin-off, ""The New Mutants"" does feel like it is part of this universe, as the audience is reminded of it quite often. While I don't believe it is anywhere near as bad as Dark Phoenix, it still doesn't leave much of an impression to elevate it above being simply ""okay"". The whole story felt as though it was on autopilot, weaving through the typical cliched tragic backstories of its main characters all while offering little to no surprises along the way. As things like this have all been done before in older entries, it just comes across as a lazy retread of something that we've all seen several times before. With that said, I did feel that the film's saving grace is the acting of its main stars, who despite the mediocre lines they had to read, managed to keep it watchable during most of its weakest moments.Director Josh Boone, who also co-wrote the film's script, does a reasonable enough job keeping things going at a decent pace, dedicating most time to developing the characters and providing explanations as to why they are in this hospital to begin with. There are some nice interactions between these youths and it definitely felt believable that they could all become friends, in that they are united due to their mutant abilities and mutual PTSD. Unfortunately, Boone does struggle to properly build tension and implement action into the story. Scenes that were clearly intended to be frightening didn't feel as impactful as they should have been, sometimes bordering on laughable, and the action scenes were overloaded with CGI, to the point where they hardly looked natural. That's not to say previous X-Men films didn't have their fair share of superfluous CGI or scenes that failed to illicit the appropriate emotions, but they at least had a kind of balance between that and the character traits whereas this film does not. This bothered me as it felt like a missed opportunity to do something creative with the ways in which the mutants showcase their powers at the most important times instead of just being saved for the climax of the film.Each of the five main actors gave solid performances, with Blu Hunt and Maisie Williams being the standouts as Dani and Rahne, respectively. I enjoyed their interactions and friendly bond that the two of them had with each other and it was nice to see them work together whenever they needed to. Anya Taylor-Joy was also fun to watch as Illyana, even if her Russian accent was slightly inconsistent at times. However, the two male actors, Charlie Heaton and Henry Zaga, didn't receive the screen time that they deserved. Aside from some scenes involving their tragic pasts, they felt somewhat shafted aside to make room for the other three mutants' backstories, which is a shame because it would have been nice to have all five of them with an evenly distributed amount of importance in the story, and this could have made for a more exciting conclusion.In the end, even though it could have been a whole lot worse considering the frequent release delays and production troubles it has experienced, ""The New Mutants"" should still provide some fleeting enjoyment to hardcore fans of the X-Men series before new circumstances come into play. It neither takes away anything major from the lore it has created over the years but it doesn't add anything hugely important to the series canon either. At this point, one can only wonder what direction the franchise will go in as a result of the Disney-Fox merger. All of the potential is definitely there, so let's cross our fingers and hope for the best.I rate it 6/10",The New Mutants
81,chunkylefunga,Not worth the wait,4,7 November 2020,"I'm beginning to think this movie wasn't delayed four times for the reasons given but that they were trying to save a burning script.First 10 minutes are ok but by the 40th you begin to think when is this dragged out intro story going to stop and the movie actually going to start, and get good.Well it doesn't.It's a very sloppy storyline and something that the X-men comics covered in one issue. At most this should have been 30 minutes long.Miss in the X-Men universe.Not even the talented and upcoming star Anya Taylor-Joy could save this movie.",The New Mutants
82,CANpatbuck3664,X-Men Goes Out with a Whimper Instead of Reloading With a Bang,6,13 February 2021,"The New Mutants caught our eye with the decision to focus on the horror of having mutant powers and going with a smaller scale. It took forever to release because Disney didn't know what to do with it and now that we can watch the final product.... It was a good try? I liked the direction of the story and the potential that the idea had. But it was undercut with the rushed development of the characters (more on that later) and some spotty CGI. You could tell this didn't have the typical tentpole budget and when the ending comes around, they needed the creatures to work and the execution was mixed with some scenes looking convincing and other designs looking cheap.The New Mutants wants us to care about these characters and to invest in their relationships but we can't get attached because they blow by the setup. There just hasn't been enough time to develop a bond with Rahne or Illyana, so when they get in fights or rail against the establishment, it comes off as insincere or too trivial. The New Mutants just represents a missed opportunity. They go a new direction with this spinoff, there could have been something grow out of this flawed but interesting early effort, but when you're trying to world build, you can't skip a bunch of steps which is precisely what the New Mutants tries to do.With the rushed development of the characters, the actors/actresses in The New Mutants weren't done any favours. The majority of the cast glowers with angst 80% of the time and while that's helpful at getting the pressure the characters are under across, I can't point to any underrated or special performances. Maisie Williams, Henry Zaga and Alice Braga were fine, Charlie Heaton and Blu Hunt could have used more emotion. I'm not saying their bad actors, it was just hard to get interested in their characters' struggle. I will say that Anya Taylor-Joy did her own thing completely, while the other members of the cast are low key and and restrained, she's going for it. I wouldn't call it a powerhouse acting job but it did standout against the rest of the cast.As much as The New Mutants wasn't up to par, words like ""disaster"" and ""disgrace"" are a little hyperbolic. Its a mixed bag with some good ideas, but its clearly been mishandled. The New Mutants needed a stronger script and a stronger push from the studio. It didn't live up to the hype however and while it ended up being alright (for me I'd say it was on par with Apocalypse in retrospect, not terrible but also far from the franchise's best), would it have been better to keep it on the shelf or retool it (I guess there weren't any reshoots because of the delays in the release)? We'll never know. The New Mutants is worth a one time watch if you're curious but it does signal the need for a hard reboot for the X-Men and I don't think we'll be seeing more from our favourite mutants for a while to come.",The New Mutants

This has some frights to it as five teenage mutants are confined in a treatment facility to learn to control their powers. But something seems to be manifesting of a supernatural nature. Some tropes of teenage films is present and some requisite superhero tropes as well. Still, I enjoyed watching, it kept my attention, and I cared for the characters.",The New Mutants
85,elicopperman,Not as Bad as Initially Perceived,5,22 April 2021,"Last year during the brief revival of limited theaters during late summer, the controversial X-men movie New Mutants was released. Despite being made in 2017, the film was not completed until 2020 due to scheduling conflicts and the Disney Fox buyout merger. Unfortunately, when it did come out, it was poorly received by critics and it made very little money financially, thus prompting a potential franchise to squander as of late. So now that it's been a little while since the film's disastrous light of day, it's time to look at it with a fresh new pair of eyes and see how it holds up. The result itself is quite promising actually, albeit to an extent.Set in the X-men universe, the film follows teenage mutant Dani Moonstar, who is sent for treatment at a secret institution that means to cure her powers, along with four other teen mutants: Wolfsbane, Cannonball, Sunspot and Magik. Supervised by Dr. Cecilia Reyes to share their stories, each mutant's memories soon turn into terrifying realities based on their concerns about being held prisoner. From the start, this does seem like a pretty intriguing story to set up all of these fascinating characters, and to the film's credit, it does establish a lot about Dani's discovery of what her powers are supposed to be. Aided by a strong performance from newcomer Blu Hunt, Dani's lack of knowledge of her own true power and spiritual connection as a young indigenous woman are what make her the most sympathetic protagonist throughout the film's slow albeit short runtime. It also helps when the film gets really emotional by developing a very strong friendship between Dani and Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane), especially based on Rahne's insecurities with great power and feelings towards Dani.With that said, the one make or break deal for viewers coming into the movie blind is the familiarity with the X-men franchise and the admittedly generic plot. It's not hard to predict what might happen in a movie where a new girl is brought into an asylum and isn't treated too well at first by all of their peers, and if not for the movie being in the horror genre, this would not be too different from any other coming of age teen dramedy. As for the issue regarding the X-men movies, while I do think this movie works as a stand alone film without knowing about any of the previous X-men movies, the whole connection leading to why Dr. Reyes is even controlling the mutants might need a bit more backing up from previous movies, or even comics for that matter. It doesn't help that while Alice Braga does her best intimidating role as Reyes, the character herself feels severely underdeveloped and one would almost wish the movie would spend just a little more time on how she feels about the mutants overall, especially when a good chunk of them are either brats or emotionally scarred forever.On the plus side, while the movie does fall short in the substance department, it does have a very solix albeit dragged on climax which could lead to more interesting stories with these mutants later on. Sadly, those plans might not happen given the X-men being forged into the MCU (thanks Disney) and the film's poor financial performance, but one can certainly hope for future tales of teen discovery. As for other notable qualities, given that this is a lower budgeted superhero flick, the special effects are a bit more limited yet very cool to look at, almost as if director Josh Boone and the VFX crew really took advantage of the limitations to make the mutants' powers come off as believable as possible. Also, for a PG-13 horror movie, there are some genuinely messed up moments here and there that even startled myself, something that a lot of the more mature superhero movies don't quite do as often. It's really funny how this simple spinoff film managed to come off more sophisticated in its darkness than most mainstream Marvel fodder.So while it doesn't look like New Mutants will be successful enough to warrant anymore potential storylines, I don't think what we got turned out as bad as people made it out to be. For all of its faults, there was a lot of passion, heart and even dedication put into this movie that might have been more successful had it been released before the global pandemic. I'm sure people have gotten jaded with X-men movies at this point, but even if you're not a fan, I would at least recommend giving this film a watch. It might not be your cup of tea, but it's worth a viewing or two just to give more attention to unique coming of age superhero tales.",The New Mutants
86,rdoubleoc,Eh.,6,20 November 2020,"I don't want to say it's bad, but it's kind of boring at a lot of parts.With that said, it's very well directed and has very nice special effects. However, I just don't think the studios put that much effort into testing these movies to see if people actually want to watch them or not. Some movies without great special effects can still be more entertaining to watch than movies that have those things, but does hollywood really know what we want to see, and what keeps us in our seats? I'm starting to think no, even though they could just hire people and see if they like watching the movie or not (no?).This movie is just hard to watch because it's kind of boring, but you can tell a lot of work went into it.",The New Mutants
87,johannes2000-1,Thank God for the last 25 minutes!!,6,9 September 2020,"A movie about five new young mutants, who are discovering their powers and by lots of trial and error in the end learn to use them: you would think that this means a spectacular and high-paced movie filled with adrenaline and action. So it's almost a miracle that the makers succeeded in giving for more than an hour the exact opposite, filling it with endless recounting of all the sob-stories of the kid's various childhoods. I know that some background is needed, but this was way too much and became more and more boring.Everyone acts heavily depressed, and the only adult around behaves and talks like a sleepwalking zombie on valium. Add to this the uninspiring setting, the almost total lack of any humor and an almost insulting lack of logic. Like we are actually made to believe that 5 potentially dangerous and super-powered rebellious youngsters are kept prisoner and guarded in an enormous facility with just one single frail woman as their guard, who apparently has 24/7 duties and predictably falls asleep over her control panel at the most crucial moments! Why didn't the makers throw in some scary armed guards or ferocious watch-dogs to at least liven up the story a little?But just when I started to slowly slide off my chair into a welcome sleep, the last 25 minutes came up and I have to be honest: suddenly the action kicked-in, the pace was upgraded to the highest gear and together with great special effects and CGI at last we got where we had come for in the first place: a spectacular super-hero climax.Maisie Williams reasonably played a depressed teen, Charlie Heaton was equally adequate but I kept being distracted by the mid-west drawl they forced on his character. Blu Hunt did the best job, but she had the advantage that her part was the most important and interesting. A nice LGBT-touch by the way that her character and that of Williams got a crush on each other, very casually pictured, so kudos for that!",The New Mutants
88,trinaboice,Such a disappointment for Marvel fans,5,1 September 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Marvel really waivers with this one, despite bringing us some incredible films in recent years. This one is a mix of coming-of-age superheroes with horror. Directed and written by Josh Boone, this sci-fi thriller features young stars: Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton. Josh Boone is a big-time X-Men fan who owns a lot of their comics.It was going to be released way back in 2018, but due to re-shoots, corporate shuffling, and the pandemic, it finally hit streaming and some theaters this week. Inspired by the successes of recent horror films like It (2017) and Get Out (2017), the studio reworked the movie to make it scarier. The intention is that this will be the first in a horror trilogy.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lesbians kiss several times
Profanity
Some scary moments and creatures that could frighten young children, although older teens don't think it's scary enough to be categorized in the horror genre.
Some violence
Bullying
THEMES:
Confronting your personal fears
Teamwork
Finding your inner strength
Courage
Friendship
Control
We've heard that story about the good/evil bear before in a movie, but it was a wolf in the other version. It's a good lesson to remember.THINGS I LIKED:
I'm impressed with Anya Taylor-Joy who is such a versatile actress. I loved her in the newest version of Emma. (2020).
Because the movie is such a slow burn, you get to know the characters fairly well.
It definitely feels different than all other superhero movies. Audiences aren't certain if that's good or bad.
Some of the CGI is pretty good, although it's also noticeable bad at times.
A couple of lines made me laugh out loud. They were meant to be funny, but this is definitely not a light-hearted Marvel movie like Thor: Ragnarok or Guardians of the GalaxyTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The first scene starts with a bang but happens at night and is so dark that it will be extremely difficult to see what's happening when you watch it on a small device on streaming.
Some of the characters' accents faded in and out.
You learn about the cliched characters but you don't really like them or care much about them.
So much brooding teenage drama and angst.
It's very slow-moving. Some call that boring. The big battle doesn't happen until the very end of the film.
The dragon creature was awesome. What a shame we didn't get to see it in action until the last 10 minutes of the movie.
The screaming just sounded like actors screaming. There was something really inauthentic about it.
Pretty predictable.

The special effects look great and fit both in with the plot and some primal fears, but they are not particularly scary and the film lacks tension or suspense.

Unfortunately I was bitterly disappointed.There are just very few redeeming features. None of the characters were even remotely interesting. Their interactions all felt very insincere, forced, and inauthentic - a result of the tired and bland script. The performances were all mediocre or poor, aside from maybe Anya Taylor Joy.The exploration of the characters was very weak. It was all very surface level and not helped at all by the tight runtime.I also hated the look and feel of this film. It felt low budget in all the wrong ways. The set design and production looked drab, and when we did get down to action sequences the CGI was only just passable.A big big let down and the worst film of the X-Men franchise by a country mile.",The New Mutants

95,TwistedContent,A True Lackluster,5,27 December 2020,"After the prolonged reshoot and release hiatus, there was already a suffocating amount of expectations set, under which it was unlikely for ""The New Mutants"" to win many hearts and much money. Not the budget (67 million), not the reshoots, not the cast, not the myriad of cool posters could help the dullness that radiates from this lackluster adventure. Despite all, there was no prejudice, but the hope that there are enough redeeming qualities to make it enjoyable, though in the end the case of ""The New Mutants"" turned out a little sadder than that, it is a case of being painfully average.Around the time the first news came in about ""The New Mutants"", it was exciting, there were awesome casting announcements, it seemed to be a potentially dark, perhaps even R-rated new x-men lore movie. With each next news article, the excitement slowly died off, mostly because such reshoots and delays never mean anything good. Reading the trivia, I'm willing to believe that Josh Boone is not the force that made ""The New Mutants"" lesser than it could've been.Five young mutants, Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt), Sam Guthrie (Charlie Heaton), Ilyana Rasputin (Anya Taylor-Joy), Rahne Sinclair (Maissie Williams) & Roberto Da Costa (Henry Zaga), are just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will by Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga), fighting to escape their past sins and save themselves. Through the movie's simplistic structure, we learn each mutant's story & trauma in a very episodical, linear way, lacking depth and excitement. They interact, get acquainted, tell their stories, and so the situations repeat till the third act, which is the most underwhelming of them all. The main villain is not so much Dr. Reyes, as just a big cgi mutant bear that pops out in the last ten minutes. To be more precise and more polite, the villain is one's fears. Fears must be conquered for one to feel like a sane and assured human being. Old morale ain't the problem, it's how much is tried to be replaced with just a plain morale, that's the problem.Overall, the plot truly is reminiscent of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"", except the 80's piece was more fun. More scary. More lively. So not only the characters are underdeveloped and cliché, the story is familiar and eventually unsatisfying as well. What is lost like that, could be made up to some extent by good action, effective imagery and aesthetical means, but ""The New Mutants"" also disappoints in those fields. Perhaps I was wrong in thinking of ""The New Mutants"" as a blockbuster before, because it hardly is one. The action merely shows its spurs in about the first 70 minutes, and the sum of it all provides no edge-of-the-seat moments and very little amazement-inducing flair. Having said that, the film is well shot and good-looking, though for a 67-million-dollar-picture it is not much of a substantial compliment.The case of ""The New Mutants"" is also mildy frustrating, because a lot of resources and talent seem to be wasted on lackluster, dull, archaic and largely ineffective piece of big screen cinema. It's passable to view, and also passable not to. My rating: 5/10",The New Mutants

99,Puroo,The VFX editor's back must be hurting from carrying the entire movie,6,9 October 2021,"I had heard of The New Mutants a lot, and seeing how awesome it looked I thought I should really give it a try. On top of that it was even going to be a horror movie so a superhero-horror could be a fantastic combination (Unbreakable Trilogy, Brightburn - it always works for me). And now that I have just seen it, I feel betrayed to levels I cannot even comprehend. The above average rating that I'm giving this movie is only for the awesome visual effects. The CGI is very well done and the colour grading is on point. But that's pretty much it.The New Mutants is not even one and a half hours long. Normally I would have complained about it since I hate it when movies charge five hundred rupees and don't entertain us for even two hours, but since it was released digitally in the middle of a pandemic I will allow it, since it means I get more time to watch something else. However, this movie even lacks a plot. Not a cohesive plot or a good plot, but a plot itself. The only thing we get in the runtime is the exposition, kissing scenes, teenagers partying and occasionally back stories. In most of the scenes I would start laughing because of how badly the scenes were done.The acting is done very badly, especially by Dani, which is ironic considering she's the main character. Her only personality is that she is a Native American. Her backstory concerns that, her being bullied concerns that, her character development concerns that, and heck, the opening and closing speeches also concern that! The score is also very, very bad. There are so many 'scary' scenes in this movie which could have legit scared me if the background music and camera angles were better. And this movie had so many subplots which were never talked about. I guess there was supposed to be a sequel to this where this would have been talked about more, too bad.If you just remove the VFX this movie would become the worst in the X-Men franchise. One thing I really like about X-Men movies is that it can never be completely bad. I'd put this movie above at least Dark Phoenix and The Last Stand because of how good it looks. I read some reviews here and found out this movie had a lot of studio meddling, so I'd give it a benefit of doubt. Probably it could have been something better, but we will never know.",The New Mutants

Director: Josh Boone
Starring: Anya Taylor Joy, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, Alice Braga, Blu Hunt, Henry Zaga etcOverall rating 52/100New mutants is about a group of teenagers who have just recently discovered they have superhuman powers, they are situated at a facility that supposedly specialises in them controlling their powers ready for the world, but everything is not as it seems. New mutants for me was frustratingly average, it had it's enjoyable moments and heaps of potential but never really lived up to it's interesting premise. Let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the movie did have an interesting concept, fascinating cinematography, good use of powers and character background. The whole concept of fresh coming of age teenagers causing them to have mutants powers and the whole facility idea was interesting to me and felt like a fresh spin on an x men movie, which I appreciated and largely delivered something different in terms of what you would expect from an x men movie. I also thought the films cinematography was very good, there was some beautiful and interesting shots and use of colour in this film that stood out from other superhero movies and made the film feel different which was great. I also thought the movies use of powers for the characters was great. Every single character had completely different and interesting characters that was explored well and each character got to show them off a fair amount, so the movie definitely delivered in this aspect. The movie also had good character background for all the characters, the movie did a good job at spending an equal amount of time with the background of each character, this was good because it developed the plot well, made you understand and connect with the characters a lot more and was definitely one of the better aspects of the movie.My first few negatives would be the rushed beginning, how generic it was, and the bad script. I thought that the movie at the beginning did not have enough background or explanation into the plot before just going straight into the facility, this felt sloppy and poorly edited to me and limited the plot. The movie was also fairly generic, all of the characters powers and backgrounds have been seen before in previous superhero movies and the movie didn't try to be anything different which was such a shame. The script was also very poor, the dialogue between all the characters was very corny and generic. And it just felt like multiple different drafts moulded into one making the movie feel very messy.My next few positives would be the likeable characters, chemistry between them and the performances. I thought all the characters here were incredibly likeable in their own ways, they all had their own distinct and unique personalities that shone throughout the movie, and they were all very fun to watch whenever they were on screen. I also thought the chemistry between the characters was great, I loved a lot of the relationships and friendships in the movie and they gave them enough screen time during the movie for them to feel well earnt and enjoyable. The performances here were also pretty good, everybody did a good job here, but my key standouts would be Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor Joy. Both had such a likeable charm and were a joy to watch, they popped the most and were the most fun to watch on screen, Especially Anya who fitted this type of sassy character very well.My final two positives would be the horror elements and the final act. When the movie actually did go into the horror genre ( more on that later) it was pretty good. I thought some of the creature designs and horror imagery were actually pretty scary and well done, making the film more edgy and made me on edge when they were actually on screen, I wish the horror elements were used more but for the most part when they were shown it was done well. The final act was also one of the best parts of the movie, they finally merged the action and horror elements of the movie pretty well for a fun and entertaining final act that redeems the movie slightly.My final negatives that really bought the movie down for me would be how predictable it was, the dull plot and the tonal imbalances of the movie. New mutants was painfully predictable which was such a shame. The characters and their actions were predictable. And the supposed big plot twist with the main character I figured out way before it was revealed, and it was so obvious when the characters acted shocked when it came to light I felt like shouting at the movie. I also felt like a large portion of the plot was fairly dull, it was just a mixture of the limited setting, repetitive plot points and the fact there just wasn't really a lot going on in the movie, but I Often sadly found myself getting bored or losing interest. My final negative with the movie and my biggest issue with New mutants has to be it's tonal imbalances. It didn't have enough horror elements to be considered a horror, and not enough action to be considered an action movie. So New mutants found itself stuck in the middle and playing it safe, not actually having enough of anything to please either of these two genre fans.Overall, despite a promising idea, great characters and being aesthetically pleasing. New mutants is very sadly a generic, corny and messy movie, that doesn't commit to either one of it's intended genres making itself stuck in a rut that it cant get out of.",The New Mutants

102,deepfrieddodo,Major Disappointment,4,12 June 2021,"There is a lot of surrounding story about The New Mutants about heavy reshoots, making the film more/less of a horror, and cutting out major characters due to budget restraints. The ultimate outcome is a really poor film. The concept of a Marvel horror film is brilliant, this was terribly executed. It is not scary in the slightest, its not a thriller either because at no point are you on the edge of your seat. To be fair it does keep you interested until the very end, but only because you're constantly wondering what on earth is going on.I don't know what the reshoots were, but there are major plot holes throughout, nothing is explained whatsoever. At one point it does hint to a link with the wider X-Men universe, and then goes absolutely nowhere with it. For an audience who doesn't follow these characters in the comics, none of this would make any sense, and you can't just expect to throw together a load of lesser known character, give vague scenes relating to their backstory, and then expect everyone to follow along.Acting was fine, the cast can't be faulted, but it does seem a waste to take some of the bigger names of young actors and waste them on this. The story was poor, and the roster was poor. All this did was show how some characters don't translate well from comic to cinema. Particularly throwing this bunch together - at least have some very vague connection, rather than dipping into every conceivable genre.If they pushed this film back so many times, how bad were the prior versions that this was the one they settled on? Completely ignoring everything on screen, there probably could have been a good film made out of this. This was not it.",The New Mutants
103,movieman6-413-929510,"Despite all the postponement and adjustment, it is still a messy movie.",4,3 September 2020,"The New Mutants is a new horror action movie in the X-Men movie series. The film is directed and written in part by Josh Boone, the director of The Fault in Our Stars and Stuck in Love.In the film, Danielle Moonstar (Blu Hunt) wakes up in an isolated hospital. She is stuck here with a group of young mutants, who are being investigated what their powers are and how they can keep them under control. When the mutants discover why they are really stuck in the hospital, they must learn to work together and trust each other to escape the hospital.This movie was originally scheduled to hit theaters on April 13, 2018, but this has been delayed to work on improvements. When the Walt Disney film studio took over the Fox film studio, the release of the film was delayed again. Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the outcome date from the beginning of this year was again postponed to the beginning of September.Because of all these postponements and adjustments of the film, the final film has become more messy, which unfortunately is reflected in the film. The mysteries of the hospital and the mysterious things that happen here also quickly become predictable, which only makes the film more long-winded. Director Josh Boone has experience with the teen drama aspect thanks to his other directed films. With this film he tried for the first time to work on a horror aspect, which unfortunately did not go so well.The effects in the film are often not credible. If the mutants use their special powers, you can see that this has been visualized with CGI or a green screen. It almost seems as if because of all the postponements and changes to the film she wanted to devote less and less interest to the film.The acting is done nicely by the cast, but most of the cast have done better acting in their other films. Most of the cast such as Blu Hunt, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton and Henry Zaga are also more TV actors, which is reflected in some of the film. The best acting is provided by Anya Taylor-Joy, who also has more experience as a film actress.",The New Mutants
104,themadmovieman,"Not a disaster, but loses its best ideas in the mess of the reshoots and change of ownership",7,31 August 2020,"Delayed so many times over the last three years that it seemed more likely that hell would freeze over before I saw this film, The New Mutants has become a hotly-anticipated and mysterious prospect. After all that waiting, though, I can't say that the movie lives up to its potential.A messy and unfortunately drab watch, the film struggles to inspire the imagination with its spin-off of the X-Men stories. Lacking atmosphere, tension and character depth, it's a pretty mediocre movie that, while not a total disaster, clearly isn't able to use its brightest ideas to the full.And that's where I want to start, because although The New Mutants is hardly a masterpiece, the effects of its many reshoots and production issues is wholly apparent throughout. As a result, its faults can't be entirely attributed to director Josh Boone, because there's a definite clash between a darker, more cerebral story from Boone and something a little more generic from the film's new owners, Disney.These sorts of issues are inevitable under such circumstances, and it really bears out as the film briefly introduces really interesting ideas surrounding the history of the facility the story takes place in, but then just drops them in favour of a generic action finale - reminiscent of the struggles of the infamous Fant4stic.Saying that, however, there are major problems with this movie all the way through. Above all, it's a really drab, dull watch that does little to use the potential of its setting to tell a unique superhero story.With a small cast in a contained setting, The New Mutants has all the potential to work as a hybrid haunted house/comic book movie, yet it lacks any sort of fear factor, tension or atmosphere to really put that into effect. Meanwhile, the film is frustratingly content with using an overtly grey colour palette to make things look moody, yet without really doing enough to bring a genuine sense of eeriness or claustrophobia into play.Failing that, The New Mutants also had the potential to work as a coming-of-age take on the superhero genre. Following young mutants discovering their powers and how to control them, the film's central themes fit perfectly with the genre, but the screenplay is nowhere near layered enough to make that drama at all interesting.All of the characters are painfully one-dimensional; each a stereotype among the wider group in a vain attempt to play off the legacy of The Breakfast Club. As a result, there's little reason to actually invest emotion into connecting with the characters, because there isn't much to uncover beneath the surface.And because of that, the film's story, action and main villain are all far less effective than could have otherwise been the case. Linking into each of the characters' back stories and deepest fears, there should have been far more focus placed on the emotions of the main characters.But with no way to form a genuine connection with anyone on screen, The New Mutants falls flat throughout, and the final act in particular lacks any genuine intensity or excitement, unfolding as a painfully drab and generic action climax with nothing to really grab your attention.Overall, I was disappointed by The New Mutants. Though it isn't a total disaster, it has all the hallmarks of a film that has been wrangled back and forth between different owners with different sets of ideas. It's messy, dull and unfortunately drab throughout, missing the opportunity to develop its best ideas as it plumps for a more generic, one-dimensional action story.",The New Mutants
105,bangel3322,Don't get the hate,7,15 January 2021,"I actually enjoyed this film.
Not sure why it's hated so much. Maybe it's a Marvel fan thing that I don't get, as I don't really watch superhero stuff. I guess this is a bit more like a horror film so maybe that's why I like it.
Decent acting, especially from Anya Taylor-Joy, and very good storyline. Of course there's always room for improvement. I would have liked a bit more background info, but it was still good.",The New Mutants

108,darkreignn,A refreshingly fun take on a tired genre,9,29 August 2020,"""The New Mutants"" was a film that I was worried I would never see. After the absolutely stellar first trailer released in pre-COVID 2018, the movie got stuck in development hell for two years. With rumors of reshoots and re-edits plaguing the Internet, and especially with Disney acquired 21st Century Fox, most were convinced that ""The New Mutants"" would never see the light of day. Enter 2020: ""The New Mutants"" was finally given its well-deserved theatrical release in August of this year, three years after filming wrapped in 2017. And after years of pushbacks and delays, the one question on everyone's mind is: ""Is the movie any good?"" In my opinion, the answer is a resounding yes.I absolutely adored this movie. Granted, I do have an affinity for ""Breakfast Club"" style films, and as this movie has been described as ""a haunted-house movie with a bunch of hormonal teenagers,"" what you expect is pretty much what you get. And for me, that was a good thing. There has never been a superhero movie quite like this before; in fact, I'd even hesitate to describe ""The New Mutants"" as a superhero film. Gone are the bombastic and high-stakes end of the world battles. Instead, the movie takes a refreshingly small-scale approach, taking place virtually in one entire location and foregoing all preconceived notions that the audience may expect while watching an X-Men film.While there are stakes, the stakes are more personal, and thus, more emotionally resonant. Because the film intimately follows the five main characters, by the time the action starts you already feel connected with them and know why they're fighting and who they're fighting for. And the action itself is thrilling. While this isn't necessarily an action movie, when there is combat it is slick and well-filmed, and surprisingly, bloody. ""The New Mutants"" is pretty intense for a PG-13 film. Complete with people's faces getting ripped to shreds and terrifying imagery that depicts the PTSD of childhood abuse, this movie goes to great lengths to differentiate itself from other genre films.Let's talk horror: While the movie has been marketed as a horror film, the horror elements are more implicit than they are explicit. And here, it worked. When the horror hits, it hits hard. There is disturbing imagery and disgusting elements that are teased, proving once again that some things are more frightening in imagination than they would have been if they were fully explained. I would of course have liked to see more horror sequences, but the ones we got were creepy enough to satisfy me, as a horror fan. But then again, a major element that helped these sequences work was the characters.I loved every character in this film. While I do think this movie could have, and should have, been longer to deepen the characterization, what we do get of these characters leaves you wanting much more after the end credits roll, which is a good sign in my book. The cast does a phenomenal job with what they have. Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Heaton, and Maisie Williams stand out to me as the highlights of this movie; they were truly incredible and I was riveted every time they were on screen, which is thankfully, a lot of the time. Also, Maisie's romance that is built up with Blu Hunt's character is extremely sweet and does not at all feel like pandering or checking a diversity box. But like I said, this movie is so short that it really feels like a lot of character development scenes were left on the cutting room floor. I wanted much more of Charlie Heaton's character, who just oozed pain and personality throughout. Similarly, I wished that Maisie and Blu's romance was built up just a little bit more; I think this would've done wonders in helping the audience become even more emotionally invested.Josh Boone did a fantastic job with his direction. The romance is filmed beautifully, the action clearly, the horror frighteningly, and just in general, this is a gorgeous movie to look at. You can tell he has a passion for this material, and that passion definitely carried over to the cast because, like I said, everyone was doing a fantastic job. Now, this movie isn't perfect. There are some cringy lines of dialogue, some wonky edits, and, while I understood what they were going for in the last act, I really wish it would have continued the small-scale story that the first two acts were building. Regardless, none of that took away my enjoyment of this movie as a whole. ""The New Mutants"" was such a fun time at the movies, and I can't wait to watch it again.",The New Mutants
109,chubarova,Ordinary,7,6 December 2020,"I can't say thst this film is bad, but it hasn't got any amazing or mind-blowing moment. Firstly, the plot is very simple and predictable. Secondly, the cast is great but they haven't any chance to show their play in 100%. Thirdly, the visual effects and action is ordinary, the bear is nit scary at all.
So, it is very usual film.",The New Mutants
110,TheVictoriousV,The little X-Men movie that could. But should it?,3,28 August 2020,"New Mutants is the film God forbade. Its theatrical release postponed again and again since 2017, the latest instance having to do with the Coronavirus outbreak, New Mutants is almost as cursed as Gilliam's The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, albeit with the worst stuff seemingly taking place after its completion - or ""initial"" completion.Yet again, I can't very well tell you where in the X-Men semi-canon this film fits. I'm going to assume it takes place after Logan and thus in the Altered Timeline, even if this weakens the perfect closure that Logan was. I don't think it takes place in the past, i.e. in the X-Men Apocalypse era, but it does follow up on that film's post-credit stinger, which teased the experiments of the grim mutant Mister Sinister. Much like Logan, however, The New Mutants ultimately neglects the final major X-Men villain to not have been in the movies (apparently reshoots are to blame for this, and the delayed release, which is never a good sign).I know these things don't matter, especially not with The New Mutants, the first film in the X-Men franchise to fall under ""horror"". Ergo, much like the tongue-in-cheek Deadpool, it doesn't necessarily need to fit; 'tis of a different genre altogether. But again, reshoots and various extra delays were unkind to this one and I'd have just shelved it if I were Josh Boone.The movie stars Blu Hunt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, and Harry Zaga as a group of angsty tween mutants who believe they've been assembled to join the X-Men, but soon learn something sinister (tee-hee) about their caretaker (Alica Braga). These superpowered kids are fairly diverse, but indecisive on which accents to use. We also get some goofy-looking additional creatures and a cameo from Marylin Manson, just so you know this is edgier than usual.One must wonder, were there still devotees who sincerely looked forward to this mess? I know DC fanboys will stop at nothing to convince themselves even the most fundamentally inept piece of cinema is superior to Avengers: Endgame, and I do recall people who insisted that Dark Phoenix, despite how obvious its sloppiness was even at a glance, was the adults' option to the Avengers finale last spring (maybe throw in an ebarassingly blatant Christian symbol and I'll be convinced of its depth).As for New Mutants, however, things seemed pretty clear from the get-go. This was pretty dang bad, and although we shouldn't treat the Rotten Tomatoes number like the final word, audiences as well as critics seemed to loathe this movie.""It doesn't really work as an angsty romance, misses the mark as a horror movie and never for a minute feels like a superhero flick"", said one Rotten Tomatoes blurb. ""It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where Josh Boone goes wrong, because there are just so many options to choose from"", reads another.This isn't much but it's what you'll have to go on right now. As it turns out, several publications have apparently ""refused"" to review this film, due to Disney's inability to realize the benefits of streaming over theatre-going, especially during a global pandemic that makes critics' screenings (or any sort of screening) a really bad idea. I suppose we shouldn't worry too much about what critics and audiences have to say about this particular movie. Let the fact that fate itself hates this film be enough.",The New Mutants

112,carlos37andre,I'm really surprised,7,5 January 2021,"If you are reading this, I think is fair to assume you know the drama this movie was surrounded by. I believe it was delayed for what felt like eternity. I remember some of the cast members came to the 2017 CCXP (the Brazilian Comic-Con), with some exclusive footage and stuff, and it ended up been delayed a hundred times, to finally come out in August of 2020 (almost 3 years after!!!), in the middle of a pandemic. Still, I'm mentioning all that, in order to contextualize, why I was truly surprised that this movie doesn't suck. I was expecting a mess, Fantastic Four level or maybe worst. Otherwise, why would they delay it for that long? Well... who knows.The point is, the movie is actually just fine, it doesn't feel like there was that much stuff taken out, or anything new that doesn't fit with the rest. Idk, maybe is just that I went with the lowest of expectations, but I thought it was really decent.The acting is pretty good (besides some accents changing at some points of the movie I thought), I like pretty much everyone here Maisie Williams and Charlie Heaton are just fine, and I loved them in their specific famous TV shows. Anya Taylor-Joy is doing ok too, even tho her character is just a jerk for most of the movie. Blu Hunt, who is basically the protagonist of the film (I truly didn't know that coming in), is also great, she does an awesome job. Alongside with Alice Braga and Henry Zaga, who I also hadn't seen in anything before, but are pretty good too.I was surprised about the plot too, I was expecting a world level threat with the big blue lighting at the end, and... I was glad the movie is really concise, and specific, dealing with a very small issue, but that fits with everything that's set up since the beginning.Some stuff I thought they could have done better, like the whole Illyana plot, she is a jerk for most of it, and... ok, we learned the trauma she had, but we never really understand why she is so mean to Dani, and also the quick change between ""I will kill you"" and ""well I guess I'm telling my tragic story now"" is at best ""rushed"" lol. Some of the scenes, like the thing with the lie detector or even the ending sequence with the bear-dream-monster-stuff do not feel that smooth, but I like how they introduce the nightmares, and the whole thing start to escalate. And I also like most of the scene between the group, and besides Illyana (and Roberto in the beginning, cause... he's such a jerk in the first scene for no reason, omg), their relationship feels pretty natural, and you buy the connection, they have great chemistry.I love that the film has quietly a pretty diverse cast, and has maybe the first gay kiss in a super hero movie? (From Marvel or DC, at least) which is pretty cool! Also, been a Brazilian, I loved that we got to see our great Sunspot on screen lol! None of those things make the movie worst or better btw, just pointing out that I thought was a nice ""plus"" if that makes sense.Anyways, to sum up, I think New Mutants is actually pretty decent, it's a short movie, and it feels pretty quick, but I liked that about it. It has a simple story, that, in a way breaks somewhat of a barrier for Marvel/DC movies, for been at least the closest to a horror they got so far (I wouldn't call it a horror per say, but still, it's more than any other movie based on a Marvel character), I like that they went on a different route, and explored a fascinating part about mutants, that we just had glimpses off so far in the movies, but was never explored this deeply. It isn't perfect, and some of the character development mostly, could have been done a bit better, with some of the motivation of the characters been more explored (and also the Big Bear power at the end), and you could also feel that story goes in a pretty familiar/predictable path, but I thought that the environment of it all, the horror elements, and the talent on screen, made me not care about that as much, and I was able to enjoy it. Overall, I would say this average here it's a overreact, and I can't really get why it's this low. Pretty good!",The New Mutants
113,trokanmariel-17760,The American quest of Amityville 2 vs the peace of The New Mutants vs the literary agent aristocracy of X-Men 2000,10,4 September 2021,"In watching Amityville 2: The Possession, I arrived at a point in thinking, that in order for a System to be at work, in which a real life demon was going through the Hollywood industry - alas, as a choice of perception - that a person or entity from the future was controlling the apparatus, of the movie Amityville 2.Never mind the hypothetical demon, in the movie and at large in Hollywood; this entity or 4th wall master was the ghost of christ-mass past.There are films, and there are ghost-films: the ghost-film means what you perceive to be the film, in your own imagination, at some point after you've watched the film (or, it can exist as well as you watch the film).In a different review, of The New Mutants, which I've written on a different site, I discuss morality protecting its antithesis, and not just itself, in terms of how The New Mutants behaves (this is Return of the Jedi territory). The peace of the story has to support the story's finity (the finity being the enemy, because of the story's obvious fact of infinity being real).Unaided by deception, The New Mutants is the feat of 2 against 3 - 3 representing the triangle of hierarchy, the 2 being the ghost and peace.Meta-wise, Amityville 2 is the story of Americanism's quest to have the rest of the world invade it and discover it and yield its mystical power.With the Darth Maul reference, in Amityville 3, correlating Susan Baxter's grabbing a red (red being the colour of the UK) frisbee with the nature of the Amityville window, an angular obsession, the meta of the Amityville story is pitting angles against peace - just like in The New Mutants (except The New Mutants doesn't have the grand meta quest story, as an aftermath to the warrior leader dimension).2 against 3 twice, only, it's only in the one instance of the two that the 3 is a mirror of the 2, and thus, can beat the 2 down silly.The New Mutants:
the moral story, of 2 not letting its handicapped opponent defeat it. Don't get me wrong. Amityville 2 is one of the greatest movies ever made, but, if demoting Amityville 2 is the price of uplifting The New Mutants, I'll happily pay that price.For all time, James Marsden's Scott Summers is my Romeo, and it isn't lost on me, that in The New Mutants, one of the subtexts of the story is the luck that Logan had found, in the original X-Men (speaking of which: the literary agent aristocracy, spoke of in the review for X-Men is a fitting 3rd challenger, to the dual between The New Mutants and Amityville 2), with Summers, Munroe and Jean Grey all being adults - a truly awesome and grand subtext.",The New Mutants

Hating on The New Mutants is like stepping over a dollar bill while searching the grass for a lost nickel.Viewed without preconceptions, The New Mutants is dark, atmospheric, exciting and emotionally satisfying movie. It's got vivid characters and a story with more than enough twists and turns. The confined locale only adds to the fun.Better yet, The New Mutants offers a genuinely fresh take on the endless 'mutant superhero' trope. The super-hero genre is getting extremely stale: the super-powers keep getting more powerful, and the CG effects more cosmic. So it's refreshing to see a more personal film, like this one, that keeps to a more human scale.

I also really enjoy the basic premise and, although ultimately a small failure, I also enjoyed the attempt for a slightly darker more horror feel.So, the good:
Anya Taylor-Joy! It is such a joy to watch this young woman in anything. She is brilliant actress and she is the shining star of this movie too. The rest of the cast, with a couple of exception, is also excellent in their roles.I also love the pacing. There is no Wham! Slam! Kaboom! every 5 seconds as is the norm with most superhero movies.
The general story and storytelling is also very good. We get to know the characters really well and since the telling of the story take its time we have a nice good entertaining story to watch. Also big extra plus for showing a Buffy episode in the background in one scene.
As mention I also enjoyed what they tried to do. Mostly they did a great job, but it didn't really land. Which leads me to:The bad:
The horror aspect and slightly darker feel do not really work 100%. Mainly because its very cliche. Evil corporation? Well, never seen that before... And testing going with an evil doctor is so cliche that its basically a bore. Especially since the doctor lady is also the weakest actor of the movie.
The movie is also very short. Feels like they should have made the story last a lot longer. And my final small complaint is that the CGi is not always on point. Sure the computer graphics are a million times better than anything the DC gang spits out, but for Marvel and superhero movies not so great.Overall though this is a good movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I give it a 7/10, a strong 7. Magic is the star and a great character, but I hope we see a lot more of these folk in the future. Definitely a lot that can done with this team.

The girl who played Dani was mediocre, Charlie Heaton's accent was forced to say the least, and Anya-Taylor Joy's accent veered from Russian-ish to South American/Hispanic. The makeup and visual effects were on a Halloween store and PlayStation 3 level, leaving a lot to be desired. I found it hard to be captivated at times because of how jarring some of it looked.

120,lyubitelfilmov,Kids in a Cage or Medium Lousy LGBT fiction,4,6 September 2020,"Fantastic. I admit that I was not going to watch this picture, well, not a bit, but the opening of cinemas made me change my mind and go to the hall, where many of the same color but cozy chairs are waiting for you, which missed the viewer. After all, in the end, after all, no one has yet canceled the romance of the cinema, and then the question arose - what to go for, because the choice was frankly small. I went to this particular picture, waited for the average dullness of fantasy in a familiar universe with good special effects - and saw a fig teen movie with obvious thoughts and a bunch of nonsense, seasoned with good graphics. In short, I was disappointed. And here's my brief opinion - Children in a cage. But before we turn to the shortcomings of this picture, consider its few advantages, which your humble servant highlighted.
So, the advantages:
1. Maisie Williams - our famous Arya Stark from the famous TV series plays one of the main roles here, and plays really well. Macy is not Sophie Turner, who walks around with Sansa Stark in any picture. Here Macy's heroine is different from her famous image. Of course, she does not always show emotions, but the heroine makes a good impression and she would be the best if it were not for one thing that ruined the whole picture and the heroine of Macy. But, if you close your eyes to it (don't try, fail), then you can live with it, but I won't accept it. I did not expect this from her heroine. It was like a knife to the heart, because Macy here was almost the only bright moment that they decided to spoil, at least a little.
2. Music - good music sounds in the picture, with motives of American Indians, which is very logical, and it was pleasant to listen to it, the only pity is that it is rather small, and it is not perceived separately from the picture.
This is where the praise ends, and the spread begins.
So the disadvantages:
1. The script - you know, but it had good potential. Think about it: a group of adolescent adolescents with supernormal abilities are in some kind of institution where they are looked after and taught to control their strength, and here a new one arrives to them, who joins this team and gradually they all begin to understand that something is wrong, maybe are they being deceived? Why does it work like this? Is there no other reason here? Instead of realizing its potential, even taking into account a rather cheerful start, the picture does not go further than revealing the usual problems of teenagers of raging puberty, revealing obvious thoughts, and of the final fight that ends like a child, despite the rating of 16+. To say that it disappointed me is to say nothing!
2. ""What's going on here?"" - believe me, you will ask yourself this question constantly while watching, because nothing is ever clear. I do not understand why the creators could not clearly describe the universe, the principle of operation of this institution in an hour and a half picture. Instead, the viewer is fed the everyday life of teenagers who do not like it here, because they want ""freedom"".
3. Logical holes - oh, damn it, there are so many of them that I have a great desire to make a review on this picture with a complete blowing of all its contents, but it will take so much time, the lion's share of which will be spent on reading comics, and I hate reading comics, and I consider it fun for children and nothing else, and that's the only reason I won't do it, because the psyche is still useful to me. Therefore, while watching, I had to mentally beat my head against the wall from the stupidity and delirium of what was happening, because if I did something like that right in the hall, I would simply be taken out of it, and then they would cause a ""fool"", and I would did not write my review now. Just get ready for an overwhelming amount of gibberish. Just think, the writers managed to make logical mistakes in the picture, where all the action takes place in one building! One building Karl!
4. Lesbians - well, since we have no gays, there will be lesbians. I was sincerely surprised that there is not a single black man in the picture, but there are lesbians, and this is disgusting. And worst of all, one of them was Macy. Well, why? It's disgusting, ugly, disgusting. It was physically painful to watch these scenes and I had to cover my face with my hand from the abomination of what was happening.
And why did they write ""horrors"" in the genre of this picture, because there is not a single scary moment. Yes, and this picture can not be called a thriller, because the atmosphere here is clearly not worn out.
A little about the main characters:
1. Daniella Moonstar performed by Blue Hunt - a girl from an Indian reservation with an unknown superpower, who got into this institution, where she has to figure out herself and find friends. I didn't expect any particularly outstanding acting from Blue - and it did. As the saying goes - it will do for rural areas.
2. Rain Sinclair performed by Maisie Williams is a religious girl, capable of, well, you will see for yourself. Behaves like a real friend to Danielle. If it were not for the propaganda of the LGBT heroine, Macy would have been the best hero of the picture.
3. Ulyana Rasputin performed by Ani Taylor-Joy - mmm, Russian flavor in American cinema, and even without cranberries, I don't believe, pinch me. Hey! And it's true. And although the girl behaves like an average , she still arouses interest, and the actress matches the heroine, you can't argue with that.
I sincerely wish this picture a box office failure, because from a fairly large budget (sixty-seven million), at the moment the picture managed to collect a little more than thirteen. In any century, I at least somewhat agree with the critics who smashed this picture, because under the guise of an interesting idea with good potential, we got an average lousy picture with an obvious and easily guessed scenario, a bunch of logical holes and LGBT propaganda. Cash failure and oblivion! This time, even theatrical romance did not save the day.
As a result, we have bad fiction about teenagers with abilities in the known universe, with a bad and boring script, an obvious thought, a children's final fight and a bunch of logical delirium, even spoiled the heroine of Maisie Williams.
Honestly, look at something else, don't waste your time on this picture!",The New Mutants

A completely new and different story of mutants that follows the first two series of X-Men movies, where after the old mutants, a few appear from time to time who gradually discover their powers. In this film the story is based entirely on 6 people, the 5 young people and the doctor. It has nothing to do with previous movies. Although in the strong elements it has good effects and goes in a dark style / thriller, which could lead to a nice horror movie (especially with the crooked man-like eyeless figures the tall with creepy long teeth and fingers) unfortunately it does not give so much weight to everyone's strengths but it gets boring of trying to delve very slowly into everyone's character and story. It had the potential to become a pretty nice independent fantasy / action / horror film.Nevertheless, it did not manage to far exceed the average.6/10 from me for what it gives, although with improvements / corrections / additions it could reach 7/10 as an idea and story.

131,hunter-friesen,"""New Mutants"" offers nothing new",4,2 September 2020,"Fimed way back in the bygone time of 2017, ""The New Mutants"" - the newest entry into the now-scrapped X-Men Cinematic Universe - has had its fair share of trouble getting to theaters. Originally set for release in April 2018, the movie has had a record of seven date changes, making it a running joke that it would never see the light of day. Defying the naysayers, ""The New Mutants"" has finally hit theaters right in the middle of a pandemic.Set in a remote research facility, ""The New Mutants"" follows five teenagers as they discover their newfound powers. The stern Dr. Reyes looks after the young mutants and tries to help them control their raw powers. We follow the newest member of the group, Danielle Moonstar, who was placed there after a mysterious natural disaster wiped out her entire reservation. After some time, the five realize that there's more behind this facility than meets the eye. To save themselves and right the wrongs of the past, the group must work together to harness their powers and become something bigger than themselves.""The New Mutants"" is directed by Josh Boone, who last made a critical and commercial splash with his adaptation of ""The Fault in Our Stars"".Billed as an action/horror/drama, ""The New Mutants"" fails on all three of those genre levels. Thanks to Boone's inability to grasp onto his material, the various tones of the movie go together like oil & water rather than peanut butter & jelly.The action is sparse throughout the first 80 minutes, only showing us glimpses of each person's unique power. The final 15 minutes end on an action set piece that unleashes all that the movie has been building up, which isn't much. The intentionally dark and snowy setting acts as a smokescreen to cover up the poor digital effects and blocking.Fairing even worse than the action is the horror element. It's been reported that the studio demanded reshoots to add more horror after the mega-success of ""IT"". Neutered by a PG-13 rating, the scares in this movie are comparable to the ones found in a January dumpster movie aimed solely at young teenagers. For nearly the entire runtime, we're subjected to a rinse repeat cycle of jump scares and sound blasts that only mildly startle us, but never come close to scaring. Even the main villains - gangly creatures dressed in tuxedos that look almost too similar to Slenderman - come across more laughable than creepy.But even the failings in the action and horror department don't come close to the movie's biggest crime, which is how boring it is. For being set in a superhero universe, very little of this movie is connected to the larger world. Except for a few name drops and the fact that our main characters are called mutants, this could have been set in any other YA universe and it wouldn't have made a difference.The uninteresting plot offers few biting questions to chew on. If you have even an inkling of knowledge about the X-Men Universe, then these questions will be a breeze to answer. But, immediately knowing these answers is a double-edged sword as you now have to impatiently wait an hour for the movie to reveal them in the dullest way possible.Maybe the only person who can come out of this mess with some credibility is Blu Hunt and her performance as our lead character, Danielle. Hunt does fall into the teenage actor trap of overdoing it, but overall she does a commendable job of being the audience's viewpoint into this story.Three of our five main characters have accents and each of them vies for the award of least convincing. The winner of that goes to American-born Anya Taylor-Joy in her attempt at portraying a Russian. Charlie Heaton's Kentucky drawl comes in at a close second place, while the British Maisie Williams of ""Game of Thrones"" fame does alright with her Scottish accent.As an action movie, ""The New Mutants"" is a failure. As a horror movie, it's a failure. Even as a piece of entertainment, it's a failure. This is nothing more than a cheap cash grab whose only purpose is to make a quick buck off brand recognition alone.The only time I'll ever think about this movie again is when I have to decide where to place it on my worst-of-the-year list.",The New Mutants

133,MinistryofDoom,The Final and Unfortunate Nail in Fox's X-Men Franchise,5,23 January 2021,"The New Mutants is one of the stranger entries into what is now known as Marvel's Legacy films (Marvel's films under Fox prior to it's merger with Disney). The New Mutants is 20th Century Fox's final nail in the coffin for it's X-men related films. Everything to follow The New Mutants will be directly produced by Disney/Marvel and incorporated into the MCU over time. This is good as it will allow Marvel to finally correct all the issues with the X-men's fractured timelines and convoluted films. For those who don't know, The New Mutants was Marvel's precursor to X-Force which is originally led by Cable, the anti-hero introduced in Deadpool 2.However, instead of a standard superhero origin story like Spiderman or X-Men, The New Mutants began it's story in a world where mutants already exist, and apparently have existed for some time. While it's not directly linked to the X-men or Deadpool films, atleast not on the surface, it does mention the fact that the X-men and Professor X do exist in this world and are an active superhero team. All the characters are canon original members of what would later become X-Force, except for Magik, Illyana Rasputin. According to Marvel lore, she's the sister of Colossus, the large metal X-man featured in Deadpool and Deadpool 2, though she never even mentions that he exists. These kids....the ""new mutants""......Magik, Cannonball,Wolfsbane, Sunspot, and Mirage, find themselves trapped in high security institution, which is so high security that it let's them walk around freely as long as they don't leave the premises. Each day they attend sessions with their handler, a mysterious woman named Dr. Cecilia Reyes, who's job is to help them learn to harness and control their powers. Throughout the film there is a foreboding sense that things aren't what they seem. Little by little the teens discover evidence that make them question why they're there and draw questions about the motives of their handler. Initially they believe that they're being prepared to join the X-men but is that why they're really there? Things come to a head when they begin to ask questions and seek answers on their own leading to an action-packed battle between good and evil.In terms of the greater X-men films, this is a nice change from all of the time travel, multiple versions of multiple characters thing that has so deeply destroyed the X-men series. However, among the X-films, it's not one of the good ones. It's not one of the worst either. I saved that place for Apocalypse until Dark Phoenix beat it.Nevertheless, I appreciate it's choice to step away from traditional costumed superhero action and attempt to tell a much darker story in the same film universe. I just wish it was executed better. The honest truth is that if you never read any of the comicbooks like I have, and have only seen the other X-men films, you would have no idea who these people are or why you should care about them. Their characters are unfortunately not developed well at all. Viewers won't know anything about them; for the most part, they don't even go by their comicbook superhero names (as I've referred to them above) but rather by their regular names. Honestly, do YOU know who are Rahne Sinclair or Sam Guthrie? Probably not, unless you're a fellow X-Nerd. The New Mutants doesn't even give them the courtesy of identifying who they are through a proper introduction. Most of them don't even exhibit their powers through most of the film. Sure, you're given hints and glimpses into what they might be capable but it's not enough to know what they're all about. While it does drop several easter eggs here and there for the true fans, they're so well hidden that most people won't even notice. Simon Kinberg was on record as saying that wanted something that resembled a mash of Stephen King and John Hughes-like horror set in a superhero world. While that sounds fantastic, it doesn't feel like, in this particular instance, it was successfully achieved. Unfortunately, during development, there were alot of script rewrites and several people who were set to join the film were either re-cast or dropped entirely. In the end, what we got was a generic pyschological horror film which was painted over with X-Men references and in the end, it just didn't feel right. It didn't work. It could have been so much better had they developed the idea some more.In the end, if you're a fan of the Fox X-Men movies, you may choose to see this but I assure you that if you decide to skip it, you won't miss out on anything important to the overall X-Men franchise.",The New Mutants
134,WatchAndSmile,4.7/10 Boring,5,9 November 2020,"I found the movie boring and waited until the end for more explanations, more connections, more action, more drama - just more of everything,but that never came. Acting was nice,far far from very good.

Even recently with mostly bad reviews and press, I wanted to see it for myself.And ... it pretty much sucked. That doesn't bode well for future work from Josh ""The Fault in my Stars"" Boone (e.g. ""The Stand"" mini-series.We pretty much know the gist from the trailers. Young mutants are haunted/harassed by something in a mental hospital.The best parts are pulled from the X-men series in which mutants first find out their powers, typically represented effectively on screen. Most times these scenes are fun, but the special effects are a mixed bag, jumping back and forth from decent to cheesy.Most of the ensemble cast are relatively new up-and-coming stars such as Maise Williams (""Game of Thrones""), Anya Taylor-Joy (""The Witch/Queen's Gambit""), and Charlie Heaton (""Stranger Things"") but the acting is mediocre, and worst of all, they butcher whatever accent they are supposed to have (Irish, Russian[?], and U.S. southern respectively).And the story -- disappointing to say the least.If you drop your expectations to a bad 90 minute ""Buffy the Vampire"" episode, then maybe you'll find something to like.",The New Mutants
137,plasticanimalz,Sigh,4,18 November 2020,"I was really looking forward to this, despite the skeptical trailer. This was one of my favorite comics as a kid, and I was willing to accept them going the horror route, despite this never being a horror comic book. My guess was they would do the Demon Bear storyline, given the elements in the trailer, and I was correct. My question is, why would they do a superhero movie with clearly so small a budget? What's the point? It's quickly clear by the lack of special effects, and what few they have, the mediocre to poor quality of FX, using the same locations, that this is on a Blumhouse style budget.The casting is pretty good, other than Daniel Moonstar, who is absolutely nothing like her character. She doesn't look or act like her, her powers are not correct, and she doesn't even look Native American. And her acting is pretty weak, especially compared to playing next to 3 seasoned actors, and Roberto, who was actually pretty good, and spot on to his character. Even though the writers took a lot of liberties with Illyana's character, Anya Taylor-Joy looks a lot like her, and has the swagger to pull her off. Given Illyana was one of my favorite characters, it was fun to watch her play her. And though Sam Guthrie doesn't look quite like Sam, the Stranger Things actor really pulled it off. Maisie Williams, also great casting and acting, despite her lame werewolf effects.This is the second time New Mutants has been made, the first time, an even worse TV pilot that also had no budget. Hopefully they'll bring Illyana on to the X-Men, as, I believe that was how she was originally introduced. She is by far one of the most complex and interesting characters in the Marvel universe, but, doubtful they will get it right, and it's abundantly clear that the studios don't really care about female superheroes.This isn't the worst superhero movie made, but considering the majority are made with a budget over 100 million and are exceedingly average, it puts New Mutants in a slightly better light. Even with the terrible budget, they still could have written a better story. Unbreakable had very few effects and was a great film. Still, probably a much bigger budget than this one.I'm glad they made a movie, I just wish it was better.",The New Mutants

It doesn't put you in the mood, despite the horror vibe of the piece. I never felt anxious, or worried for any of the characters.Even if the tone is a bit of a miss for me, it is a smartly constructed story. I felt I got the characters. I understood their fears, their traumas, and why they were the way we found them on an intellectual level but I hardly felt for them. I can't say that the actors didn't pull their weight, even though they are no oscar worthy performances, but giving that the atmosphere wasn't really there nothing elevated the work they put in.The action scenes and visual effects were great for what they were going for, but in comparison to the sets looked like an expensive new car in a junk yard. The facility they were in is so rundown and cheap looking that I couldn't believe that it had voice activated locks. It would have been easier to believe that the doors opened and closed because of a Mutant's power.The New Mutants felt like a great idea that wasn't totally followed through. There is a gun-shy feeling to it. They didn't go all the way or didn't strike the right tone. The first half of Josh Trank's Fant4stic Four felt more ominous than this entire movie.

164,Animus,"I'm a fan of the comic, the movie is NOT the comic",3,18 July 2021,"The New Mutants was one of the better X-titles in the 1990s. This movie is travesty and soooooo badly done. I'm no a stickler for faithful adaptations, after all the MCU adapts and updates classic comic book characters and plot lines and does it well. The New Mutants does not. If you know anything about the characters you'll spend most of the movie saying ""What the F--k?"" Why is Sam Guthrie injured from using his power? It literally protects him from harm with an invulnerable force field. Sunspot absorbs light and converts it to strength, he doesn't catch fire. Did the writers not even read the Marvel website entries on the characters? Iliyana (Magik) is done pretty well and the 'lockheed' is kinda cool even if they writers forget that she an TELEPORT AT WILL for 95% of the movie. Rayne is done fairly well, although she was never portrayed as bi/lesbian in the comics. But this is the least problematic change. As for Dani Moonstar... if you ever picked up a New Mutants comic you know she's the source of the 'demon bear' in the first 2 minutes of the movie. This knowledge makes the 'tension' of the next 90 minutes tedious and annoying. Ooooh no something is stalking the rehab center! It's Dani. Oooooh no, soemthing is rying to kill the kids. It's Dani. Oooooh no the monster is sooo powerful. It's Dani. Ooooooh how will they fight it? It's Dani. It's Dani. IT IS DANI !!!!!The New Mutants had massive potential an could have launched a 'phase 2' of the X-Men but the writers whizzed it down their leg by ignoring the rich history of the comic and turning it into a craptastic and generic horror movie.",The New Mutants

So I went to see this in theaters, so I was made sure I was open-minded in this movie. But sadly, like most people, I was disappointed. I liked some sequences; sometimes, it feels generic, and sometimes it would feel new. But what we got was mostly generic. I give 100% props to Fox for trying something new because Disney would never allow stuff like this in their MCU. (They never like to take risks anyway.) But to me, it should have been better. Fox made movies like X-Men, X-Men 2, X-Men Days of future past, Logan, Deadpool 1, and 2. Those films were great and fun (especially Logan), but they also make stuff X-Men Apocalypse, Last stand, Dark Phoenix, and this film where they were forgettable and bland.

All the leads are very good, young actors who are already carving out careers.The characters don't always match the originals, Dani lacks the leadership qualities, Berto, the humour, Sam is a bit all over the place and Illyana, actually she's the right amount of nuts! Rahne is pretty spot on but the writers have introduced a new character trait to both her and Dani which I personally didn't think as necessary, if they wanted that trait, they should've used Karma or Rictor instead.The film tries to be a horror and apart from the rejects from the episode 'Hush' of Buffy, it's not a horror, but it could be a good action film, if the story actually brought in any action apart from the last 20 minutes or so. It falls down by spending too much time faffing about and not enough doing what The New Mutants do best and that is working together.It's not as bad as you might have heard but can be considered the X-Men's poorer cousin, which is a shame as the comics have tried their hardest to get away from that moniker.",The New Mutants
175,gacsogergely,Beautiful and potentialy useable,8,3 September 2020,"I confess I'm not familiar with this branch of the comics, but that doesn't stop me.The movie was a very competently made, well structured, sufficiently acted mytery-drama, with certain horror elements and atmosphere.
Like, as the basic direction of horror is to hide your monsters, this movie hides the abilities of the mutants, instead flashing them in your face like the X-men movies.
And mentioned abilities are not that overpower as those of the X-men either. These young adults are people with certain talents, not Gods Amongst Men like the X-Men. And because they are more like a traditional superhero (eg. Captain America), they have the potential to be introduced to the MCU.The movie isn't much about flashing the characters in yo face, like some stupid Thor, or Ruffalo-Hulk. Nah, it's more clever than that toy-selling stuff. This instead makes you question who are these people? Why are they in an asylum? What is their backstory, or more like: trauma? And how they connect to their mutant abilities?
This is not a cliché horror-movie where you worry about which character will be eaten next. This is a good movie instead, which makes you question, is there a monster at all, and what is its nature? During that you should worry about the characters because a) they are humans b) they are practicaly still kids c) they are unfortunate, tortured souls. And you should feel for them in the end, as they become what they become against all the odds.I honestly loved this movie. Despite all the delays, and recuts (in the end I even think those made it a better movie, but who knows of course), and Disney.

Danielle (Blu Hunt) is the only person of her village that is alive and is brought to a strange mutant facility ran by Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga). Things start to seem strange when everyone in the facility seem to be reliving their deepest fears.REVIEW:
I mean, I can't really be upset that this film wasn't the best. After multiple pushbacks and a very lackluster trailer, I knew what I was in for. With that being said, I didn't hate the film. It definitely wasn't good, but I could see potential in it. Some of the scenes near the end were entertaining and a couple of the scenes where we see the characters fear were good, but not too much aside from that had much value. The only acting performance that I would say has any sort of impact on me was Charlie Heston as Sam. Aside from those things, there were a few issues. E didn't get much backstory from the character and a couple of the characters had no flashback of their tragedy which removed what connection you could've had from their character. The acting as a whole was pretty mediocre and you can tell that there wasn't fully thought out idea for the story. It seemed like they wanted to make some quick cash from the X-Men world without truly putting much thought into a reason for having this film. My biggest issue with the film was probably not having a clear villain. You can say that each of their fear was the true villain of the story, but that feels very corny and easy. The villain I think they were going for is Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga), but there wasn't any part of this film that I felt she held much of any threat. She seemed sincere the film and even with an act she's attempting to do at the end of the film didn't appear to be out of any hate and I almost couldn't argue with what she had to do. I would go more in depth with that, but it would reveal spoilers.In the end, I was disappointed with the performances since I do like Anya Taylor Joy and I felt this was her worst and it's just a bit disappointing knowing this film had potential, but couldn't find a clear path. I didn't hate watching it, but I wouldn't recommend it. 5.0/10.",The New Mutants

181,waltermwilliams,Dialled Down Horror,6,6 September 2020,"It's been thee years in the making, but has it been worth the wait?
I first saw a trailer for ""The New Mutants"" in 2017 and have been waiting patiently for its big screen release.
A lot has happened since then.
For starters the movie didn't get the post production upgrades it needed to make it scarier and Marvel was bought out by Disney.
The horror element has been dialled down by Mickey & his mates and release dates pushed back until September 2020.
The result is a much tamer vision of the X Men trainees directed by Josh Boone (he owns every New Mutants/X-Men comic and graphic novel) who are being prepped for a higher power, but is it Professor X who wants them or someone diabolical.
Watch out for: Logan flashbacks.
Basically this is a haunted house movie set in a real Asylum that freaked out the cast & crew during filming.
If it had been released three years ago it would have been a game changer and pioneer of a new genre of horror superhero LGBTQ movies, but that's all been done since then.
Still it will find a teen, tween audience, just not fully satisfying adult fan boys and girls who remember the original comics.

187,Phil_M_A_Kerr,The New Mutant Breakfast Club,8,13 September 2020,"I was moved by this movie. Surprising, considering all the negative reviews.The CGI set-pieces which reveal our characters' respective mutant powers are as frequent as larger budget X-men movies. Whilst not as elaborate, they are imaginative.Some inspirations are obvious - The Breakfast Club, Show Me Love perhaps, and the Anime action/fantasy genre. The director lists some influences in a promotional video - Nightmare on Elm Street 3, Psycho, & One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest which I can see in hindsight.All performances are earnest and that goes a long way to make the film gel.It doesn't seek to reinvent the wheel but it does gently and carefully nudge the mutants down a different, spookier path.The horror is pure visual creepiness, like Pan's Labyrinth, and not so much jump scares. The fantasy elements use splashes of rich colour, which is nice to see these days, and moments of epic scale.I'm a child of the 80's and didn't connect with the original Breakfast Club as much as I did with this mutant version. I think that's due to the added horror/fantasy elements.This film works VERY well within its limits and is worthy of a spot on any cinema's COVID reopening program.",The New Mutants

In the third arc, the movie just ends without any banger that could be count as a good and satisfying ending.

Overall New Mutants doesn't stand out much differently from the other X-Men films we have watched before.",The New Mutants
190,c-kelsall,Much better than IMDb reviews led me to expect,7,19 February 2021,"The negativity around The New Mutants is absolutely extraordinary. It's simply baffling. Maybe I would have to be a comic/graphic novel fanboy to get it.
It is well known that this film had a troubled genesis and took a long time to get a release, so if anything I think we should cut it some slack, rather than rip it to shreds. Some people just love to kick you when you're down.
The New Mutants is loosely connected to the X-Men franchise, but only by reference in the dialogue. It tells the story of a 16-year-old Cheyenne girl who's reservation comes under mysterious attack from some terrifying power. She passes out, and comes to in a strange place, chained to a hospital bed. She has become the latest of a small group of latent mutants who, for their own safety, have been institutionalized and studied to help them come to terms with their new-found abilities. It soon becomes apparent that she is the only one of the group who does not yet know what her power is.
In my balanced opinion (I have no agenda or axe to grind), The New Mutants is an entertaining 94 minutes of film. Is it award-worthy? No. Is it utter garbage? Absolutely not. Some criticism is justified, as with pretty much any film or TV show ever made, but it didn't annoy me in any way. Apart from Magik's unexplained inability or disinclination to leave the facility at will, the story stood up quite well in terms of its own internal logic. I was slightly bothered by the lack of explanation as to how Dani arrived at the facility, but it wasn't necessary to know in terms of the story being told. The characters were mostly quite well rounded and developed, which was necessary for the narrative. The most inscrutable character was the facility's doctor - we were not given to understand what made her tick, which I imagine was done deliberately. In a way, I think there might have been a greater payoff if her character's motivations had been clearer.
I worked out fairly quickly what was going on, but it didn't bother me that there wasn't a well-disguised twist. For that reason, I think it will stand up to repeat viewing. I thought all the actors did good work, especially Anya Taylor-Joy (Magik). I imagine there was a certain amount of infantile rejection of the lesbian love interest angle, or the fact the main character was American Indian, by some viewers. Of course they won't admit their prejudice, so they trash the film in other ways. More fool them, I say.
To sum up, if you view this without encumbering it with preconceived ideas about what an X-Men film should be, you just might enjoy it.",The New Mutants

201,PaxD75,Good low-budget film. Two obnoxious teens are main failing.,7,19 November 2020,"This movie was on my watch list for a long time. When I finally had a chance to see it, I was concerned about the low rating (5.3 from 24,223) and the many negative reviews.This is far from a great film but it also isn't atrocious. My rating is a 7; here's why:The entire cast is comprised of just 6 actors. Only 6. The setting is a single enclosed building. I have just described a low-budget set up. I shouldn't have but this is what this film clearly is for some odd reason.The budget (according to online sources) was between 67 to 80 million dollars. Where did the money go? Clearly it wasn't spent on hiring more cast, improving the script, managing the interactions of the characters better, location shooting or anything else that defines a big-ticket blockbuster.I love the 'X' franchise. It is far and away my favorite superhero film franchise. It's got a ""bite"" and realism that other franchises lack. I'm very angry that someone (or a few someones) abused this franchise to the tune of 70-80 million dollars. They got the money and then skimped on everything, it seems.It's hard to make an epic film when the setting is a single building and the cast totals just 6. I can only review what I see in front of me - not my expectations of what I think it should be. I can only review and rate this film based on the fact that only a small portion of the budget was actually used for the film in any real sense.As a low-budget 'X' entry: this film truly delivers. Great acting, fantastic special effects, and above average story. As a low-budget film there are some obvious holes: like Dr. Reyes (Alice Braga) working 7 days/week, 24 hours/day to oversee 5 mutant teens in a huge building (when a few more nefarious super-powered staff would have delivered a much better story).Even as a low-budget film, the film's main failure was the unlikability of two of the teens. Rasputin (played excellently by Anya Taylor-Joy) and da Costa (very convincingly by Henry Zaga) were so unlikable (for most of the film) that they infected the entire mood of the film. Likable characters like Moonstar, Guthrie and Sinclair (and even Dr. Reyes) were unable to truly deliver on their traits because of how the two teens were written.A couple more nefarious staff to aid Dr. Reyes would have made these two teens seem less obnoxious. It may have forced a tweak of the existing plot to make the group more cohesive earlier rather than the final waning minutes of the film.I cannot, in good conscience, rate this as I would an expensive blockbuster. The money wasn't there. We'll never know where it went. I can only rate this as a low-budget entry into the 'X' franchise. As such, it's a 7 low-budget effort.",The New Mutants
202,jaywensley2004,"There's 15 minutes of movie here, worthy of a franchise",6,28 August 2020,"She's back.It's no secret that for all eight seasons of ""Game of Thrones"", Arya Stark was my favorite character. I even talked myself into believing that the character played by the elfin Maisie Williams; smart, pure of heart and mission, and capable of making an ally of anyone; was not only deserving of ruling Westeros, but might actually pull it off. When Arya sailed-off into the unknown lands, I knew she would be the only character I would miss.Well the spirit of Arya Stark lives on as the heart of the teen group that premiers today as ""The New Mutants"", and Maisie Williams acts the hell out of the role. From beginning to the end of the movie, she anchors this disparate, desperate group, wrangling (and occasionally wriggling) her way through the broken souls and bitter angst that, as usual for a Marvel Universe film, typifies the will-be heroes.Not that Maisie Williams' Rahne Sinclair is the only character that rises to the occasion. In fact it is Anya Taylor-Joy's unfortunately named Illyana Rasputin who finally drags a movie that takes too long to get started, into the promised Land of Heroics. For most of the film Illyana is so unpleasant, that it becomes almost predictable the trajectory her character will eventually follow. But for a few minutes ""The New Mutants"" allows her to do it so well, that she creates a reason for this franchise to exist.The rest of the mutants are so bland and ambiguous that they become little more than plot devices, including Blu Hunt as Danielle Moonstar, the ostensible central character in the story. Bleh! Her character is nothing more than this crew's Jean Grey--most powerful, TOO powerful, blahblahblah. Ultimately she becomes the focal point for the emergence of the love-struck Rahne (Maisie Williams) and the indomitable Illyana as THE new mutants.I want to rate it higher, but I can honestly only give ""The New Mutants"" six stars. As I say, it takes too long getting rocking, and only sustains its energy for about 15 minutes. But that's enough to see that this team can be a franchise in the Marvel Movie Universe, if they can write stories that focus on two very strong characters, portrayed by two very strong actresses.",The New Mutants

It goes on for more than half of the movie. Then it comes to the climax where the new kid loses control over her powers. And then the movie ends. I felt empty afterwards. I waited for years due to the delays...to watch this movie. Anyways, I gave this movie 3/10 because I like Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams as actresses.

I wasn't interested in The New Mutants since I didn't like the trailers and I'm not a horror guy. When the film came out, two fellow YouTubers told me its not straight up horror. New Mutants is really lame in fact I think its the worst X-Men film.The acting is fine, I don't think anyone was bad. Maybe a lot of fans said this but Charlie Heaton's accent is inconsistent. The characters are bland but not annoying. They explain their stories but its not real characterization.The story is nothing special, these mutants are simply locked up together and get to know each other. New Mutants isn't like the other X-Men films but its poorly made.The scares are terrible, I never felt scared or disturbed. The film has zero suspense in fact the prologue is rushed so you don't care what's going on.New Mutants isn't CGI heavy like superhero films but the effects are terrible. I guess they're on the same level as Origins Wolverine.Overall, New Mutants sucked not to my surprise. The film didn't make me mad or really bored like Highlander which I recently watched.

The actors are water, the cgi is childish, and by the climax fight, it's so predictable that viewers won't care, as it's worse than a old Disney production..

The story lines from the comics are some of the best ever written, so why do they insist on mutilating them beyond recognition. The Dark Phoenix was such an iconic story line which has been completely destroyed twice now on the big screen. So it was with some trepidation I approached this movie, which seems to have spent an eternity in production, and has clearly been edited and re-shot several times. Most of the acting is pretty reasonable, with the exception of Illyana, who's accent grated and the character was 1 dimensional but this is probably more down to the writing than the actress. I know this was a the first movie and they needed to set characters etc, but it did seem to take a long time to get going. Most of the characters were pretty close to the originals, apart from Sam Guthrie, who in the comics was a lean, blond jock. Having said all that, I quite enjoyed the movie, but in retrospect, I wonder if that was in expectation of what was to come and never did?",The New Mutants

As a marvel movie and comic fan, this film was a let down. The horror aspect was minimal and the plot- which wasn't very fluent- abandoned itself at times and came back later. There was no suspense and came across more as a series of teenage drama clichés. Even the mutant powers were only used on occasion. It also has an issue staying within X-Men film canon. My movie goer partner and I were debating where the film fit in with the other ones. Eventually we came to the conclusion that it was after Logan (2017) but an alternate timeline created by the ending of Deadpool 2 (2018). That being said, either one of those films would be a much better use of one's time. The New Mutants was a disappointing hot mess that was boring and slow, but also felt very cut and pasted. Maybe if the film had remained an R-rated film, as it was originally intended/filmed as, the film would be a better experience. What is left over from editing and sold as the ""final product"" is a disappointing hotness and should be skipped. At least Cats (2019) had a memorable soundtrack and Taylor Swift.

It was like any other series pilot giving you the setup to what it WILL be about. The story and character development are minimal.

Love story was well handled, probably the best bits of this film.Magik: acting was bad in one scene, she felt okay understandable as we mostly followed her. Final twist was kidda meh.

But I have to say new mutants was a pleasant surprise of a movie, no it isn't perfect or like the best movie I have seen out of this year but this movie I did enjoy for what it was. There is a lot to like about the new mutants aka the cast, the cast here was pretty good and each member gave a pretty good performances but the 2 standouts had to Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor Joy who steal the show each time they were on screen and both gave the best performances of the whole movie. The story is also very interesting and the concept was done pretty decent. The characters are also for the most part good but the 2 stands were Rahne(maisie Williams) and Illayna (Anya Taylor Joy) who easily kept this movie going each time their characters were on screen. The action and fight scenes were also fantastic and well shot this is a super hero movie so expect some well shot fights. Also the romance in this movie even though it was very clutches I thought it did the job for what the movie was aiming for. The second and third acts also saved this movie from being a flop and being an disaster. Where the movie starts to fail is with the pacing, the pacing in the first act is extremely messing and the first 30 minutes of this movie felt extremely rushed. Also there is barley any character development for some of the characters in this movie which sucks because we got these great characters but we don't get to really know about their backstories or their pasts we just get little hints about it. But where the movie does fail was it was always marketed as a horror movie yes there is horror elements and those elements were done very well but they never committed to this being a full blown horror movie and maybe because it was PG-13 and I think that rating did make it suffer if it was R I'm sure it would of been a lot better. Overall, the new mutants is a pretty fun movie that I enjoy quite a bit, yes it's not perfect and after all the delays it had I don't think it did any help to this movie but if you have the chance to see this movie I would say give it a watch because I enjoyed it quite a bit.",The New Mutants

But I loved the love story between Wolfsbane and Mirage. They did with just a beauty and finesse that it made me tear up a few times. Truly beautifully done. The film doesn't really try to hard to be too different which is where a small fault lies. It surprisingly has its fare share of twists, nothing too groundbreaking tho.

Sure, the dialogue is cringe at times, the backstories are a bit thin, but the characters are not unlikable (great achievement for a modern movie), and they even managed to put in a lesbian love story that isn't cringe for a change. Honestly, what more do you want?Contrary to what many idiots here claim, the VFX are actually quite decent, and the suspension of disbelief works well enough to hide the plot holes.

I expect most of the individuals who starred in this film to find work easily in Hollywood. Action and horror, what more can a Marvel fan ask for? People will write this movie off because it's a spin-off but don't let that be a deciding factor.

Alas, it was a watered-down, non-scary sorta story that doesnt really go anywhere.The movie itself doesnt have much to really 'say'. Its kind of more of the same, mutants being persecuted for being mutants. Yawn. Oh, but they're teens instead of adults, so thats a thing... I guess?Writing was kinda poor. The CGI was fine, but nowadays its more when the CGI IS NOT fine (batman v superman) is when its noteworthy. The story doesnt really go anywhere, and there are some hamfisted things that felt like they were thrown in to appeal to certain audiences.The 'twist' was extraordinarily obvious from the get-go.The ending, and especially the quote, were extremely cringeworthy.Unless you're dying to see a ""people with superpowers: the movie"" movie, skip this one.
Which is sad to say, as I was very much looking forward to this flick from the trailers and the horror aspect that was touted early on in production. Unfortunately studio meddling and shelf time seems to have gutted this flick.If you want a superhero horror movie, Brightburn or Chronicle for more of a horror vibe.As an aside: Being a 100% true Native American, it is bothersome to watch words that are used as racial slurs, such as Pocahontas (Trump's favorite Native American insult) and others for entertainment purposes with no real need or redeeming factor.
Movies, such as Tarantino flicks, which use racial slurs are doing so for actual reasons. Here, it felt like more of the ""lets just use Native American's however we want without any real care about their plight or history"".
Also, Hollywood, you realize you can have a character be a Native without resorting to stereotypes. (Letterkenny does this well)

If you throw out the whole X-Men theme, then it's a good diversion movie. Fun effects, colorful characters. Absolutely insufficient character development and a shock value lesbian scene to wake you up, although it's telegraphed. No real chemistry between the characters, so most of the pronouncements (""I love her"") just fall flat. Still - I enjoyed it. Fun and mindless. Set-up for a part II. I'll watch that too. Beats all the foreign films they're dragging out of who knows where.",The New Mutants
253,Clive_W,A required film is missing!!!!,1,7 November 2020,"Ive spent much of today after watching the film just last night, trying to come up with positives to this film, unfortunately there is none I can think of, the movie has a number of big issues, firstly the constant delays to the film where I had heard reshoots were meant to be taking place. This was not the case. Then you have the actors issue, the actors consistently change accents, or their appearance change much like the blonde character one moment having hair buns then the very next seen it changed... the editing is completely off, and at best feels like a mismatch of scenes put together with no flow. When the characters start to go on about strange things happening and they all somehow know what each person is talking about makes no sense as at that point two of the characters had a single moment something happened... no character development really, plots just randomly thrown in and never revisited. Then there's the very very misleading trailer that paints a completely different film, I have no idea if the footage in the trailer was part of the very original cut or one the later cuts, I believe one the main reasons the film is such a mess is partly down to the constant push backs, that and the terrible mess of a plot (If it can be called a plot). The issues I mentioned early with the accents was a big part of the film, as the characters begin a dialog but it's very noticeable the accent is dropped or forgotten completely. What makes that worse is it's not just one character, it's basically all of them. In addition the CG work and other effects are just down right poor, the bear at the end is constantly changing size and shape, one angle the bear appears huge on the face angle but then shifting further away at a side angle somehow has become so much smaller than when it was attacking the building where it clearly towering 2 or so floors... I wish I could find some redeeming quality to this film, the New Mutants end result was such a mess you could hardly call it a film, there was no horror aspect like seen in the trailer, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, it's a skip, 5.5 is far too generous. The concept had potential, if executed right.",The New Mutants

What more could you possibly ask for?! The roles are perfectly cast and characterized, it's adapted well from the source material, more or less and Illyana Rasputin is actually MAGIK with the soulsword and Limbo and all.The Demon Bear is also well done and impressive.As a fan of the New Mutants, I absolutely adore what they did here.",The New Mutants

Its strength is its extensive world building with three dimensional characters and immersive storylines. It should be hard to mess up but people find a way.X-men needs room to breathe and New mutants is just a cheap oxygen tank.",The New Mutants
257,ksharath1999,"Versatile But A Dull,Boring Sleeping Pill",3,4 August 2021,New Mutants is an variety attempt which tries to provide something new from the regular CBM movies. The movie can be described as a drama movie which offers a visit into a mutant facility and its functioning. However the movie has only a few pros including Anya Taylor's comic accurate Magik and Alice Braga's performance near the end. All the actors have performed their parts well in this movie but the whole film feels like a sleeping pill till 55 mins runtime. The movie only gets engaging by the end where we get an ok climax and some good power unleashing scenes.The movie suffers from a lot of cons including the way it progresses. The movie is extremely laggy and boring till 55 minute runtime after that it somehow finds itself back on foot. All the horror or intense scenes fails to touch the mark as the movie turns into a sleeping pill. The movie has some b grade cgi effects which was poor compared to the final effects.On the whole New Mutants is a variety forgettable attempt which felt too short of its course. It can't be called a disaster because its a variety attempt among CBM's. However the movie feels like a failed experiment which becomes my least favourite CBM movie.Rating:35%,The New Mutants

263,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,A Wasted Concept,5,2 September 2020,"Whoever came up with this movie should deserve more than the actual movie. The idea of mixing superheroes and horror together is a good idea for a cinema redefining film, but the director must have had other plans. The film is the utter definition of cliche and shows every weakness of both genres, taking the ""I can't control my powers"" story and mixing it with ""it takes the form of your greatest fear"" story. The movie isn't scary because the scares it uses are ones I have already seen. The monsters and horror scenes are extremely inspired. Everything happens way too fast and nothing is fully developed or expanded upon. The villain is bland and unintimidating I was thinking of better uses of the scary scene setups throughout the movie. The actors try to be good, and mostly are, but the characters have boring superpowers you have seen a million times, and ones that have new powers have really weird and unexplained ones, excepting the main character. You may think you're seeing the last X Men movie ever, what you're actually going to see is a sad, more cliche than cliche, cash grab.",The New Mutants

266,WillsFilms,The New Mutants Hasn't Developed Its Powers Yet,6,6 September 2020,"The New Mutants is a perfectly enjoyable, if flawed, entry into the X-Men film series. The story gives an interesting insight into how dangerous mutants can truly be without developed powers or the aid of Professor X. I also really liked the movie's message about overcoming trauma. The characters are all interesting, with tragic backstories which make them more layered. Unfortunately, while the characters are written well, the acting is very wooden. Charlie Heaton, despite having one of the most interesting characters in the bunch, is terrible. He doesn't have a single convincing delivery in the whole movie. Anya Taylor-Joy also massively overacts as Illyana Rasputin, to the point that the character becomes quite annoying. However, the two leads (Blu Hunt and Maisie Williams) deliver a pair of pretty good performances, which carry the film, as do their characters, who are well fleshed out and sympathetic. A huge problem with the movie is that it's marketed as a horror movie but, aside from the odd CGI monster, plays out far more like a thriller. The story also suffers from being incredibly predictable. I knew exactly what was happening as soon the climax started. Also the villain is really bad. She started off interesting but slowly progressed into a boring one dimensional character as the film went on. Honestly, I'm upset that this film won't get a sequel because I feel like these characters have potential to be further explored. As it stands, The New Mutants is a perfectly enjoyable piece of entertainment and since there isn't anything else on at the moment, I'd recommend checking it out.",The New Mutants

That being said it's a rather lackluster end to the X-Men(ish) franchise. I get the feeling this would have served better as a side film to the mutant franchise renewal which began with X-Men First Class.
It comes across more as a TV movie overall.
It's a shame the mutant stories ended on this film but I suspect audiences have grown a bit weary of those escapades now. It will be interesting to see how the MCU will weave them in, or even if the audience has anymore appetite for it.

In a way, this reminded me of all the stories about teens fighting evil that I used to read as a child. Such things aren't usually complicated, sure, but they don't need to be -- just like this film. It's good as it is, as a simple story of becoming more or less independent, solving problems and fighting against bad things, primaly against your own fear coming from past traumatic experiences. It's also good as it somehow explores pedagogical aspect of X-men universe, a very important one that, nevertheless, gets only glimpses in other X-men films. So, it's nice to finally have something different, painting mutants -- young mutants -- from a new perspective. Sure, this isn't like any of the previous movies, or like other superhero films they make nowadays, but this is exactly why it's so interesting and nice to watch.

Illyana and Lockheed the dragon, could not have come up with a better way to put that in a movie without some lame CGI.
The mysterious Doctor, what are her real goals, mission, keeps you guessing, and the CGI at the end is necessary but done well. If you read the books when they came out I think you should like it, and if you are expecting something like the Avengers you should watch it to up your game. Though I did miss Kharma not being there, as she was capable of possessing someone, and she was the original team leader before Dani became a Valkyrie. Sam and Sunspot, good casting, would love to see where they went in a second film.
Maise as Rahne Sinclair was good, about as you would expect it, and the simpatico between her and Dani wasn't really explored in the books when I was reading them, maybe after Leifeild took over and everyone was either grimacing or screaming, mainly because their over sized shoulder pads must have been chaffing.

Nobody in the theatre enjoyed it all that much. Consensus was the same on the way out. Not bad but not good.,The New Mutants

Overall I enjoyed it, but can't see it winning any awards anytime soon.
I liked the story and the characters, some of which are/were from major current shows and I though they played their parts very well and same for the rest of the cast.

299,gressman07,Decent enough,6,16 April 2021,"6/10 for me means slight overall positive vibes, starting all movies at neutral 5 and dropping or raising from there.There isn't much that happens, but the strange facility and unknown characters (knew nothing of who was in this mutant-wise) was intriguing enough, at least with its short runtime which helps.There are certainly worse ways to spend a few beers. Most of it was enjoyable enough, but with all the action limited to the finale, and with said action being pretty lame in all honesty, this drops from possible 7 to 6.There are surprisingly few HDR-worthy elements, again with most contained to the final 30 mins.Kudos for taking some time to establish some characters before throwing their romance in our face.The 5.3 rating is probably accurate for most. Coming in with low expectations helps. Probably worth a view just for curiosity, given we all got HBOMax right now for the SNYDERCUT.",The New Mutants

This is that type of movie, without the deftness and talent.A completely unstructured mess, this movie trips and stumbles through its single act with no plot in sight, bland and shapeless characters the writer so sincerely wanted to force life into, and an absolutely absurd lack of any stakes.And that's not even mentioning the plot holes so wide you could drive a truck through, the bizarre character decisions (""oh yeah, Dani, we know you're literally causing us to live our nightmares and you've sicced a huge demon bear on us to kill us, but we're gonna be on your side because... because the doctor is... sort of bad?""), the TERRIBLE acting (except Anya Taylor-Joy, she could act her way out of anything) and, again, literally no narrative thrust.

309,jdowney-57-371157,Purposeless and Mediocre,4,11 March 2021,"This is not a good movie.Begins with the standard voice over of a flashback...my dad told me something once. We're Native Americans, so it was about bears as a psychological metaphor. Then we see disaster strike and Dad doesn't make it. But he gave me that great lesson that is going to help now in my new travails as a Native American superhero.Then we're with a bunch of Junior X-men for some reason in a big empty school on a remote campus with a church and graves. Anna Taylor-Joy puts on a Russian Accent that is Angelina Jolie bad, and she is mean to new Native American Mutants. But Maise Williams can do a decent scottish accent, so she is kind to Native Americans. Then the guy who was the older brother from Stranger Things plays a real Kentucky Hillbilly....you can tell by his fake ah-shucks accent and his Trucker Hat. Henry Zaga is pretty good, he doesn't put on any kind of accent...oh no wait....he is a Braziian Mutant.I don't know...so any way these mutants are all there because this is the Junior X-men program. And you need to control your powers so you don't by accident fry your girlfriend or something.Any way..its like the Breakfast club with mutants for a little while. Then we find out that nothing is what it seems. Then there is some action, and we're done.The main problem is that they story is just not compelling. With a good origin story, you need a Red Skull or a Lex Luthor...somebody to challenge you and to prove your prowess and your emotional mettle. Here we get kind of a trick psuedo-enemy. Everybody tackles it, but where the X-Men and the Avengers and even the Justice League had to learn how to be a team and develop a synergy in order to beat the boss level enemy, here that never happens.Ultimately, our team lacks chemistry and the story falls flat. The direction is not stylish, the dialogue and situations are cliches, the mutant powers are not overly impressive, and there is no enemy to rally around.Thumbs down from me.",The New Mutants
310,MiroslavKyuranov,"The Myth, The Legend, The New Mutants",6,27 August 2020,"Well, they finally released this movie...3 years later. Given that, the story originally had to be told in 3 separate films, I can say, that it turned out to be kind of a boring mish-mash.For sure the dark tone we have seen in all the promotional materials is certainly noticeable, but I can't say, that there are so many scary or intensity moments. I guess it also depends on how old you are. The Demon Bear got cool design and that's it.The cast brings nothing special to the table, except Anya Taylor-Joy's Magik character, which stands out in front of the others.There are some great scenes, but in the end the movie is kinda forgettable. This movie was supposed to come out 3 years ago, a time in which many movies came out and people slowly lost interest.If you are a comicbook fan, watch it and support the work of the people who worked on it, they deserve it.

312,benmundie,Disappointed But Not Surprised,5,21 September 2020,"This film was the very mediocre end to the franchise that has been running for over 20 years. The CGI was stunning but that is what we have come to expect from these big budget comic-book movies. The setting was very eerie which lends itself to the roster of characters involved. The acting is entertaining especially from Maisie Williams as Rahne Sinclair / Wolfsbane and Blu Hunt as Danielle Moonstar / Mirage. Josh Boone does his best in the director's chair and the writing isn't terrible. However, this film was nowhere near perfect. As this was marketed as a horror picture, I was expecting big scares, but there were no scary parts, and it was very disappointing. The accent that Charlie Heaton has to use was incredibly grating and it really took away from his performance. The decision to skip over any backstory for Roberto Da Costa / Sunspot (Henry Zaga) led to the character having no real connection to the audience so it was difficult to get behind him and care about his role. In parts, the filmmakers hinted at some interesting plot threads (trying into 'Logan' and The Essex Corporation) but didn't act upon them so they felt like real missed opportunities. Having the 'Demon Bear' be the main antagonist didn't make real sense because it only had a connection to Danielle so lacked the attachment to the other protagonists. Some of the relationships between the titular characters were extremely forced especially between Rahne and Danille.
Overall, it was very apparent that the movie had big studio interference which stopped Josh Boone from making the film he actually envisioned. Also, it was obvious that a sequel was originally on the cards which has now been canned. Finally, I now can't wait for Disney to reboot this franchise.",The New Mutants

The lack of staff at the asylum was weird and unrealistic. Once again the cast should have been cheap. It has a predictable solid story. The horror angle didn't really work.

There's even a scene mentioning the X-Men, with a Prof X joke. They talk about not wanting to dress up and fight criminals.These are young adults who have all had tragedies in their lives, some which were caused by their new powers or triggered them. We learn how these effected them and altered their personalities. Meanwhile a doctor claims to be helping them understand their powers for her mysterious supervisors.To be honest, I thought this film was better than about half the costumed X-Men films that were given wide release. Sad that this wasn't given a chance and released when initially announced.",The New Mutants
330,josephbrewster-88279,"The ""New"" is only new for Marvel",4,1 September 2020,"As a Marvel movie, this is dark and edgy. As a dark and edgy movie, this is a little too Marvel. I'm a Marvel fan and a horror fan, and I felt a bit caught betwixt the faltering attempts at broody supernatural horror and the angsty teen drama of a blackballed Spider-Man coming of age script.Marvel wants to make horror? I'm in. Marvel wants to make a (another) dark X-men story? I'm in. With this cast? Yes, please.So why does this movie not impress me?It didn't go far enough in any direction to merit greatness.Warning: Spoilers ahead.A girl in an ominous (superhuman?) experience wakes up in a psych-ward with high tech locks and gadgetry inexplicably welded into a broken down hospital set where a mysterious organization is funding ""treatment"" for young mutants. The kids are led to believe professor X is the anonymous puppet master, but the plot keeps signaling that no, that's not the case. Maybe signaling a little too loudly. The sole care provider, Dr. Reyes, seems well-meaning, but completely cardboard as a character for the majority of the movie, functioning as a boarding school mom slash psychiatrist who apparently knows next to nothing about communicating with teens, but has somehow earned the position of headmaster in her private ward.Why is she the ONLY caretaker her for five students with high level powers? Why are they in a dilapidated crazy farm? How can she (as we learn later) generate a forcefield around this whole facility 24-7, even while sleeping, or knocked unconscious? Why in God's name would the organization depend entirely on her power as the primary security measure and just assume she would never get incapacitated by these dangerous youngings she meticulously spies on?Throughout the movie, the kids are constantly able to evade her, lie to her and even drug her to have a party. Where is the parent organization?All of these sins could be forgiven if the movie would just be something special, and here's where my opinion as a long time horror fan will tilt in a direction the average marvel fan might not agree with, because, if you watch much horror at all, this movie is derivative. It uses horror tropes, but clumsily, taking me to the edge of being uncomfortable or frightened, but never really shoving me over. It feels like a horror done by an action/adventure writer and director. It was like someone said ""let's make this dark"", then they remembered this is a Marvel movie, and toned it way down.I would rather have had either ( Thing 1) a truly horrific story, a la AHS or the descent, or (Thing 2) a fun movie for x-men teens, like Homecoming.Because it was not thing 1, there was nothing at stake. No one important was going to die. It was a typical superhero movie where we know the main characters will make it to the credits, despite the close calls. Nothing was truly at stake here, which sucks some of the horror potential from the plot.Because it was not thing 2, it's not that great of a story. Almost no humor, very little fun (other than that one fling night) and an oppressively cynical tone that gives way to a ""happy ending"" where there is very little happiness, but characters who hated each other quite recently are suddenly ready to road trip.As the credits rolled, I was left feeling cheated. Everyone lived. Everyone is friends. But the movie didn't earn that ending. It was trying to be dark, depressing and scary, all the while reassuring us that things will turn out ok.That gnawing in my gut at the end was asking:
Why do they think Danni saved them? She severely wounded all of them and almost killed them.
Why was Illy torn up over Lockheed (or Lucky?) during the battle? Did he die? Did she overreact and he's fine now?
Did we actually lose ANY characters we cared about?
Why were these good actors so subdued?
Why were these fake accents necessary?The New Mutants wasn't a great horror movie, it wasn't a great Marvel movie, it was just a movie that wasn't a throwback movie, and post-pandemic, that was its saving grace.",The New Mutants
331,flopezgraziano,Don't spend money to go see this movie!,3,5 September 2020,"Now that Disney owns Fox, the mutants, like The Fantastic Four, will be able to slowly integrate into Kevin Feige's master plan for his Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a pity that The New Mutants have had to dance with the ugliest, and not only share a release date with Christopher Nolan's Tenet, but because almost no fan is unaware of the long and tortuous path of this superhero film with the soul of a horror movie. Unsuccessful trial runs, reshoots and, to top it off, a pandemic. In the end, what counts is that here we have it, with its attractive cast and daring proposal. But this eagerness to satisfy both audiences at any price has left her halfway to nowhere.Dani Moonstar is taken from the Cheyenne reserve where she lived with her father after the devastating attack of a gigantic supernatural beast. When she wakes up, she finds herself confined in a containment center for teenage mutants who still do not control their powers and, according to her only supervisor, Dr. Reyes, are a potential danger to society. Although Dani is not yet aware of her abilities, there she will meet and collide with four young mutants, discovering a world full of possibilities, but also of terror, because after their arrival, the fears of those who reside there begin to come alive.The film is vaguely inspired by the celebrated Mystic Bear Saga (The Demon Bear), published in the 80's from issue 18 of the original collection of The New Mutants, the first spin-off from X-Men (The X-Patrol in Spain) before becoming that best-selling phenomenon that ended up multiplying its satellite collections like Gremlins. Bill Sienkiewicz's innovative illustrations and the effective scripts of the mutant patriarch, Chris Claremont, who raised to the altars the original formula conceived by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby two decades earlier, is honored in its adaptation by Josh Boone and Knate Lee, authors of the script, which pays tribute to the healthy diversity of the original comics, and which is one of the film's successes, although with little space, given its meager 90 minutes of footage, excluding final credits, some of which, by the way, reproduce some of Sienkiewicz's unforgettable art.It is clear that its director, Josh Boone, was signed up for the project thanks to the teenage angst he portrayed in Under the Same Star. One that here is made more credible by the two actresses with the most mileage: Maisie Williams, in the skin of Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane), and Anya Taylor-Joy, none other than Illyana Rasputin (Magik). Not in vain they are the two most developed characters and best transferred from the cartoon to the frame. However, once again the usual chronological chaos of Fox's mutant universe is imposed (a reason for mockery even for Deadpool in one of the most applauded jokes of his first installment), and Illyana's roots are overlooked, as happy as that would have made so many fans, as well as her pointed plot connection with Logan, who insists again on the figure and influence of a villain that neither Logan nor The New Mutants end up presenting.That tortuous path to the halls seems to have left The New Mutants reduced to its minimum expression. An almost naked frame, an involuntary Glass teen transcript that at least manages to hold a cast that will be very attractive to its audience, with an Anya Taylor-Joy who will stir up passions with her Magik, which is all that is dangerous and sexy that the character and his fans demand. And that is already much more than what Sophie Turner achieved last summer in X-Men: Dark Phoenix",The New Mutants

You'll see what I mean.
I expected this movie to be similar to Brightburn, and It had the potential to be as good, but fell short. For me Anya Taylor-Joy stole every scene she was in, and the other young actors also gave solid performances, but something was just missing... The ""horror"" aspect was sophomoric and probably won't impress veterans of the genre, and it rations out the mutant abilities at a snail's pace compared to other Marvel ""hero"" movies. When all the character building and exposition finally gives way to action, you've almost forgotten what type of film you were expecting, and then you are flooded with a heavily CGI dependent final scene that ties things up quickly... Supposedly to hurry on to filming the sequel...
I will give a generous 5.5 Stars. It's as good as Dark Phoenix even if it does lack the familiar mutant faces that we love to see.",The New Mutants

Well, nevermind that, none of them reappear here and the story isn't connected at all.There were so many great stories told in the New Mutants comics. Deadpool was introduced there. Wolverine had epic battles with their enigmatic leader, Cable. Beloved characters died, legacy characters were introduced. They were part of some of the best multi-part crossovers in 90's comics. Nothing about this movie has anything to do with the comic book and it comes across as a really cheap and disposable effort. It doesn't seem like the director was very serious about what they were doing, nor was the editor. Thousands of people were employed in making this, spent years on it, and it's complete garbage. What a waste.",The New Mutants

Also, I didn't really care about the main character at all! How is she going to control her powers?The best thing to me was the introduction of Magik (Illyana Rasputina)!!

It doesn't take itself so seriously and focuses on telling the story of bonding, friendship and self-realization. The occasional references to the X-Men were enjoyable. The VFX was good.

Might wanna pass that one off on voice coaches though.My last point isn't necessarily a failure. I know why its a slow burn and there's lot of character building.

As is it's not exciting enough to be memorable.Cool location, solid effects, good music, character profiles are great. I didn't have a problem with the teenage aspect.

Marvel has its own universe, so does DC now (copycats lol) and then there are the studios that had successes and misses... well, this one is not a big success but it isn't a miss either! There are great special effects, there's Maisie Williams and Anna Joy Taylor (great upcoming actresses!) and there's a good storyline (not the most elaborate one, but at least there's a storyline!) but... here it comes! But, you feel the restraint of the director, the lack of the potential that could have been! Maybe Boone should pull a Snyder and release his 'Boone cut' of the movie! Because this could (should!!) have been a horror movie like The Conjuring (it had that potential, believe me!)
Good effort though and sometime directors should listen less to the studios and make the movie they want to make!!!All in all a good movie, but it could have been better! Let's hope Disney dares to make the horrors (which I doubt) that we really want to see! Marvel has great characters and some of them are truly bad and scary...

The 39 metacritic score for this movie is waaaaaaay too harsh..Let's be honest, The New Mutants (TNM) lacks on a few fronts; the story brings nothing special or at least interesting to further expand or reflect on, the characters motivations and backstories are lacking or rushed, the acting and lines are often cringeworthy and last but not least; where's the horror? Just to name a few things that could made me understand the 39 metascore, BUT.TNM still somehow achieves to be a very entertaining movie! It's very cool to finally see a marvel movie trying to touch ground with the horror genre (even though it's not scary or gory at all). And the comic character 'Magik' is an amazing addition to the story (she could easily function in a standalone movie). There are some surprises here and there and the cgi is pretty good too.The movie had a constant flow between the positive and negative things mentioned above.

I'm not even sure that you can call it a ""movie"". It's a bunch of clips, bits and ideas that aren't really connected to each other nor focused.Director and writer of the film (Josh Boon) had an idea of a movie he wanted to make, that ""FOX"" did not approve of. Rather than hiring someone else, ""FOX"" got some writers, producer, directors and executives (with their own singular visions, different ideas and directions for the movie) to oversee/make re-writes/change parts of it/just coming up with something and making someone film it. This is a ""Frankenstein's Monster"" of a movie and that's probably why it had so many delays.
It's technically/objectively a ""bad movie"", that has all the parts that (could) define a ""bad movie""
Unconnected scenes, motivations that don't make sense, contradict themselves and don't mach the characters,
bad dialogue, that is written by a child,
Unfinished SGI etc.

But they blew it. No character development, no cohesion, bad acting with a couple of exceptions. Bad script and bad direction.Why a 7/10 then you ask ? Because I love the premise.

I'm sure I might anger some hardcore comic fans with this statement. But its originality is this movie's biggest strength: The New Mutants finally covers a topic about the X-Men franchise that was only scratched the surface of in the first movie: the body horror of young mutants discovering their frightening powers for the first time. The choice to elaborate on this topic using the horror genre as a vehicle is both genius and somewhat neccessary when you come to think about it. And it works extremely well: the movie has one of the griddiest anthmospheres in all of the movies and is genuinely scary at times (special nod to the genius design of the Smiley Men). The great CGI does it's part, as well as the score. All in all it's a technically well-made experience with a clear and distinct style overall.Another selling point is the character-driven plot, with every single one of the mutants being extremely likable, well-written and cast with talented actors. The makers of the movie decided to change major parts of the characters' biographies significantly, and it provides them with much more depth than was the case in the comics (again, I only read about their bios on the internet, I'm sorry if I might misrepresent the quality of the comics here).Of course, the movie also has its issues, with some major questions remaining unanswered and some plot holes kept empty - I could imagine one reason for this was the movie's difficult production process.

The main actor of the movie was by far my least favorite person in the whole movie. Their acting was sub par. Even when they would go to run, it looked like they were faking it. They don't deserve another feature film role.

The director doesn't make a good job, the cinematography is very conventional, but you could really think that this movie is a telefilm, a boring telefilm.
The movie is very small. It only takes place in one scenario and the cinematography is very weak, you'd think that this movie is a low budget movie, but not... it has a very big studio behind it.
The cast is very, very good, the actors try to be charismatic and cool, but the script is so bad and everything seems so forced that you lose the quality of the cast.
The VFX are good, but there aren't any action sequences till the first movie hour, what really makes the movie slow in his first two acts. The OST is conventional. The aren't horror scenes.

401,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,Um desastre anunciado!!,3,4 December 2020,"Este filme é aquele típico filme que ficou no forno demasiado tempo e acabou por se queimar. A prova disso é mesmo a altura em que o estúdio decidiu lançar o longa.
Não sendo injusto o filme apresenta até uma plot interessante e oferece algo diferente aos gênero de super heróis. Afinal são 5 pessoas que toda a sua vida foram lhes dito que tudo o que fizeram foi somente culpa deles e por isso passaram grande parte a tentar perdoar-se por aquilo que fizeram e consequentemente abdicando de parte da sua vida a residir num hospital que prometia ser a cura para todos os males.
As sequências de ação são ok, apesar de haver alguns momentos em que o CGI vai de férias, mas no geral é seguro dizer que o entretenimento é mais ou menos garantido.
Onde eu vejo a maior fragilidade é no argumento. Para começar as personagens são demasiados clichês. Temos a rapariga que ninguém gosta, o rapaz que é um convencido, a rapariga simpática e o rapaz simpático. Isto de certa forma até podia funcionar, se tivessem dado ao trabalho de desenvolver os personagens, mas decidiram deixar o desenvolvimento de lado o que fez com que o apego que o público podesse eventualmente ter criado/criar se dissipasse completamente.
O segundo erro, foi a decisão de construir a personagem principal, e praticamente a história toda, em cima da dúvida de ""Qual será o poder dela"", pois não demorou muito a mostrar-se uma tentativa frustrada na medida que quase no início deu para perceber qual era o poder dela o que fez com que a sensação de que o filme não tinha mais para contar crescesse a cada segundo que passava.
Uma última nota é que existe alguns traços de terror, apesar de parecem ter desistido da ideia, ou simplesmente foi extremamente mal executado, apesar de ser interessante fazer cada personagem conviver com cada um dos seus medos.Nota: ⭐ (3/10)",The New Mutants

The performances are good and the characters are interesting enough that I would like to see them again in a sequel if they get one.

This movie left me speechless.,The New Mutants
407,austinbmoney,We Waited Several Years For A Sub Par Superhero Movie,6,24 September 2020,"I just want to start off by saying that no major motion picture has never had as many production issues as this film did. The New Mutants was supposed to come out over two years ago, ended up being delayed four times, went through extensive reshoots, and then was finally released in the middle of a pandemic. Unfortunately, some of those production issues are both very present, and very noticeable in this film. The basic plot of this film is that it takes place in the X-Men universe, and is about all of these teenagers who have just discovered that they have powers, and they are put in a facility where they are meant to learn to control their newfound abilities. However, something more sinister is afoot at the facility, and it is up to them to figure it out before it is too late.
The one thing that I will say that this film does is that it introduces a fantastic concept. The whole idea for this film is so interesting, and isn't something that we have ever really seen before in the superhero genre. Unfortunately, that is where the production issues come in, because after this interesting idea is introduced, the film turns into a very generic run of the mill action/horror movie, that chooses to make most of its cast unlikeable, and ultimately chooses to have nothing happen until the last half hour of the film. The actors themselves do a good enough job, but their characters are all given these attitudes that make them so unlikeable up until they team up towards the end of the film. The CGI in this movie is also very spotty at times, and the viewer can totally tell which scenes had to go through reshoots, and given how expensive those reshoots were, the final product should have been much better. Also, as I mentioned earlier, there is not much that happens throughout a good portion of the film, the first forty five minutes to an hour are spent having most of the cast arguing and just doing random activities throughout the facility. One other thing that is worth pointing out is the director of this film, Josh Boone. He has only directed two other films, and they were both teen romances, Stuck In Love, and The Fault In Our Stars. The audience can actually see elements of those in this film because a big part of the plot is a love story between two of the characters who meet in the facility. That aspect of the film was particularly well done, however I don't know if it really needed to be included in a superhero horror/action film.
From superhero movie standards, this is not a good movie. It was heavily advertised as a horror movie, despite there being almost no scares, and the action doesn't really come until the end of the film, so the audience is ultimately left watching nothing happen for about seventy five percent of the film. While the acting is good, the characters are made extremely unlikeable, and the special effects are really awful at times. The last half hour of the film does make up for some of the many issues that this film has in the first hour, but it is definitely far from a perfect film. Despite the many flaws this movie has, it still has many enjoyable moments, and I would be really interested to see the route they would take if they ever did make a sequel to it.",The New Mutants

It felt kind of rushed at some parts and also it is way to short
if the planned sequels came out it would be amazing it really is a shame that these amazing characters are getting dumped in the trash so quicklyIf it came out in 2018 then i think it would have been appreciated and yeah.It also could have been a lot scarier and if fox had the support for this movie it could have been really good but it would definetly scare young kids and the smiley men were kinda creepy aswell if only they could have actually tried to harm them it may ave been a litlle bit betterI guess at this point we should be relieved that it came out but i still found it enjoyable and even good enough to be in the MCUThe acting was great and the characters were great aswellThis movie gets way more hate than it deservesI'd say Rahnes fear is one of the most disturbing parts of the movie and when Dr. Reyes gets eaten by demon bearI think every Marvel or Horror fan should try this out",The New Mutants
410,charleski2000,Avoid if you read a lot of comics. Watch if you don't.,8,22 January 2021,"There are a lot of negative reviews here, and I'm not going to say they're wrong. This is not a film for anyone who's heavily invested in the Marvel mutant ecosphere. Put bluntly, if you read a lot of comics you won't like the film, but if you last picked up a superhero comic 20yrs ago this is worth a look. The film retreads a lot of tropes that will be overly familiar to some, but it's trying to show elements of this slice of culture that haven't made it to the big flashy pictures.Personally, I liked it. This is definitely a result of the female stars, who put in performances that are really worth seeing. Maisie Williams is splendid, and shows an increase in her depth that's rarely found from other child stars. But the star is Blu Hunt, and that's so blatantly obvious that it's bizarre to find she's not at the top of the bill in the credits. I can only assume that Maisie Williams and Anna Taylor-Joy had better agents, but those agents really haven't done them any favours in this case, because it leaves you with a sense of injustice.",The New Mutants

It's difficult to do in a 2 hour film with many new characters. A single character like Deadpool gives you the time you need to tell the story, unlike Suicide Squad, where there were too many heroes and not nearly enough story.The New Mutants were supposed just to be a introduction to the characters for us so the story wouldn't be lost or ruined.

Had to have the 'teenage' girls in a couple (unseen to audiences) nude scenes where the cameras and studio people got to see them naked and make it sexual in several parts and comments. What a crappy writer etc. Everything doesn't have to be sexual. We all know what goes on in real life with many camera angles and easily hidden cameras and getting young Hollywood girls in positions to get nude for the not revealed scenes 'to the audience', but do you really have to do it to our favorite comics and especially a teen comic? Did it really have to have shower scenes and young teens getting hot and turned on by each other? Yeah real life has it, but a teen comic movie, really? Rahne and Dani especially, their connection in the comic wasn't sexual, it could be like sisters or best close friends with deep shared personal experiences and connection that way. It was a really cool teen Marvel comic, my favorite, in fact, and this just cheapened it. Too bad, really. With a different writer etc this may have been really good.
Also, such a over used generic message to close it out too.. who hasn't heard that, over used a hundred hundred times.. bear, dog whatever. It was like it was written for 5 year-olds. The special fx were good, but too limited. They didn't do an end scene or after credit scene because they knew it wasn't done very well & wouldn't be well liked ( not just covid and delays).
Too bad Stan wasn't here to make this movie better. Too bad The Avengers Iron Man Cap etc writers and producers weren't here to help. I am still a true New Mutants fan and liked most of the actors so I gave them a 6, but the movie just fell far short.

I'm not familiar with The new Mutants so much as I am a fan of the core team. But have read some of their stories.This movie is different from the others as it has less action. There's an attempt at character study but they can't seem to focus. For me, the romance part can be left out as it adds nothing to the story or dynamic. Some side-glances and hints are OK but no, they want to shove it down our throats. I mean can't a group of teenagers be in the same place and just be friends and a good teammates? They don't strike me as in need of a relationship while trying to figure out what and who they are.Without it I would give it a 7.5.",The New Mutants

Should of been R rated and less blah blah blah. Nothing really happens until an hour in and the the big climax is about 20 minutes drawn out with a lame ending to tie it all together. The mention of the X-men and Essex Corp lets you know it's marvel...

I spent the entire movie trying to figure out who I was supposed to like or root for. I don't know why this hospital exists, why the characters are in it or, and this is important, why there was only one ""doctor"".
The movie ended like it began. There was a group of teens that I had no knowledge of or feelings for. Things happened to them, it ended and I feel nothing. I'm not excited for a sequel. It won't matter if the characters make an appearance in the MCU.
Not to put to fine a point on it but I'll rewatch Green Lantern before I bother with this show again and it irritates me. Like like Maisie Williams and Anya Taylor-Joy, it would have been something to see them decked out in hero attire.

Took my youngest daughter to see it in the theaters, and she says it's her favorite movie. Watched it again with the wife and both my daughters and they all really liked it. I didn't have any problems watching it again because Magik is legit. Now the accent from the actress that plays her is not so great, neither is smug look she tried to wear constantly. Sam's accent isn't that great either, but you can't help but like him a bit.It's not Avengers, it's not xmen, it's more of a teens end up in this place because their powers are dangerous and things may not be what they seem with the ""doctor"" and the company behind her. Let any expectations go, it's not a horror movie, it's not a scary movie, but as my 10 year old said ""that movie makes me anxious"", but it is still a mutant, coming of age, superhero genre film.

462,osborneshawn,About What I Expected,6,5 September 2020,"No, its not a great movie. But it isn't terrible either. A very predictable tale with some decent special effects. Acting is okay. Anya Taylor Joy stands out as Magik and her character is the most interesting of the bunch. There is nothing new being offered here but its about what I expected based on the trailers.",The New Mutants
463,dustingonzalez41,Potential,5,15 April 2021,"First things first, the concept of this movie is honestly very strong. Young, dangerous, and vulnerable mutants being worked up to eventually be controlled by a bad organization that IS in fact connected to 'Logan', is a great idea. The problem was it's execution, mainly the directing and writing. You can tell there were production cuts for sure but I still feel like the directing didn't know what it wanted to be, you can't tell if the idea of the film was to make a much smaller film about mutants or a kinda bigger film about powerful mutants that could potentially join x-men. The characters are never properly developed and most of the dialogue is very weak which turns the movie being boring. The idea that all the kids are there because they are dangerous and killed people is neat but it doesn't make sense, these mutants aren't powerful enough to take out one doctor that's by herself in a barely running hospital but they clearly are well suited to take out some monsters. Except, they nerfed their power at the end for a lame attempt to have to get the main character to have her moment. Weirdly, the characters are all pretty interesting and all have interesting powers and personalities but again, they were never developed properly and they just felt empty at the end. Again, it was mainly bad writing. The accents accents were pretty bad, but Obviously those actors would have done better under a better director, and there is proof to that. I honestly did not have a problem by how little the action was because it did feel small but then they built them up to be powerful and it turned out underwhelming by the end. They really should have just given the idea to someone else to write and direct it.I do disagree with many of the 1 star reviews here tho, people saying this is the worst film they have ever seen clearly don't watch many movies, which honestly is good for them because there are seriously much worse movies that come out every year. But also a lot of the criticism is absurdly senseless. Most of the 1 star reviews are from people that have no idea how to watch a film. They literally explain all their questions throughout the film, yeah they do it badly and boringly but nothing in this movie is confusing. The worst criticism is how does it have to be connected to the x-men. Mutants exists outside of the x-men in the comics as well it doesn't have to be an x-men movie and it wasn't advertised as so. Again, I imagine the criticism is mostly from people that don't know how to watch films or have watched many films, as well as read an x-men comic. Either way I suppose it doesn't matter because Fox x-men is dead, it is unfortunate that we will probably never see these characters again because if you know anything about mutants in the comics, those are some pretty popular characters with actual good stories to tell.",The New Mutants
464,jerzio13,Kind of underrated,8,5 December 2020,I thought it was great storytelling and it was a great beginning to something that could become more in time. It might even be something that would be better suited to be a series.,The New Mutants
465,shmishe,Not horrible but could have been so much better,6,7 September 2020,"It's a very confusing film. It's like it tried to be something but then didn't know what it wanted to be. Almost like identity crisis. It's not a horrible film by any means like some of the other reviews say but it would have worked so much better if it was a tv series instead. We simply didn't get to spend enough time with the characters. What bothered me the most in this film is the wasted potential of some of them. We never really see the full powers of the strongest character and the accents are bad. Some stuff is not explained and pulled out of thin air and some moments are outright silly. Still, it's a watchable film.",The New Mutants

It did manage to bridge the gap between X-Men and the horror of what could go wrong when mutants lose control of their powers.The horror aspects were very unexpected and reminded me of the superhero series Legion and a horror movie called Before I Wake.Overall it was an interesting concept that unfortunately had been done before in an episode of Titans.Marvel did a fairly good job of making it dark but still with the Marvel touch to the humanity of the characters but their development was a bit choppy.A lot of the backstories to the characters requires a bit of research which is why that video helps. But the movie could easily stand alone as a horror even if it wasn't connected to Marvel.It was nice though that they did include enough clues about the bigger Marvel/X-Men universe which kept it interesting.Overall, was somewhat anticlimactic but had a positive message.

Where do I even start... I was really excited to see Marvel movies try to explore a new genre for them, but this movie was underwhelming at best. The movie takes itself too seriously yet doesn't take it to the point of being scary enough. If they made a horror comedy maybe it would have worked better? Most of the time I felt that the plot jumps from one story to another without taking the time to tell any of them properly. Characters are a bunch of cliches and present nothing of themselves. They almost had a good moment making the viewer guess who was in the pool with Sunspot but then instantly reveal what it is. There's simply no catch, no mystery - everything is obvious, everything is what you think it is. The main villain is... a bear. Yes, you read right. I expected the evil doctor to be killed by her own worst fear but she was just eaten by a bear. Then they had to fight the bear so he doesn't eat everyone else. The fight was so cringey, I just didn't care about it at all. The only emotion I felt after the end is sadness that I didn't spend my time watching something good.",The New Mutants

The passing, the plot, the interactions between characters lack something that make you care, so you probably will start looking to the clock waiting for the end.

I also enjoyed some of the tone setting throughout. The powers are interesting and leave me wanting to see more (sequel territory),I also found the story set up very interesting. I just honestly think this movie would've been a good filler and building movie after Days of Future Past. Magik absolutely 100% takes over the show,her story is intriguing,her powers are awesome, and the acting is great. The only character I thought should've been replaced was Moonstar..I just found her to be very boring and to have sub par acting. The rest of the cast was amazing and I thought meshed well together.

Theres a fight scene near the end that is endless, unbelievable, really repetitive.

It was so obvious what was going on but they dragged on every single story element and repeated it. I feel bad for these actors; Truly a waste of money and talent.Part of the reason it was so bad is because it has an intellectual level of Spy Kids, super predictable and stereotypical moments but placed and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth.

But no. They have to throw in every leftover ideas from past X-Men and Wolverine movies to come up with this trash. Poor script, cliché acting, annoying CGI and to top it all off a lesbian scene.

With Josh Boone as director, all the characters' background and personality were defined pretty well (albeit some cliches) and relationships were defined naturally. Along with the actors, visually it is appealing on all levels, and the story is crafted so it is an isolated story and smoothly told. At the end, It does feel pretty lackluster due to it being a superhero movie (but still not that laughable 22% rating).

""The New Mutants,"" has been on my radar for the past several years as it has gone through development circle of hell after development circle of hell. I am pleased to say that it has satisfied all of my hopes, serving as a truly revitalizing film in what has become a somewhat tired franchise. Is this film perfect? No. It has its moments of the expected superhero team-up cliches, unnecessary teen drama, and the occasional clunky editing, but what it lacks for in technical prowess, it makes up for in pure energy. This is a film that reaches out from the screen and grabs it audience, pulling you into a world that is familiar, but also, pardon the term, new. It is a world that is biting, real and often frightening. It is a world that is worth the wait.",The New Mutants

As for the concept of horror ... MEH ... it's not really horror, it has a little bit of horror but nothing spectacular, and I wouldn't put it under the category of horror. I loved all the characters, especially the character of Magik (Anya Taylor-Joy), it's a shame that we won't see these characters and their stories anymore since it is the closing chapter of the X-Men saga with FOX.
Probably all the delays that occurred with this movie affected it in one way or another, especially because most of the people will expect too much and be disappointed, but give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is. At least it's WAY better than X-men Dark Phoenix.",The New Mutants

Read the comics most of my life starting in the 80's and they have always been my favorite comic book characters. That said, I don't have blinders on where the movies are concerned. Some have been great (X-Men 2, X-Men Days of Future Past, Logan, Deadpool...) some have been ok and some downright disappointing (X-Men 3, X-Men Apocalypse...).The New Mutants falls somewhere in the middle area for me. There are a lot of things I really liked about it but a few things holding it back from being great.Overall I enjoyed it. Most of my few complaints didn't ruin the movie and in the long run feel inconsequential (since this is the last of the Fox X-Men films before Disney wipes the slate clean and does their own spin on the Marvel mutants).The cast is great. The characters felt like they we're given time to develop and feel realized (at least as much as you can do in an hour and half or so)... the final battle has some really cool moments. Magik in particular has some kick ass scenes.Spoiler below...
The biggest shame to me, besides the fact we won't see this iteration of these characters on screen again, is that the Essex plot will go unresolved. The X-Men films have been teasing and laying the groundwork for Essex to be a main villain for some time now. This film probably did the most to prepare us for a confrontation with Mr. Sinister. It is a shame that never came to fruition.Anyway, I liked this movie. I am excited to see what Disney does with the mutants. But I am also a bit sad this is the end of the Fox era. Even though Fox has been hit or miss with it's efforts where the mutant films are concerned, where were some really good films to come out of it and The New Mutants was an interesting expansion of that universe.",The New Mutants

After that, there was no any new information about the movie. Finally, it was released a day ago and gave me a heart attack.Having seen the movie, I am wondering if the reason why they kept postponing the release date of the movie was when they were in the post-production, they found how ridiculous the movie is and tried to save it but to no avail, and had prepared to take the backlash from the audience.First of all, what kind of 20 century Fox + Marvel movie only features six people in a movie? Only six people in a institution? That is definitely a hint that this movie will be unsatisfying when we all know it's from Marvel. The story is overly easy and lacks any respect for the Marvel fans.Second of all, this movie concept is for horror movie instead of for superhero, which makes it so weird to watch and cringeworthy. I wouldn't tell you why, but I can tell you that the similar element is also in ""The nightmare on elm street"".Lastly, the CGI is the worst. How much did they even put aside for making this movie?

After the initial 15 minutes, the movie picks up, it is a better flow with dialogue, it makes more sence.
A portion in the middle is also off, probably again due to editing.

The film tells the story it wants to tell, but once that's over, now what? There's a positive, uplifting feeling at the end. The group did not entirely get the therapy they needed, but together, they can conquer their inner demons.It's a nice message of togetherness, but sadly, the group are each given just enough backstory (comprised of their worst memories/fears) and that's mostly it, with little else. The women of the group fare better than the men, in terms of development, but that's both a praise and a complaint. I wish the group had been given equal amounts of personality development. But suffice to say: the one you expect to be the standout character absolutely *is* that standout character. But she is No One.The other reviews that mention fluctuating accents and plot holes... Well, to be fair, I noticed some of that here and there (for instance, why is the rich kid the only one shown doing manual labor?) but not enough to bother me.Still, its a breezy 94 minutes.

It says a lot that even I noticed how bad and inconsistent these were.The backstories were glossed over and only partially explored for the most part with glaring holes in most of them.The ""hospital"" setting was not set up, explained, or even logically consistent.

It wasn't a full blown, dark, twisted horror movie like many were expecting but it felt like they did a fairly well enough job incorporating the horror aspects they were working with into the plot and setting. It might not be worth the Blu-Ray or multiple viewings but it was definitely enjoyable as a change of pace during this quarantine.Those who are calling this movie boring have been over stimulated by the copy and paste, non-stop action superhero movies that have polluted the genre for years and can't sit through a ""superhero"" movie without constant explosions. Especially looking at that ending, slendermen and a colossal sized demon bear fighting a witch with her pet dragon is considered ""boring"" nowadays?We should be encouraging movies like this attempting to push the superhero genre out of it's tropes and cliches we've been desensitized to over the years.

565,medic061076,Where's the other half?,1,12 June 2021,Fox does Marvel on a small budget. Unfinished and seemingly missing the second half. It's a sorry excuse of a movie that doesn't do the actors any favours to their careers. Oh well won't get that 90minutes back.,The New Mutants
566,javierbaron2008,Psychological cages,8,8 September 2020,"The New Mutants (2020) Dir. Josh Boone.
Taking as a common thread the Cherokee legend of the two internal wolves (in this case, bears) that represent the conflict of antagonistic internal forces in each individual, 'The New Mutants', takes us into the fierce inner battles that five cloistered youths wage in a kind of psychiatric hospital trying to make their dark side visible and face it to find a balance between who they are and the individual powers that segregate them and make them different from others.
I understand that negative comments are emerging around the new Marvel proposal: The New Mutants is completely different from the tone that has characterized that universe and that of the X-Men in particular.
From the fusion of action and thriller that predominated in the two previous stages of the mutants, we have a new beginning that bets on psychological terror. A walk through the dark corners of the psyche.
The five are in charge of a doctor who, in addition to the daily group sessions, monitors them day and night, in an obsessive exercise of auscultation, completely denying them any vestige of privacy. Located in the middle of nowhere and with an insurmountable energy field surrounding the facilities, they are totally isolated. They only have themselves.
Marvel enthusiasts will be somewhat baffled by a new narrative treatment that bets on examining the deep fears of these new mutants, leaving behind the eye-catching of long action sequences and special effects, focusing on the psychological cages that keep them as social outcasts by not knowing how to handle with care their personality and the powers that they involuntarily possess.
Personally, I like the 180 ° turn in the narrative nuances with a gloomy and claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the interaction of the mutants and leads you to sympathize with them because of the oppression they suffer.
The characters, in general, are well chiseled leaving unknowns that, I suppose, will be cleared up in future installments.
Now I understand why there were reshoots and several postponements of its premiere. Marvel being now owned by Disney, it is a film at times, too dark that bursts into narrative territories and tonal scales that Disney is not used to traveling.",The New Mutants

It's actually a really good film.I can honestly say that I mostly loathe 20th Century Fox's 'X-Men' adaptations. The stand alone 'Wolverine' movies range from entertaining to pretty good, and I do like 'First Class', but apart from those I mostly consider them to be convoluted disasters with poor characterization, and their presentation makes suspension of disbelief nearly impossible.'New Mutants' is quite the opposite, taking place in a confined setting, limiting the number of characters, and actually taking the time to set them up and build the world. The characters come across as sincere, and the actors all do a great job.It also makes the bold choice of using alot of horror elements as its' vehicle for storytelling, but it retains enough of its' comic book super-hero fantasy origin so as not to alienate its' target audience. It's interesting, because I always thought that if I were offered the job of making an X-Men movie, my templates would probably be David Cronenberg's 'Scanners' and 'Village of the Damned'.I had actually heard very little about it, and most of what I had heard was negative, but I would recommend giving it a shot.",The New Mutants

It's not a horror movie neither a superhero movie. It's doing its own thing in a very bad way. The only decent thing about this was were the kids backstories but they were so rushed in the end I just couldn't connect with any character. I didn't care if any anybody would've died.

587,alexnielsen-98723,A unique x men movie but you have to understand what the director had to go through while creating the movie,7,8 September 2020,Before I give the overview of the film the film has been delayed five times and the script was being written by five people. Disney buying fox also created more changes. The movie had lots of planned things like having the young Charles Xavier and mr. Sinister who would become the leader of the essex company who hunts down Wolverine and x23. The film was planned to be part of a trilogy as well.The film follows Danielle who ends up in this mental hospital. She doesn't remember how she got their and the doctor says that you are here to protect you from yourself. She and a couple of other mutants are in this facility. One good thing here unlike most horror films is that the characters are interesting. Their backstories aren't the most unique but still intriguing The movie does start off pretty slow but once the second half the movie starts it gets pretty interesting. The acting here is really good. The sequences of the horror are handled well. Fox actually wanted a young adult film and Josh boom wanted a horror movie.This movie gets a 8 out of ten. A comic book movie that uses horror is finally here and it is used well where it doesn't take to much away from what the movie series at the core.,The New Mutants

The artwork looks to have been created around the 1990s, albeit not in a very innovative manner. It's a little undercooked, making it unappealing as a superhero picture, drama, or horror thriller. A huge and enticing budget cannot compensate for an image that is completely out of date.""An irrational, incoherent, and bizarrely expensive attempt to reimagine the superhero genre."" The movie is mildly amusing but ultimately uninteresting. The final installment in Fox's X-Men franchise is a letdown. The horror elements in The New Mutants do not appear to be particularly frightening, and the film falls flat as a superhero film.

600,barisaxnate,Adolescence is a Nightmare,6,28 August 2020,"*Minor Spoilers*
Many people will be asking, ""Was the wait worth it?"" My answer is yes. This movie is exactly what I wanted from a superhero horror movie. Don't go in to this movie expecting a typical superhero movie. This is a horror movie with superheros.
I think the two main reasons this movie kept getting pushed back is because it is very gay and very scary. In my opinion, those are good things. We need more gay horror superhero movies! This is not the mainstem superhero movie that Disney wants it to be. I think this is true to the director's vision.
My biggest issue with the film is that it isn't subtle with its imagery, but most superhero movies aren't.
I think that this movie will probably be compared to Glass. This movie is better than Glass, which I did like. New Mutants has an exciting third act. Some people might criticize it for falling into the superhero movie trap, but I think it's done well here.
If you are looking for a horror movie with superhero elements, I would reccomend this movie.",The New Mutants

602,chancehuffman,I wanted to love this movie,6,28 August 2020,"Was so happy to finally see this movie we've all been anticipating for 3 years. However, I left the theater feeling somewhat empty.The movie began with a thunderous punch, which I had seen already when it was released on YouTube. That energy was quickly stifled with a slow crawl of story progression for the next two acts. What kept me involved was the charming performance of Maisie Williams.I could see what Boone was going for conceptually and within the story, but it all fell flat. Every reveal about the characters felt shoehorned in. The situational tension felt manufactured and unnatural, only serving the purpose of revealing specific Elements. Given the pace of the movie, more creative things could have been done to progress the stories naturally; but, scenes and shots were Continuously recycled.Anya Taylor Joy is always a delight to watch, the camera loves her. Her character had so much potential but she ended up feeling generic, despite a few moments of levity and one sentimental scene. We had already seen everything about her in the trailers, unfortunately. She went from badass to a crybaby too often. Wish her arc would have lead to more of an emotional and energetic reveal, but she kept being used to spice up the movie intermittently. Her action scene at the end felt flat and anticlimactic because of this.Blu Hunt held the lead role well, but didn't have much emotional range. There should have been more of her dealing with the knowledge that she killed her father and entire village. That's all swept away by the dues ex machina of her father just coming in a dream to say ""she's strong"". It was cheap and undeserved and almost unexpected. There was nothing throughout the movie to make us feel like it was necessary or what she needed. Just a lazy Trope to lead to the anti climactic ending. I enjoyed the mysticism behind her story. But in the end, her power only works when she sleeps?The third act action scene was a mess. It goes form cannonball getting involved in the fight but we don't really see him do anything, then it jump cuts to the bear attacking the other two girls. What happened to cannonball and Majik??!! And the other characters don't do much to stop the attack either, but it doesn't ever show them all working together. They just power up, try to fight for a second, then get their asses handed to them. Who's idea was this to neuter everyone?!!!I really wanted to love this movie, and there are moments I enjoyed, and I did enjoy what the actors brought to the characters. But it took a concept with plenty of mystery behind it, and characters with so much potential for incredible arcs and growth, and instead just relied to heavily on tropes and forced situations to move the story forward unnaturally. And then just butchering the end action sequence by revealing too much of their powers Early without showing us their struggles, promising that when we see them that it will be awesome, then barely giving us anything from them at the end other than getting their asses beat. Did M knight Shamalan have a say In this.I recommend The New Mutants cuz it's a new movie and dear God it's been so long since we've been to a theater. It has its entertainment value and charm, but it falls flat and is forgettable. It's also sad to know there's no tie in with anything else marvel; and therefore this will be all we get from theses characters. It'd be nice to see Majik somewhere down the road. Maybe knowing that this was our only chance to get to explore these characters, and seeing it done so generically, that ultimately leads to my overall take on this film.",The New Mutants
603,nathaliebazinga,Save your money and ho watch Chronicle (2012) instead,5,20 November 2020,"With a $60 million budget I feel like the producer scammed the investors and took 90% of the money an fled. Apart from the 10 minute CGI and 5 actors I have no idea what they spent the money on. The movie Chronicle (2012) was filmed with 12 million bucks and still turned out way better and at least managed to depict the characters in such a way that you can relate to them or understand their thoughts or feelings. In this movie however, there is zero personality depth or development. The characters are very unrelatable and the storyline is dull. The only reason I gave it a 5 star is because I think Anya Taylor Joy and Charlie Heaton are gems.

As you can see in the trailer they are ""trapped"" in some sort of bubble but that's never really utilized to maximum effect. Really, I think it's just used to keep the story in one, confined place. On top of that there's a limited cast and therefore only 1 ""doctor"" in the entire ""facility"". If it wasn't obvious yet, they kept the costs down.And that may have worked had the rest of the movie been better. The story has been done before. And that's ok. But unfortunately the story is also weak. I'm not one to give out spoilers but if you do decide to watch this movie you're going to have a lot of ""... but that could have been done way sooner"". It's also quite predictable.So, anyway, 2 stars for me. I could go up to 3 stars maybe, but I'm rounding down rather than up to at least combat the fake high score reviews a little.

You're good with a stranger claiming to be a doctor sticking needles in your arm the next day and the explanation that you might be a prepubescent mutant is plausible.This movie moved on way too quickly from something a reasonable audience would be gripped by. The anticipation of finding out the cause of the first scene's events had me invested in the story. But the lukewarm response from Dani turned me off rather quickly. I can't buy that your father's wisdom was something you treasured and would eventually lead you to ""saving the day"" if your reaction to his death, a gruesome, unexplained death, has about a half a day's grief attached to it. This literally doesn't fit into the timespan of the movie.If you don't have the time to make a movie that doesn't match emotional response with tragedy, love, loss, etc., then expect negative responses when tell the audience to go long in the beginning only to fake the throw and hit your check down.This is a good idea, the movie plot, but missed out on being a great movie because of an early and monumental letdown in storytelling.",The New Mutants

621,brennan-jones98,The underdog X-Film,7,28 August 2020,"This movie has been through probably one of the most difficult journeys to get to it's release. No it's not perfect but it for sure worth my time to finally see it! As a major x-men fan, I didn't know a whole lot about the new mutants roster & story so I tried to go in not knowing exactly what would happen. The major name/character drops & teases were awesome and I'm sad they won't get to further explore those!The actors did great with their accents & portrayals of the new mutants! Braga played Dr. Reyes in a way that made you question whether her every motive but also wonder if she was good or not. Zaga, Peters, Taylor-Joy, & Heaton were great in their scenes, Hunt as Danielle wasn't the greatest actor at times, but definitely fit the role in my eyes.Considering the direction the series was going to go, they did good with it. You could tell a few things were shoe-horned in for the sake of this being the only film to be completed. The New Mutants story was on the shorter side, but also felt satisfactory considering they wanted to tell an effective storyline that wouldn't also bring in the other major players in the X-Men.They definitely could have pushed the thriller/dark aspect of the film much more. Considering it was marketed as that, it didn't really have much eerie-feel. But still, a unique and different comic book film.Despite some opinions, the cast was picked very well & the movie is worth seeing for those who are big x-men/marvel/superhero Fans!",The New Mutants
622,endershadow_01,Its worth a try. It's not all that bad.,8,28 August 2020,":: Quick note for comic fans. What I will be reviewing is the New Mutants film itself not the comics nor it's inaccuracies from the demon bear Saga of New Mutants.::The New Mutants for me was a breath of fresh air from what can only be described as a bombardment of the same story in super hero films. Whether to save money or just trying something new the film sets it focus on six characters unraveling each of their dysfunctions slowly. It Centers on Dani Moonstar being put into a kind of Institution after her father and her whole tribe is wiped out by some unseen force. In the institution she's put with mutants like herself who have all suffered because of their new mutant abilities. Teenage Drama ensues as Dani finds a love interest in Rayne Sinclair (Maisie Williams) another patient/prisoner with the ability to become a wolf. Then everything is turned on its ear when the Institutions only doctor tries to murder Moonstar and the whole Hospital suddenly becomes Hill house complete with Smiling men, blood ash raining from the ceiling and a Demon Bears. It turns out Dani was born with the mutant ability to manifest everyones deepest fear. Giving it hands and legs so I can hurt them. The Demon bear feed by all of Dani's adolescent insecurities and fears destroyed her tribe and killed her father. After ripping the whole institution apart and almost killing her new friends Dani confronts her fear sending it away. Anyone who is tired of the same old thing done to death will find this film an absolute joy with a touch of horror and just a pinch John Hughes. If you give it a chance you might be surprised.",The New Mutants
623,bmwjoe28,"Not just another X-Men movie, something different",7,15 September 2020,"Having read X-men and its family of books for 30 years, and knowing about the various delays and edits, I was wary but hopeful. This film exceeded my expectations by not being overly silly and comic book-y, and having obvious horror feel with a small cast in a claustrophobic setting. There are only minor references to the X-Universe, and then Essex, but that's really it. The characters have their own story and are allowed to show who they are and why they are there; not just existing to move the story to a bigger narrative or introduce other characters. It can work as a stand alone film, like ""Logan"", or be enjoyed as part of the X-Universe. I think it's well done, and has solid music by Mark Snow.",The New Mutants

The story was predictable, any fan of sci-fi/fantasy would see the plot reveal coming a third of the way in. But the movie as a whole definitely wasn't as bad a Dark Phoenix.

Sunspot- bootleg Johnny Storm
Wolfsbayne- a poor man's Wolverine
Cannonball- who's only power is to fly; yet he takes flight like a drunken kamikaze who inspires to be on Jackass
Moonstar- who's power is later revealed in the movie so I won't spoil that. I tell you their names in comics cuz it otherwise isn't revealed in the storyAdmittedly idk much about this series. Which imo gives it a clean slate to wow since I have no expectations. But boy did these ninjas disappoint. The movie could be best described as a psychological thriller version of Twilight meets every CW show ever. Who makes a superhero movie w/o a tangible villain. Hopefully this can be the start of something but I can't say this is a franchise I'd care to invest much else in. This might've been better as a TV show or even a stageplay.If filming/production occurred in the midst of the Rona Outbreak I might be a lil more leniant of the final product but this was a film that added lil to no value to the franchise; it's on par w/ the last F4 movieWAKANDA FOREVER

Unfortunately Disney buying FOX stopped that from happening before the movie was even out. That is really a shame, because as a fan of the New Mutants I found this quite enjoyable, if somewhat overly grimdark. I especially liked that Magik was allowed to keep her magical abilities, even though the FOX X-Men universe never really had supernatural elements before. (However, they did have aliens out of nowhere in the last movie.) That said, if seeing these characters in live-action for the first time isn't a selling point for you this movie is definetly skippable. It's fine as a stand-alone mildy scary young-adult-novel-like flick to watch on when bored, but that's about it. No major flaws, but nothing impressive either.",The New Mutants

636,katiesalbrux,I've tried,6,25 November 2020,"I gave it a 6 fresh out of the cinema, but now I feel like I have to share my thoughts, because in retrospect I wouldn't even give it a 4.
Why? Because this movie was so forgettable (almost like dark phoenix) I feel bad for watching it before they closed all cinemas (I wish I saw another movie altogether.. Something fun.)
The plot is kinda dumb and there are plot holes everywhere. I don't get why they had to cut out basically half the movie, there just wasn't any time getting to know the characters or properly submerging into the story. It should have gotten a higher rating and shown us the good stuff (like Deadpool).
The characters are stereotypical and boring, and the star of the movie? Blu Hunt? Jesus, she couldn't act to save her life! I've heard she's kind of a big deal in the US, but honestly, I just saw another Bella Swan. She couldn't display one believable emotion through the whole movie. It could have been bad writing, I wouldn't know, but she annoyed me so much I had to roll my eyes every time she was on screen. The relationship in the movie (between Dani and Rahne, you know, wolf-girl) was Twilight-like: rushed, unexplained and completely unnecessary. I mean, they spent together one day and fell in love like that. No. Just... No. They didn't even KNOW each other at all.
The big.. Bear.. Thingy.. Was the cherry on top, especially when Dani just walked up to the thing and petted it into submission. Seriously.
On the top side: Anya Taylor-Joy was the only enjoyable thing in the whole movie. I liked her character and she's a fine actress. I would watch a movie based on her story alone (without I-don't-have-emotions-but-you-have-to-like-me Dani).",The New Mutants

Without spoiling it, graphically to certain people it can be a horror, but it's more of a psychologic horror in my opinion.The story is different from the X-Men franchise, but it introduces new characters and it's a nice change from the X-Men. Well thought out with a balancing storyline, alluring with exciting moments, sometimes jumpy, enjoyable and a strong character build.The New Mutants released date kept changing, as someone who waited for this to be released, I'm happy how it turned out in the end.

Hasn't the horror genre suffered C- ratings galore from critics who want Shakespearean dramas only?For me this was an equally honest way of telling of 5 mutants who came of age and developed powers than the other X-men movies where there was less terror, principally because you didn't get a back story of all the Evil mutants under Magneto.Fine acting, believable circumstances, and the right pace for terror (not horror) make this a different, but acceptable contribution to the franchise.",The New Mutants

It was thought that this film would continue the storylines that were teased in the closing credits of the most recent X-Men films, including Logan.However, this film is now the final installment in what was a very successful franchise for Fox Studios. Unfortunately, The New Mutants is a mediocre film at best and a needless addition to the X-Men cinematic universe. Very little background is given on the characters, which makes them difficult to like and impossible for the viewers to sympathize with.The budding romance which develops between Rahne and Dani feels forced and shallow. It's so poorly written that it makes Anakin and Padme's love story feel epic by comparison.This film sufferers from lazy writing and awful character development. If you've followed the X-Films over the last 20 years, you might feel obligated to watch this movie. My advice, skip it; and end the journey with Logan or if you must, Dark Phoenix.Don't let this film be the last one you watch in a beloved franchise.",The New Mutants

Production hell made it feel like it would never be out. Now that it's finally here I can say from my Personal exp, it's Honestly way more surprising than what I expected and does justice to source material. It has some stranger things influence and some cliches around it but overall is a nice blending of bizarre horror tinged aspects from the comics with great character arcs. Solid action and comedy relief that doesn't feel forced. I would say to support this film after all it's been through and you most likely will be surprised.",The New Mutants

Plot
Editing
Cast
Story
Effects
Setting
Trailer (Completely misleading)
DialogueI could honestly go on and on, you pick this film apart over and over and could find nothing redeeming, I know this film had issues with getting released, and numerous push backs for re-shoots and re-writes.... whatever other excuse they could come up with, personally, the film should have stayed in production limbo, stayed on the naughty step till the parents came home cos you will regret ever watching this film, if there are any reviews over 3 stars are lying to you, you will regret every moment, you will hate your life, you will wish you could scream at the tv till they could hear you and be ashamed of what was the final product. I hate myself for ever giving this film the time, and if you get to the ending spoiler everything was given away in the trailer.... Also that trailer OMG WTF, there should be a law against misleading people on films just like products in shops.I am making myself angry just thinking about how bad this film was! Therefore I must stop and take a breather",The New Mutants

This movie is essentially a faithful adaptation of the first issues of Marvel comics ""The New Mutants""... It is a decent standalone film far better than ""Dark Phoenix"" or ""Apocalypse""... Yes there are some problems but it's cool seeing Roberto Costa brought to life, Illyana Rasputin brought to life, Dani Moonstar's spirit bear brought to life. I suggest anyone who hates this film is not a lover of the comic book. Chris Claremont, Bill Senkiewicz and others provided us interesting characters and an interesting story, this film does a fine job and bringing those characters to life on screen for the first time. I'm an X-Men fan from way back in '77. There is nothing so terrible about this film as to rate a one star.",The New Mutants

Yeah after watching it, the movie was literally not good. Because the plot there is not much happening, this was supposed to be like a fantasy action sci fi kind of movies but in this movie, its not it. And the fact that it was about 1 hour and 30 min long but the plot was not that really great it took like half of the movie to reveal what dani's powers are and the only part that they got to use their powers is that when the doctor started or like planned to kill dani. Illy was an interesting character as well as the others. The plot is just lacking so much and just this could have been better if this was a tv series.",The New Mutants

727,nenadscuric,"Fun movie, good actors and wrong audience",7,11 November 2020,"The movie is ok, but it sends the completely wrong message to the x-men audience, that is why they cry like babies with strict 1 of 10 ratings. No one is objective there, they are angry because they expected something else. First, it is a step away from existing x-men movies in many ways... Like now it is not a mutation, some characters have ""magic"". And second, it is made for teenagers and they presented it as horror for adults.Anyway, I don't care about x-men movies, to me, it is just a new interesting movie to spend the afternoon. And it is far from bad, I would like to see these actors with better script and direction, that could be a 10/10 movie.",The New Mutants

I was personally stoked for a horror mutants movie, but this is as much horror as any other superhero movie (and less than some) so I must say I was very disappointed. The idea of was there and it could've been SO SO good but in the end, it wasn't...A thing that really distracted me was the actors weird accents.

733,Yakrakus,What movie are these people watching?,8,18 November 2020,"The sheer number of 1 star reviews on here lead me to think that these people haven't seen very many movies. Or they don't understand how a rating scale should work. I honestly think anyone who rates a movie like this a 1 should be discounted so that the review score can actually be useful for everyone else. This isn't a terrible movie. It's better than most of the other recent x-Men movies, which themselves weren't absolutely terrible. They won't win any Oscars by any means, but I was entertained while watching them. Having seen lots of movies, even the worst of them wouldn't score below a 5. They're typical summer blockbuster style movies. There are better ones, there are worse ones. Shut your mind off and enjoy the nonsense. This one was fun because of the spin it tried to put on a super-hero movie. Everyone does a perfectly fine job. I found them all likable and their accents weren't bad (and I'm from Kentucky). The special effects weren't bad, and Back to the Future and Terminator have plot holes you could fit this entire movie into. Seriously, you'd think the director had run over some of these reviewers mothers. It could be considered an average movie at worst, but ignore anyone giving it less than a 4. Personal taste could take you that low, but below that and I don't think you know what an actual ""bad"" movie is. Me, I liked it. I'd give it an 8. Not a perfect movie, not a great movie, but really good. I'll probably watch it again someday.",The New Mutants

I mean... I wouldn't and I haven't been an impulsive teen for a long time. That ""good faith"" end twist and the overall happy ending fit in no way or manner the overall atmosphere of the film.Additionally, as a Marvel fan - it was an awful shame to have seen Stan Lee's name in the end credits.

It feels like people went into this movie wanting to dislike it and I fundamentally disagree with most of the criticism it has received. I'm a big fan of the xmen movies and I have to say, this was in no way, shape or form the worst of the lost, not even close.It would be criminal if after all this the series didn't get its trilogy run.I would be curious to see any cut scenes, from the movie however, fingers crossed for a directors cut...",The New Mutants

And the critics were right, this movie have a bad storyline, bad script, bad climax.This is my first time seeing Blu Hunt in a movie, she's pretty but as a lead actress in a movie her acting is so unnatural and look amateur, and this get worst because of the movie story (it's bad, and the conflict is really childish)

743,jamesmcleod420,Idk I liked it. Give it a chance. Pls Read my review.,8,1 January 2021,I haven't liked any of the X-Men films since X2-United. Logan was awesome. But this is about Mutants. Doesn't mean it's about X-Men. I like this cause it more of a take on random new mutants it's not about saving the world or some total catastrophe. It's about confronting your fears and dealing with tragedy and mistakes. Now granted this movie isn't super deep and actually quite short. A lot of that is due to covid and all the reshoots so with that in mind I think they put together a nice little mutant movie.Ps: All film is subjective and this movie wasn't well received but I liked it and I hope more people appreciate what they tried to do.

No doctors, janitors, landscapers, chefs... does anyone eat??? Is there anyone around to keep these mutant kids in check?

749,jgo-11812,Unrealized Potential,5,23 November 2020,"I had really been looking forward to this movie. Once it started getting delayed, I figured that wasn't going to be good news. There was a lot of potential that was never fully reached. The story itself wasn't that great and it probably wasn't the best to introduce these characters, but it could have been done much better. I recall this being marketed as a horror movie in teaser trailers years ago, but there wasn't much horror here at all. I'm not sure if this had to do with the director or with the studios. I think bumping up the horror aspects could have improved the movie significantly. The setting of the movie certainly allowed for it, so I don't know why they wouldn't have exploited that more. The pace also needed work. By the end of the movie, I felt like had watched a two hour movie even though it was barely an hour and a half.I was quite impressed with the cast for the most part. I wasn't familiar with too much of their work, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I think both Alice Braga and Blu Hunt's performances were mediocre, though Hunt's scenes with Masie Williams were her best. Alice Braga was just quite awful. Anya really turned out to be star of the movie. The only criticism that I have of her is her accent. It was quite inconsistent through and she could've definitely worked on it more. She was also the only one that really got to show off her powers, which was a little disappointing. Henry and Charlie were great. I wish both of them had gotten a lot more screen time and also gotten the chance to show off their powers for more than just a few seconds.There was definitely a lot more that could have been done with this movie and the characters. There were a few scenes that were in the teasers and trailers that didn't make it in the movie and some of the deleted scenes could have made it better. I wish we could have the opportunity to see these characters played by these actors in a different story under better direction in a sequel, but I'm pretty sure that won't happen (even though there's nothing really tying them to Fox's X-Men movies).",The New Mutants

759,laura-24027,Good coming of age drama/action - not really a horror.,7,20 September 2020,"I enjoyed the New Mutant comics growing up, & was so looking forward to seeing the characters I loved make it to the Big Screen. When they said it would be filmed as a horror, I didn't think I'd be able to watch it, as horror movies freak me out. I needn't have worried, because while there are some creepy characters/ creatures, it did not have that horror atmosphere, & I wasn't scared at all.PROS:
-The young cast, especially Dani & Illyana. Dodgy accents aside, they all did a good job of conveying teen angst & having to cope with their powers in an unfamiliar/ possibly enemy setting.
I thought the idea of having them in an institution, & being in the dark about who put them there, & Reyes true motives, was good & was a good foil for the manifestation of Dani's power.The effects were pretty good.Dani & Illyana's powers were pretty awesome.CONS:
Why was there only one Doctor/ supervisor in the whole place, considering these kids have potentially dangerous & uncontrollable powers? There's not even any tech support, with all the monitors etc...Rahne's character is deeply religious in the comic, & constantly conflicted about her power. It doesn't gel for me that she would embark on a lesbian relationship, or if she did, that she wouldn't be apprehensive or have guilt about it.-The kids (in the comics, from what I remember) are supposed to be not long out of puberty, when their powers are manifesting, & they (with the exception of Rahne) all looked about 17-18. Sam, I thought, looked older than that.
Why didn't Rahne turn full wolf in the action scenes? In fact she was hardly a wolf at all. I wanted to see more of all their powers.Overall, flaws aside, I enjoyed the movie. If I hadn't read the comics, I'd probably have enjoyed it more. Apparently they aren't making any more movies about the New Mutants, which is a shame, because there's potential there. I'd love to see more of Illyana's backstory.",The New Mutants

The setting is a large establishment which is supposed to give of the vibe of an abandoned asylum; but this isn't really explored. The mutant trope is poorly handled; we do get some origin stories but they're handled so badly that they don't contribute to the plot. The script is terrible and the dialogue, by and large, helps waste some good acting talent. The directing is all over the place and fails to create any tension or sense of jeopardy.

I thought the action was good and it did have a tense feeling throughout the whole movie. I think it did a good job of setting up everyones fears before the final battle. And it was so good to finally see these characters come to life. Lets get to the bad. It had some writing problems and the acting from the girl who played Dani needed some work. The trailer def did ruin the scares and I feel that the trailers kindve mismarketed it too much as a horror movie as it was more of a sci fi thriller. Overall, this movie was very enjoyable and it definitely did not deserve a 24% on Rotten Tomatoes.",The New Mutants

This movie fails as a superhero fantasy, action adventure, drama, horror, psychological thriller and sci-fi fantasy. The whole movie feels like everyone involved in making this film just gave up on it two days into production. The acting is forced and contrived, the writing is overtly social politically driven. It is as if the writer(s)/producer(s) never bothered to read any of ""The New Mutants"" comic books. The film's direction is all over the place. Is it a horror film? Is it a drama? Maybe an action adventure film? This film doesn't know what it wants to be.The only good thing I can say about this film is that I waited for it to come out on cable television.

768,ollieharrison-76586,I want to give it more!,7,8 September 2020,"I'm sitting here in the cinema, the films just finished and I'm thinking 'I want more!' More in this extended universe, more about these characters and more about their powers. Especially Anya Taylor-Joy's character.It is easy to see the why the producers and critics said this film went through 'Development Hell' within the time between the original and final product. At times the script falls flat, the 2nd act drags on almost to the point of being boring and the screen just goes black in the middle of a scene obviously to cut a possible plot point due to the unlikely possibility of a sequel. Which was a huge shame.But overlooking the films short comings, the final act does come together in a way that I believe does tie a bow in the film and personally, I would love to see more come from this.I know it's unlikely but I would really love to see more from this film in an extended universe film series of go the way of the MCU and give it an MCU TV series.It is easy to see that there is so much potential with its characters and story and you can see the film wants to be something more.I would say it's the perfect example of company executives thinking they know what their fans want. Sadly we've seen the same from none other than 'Justice League'. Which also went through expensive reshoots and cuts when Zach Snyder left the scene and Joss Weadon joined.All in all though, as I said before, I can see the film wants to be more and I want more!",The New Mutants

772,theinvinciblefilms,It was pretty bad but I enjoyed it and Magik is awesome.,5,29 August 2020,"The New Mutants has had one of the most famously tumultuous productions in recent movie history. It had multiple delays, rumors of reshoots, and a few times was suspended indefinitely because of corporate mergers, and our past selves to wonder if we would ever see it. Well, now we have. So was it worth the trouble?
Sort of. Let's start off with the elements that the movie got right. The best part of this movie is the characters. They all have interesting backstories that show how they got to where they are, without overexplaining every little detail. Every character has their own method of approaching things and they all think differently about problems, which helps to unite them under their common goal of freedom. They also all behave in a way that seems totally in character for themselves in that situation. (Spoilers) Specifically, at the end of the film when the Demon Bear starts to attack them, Magik goes to fight the bear, looking to take it down, while Rahne tries to wake Dani up and get her to fix it, which makes sense for their characters. Magik, or, Illyana Rasputin, made the movie so much more enjoyable for me. She was my personal favorite character and she is played very well by Anya Taylor-Joy (except for maybe the accent, but we'll get to that later). She was my favorite because she had gone through so much pain and you understand why she lashes out at people, like she did to Dani, it's because she feels better about herself when she makes other people feel worse; she feels more in control. This film also benefits from a new perspective on the now concluded(?) world of mutants and X-Men. It shows what else is happening in the universe, and shows that not all mutant powers are fun to have. Now having said that, there are quite a few issues I had with The New Mutants.
Now let me preface this with something. I think this movie would have been pretty great in 2018 or so when it's first release date was scheduled, however, today it's not so much. One of the biggest problems is how this was sold to the audience. It was presented as a horror movie, and (in my opinion) this is not a horror movie at all. Maybe this classifies as suspense, but it is NOT a horror movie. The trailers make it seem as if it is a terrifying story about fear and how it manifests, yet the actual movie is more about Dani trying to fit in with the other mutants and figuring out what powers they have. It was also not very scary at the moment at all, there was about one time I remember being scared, and it was the first time those weird smiley face Slenderman looking guys were shown attacking Illyana as a child, because of pure shock value. A lot of the film is creepy, but it is not at all as scary or weird as I thought it would be (and wanted it to be). The film itself is built as a horror movie, with not a lot of action and it's more mystery focused, but the problem is it's not scary enough or even mysterious enough that it fits the horror movie template that was set up. There is not a real mystery in this movie that I wasn't able to predict, except Magik's backstory, which wasn't even answered by the movie itself. The Slenderman guys were also very underutilized they seemed like a big deal in the trailers and then in the movie they just are kind of zombies that show up and follow the main characters around until they are easily killed about seven minutes later. Another problem is its lack of tonal consistency. There is a scene in the movie that is very The Breakfast Club-esque which comes out of nowhere right after a quite serious scene. The whole movie, in fact, feels more like The Breakfast Club then the horror movie premise it was sold on, that is, until the end where it just becomes a generic superhero movie, albeit with a cool fight with Magik and the Demon Bear. Another setback the movie had was the brightness. I went into this thinking it was going to be tonally dark, but that is NOT the kind of dark I got. You can barely see people and objects in a lot of scenes in this movie, especially the opening scene that there are many flashbacks to. the Demon Bear especially is hard to make out in the outside portions. Now the brightness is not a massive deal it's just a tiny bit distracting, and it is not as bad as, say Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 3. The aspect I wish they had done more for out of everything, would be the backstory of Magik. Now I previously said that the backstories of all the characters were very good because they aren't overexplained, HOWEVER, Illyana's is so confusing and convoluted that I just needed more to even understand what was happening in her flashbacks. Like what are those things? Where did they come from? Why do they have her? What are they doing to her? How did they get her? Why do they want her? You don't even understand her powers completely because it's not explained enough. I appreciate that this movie doesn't overexplain things for the most part, such as the Demon Bear, but specifically for Magik it just needs answering. Another problem this film has is that people who watch this movie, who know nothing about the characters and Marvel itself, will have NO IDEA what is happening. But on the flip side of that, anyone who knows anything about the characters and what their powers are will already know a good chunk of the reveals and surprises. There is a whole mini sub-plot that is resolved about halfway through the movie about the mystery of what Marcus' powers are, but everyone who knows anything about the comics, (or even watched Days of Future Past) already knows he is Sunspot. The same goes for Dani, or Mirage. It's no mystery to Marvel fans that she is the one making all the fears come to life so it just takes away from the movie. It makes you wonder who this movie is for, the Marvel fans, or the people who just thought it looked cool or just watch the movies. A small issue I have is that the three most interesting characters to me were Cannonball, Magik, and Sunspot, and instead of focusing on them, a lot more of the movie than is necessary is focused on Dani and Rahne. Rahne was my least favorite character out of the five main mutants, she was just so boring and I got her backstory within about two minutes and I didn't really care about her and Dani's relationship as much as I probably should have. Another issue that is connected to that is that it seems like every time someone was about to get in a fight in this movie, it cuts away to Rahne or like Marcus on the ground doing something else, which is incredibly frustrating when it looks like something interesting is about to happen. But possibly the most bizzare choice of this entire strange creation is the accents. EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. HAS. AN. ACCENT. The accents are also wildly inconsistent, such as Charlie Heaton's Southern accent which is just not good. It is incredibly strong at one time and then at others, it's almost completely gone. Maisie Williams' strange Scottish(?) accent is awful and is at points incoherent. Anya Taylor-Joy's accent is the one I bought the most but it still sounded a little strange at times and took a while to get used to. Another minor problem that was not really the fault of the writers or actors was the CGI. Some of the stuff looks pretty good, such as the Demon Bear, especially for a movie with an $80 million budget, but some stuff looks not great, like Sunspot. My penultimate negative point is that this movie already came out in January. It was called Glass and it is incredibly similar to this movie not just in plot but in actors. The plotlines of ""people finding out their powers and being trapped in a hospital/prison that claims to help them"" has already been done in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. as well. Now, this is no fault of the movie but The New Mutants coming out after Glass has already done the ""superhumans in a facility being tested and then they realize they have to join forces and escape"" thing just makes it feel less special, which is why I said this movie would have been much better in 2018. I do believe, however, that this movie is a better version of Glass and a better all-around movie. The acting isn't phenomenal even though some actors are doing very well with their roles. One more quick thing I have to talk about is Alice Braga's character. I think Sarah Paulson's character in Glass was just played and written much more effectively, although they are not one to one comparisons as characters.
Long story endless, the film itself is built as a horror movie, with not a lot of action and it's more mystery focused, but the problem is it's not scary enough or even mysterious enough that it fits the horror movie template that was set up. There is not a real mystery in this movie that I wasn't able to predict, except Magik's backstory, which wasn't even answered by the movie itself, and it was mostly a lot of build-up for a movie that couldn't possibly live up to the hype. I give it a 5 out of 10 rating.",The New Mutants

808,mazenassal,I'm only rating it 10 to balance the really bad reviews which I think are not fair.,10,7 May 2021,"Now I'll start by saying that I have never read a single comic related to this, and that I'm not even an X-men fan.I believe the movie got really bad advertising (as horror) and it also seems like fans were upset about the delays in releasing it, bot of which may account for the bad reviews.For me the movie was a pretty decent 7 star teen movie with a bit of action and mystery. Could have been better but it was good. It also had a some sort of a 2010 movie aura to it.",The New Mutants
809,mpeti08,"Great movie, so underrated",8,6 February 2021,"I think that movie, is soooo underrated. I liked it a lot, thats one of the best xmen movies. I really like its horror vibe.",The New Mutants
810,michaeljustinfloyd,"DON'T LISTEN TO THE WHINERS, GO SEE IT!!",10,4 October 2020,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, the movie is a perfect hero/horror hybrid! It's a perfect smaller scale setting, which let's you get to know and feel for every character before it gets crazy! Ignore all the haters and just go see it or rent it when it's available!!:)",The New Mutants
811,dleon-10135,Tired of all the haters!!!,9,31 August 2020,The movie is not bad at all. The story was good and entertaining. I really don't understand why people keep complaining so much lately about movies and pretty much everything else. Some of the actors could've done a better job with their accents but other than that I liked and enjoyed this film.,The New Mutants
812,allcountydoor,Pretty true to the source material. Waaaaayyyyy better than the bad reviews suggest.,9,11 April 2021,"As a fan of the comic when I was a kid, I thought this movie was really well done. With an adapted focus on the Demon Bear storyline, I was really happy with the movie. I immediately recognized every character, and really couldn't look away. None of the acting was bad, special effects were fantastic, and the storyline was completely cohesive. I have a feeling that many of the bad reviews are from right wing trolls for what they perceived as an ""agenda"" being pushed, even though that part of the storyline was somewhat in line with the source material. Had I believed the reviews, I would have never watched the movie. I am really glad I ignored them. Really hope there will be sequels, but that is doubtful.",The New Mutants
813,njterry-38826,Just bad bad story-writing and interpretation of the original material,2,9 February 2021,"Not going to make this all blow-hearted, but this movie failed first and foremost in its writing and story telling. Such a GREAT opportunity to capitalize on a different perspective of the mutant/x-men genre, as the comics did with the New Mutants, and such a complete failure. This movie lacked substance, continuity, story, everything. I am very disappointed and hope the makers of this debacle feel the same as well. One positive, I think the actors actually did a good job with what they had to work with. But come on!!! Haven't we tortured the x-men/mutant side of Marvel enough with bad movies?? It is such a RICH storytelling opportunity!!! Why can you not see this and make a movie that is worthy of it? Okay, I am done with my rant, but seriously, the ""mutant phenomena"" within Marvel and essentially the American Dogma of American Mythology has been something I not only grew up with, but have studied throughout the years, and this movie really missed its mark. There is so much amazing source material they could have played from, and they just trashed it all to make some garbage that they hoped people would pay to see.",The New Mutants
814,jtswaineg,Low budget horror film does not disappoint,8,5 September 2020,"I did not go Into this film thinking it was going to be the best film ever, and if my assumption about super heroes movies is correct, most fans are used to the over the top action of films like the avengers and doubling down on the stakes, and that somehow equals a better movie. So In that regard, I did not contain the same sentiment. The formula for superhero movies gets stale and I love seeing new takes on the concept, a more grounded psychological horror twist is what we get here with a smaller cast and smaller set. This sets it up to give the movie some breathing room, Often in movies there are so many time skips, and changing of locations that you can't fully be immersed. By having the movie Nearly entirely take place at a creepy hospital it get the set some character and makes you feel like you're a resident. I love the looks of the characters, I like the real world tie ins to comic book references like the Lockheed puppet. They could have just shoehorned him in, but I was surprised that they gave his presence a purpose and a backstory that ties in well with Magiks character, whose actor actually looks like the comic book character. The Actors all did a good job in their roles, they are all young, with some slight wobbles, but I think they made for a great looking cast. The story helps create empathy and interest in the main characters, but the movies pace is never slowed by introducing the characters pasts, the movie is all purposely edited, and I don't think too many scenes lagged on. The Music was great. Not a bad first film to come back to from lockdown, maybe you will be able to relate to it as well.",The New Mutants
815,jcw1709,Some of the worst acting I have ever seen,3,19 September 2020,"Something about this movie was enjoyable, i'm sure...Actually, i'm not so sure. This was one of the worst movie experiences I had in a very long time.",The New Mutants
816,ethanhurley-32624,So much potential!,1,14 September 2020,"Anna Taylor-joy made it worth it her character was funny and a badass the rest especially the main character were meh, they could've done so much with this movie but it dragged out longer then it should have. Save your money on this one not worth paying in the cinemas",The New Mutants
817,omarfigueroafilms,The Under Appreciated New Mutants,7,18 November 2020,"The movie can double as a television series for Hulu or Disney+ and it has potential. The premise itself was a bit all over the place, but in the end it was a lot of fun. People are being a bit harsh, the actors did a great job. This movie is not a 4 or a 5. Just released at the wrong time.",The New Mutants
818,nemesiociau,clearly written by a child,3,15 November 2020,The dialog tries too hard to be dramatic for all the kids in the audience and the characters are in this coming of age phase which makes it less an Xmen movie and more of a high school drama. The doctor is predictable and naive. It's not fully clear what the doctor is trying to do or who she works for and that's true for all aspects of this movie. There's a difference between being mysterious and cool ( stranger things for example) and deliberately keeping the audience in the dark for dramatic effect.,The New Mutants
819,samatramazan,An interesting spin on superhero genre,7,29 August 2020,"I was pleasantly surprised by the movie strong horror inclination. There are very limited number of characters which helps film to flash out individual personas and explore their personalities and past traumas.
Weak introduction was overfilled with cliche shots and phrases making first impression of a student film. The ending was also quite predictable and cheaply ""empowering"" of the main character with very cheesy ending",The New Mutants
820,isaaccomer,Actually really good,10,29 August 2020,I thought this movie was incredible. The characters felt new and fresh and it was finally a plotline different from the x-men.,The New Mutants
821,adimayuga-22193,sigh.......,1,29 August 2021,No likeable characters at all. Hell I wish the Devil Bear ate them all.,The New Mutants
822,deepredlove,something wrong with the casting,2,12 November 2020,One of the reasons why the XMen series movies are incredible is that the actors and actresses are so suitable for their characters and their charisma so stunning. And this movie just lost this advantage.,The New Mutants
823,craigpiek,2 is polite. Extra 1.5 cause I Loved Queens Gambit & Arya Stark,2,1 December 2020,"Worst Marvel creation by a mile, no matter how big or small a part they actually played in the making of this monstrosity. There is nothing to enjoy about this rubbish. Not even an attempt at a story line, and special effects from the 70's. The main character is about as believable as Trump is honest and pretty boring on top of that. Sad to say that I have wasted 94 mins of my life...
Don't do it to yourself, it will only end in you cursing at yourself and wishing you had not been so stubborn and believed the reviews from the masses. The New Mutants should be erased from existence... Someone get Tesla's death ray!!!!",The New Mutants
824,barbarazinhaguimas,I like it,8,8 November 2020,"It is a great movie to just enjoy and relax . I have a really great time watching it , of course it wasn't the best movie I've ever watched but definitely I will give another shot for a sequel . I really loved Anya character Magik or Illyana .",The New Mutants
825,clauqs,O M G,1,7 December 2020,"Wow! Image a bad film...well this one goes beyond that.
Please save your time and do not watch this movie. I mean....can't believe it's from Marvel. Very disappointing. Luckily it's only one hour and a half, but still, one hour and a half of pure garbage.",The New Mutants
826,jimdolphin,Really wanted to like this...,2,19 November 2020,"The first 10 minutes pretty much killed it for me. Roles were poorly written for each actor. The overall plot lacks consistency and the assets that made other X-men movies click. An hour into the movie, it somehow morphed into a laughable children's fantasy tale. It's a pure waste of talents with spectacular Anya Taylor-Joy as a confused Magik. Without expectation, it's 4 out of 10 at best. With so much history on the franchise, this one is a miserable 2 out of 10. Hope these good young actors deserve better.",The New Mutants
827,hassanalsilwadi,Very bad,1,15 December 2020,The worst xmen.. Marvel or superheros movie I ever seen... I'll watch the green lantern over and over if I can remove this move from my memory,The New Mutants
828,Bainan,"Could have been ok, turns out bad.",5,19 April 2021,"This could have been a decent movie, but the writing is terrible and predictable. There are some of the worst one-liners I've heard in awhile. It wasn't scary, it wasn't interesting and it wasn't really worth watching, They removed arguably the main character from the original graphic novel (Karma) and replaced with an incredibly annoying Illyana Rasputin and then added a teen romance subplot. Too convoluted and a sad way to end the X-Men film franchise.",The New Mutants
829,mfirecarb,Really good movie,8,29 April 2021,"Don't listen to all the naysayers. I went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by this different take on mutants in movies. It's not just a ""good vs bad"" scenario. It makes you think outside the superhero genre, which could be why some don't like it. And those that are disappointed by the ""horror"" aspect (or their perceived lack there of) should relax a little and just enjoy the movie. If they made a sequel, I would definitely go see it.",The New Mutants
830,igorz-1,"Not so bad, quite entertaining actually",8,20 December 2020,"After watching it again in BRay... I must say this is not a bad movie, quite easy to see and have a good time. If you ever bought a New Mutants comic, you have to watch this movie and you will love the easter eggs. All the characters fit in their roles, but I can't think of a better Illyana or Rahne.About some of the bad reviews, I guess that some people just follow what the critics say to sound cool.",The New Mutants
831,eventswalnutcreek,Wonderfully entertaining!,10,26 November 2020,"This movie may not have been that great, however it was pretty entertaining and well done visually. There are all kinds of twists and turns in this crazy action/ sic-if movie. Highly recommend it.",The New Mutants
832,kimbij,Not that bad it sets them up for something bigger,6,5 July 2021,Its not that bad it's a decent first movie that explains who they are and what they can do there interesting characters.,The New Mutants

834,List2019,Who green-lit this script?,4,18 November 2020,"Looking at the trailers, it is marketed as a horror as its main appeal, but just seems like they gave up fixing the script and ran with whatever they had. All the notes are there to weave it into a better action horror story, but pacing is awful.There are moments where it doesn't even allow the viewer to appreciate what is going on in the scene, instead trying to advance the plot points faster.
Then moments where it was too much with making sure the audience knew the subplot.There are no trials and tribulations. There was no time to build up of tension.
Instead just little post-it notes of what they thought was cool to see in the film.
Little quips where the characters makes in-jokes of their superhero names for fans.All this together just made the whole final scene feel empty.
Where the audience is suppose to feel elated, that the character overcame their fears. Cheering on and enjoying a spectacle. Instead it just falls flat as they are trying to imagine why are they even invested in these characters in the first place.",The New Mutants
835,martin-neuberger,my expectations where low,2,6 November 2020,My expectations where low m´but this movie managed to disappoint me anyway. Maisie Williams was completly miscasted for the role. the story didnt know what it wanted to be and the dialogs where bad.Anya Taylor-Joy was the only decent role/arc/actor in this movie.,The New Mutants
836,prbet-97752,Aweful,3,13 April 2021,Absolutely aweful. It doesnt even seem to fit in the X-Men universe. I had about 5 minutes left and just couldn't watch it. Mutant abilities we lazy and just boring. Do yourself a favor and don't watch.,The New Mutants
837,chasexpress-24037,There's so much potential here.,7,21 November 2020,"Yes. The movie is extremely flawed. There is so much more to this than what I'm sure I can even imagine and I'm gathering that by the small amount of deleted material we were given with the Blu-ray/Digital. Also adding the fact that this was delayed a lot (I'm surprised we even got this version tbh). There has to be a lot on the cutting room floor. While the whole movie is an edited mess I still enjoyed the characters, the little bit of story we were given, and the actual look of the demon Bear along with some of the characters. Anya as Magik was a fantastic casting choice and would be such a waste to not have her continue to play the role in future marvel films. Honestly I liked the entire cast which I didn't expect. I know that this is supposed to be the last ""Fox X-Men Movie"" but it doesn't have to be. The cut they released has almost no connection to that fox universe. It could easily be included in the marvel cinematic universe. I would really hate to see this cast thrown out because of the label put on it. I went into this movie with no expectations because of the all the reviews. I sat back, shut my mind off, and let myself enjoy what I was given. I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. Again it's not a cinematic masterpiece. I'm sure I'm in the minority here but I believe this should be given a sequel because let's be honest a lot of sequels succeed their predecessors (X2, Raimi's SM-2, Aliens, etc.). Another thing I would like to add is that I liked the feel of the movie so I wish there were more of that ""haunted house"" aspect we were advertised the movie would have in the beginning. It's just another example of all the potential this movie and a potential (although unlikely) sequel could have. I'll conclude with: You the viewer should not go into this movie with a lot of expectations, shut off your movie critic mindsets that we all have, and just let yourself enjoy it.",The New Mutants
838,jspenn,Bad,1,27 November 2020,This movie is slow all the way through and such a bad introduction to these heroes. This could of been so much better! Massive fail!,The New Mutants
839,raeballek,A decent film that's getting too much hate!,7,5 October 2020,"It was a fun story with really cool effects and neat characters. It's not the most high tech and most thought out, but that doesn't make it a bad film. Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who adores the New Mutants comic books. I hope they do a sequel and we can see them really grow as superheroes!",The New Mutants

844,moviebufferic-11367,"Great Movie, More Thriller than Horror",9,28 August 2020,"After waiting to see this movie for over two and a half years, I wasn't disappointed with the end result. I wouldn't call this a horror film as it's described online but there was a few times when I felt creeped out while I was watching. Considering the fact that this film was supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy, the director did a really good job with fixing up all the loose ends so it wouldn't end off as such. There was good character development, good action sequences, with comedy bits and touching moments so overall good film. I also liked how they made references to the Fox X-Men Universe, which to me, is important in a film series. However, I do wish it had more jump scares and creepy moments which is why I deducted a point. Who knows? Maybe they had to cut lots of it out due to it being given a PG 13 film rating. Either way, if you're a fan of the Fox universe of X-Men, I'd recommend this film!",The New Mutants
845,Cjboyle84,Not worth the wait :(,4,30 August 2020,After a three year wait of it being released or not being released I have to say......it was NOT worth the wait lol.It's not the worst X-Men film out there by any means (that still belongs to Dark Phoenix) but the overall feeling I had from watching it was just Meh!It's a shame so much of the cool scenes were in the trailers because all those scenes fell a bit flat in the film because we've seen them so many times over the past three years.So long FoX-Men.,The New Mutants

848,trixvybz,Not as bad as the reviews,9,2 September 2020,"Trust me, I loved it personally, the Blu hunt girl was kind've forced acting but everyone else did an amazing job, I just wish this was a series instead and it has a sequel of them going out to the Urban areas and fighting and stuff, each character was shown why they were traumatized, its an amazing movie to me.",The New Mutants
849,yachavanginkel,Good film that could use some improvements,7,2 September 2020,"Overall it's a really entertaining film that provides us with solid and good background stories for all of the main characters. It definitely made me jump a few times, though I wouldn't call it a horror. The story managed to surprise me a few times and I can't wait to see what they can do with a serial if they get a little more budget to work with. The LGBT romance plot is well done, doesn't feel forced and doesn't contain many of the stereotypes we usually see in films. The few downsides were the terrible fluctuating accents and the bad acting in some scenes.",The New Mutants

It's basically a haunted house movie set in MA.2) There is zero characterization. The crew members are virtually interchangable. How can you care about somebody getting killed when you don't know who they are?3) Getting a bunch of talented actors and giving them nothing to work with.4) Overdone set design. Yes, it's impressive but it overwhelms what little plot there is. Nice set design does not make a movie.5) People stumble around in dark corridors and dark rooms looking for a cat. Not once but TWICE! And this is after they know there's a killer alien on board!6) What the hell is a cat doing in a hospital?7) The characters act incredibly stupid.8) The Smiley guy looks dumb--it's just a guy in a slightly modified alligator suit. Cool set of double teeth though.9) What does the Smiley guy do with its victims? Two of them just disappear.10) Why is the Smiley guy killing them? What reason? We're never given one. Oh wait--because it's in the script. That's why!11) Maisie Williams strips to down to her underwear for no reason whatsoever at the end.12) IT'S DULL!!!!!!!!",The New Mutants

The lighting is so awful most shots come off as silhouettes, the action and camerawork in general would be incoherent even if the lighting was passible, the sound design is lazy at best, the acting is plain bad, the callbacks and references are insulting, the creature design may even be decent if you could see it, the story is messy, the fight this is named after is likely the shortest of the entire movie, the list goes on.

But fun - you want to see it over and over again, and force other people to watch it too. Rent it on a particularly bad day: you'll forget everything irritating in your life, and be weirdly involved in a world of badly-clad midgets; suddenly wondering if baloney sandwiches or urine could possibly be the solution...

879,jfilm21,"Mostly great, for Marvel fans of the lore",8,20 November 2020,"This is not a ""Superhero"" movie. It's a Marvel mutant/Alternate X-men movie. It's a great movie for fans of the Marvel Lore who understand and/or know the origins of the characters. Finally, like Dark Phoenix, but without the studio constraint so much, a director sticks to their grit with a Marvel film like this under 20th Century Fox. It wasn't a haunted house, if you pay attention everything comes together and in a great way.
Mind you, not a fan of the on and off accent of Wolfsbane/Rahne, and descent acting, but the story was good and special effects awesome.
There is just no present or obvious ""bridging the gap"" between Marvel lore fans and the average person, and that's how I think they lost a lot of their audience. And maybe because of a character being supposed to join but didn't for whatever reason.
Still a good movie though. Because of all your ignorant people I almost didn't watch this and would have missed out. Maybe think and do research on lore before you comment on something you aren't familiar with.",The New Mutants

I finally gave up on this poor excuse for an ""X-Men"" film after Dani and Rain and spent, what seemed like 10 minutes, laying on the grass looks at a light show. I am wide open to the LGBTQ community and had no problem with that storyline. I just felt like it could have been done in a better way which actually moved the story along.

I wasn't planning on seeing it in theaters(I was gonna rent it) but we were having our house professionally cleaned and had to clear out for a while My family hated It Personally I thought it was brave for Hollywood to try something new.

The romance was pretty good Between Rain and Danny The special effect were great .

The New Mutants is no masterpiece but it's not a total flop either. In my opinion the actors chosen did a decent job to portray their characters especially Raine and Illyana stand out. As a fan of the 90's comic you cannot deny the film kind of was trying to capture the spirit of this era.I somewhat had to think of Sam as the emo kid listening to Grunge all day and being depressed. You could say it's a but cliché but It somehow reminded me of my own teenage years in the early to mid 90's.The overall pacing can be a bit slow at times and the Horror elements are not actually scary. It reminds you somewhat of IT though the scenes here are generally more creepy.In the end it felt more like a pilot to an upcoming New Mutants TV series...that will never be.

896,jmichaelm0,An acceptable interpretation that fails in production design,7,26 November 2020,"If you read New Mutants you may have expectations that are not met here. But in the end forging strong relationships out of trauma is the essence of what the original story and this film are about. Young actors often lack the skill to carry off the challenge of translating emotions into performance. That's true here to some extent, but I believe the main fault with this film lies elsewhere.The biggest failure of the film is in the production design of molly Hughes. She needed to better understand the visual style of New Mutants that made it a success, in particular the genius of Bill Sienkiewicz. While McLeod was the original artist, his drawing was workmanlike with a solid but nondescript superhero style and he quit the title soon after launch. It was Sienkiewicz who brought the magazine to life, drove home the substance of Claremont's writing, and made it more than an also-ran mutant spinoff. Had Hughs, or more likely a different designer entirely, aimed for the bleachers with Sienkiewicz-inspired visuals instead of playing it safe with a moody haunted house theme, then the whole film would have been elevated to the level we now expect from Marvel. Sadly that was not the case.",The New Mutants

Sadly it was not as expected and fell extremely short of where it could have been. The majority of the movie was painfully predictable, and not in a fun way either. Danielle and Rahne was so blatantly going to happen, not to mention Rahne having one of the worst wigs I've ever seen in my life! Her accent was also a bit random which detracted from the character also. The other accents didn't bother me as much though.
The actual plot of the story was quite simple really, that it was Danielle causing all the drama, even though she had no idea what her powers were. It was all so obvious, to the point where I was getting bored of what was happening. Even the ""horror"" elements were okay at best. The finale itself was a little better as more characters were using their powers, Magik was probably my favourite, but there still seemed to be something missing. Also, at the end when Sam throws the rock to see if the force field was still there, it seemed a bit pointless as once Dr Reyes was dead it was clear this would have been destroyed also, considering she was able to manifest the force field. But others have mentioned certain plot holes which you may see yourself if you can be bothered to watch it.

Was it flawless - of course not. But was it entertaining? In my humble opinion, yes. From the very beginning I was drawn in, and as the movie progressed it never felt laborious or contrived. The actors were good, the story was interesting, and the special effects were good as well. Unfortunately, it seems as though those that would have you believe that this movie was a failure view it through a black & white perspective (it's either perfect or garbage) instead of a spectrum, with both positive and negative aspects. Which is sad, because if you were to examine what negative reviewers would use as a ""Litmus"" test I'm sure there would be a lot of movies left out that are fun to watch.

They don't give any backstory to the characters really, but the single scene they do seems like it could have been interesting. For one the final fight scene uses their nightmares, but we don't even know what the nightmares are since they never gave a backstory to the characters. Like why is Slendermans cousin there.

Is it the best X-men movie? No. Is it the worse. Hell no?
The horror elements could have been more in my opinion but I knew they had been cut down during the long long production/post production process. But I liked what they had in there. I thought the actors did a good job and the accents weren't nearly as bad as some had said. For the most part they pulled it off.
So in closing, if you like the characters and you like X-men movies you will like this movie. If you want something different in your super hero movies, you will like this move.

913,mikerod-48500,Better than Expected,6,15 April 2021,"I'm not going to lay tons of praise here. Don't get me wrong there is a lot wrong with the movie, but it's definitely better than I expected.I went into this expecting a complete mess. I knew about the re-writes, re-shoots, and overall mess it was to make and distribute this movie and it was dealt with just horrible timing as well.The movie feels like it had weightier plans that extend beyond this single movie. It's basically an introduction story of 5 mutant characters all jammed into 1.5 hours. In other words you don't get as much character development that you would have liked, but it's enough that you get the gist of what pains each of them. Ironically, Mirage's story is least developed. Some of the stories would have been very interesting to explore more about especially Magik.There are certainly some plot ""holes"". When smiley face creatures are attacking they spend time hitting them with a fire extinguisher and you are left wondering why is no one using their powers? I assume there was some creative thought that they were too traumatized to do so and in fact they do eventually use them but it leaves you wondering at first.You can also tell this was re-shoot and re-written. It feels disjointed in the editing and storytelling. It feels like it can't really determine what genre it wants to be. It's really a mix but probably would have done better just picking one and sticking to it.The cgi isn't actually awful. Clearly there are some good cgi wins and some faults but overall it was fairly good.I think this movie and these characters would have been better suited to the small screen format in a gritty R rated horror/thriller style. There is enough with the character, Mirage, that could have you really exploring these characters ""demons"". A 10 episode arc would have done these characters justice and potentially even found ways to expand them. Magik could certainly cross paths with Dr Strange. It's possible some are recast and included in future marvel work, but definitely feels like it is wasted here. I feel like that was the goal here, R rated horror/thriller but somewhere along the way it got routed and altered and ended up where we are.And yes, the accents were horrible. That being said it's definitely worth a watch. I have absolutely seen far worse than this and I know I'm not praising it a ton and the fact that I say I've seen worse isn't overly positive but it's still an interesting story with interesting elements and it's fun to watch.",The New Mutants

So I expected quality to the extent of the X-Men films. Plus, with all the changes made throughout the production of this movie I had an idea that it could seem as if it was missing bits and pieces. I don't feel like there was anything that was noticeably removed that would help make parts of the movie make sense outside of a little more backstory for the New Mutants. They did get a little explanation of backstory but I feel like I needed just a little more.The showcase of their individual powers was done well given these are New Mutants who are still learning how to use their powers properly. A little awkward at times and confused was the reaction to their powers.The demon bear we saw in the trailers was really well done. A strange foe to tackle for mutants getting a grip of their powers but still done in a fashion to make it believable that they were going with whatever happened and making the best of it.Of course, you had the predictability in some scenes. The teenage romance/drama was there but outside of a scene or two I don't feel like it was ""in your face"" as much as it was natural progression.As a standalone movie outside of the X-Men films and MCU, it was a decent movie.

The New Mutants is a perfect example of an above average yet flawed movie that is elevated by its characters. The cinematography and editing are good, the writing and musical score are very good, and the effects are great. Blu Hunt, Maisie Williams, Charlie Heaton, Henry Zaga, and Alice Braga are great, and Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic. Magik is by far the most interesting character, and Taylor-Joy does a solid Russian accent, at least to my barely-trained ears. Also, Charlie Heaton does a very good Kentucky accent. The characters' relationships develop naturally, and Blu Hunt and Maisie Williams are adorable together. The story moves along at a nice steady pace, never feeling rushed or stretched.

Also there was a few times throughout the film where it would show 2 girls kissing which was extremely uncomfortable!

I've always been a huge fan of Maise Williams and Anya-Taylor Joy and they both shine here.The story follows a group of kids, from Scotland, Mexico, Russia and America, brought together to find a cure for their ""iIlness."" They are mutants who have caused chaos in the outside world, being unable to control their powers. They find themselves prisoners in a special lab and make plans to break free, little realising the new girl among them may be a danger to everyone on earth.The acting is fairly decent, the effects and make-up are good if a little flashy and overdone the lesbian love interest is never overly showy or explicit, and I liked Magik(Joy) the most for her skills with a sword, thought the teradactyl a nice touch.

However the execution was very disappointing. I was never emotionally invested in any of the characters which should have been a slam dunk given the premise but the direction was standard at best.The set was unconvincing and lent little to the tone and atmosphere which I am sure the creatives involved were desperately hoping for.

I dont think you would want to take a little kid to see this movie because it's not like your average PG-13 superhero movies, it has some prety intense horror scenes that might leave an affect on some children.

978,dancingpastr,Bizarre and confusing?,4,30 August 2020,"I came into the theater expecting a good, somewhat scary movie, well this movie certainly wasn't it. While this movie wasn't horrible like some reviews say it is, it definitely wasn't a great movie. Let's start with the trailer for the movie, I assumed it was going to be a movie with horror, or at least some amount of suspense which is what the trailer had shown. Yet the movie is completely different from what I thought it was going to be. Also another problem I had with the trailer was the fact they literally spoiled what was going to happen, for example the russian girl says that it is a prison. So before I even watched the movie I knew Dr. Reyes was going to be evil. Now on to the actual movie, for a movie that was marketed as being scary there was little to none for horror. The only part where I was scared was the opening where they are running away with all the chaos and when Sam was having the mining vision. I suppose the love children of microwaved slender man and venom were a bit scary.
The main character seemed very dull compared to the rest of the cast, her only personality being that she misses her dad and is native. You don't really know much about her. Everyone's powers were alright, I didn't have any gripes with them apart from Illyana, her powers left me very confused. They brushed over what her powers were so quickly that I never understood what they were. Apparently it's sorcery. Now onto the convoluted plot, I am so bamboozled on the lack of security that the hospital has, they had one mutant looking over a bunch of likely rebellious children that have been brought here against their will. Yes even if Dr. Reyes had shield powers they could so easily take her out. Illyana during the whole movie expresses how it's a prison, if she doesn't like it so much why does she stay? Rahne just scratches the crap out of Dr. Reyes and she's done for, but you might be saying "" But how would she know she would be able to get out if she took out Dr. Reyes? "" Well when Illyana and Danny get into a fight she stops Illyana from attacking with her shield powers. If Illyana had more than three brain cells she would of put two and two together, realizing that the shields looked the same. Any of them could of took her out! The only security there is Dr. Reyes and the cameras. The CGI, to be honest it wasn't that bad but it definitely was not blockbuster material, it was more like CGI I would see in a high production show. The bear CGI threw me out of the movie and when I saw Dr. Reyes get thrown around like a rag doll I wanted to laugh. The end, the ending bear fight was very boring to me, it came out of no where and the mediocre CGI didn't help. I thought the bear being tamed was fine but left some questions about Danny's powers and what happened. Did her fear just go away or is she able to control it now? The ending was left open so I can assume a sequel might be planned, but since this movie was supposed to come out a couple years ago and has pretty low ratings, so it's not likely. Overall the New Mutants is a mediocre movie with a plot that hangs by threads. 4/10 it can pass the time but has little rewatch value.",The New Mutants

983,hannaheve_cobble,New Mutants - Essay Review,6,1 September 2020,"This film makes me feel conflicted. I went to see it on Sunday 30th August, and I had not seen a single piece of advertising for it before hand, so I assumed it was the first film from an unknown company. So, I was very surprised to see the 'In Association With Marvel' logo! However, this was just the start of the conflicted feelings.The fact that the introduction started with an infamous cliche surprised me, especially with it being associated with Marvel. The cliche of the two wolves fighting inside you was used, but instead of it being wolves, it was bears. This cliche was used to give backstory to the main character - Danielle Moonstone - and although it was effective in doing that, I couldn't help but giggle a bit at the obvious cliche nature of it.However, once the cliche monologue was out of the way, we were thrown into a sequence in which her father and fellow village-members die, giving her a backstory. Admittedly, this sequence, while not flawless, was rather good. I was glad to see that they built immersion quickly.The main character Danielle is a very interesting character to me. She is presented as someone you would understand. Her reactions to the bizarreness of her situation are fairly realistic. The fact that she is a Person Of Colour, female and LGBT+ is a rarity in film, and I'm absolutely thrilled to have her as the main character. The fact that the writers didn't shy away from her heritage, femininity or sexuality was very satisfying to see, and something that I greatly appreciated.Dani's power is linked to the fears of those around her. Whatever they fear, she exposes them too. I enjoy the power dynamic that this power brings to the group. She is undoubtedly powerful, she is probably the most significant character out of her group, but she doesn't completely outshine the others. However, her power leaves me conflicted at the same time. The fight sequence with the bear at the end of the film felt, for lack of better words, odd. I feel like the fact that isn't wasn't Dani fighting for the majority of it made me feel like the final fight was unfinished and incorrect. The way that she killed him to sleep instead of actually killing it really frustrated me and made me feel like I did at the beginning, irritated over a cliche. If the writers redid that scene, it could've been better. For example:
If the demon bear wasn't so comically huge and overpowered, it would've improved the immersion of the scene
AND
If the fight was left to Dani to do, rather than her friends being left to fight until the end
I appreciate that the ending was probably written that way to make the characters seem like they had bonded, but I think that a solo ending would've worked better in this case.The other main characters are a bit of a mixed bag.
Illyana Rasputin probably irked me the most. She had so much potential, but they should've worked harder on giving her a real personality, rather than trying to shove her into being the ""quirky edgy girl"" cliche. She has such a lot of potential and I'm honestly sad to see her not fully utilised. Her traumatic past, whilst interesting, was never fully explored and was only used for a cheap fight scene. She boasts about killing loads of people, but that fact is never clearly explained. She had the potential to be a fun anti-hero. Her power stemming from her toy dragon, a symbol of her childhood trauma was particularly good, I very much enjoyed that idea! It's moments like that that I realise that this film has its brilliant moments. The visual of her sword and her metal plated arm was stunning. It reminded me of a graphic novel, it was just the right balance of flashy colours and shapes like a drawing. I enjoyed her whole attack visual very, very much and I would love to see more of her in battle. With some tweaking, I would love to see a stand alone film of her. If her edgyness was toned down, her trauma and fears better developed and her name adjusted, I could honestly see myself enjoying her a lot more.In the beginning she's nasty in a way to Dani that honestly made me uncomfortable. The racist bullying dialogue she says was unnecessary to me. Yes, racism happens. But to hear someone call an indigenous person ""Pocahontas"" in a film made in 2020 was not what I wanted to hear in an otherwise very accepting film. Also, her surname ""Rasputin"" irritates me beyond belief! I'm not sure what ethnicity Illyana is supposed to be, and I don't like to make assumptions, but I'm going to assume for the purposes of explanation that she was supposed to be Russian. So, having her surname as ""Rasputin"" was a bit like have an English person's surname be ""Crumpets and Tea"". It was silly, unnecessary, immersion breaking and quite jarring.The issue with the racial stereotype continues with Roberto De Costa, who is presented to be from Brazil. I don't think they could've come up with a more stereotypical name if they'd tried! Honestly, I wish that they had rethought the names. I'm not sure if that was the original names that they had in the comics, but even if they were the original names, they could've adjusted them to be more fitting for a modern audience. Roberto was the cliche girl hungry boy, who had little personality other than being good looking. But, I enjoyed the trauma related to his power, especially the visuals that I brought to the screen, it had a very specific comic book charm to it.Sam Guthrie is alright. The visuals of his power were very entertaining! He seemed like a decent enough character, but to be honest, he's not stuck in my mind very much.Finally, we come to Rahne Sinclair. I have to be honest, I love her to bits!I love her power. It's very rare to see a female werewolf, so it was fun to see her in that position! Her power is simple enough to follow, but it also brings a lot of fun visuals and interesting power dynamics, such as when she protects Dani from the doctor, who I unfortunately cannot remember the name of! Her power is violent, which brought forward some very good fights.I love how human she is (despite the obvious fact she's a werewolf). The way that she dresses gives her the sense that she's down to earth, the fact that her design isn't too flashy like Illyana's also gives her the sense of the underdog.Her trauma is very well done. The priest branding her as a witch was an interesting route to take. The way that she has her triggers (churches, her scar etc) make her trauma feel realistic. Speaking of which, I enjoy how she addresses her trauma with Dani. When Dani exposes her to her fear due to her power, she says that she understands that it's out of her control and that they will work through the issue together. I was so happy to see that! Dani and Rahne have a very well communicated relationship. As a teen myself, it makes me happy to see people present teens like people, rather than annoying messes. Dani and Rahne are a great example of a kind, understanding and communicative couple in fiction, and seeing them work through things together was very satisfying to see.Speaking of their relationship, I love that too! From the very first scene they had together, I felt like they had good chemistry. They were very sweet together! The fact that they actually got together was a lovely surprise, the fact that they allowed their first kiss to be on screen was very cute. Although their relationship was rather rushed, I can forgive that as everything that happens in this film happens fast. Rahne and Dani were a joy to see on screen together. They compliment each other so much. Overall, Rahne is probably my favourite. She was realistic enough for me to root for her, interesting enough to be a good hero, and sweet enough to be a likeable individual.In regards to the plot, it was a bit odd. The cliche of the corrupt doctor was obviously predictable, but if you were able to get past that, it was a reasonable premise. I enjoyed seeing the trauma of each character play a part. The 'horror' elements, especially Illyana's, whilst not being very scary were quite fun. Many people have said that the film felt a little disjointed, which I can agree with. But, if you go into the cinema expecting an LGBT romance, coming of age or a goofy comic spin off, you'll have a good time.

It's because you're acting like a complete moron, okay? A complete moron. You don't make videos, and all this other silly stuff that you're saying. You've got- you've had to have lost your mind or something man. What is wrong with you? Okay, you harass innocent people's YouTube channels because you don't like the content on it even though it's perfectly safe and enjoyable for most of the rest of the YouTube community. If you don't like it if it's a video game you don't like you're threating to send Barack Obama or whatever you're trying to say I can't understand half the stuff you're saying. But it's all bad, it's all violent, it's all slander, it's all threats. That's why your YouTube accounts are going down, that's why they're all disappearing, not because of this guy false flagging you there's no such thing as false flagging. You can't get flagged and get a strike unless you messed up. And you messed up, you've messed up not once, you've messed up not twice, not five times, not ten times. You are continuously messing up because you are a disaster. Straighten up, you need to straighten up alright. I tried to befriend you several times I tried to take you under my wing, and teach you. I had plans of us making a channel together a rant channel, we could have set that viral. You would have had hundreds of thousands of subscribers but you decided to take the low road, you said ""I'd rather pick on kids, I'd rather pick on kids"". You're stupid, you're so stupid man. What is wrong with you, man? I had it about here, gave you a change, had it about here, gave you a chance, had it about HERE, STILL gave you a chance.

1066,ohagvv,Do you believe in miracles,1,9 November 2020,"After appearing in this garbage as Deadpool, it is nothing short of a miracle that Ryan Reynolds found anybody to cough up coin to pay for his Deadpool movie(s). But I can see why the Deadpool ''outtakes"" include having him appear in the doorway and, instead of going on to fight Wolverine, he gets clubbed like a baby seal. That is A-level self-awareness.Anyway, The New Mutants. Basically a $150 million video game, except the pimple faces get to leave the basement for a night and hang out at the googleplex with their loser friends.You know, disaffected American youths, maybe get out there and help your parents mow the lawn. Help the old lady next door with some chores. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Do your homework. And put down the comic books. They're making you even stupider than you already were when you slid out the birth canal.Oh, and what of Patrick Stewart's face. Was he CGI'd to look younger, yet just as bald? Just for fun they should have CGI'd a Shatner2000 rug on him.As for Wolverine himself, I don't get the deal with Hugh Jackman. Of the ''big time"" movie stars there are few worse actors. Short list includes Nicolas Cage and maybe Bruce Willis. But it's a short list for sure.",The New Mutants
1067,ycvyuv,Hilariously Incompetent,1,9 November 2020,"After the utter failure of X-Men: Dark Phoenix, Fox decided to change their plans for the franchise. Instead of having sequels, they would have origin stories based on individual characters. I believe that they originally planed to have an X-Men Origins: Magneto film as well. However, these plans were soon dropped, for reasons we'll soon get into.Let's start with the story. We have a rushed beginning that messily sets up the plot. The relationship of Wolverine and Sabertooth are given only a couple of scenes before they become enemies. There's a decent heist action sequence at first. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as Deadpool in the first scene he's in. But it quickly becomes bad after that.Wolverine decides to retire, get married, and live an idle life. Then his wife gets killed by his brother (Sabertooth). This feels rushed as well, because we're only given one scene with them together, and so it's hard to feel that emotional. The rest of the movie is Wolverine being hunted down and him trying to get revenge.I won't get into the entire plot since it's way to complicated. Wolverine jumps from one location to another, making the story feel all over the place and unfocused. Gambit appears in the film as well, only to leave after five minutes. The CGI is especially terrible. As anyone would have told you back then, it looked bad in 2009, and it's gone worse with time.When you stop to think about it, you realize this movie was kind of pointless. We already know Wolverine's backstory, and nothing else of importance is achieved. None of new characters in this film return later, and Wolverine himself forgets everything at the end. It feels like pointless filler. Really bad filler.The movie was so poorly received that the studio decided to scrap their plans for the 'New Mutants' series, even though it made a decent amount of money at the box office. But it's quite a useless movie in the long run. If you're going to watch the entire X-Men franchise, it'll probably be best to leave this one out.",The New Mutants
1068,yatyp,Must not watch,1,10 November 2020,Fox exceeded all expectations and made a movie even worse than we could have possibly imagined.

1084,solonesq,The Worst Ever,1,18 November 2020,"Hands down, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't know what they were trying to do with this film. We all know the mutants. We all know they have some unique power. But these teens?? What?!?First off, there are only six characters in the entire movie. This movie is more like a play-a school play you go see because your kid is in it.Second, their powers are all pointless, except for one and her power is the same as scarecrow. Yes, scarecrow from Batman.Lastly, the acting is off the charts horrible. This was some crash. Only see it to talk about how bad it is. It's just that bad. Like a bad smell someone tells you about.

The New Mutants is twice as bad as X-men Origins: Wolverine was and that wasn't even top quality, so you know your in for a bad movie. The story is so bad that someone could legitimately think that it was written by children. The New Mutants is just a high budget toy commercial and not even a good one. I have seen worse movies out there, but it is by far the worst theatrically released X-men movie if not the worst X-men movie.",The New Mutants

I am fond of the story I tell about Gene Siskel. When a so-called film critic defended a questionable review by saying, ""after all, it's opinion,"" Gene told him: ""There is a point when a personal opinion shades off into an error of fact. When you say 'The New Mutants' is a better film than 'Dark Phoenix,' you are wrong."" Quite true. We should respect differing opinions up to certain point, and then it's time for the wise to blow the whistle.

1098,ovxey,What I noticed,1,24 November 2020,"""The New Mutants"" is the ""Dark Knight"" of 2020. In what way? It's the pop-smash action picture that has excited a bunch of fanboys fans who don't usually read movie critics to howl with inarticulate rage about movie critics who don't like their movie. Of course, ""The Dark Knight"" was met with considerable mainstream critical acclaim, and ""The New Mutants"" with equally considerable mainstream critical disdain, but the important thing to remember is: critics had nothing to do with making these movies hits.",The New Mutants

But you didn't come here for a history lesson. Or maybe you did, if you need to know that Dani and Illyana became Americans (still before they could be Canadians) and fought side by side in the Civil War, World War I, World War II and Vietnam. Why they did this, I have no idea. Maybe they just enjoyed themselves.",The New Mutants
1100,eacoss,Ah the plot,1,24 November 2020,"The plot is incomprehensible. The dialog of the Mutants, X-men and OtherMutants is meaningless word flap. Their accents are Brooklyese, British and hip-hop, as befits a race from the distant stars. Their appearance looks like junkyard throw-up. They are dumb as a rock. They share the film with the smiley things who are much more interesting, and that is very faint praise indeed.",The New Mutants
1101,qebma,Surprised,1,24 November 2020,"The movie has been signed by Josh Boone. This is the same man who directed ""The Fault in Our Stars"" in 2014. Now he has made ""The New Mutants."" Faust made a better deal. This isn't a film so much as a comic tie-in. Children holding an X-men toy in their hand can invest it with wonder and magic, imagining it doing brave deeds and remaining always their friend. I knew a little boy once who lost his blue deadpool toy at the movies, and cried as if his heart would break. Such a child might regard ""The New Mutants"" with fear and dismay.",The New Mutants
1102,vveoo,bad acting,1,24 November 2020,"The human actors are in a witless sitcom part of the time, and lot of the rest of their time is spent running in slo-mo away from explosions, although--hello!--you can't outrun an explosion. They also make speeches like this one by Anya Taylor-Joy: ""I'm going to play with him. Get her out of here.""

However Steve Pasquale and Reiko Aylesworth where solid enough. The rest of the cast appeared to be reading off cue cards.The action was terrible. It was edited horribly, it was too dark and the close ups where way too close. The action scenes where filmed the same way Paul Anderson filmed them in the first AVP1.Lastly the movie was really poorly paced, it seems like Ricky the Pizza Boy got more screen time than any other human character and the opening portion of the film was slow and without purpose.Save your money and watch I Am Legend or Sweeny Todd instead.1/10",The New Mutants
1108,sochuu,One of the worst films ever made,1,1 December 2020,"Dark Phoenix was bad but this took that and drove it into the dirt.

1109,okzega,Worst Lighting EVER,1,1 December 2020,"Despite all the hate for Dark Phoenix I really liked it. The story was okay-ish, but the visuals and action scenes were great. I watched the new mutants right after and boy was that a mess. I instantly forgot about the story and the characters, but the thing I really hated most is the lighting.

It is soooo dark that you cant make out anything. Often it's dark AND raining to obscure vision even more! There is only ONE mutant, so dont expect massive species on species dust ups.

You can't see what's even happening most of the movie because the lighting is awful. To me, the plotline with the smiley guys made absolutely 0 sense, and I lost brain cells watching the ending. It is more gory than Dark Pheonix. That's about the only good thing about this movie.

It's such a shame seeing Alice Braga and Adam Beach in this as they could have actually been quite good with a decent script. Oh, and Anya Taylor-Joy's Illyana Rasputin is one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a Superhero film, her jokes are like Mom jokes but 100 times worse.The storyline is very poor, Dr. Reyes and Illyana Rasputin team up to turn the world into a giant jungle and freeze it over. Despite their goals being completely different that doesn't stop this uncharismatic partnership flourishing.The cinematography isn't fun enough to be campy, nor dark enough for Bryan Singer, it's a weird blend and comes out looking terrible.1/10: Absolutely do not watch this unless you want to see how bad it is",The New Mutants
1116,uxasaf,The film that nearly killed X-men,1,2 December 2020,If you thought that Dark Phoenix was a bad hard crash from the 2 brilliant Bryan films then you havent seen anything yet. Rahne Sinclair now played by Maisie Williams was a disaster and the only point of any entertainment was Anya's Illyana Rasputin but even then the character was so bad. The film was completely devoid of a plot and even children who this is aimed at must feel insulted. Thankfully it killed off this part of X-men and we will get much better adaptations in the future,The New Mutants
1117,fengo-33753,"Brilliant, Mind-Bending Storytelling",1,3 December 2020,"From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed they released an R-rated X-men movie not so long ago. It was well received by any means.Not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought Mangold was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, Fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and House of the Dead.Their first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after.Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the franchise was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.Fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the mutants. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great CGI used in the otherwise terrible Dark Phoenix and go with the real mutants seen in the old films. The actors playing the mutants had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the Smileys, the monkeys decided one smiley was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of mutants that seemingly come out of nowhere.But what about the effects, you ask? Come on now, people. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Smiley visions.The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this was to be on Earth, in Massachusetts of all places, they needed to make it realistic. This was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. See, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see the mutants instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, rookie mistake.The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie PG13-rated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers got the mutants they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving those mutants.Some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. Why does a blue liquid the Smiley has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the Mutants? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece.Fox was thrilled with their work. So thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.But some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? They put it towards their next film: The New Mutants 2. They knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:""To the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. It will be rated R and will have violence.""And everyone lived happily ever after. The end.",The New Mutants

I can't believe someone could mess up a movie about the new mutants so bad.The New Mutants are AWESOME. This movie made a big joke out of them. The creators didn't take this movie seriously at all. I am throughly disappointed in how Josh Boone handled this film. He made a mockery of amazing characters. It's like he was trying to be serious in the beginning, then their writers got high and gave up. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were awful and were NOT The New Mutants. I am so ridiculously sad that no one takes The New Mutants seriously anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films.

But even with the addition of a badly cast, badly acted human ensemble to this travesty, the dreadful writing and offensively lazy clichés do the job of making the whole film play like a laughable video game any way. Oh, the writing... The dialogue... The needless complexity... I can't. I just can't.

The movie was just horrible. Sure, some director tries to do something differet. Does that make it a good movie? Far from it! The plot was just awful, the acting was awful, the ending was awful. ""The New Mutants"" is a generic spin off title even if there was no mutants in the movie. There was no character development, the main guy we can only assume is a creep for cheating on his wife. Unfortunately, my friend had to buy this movie to complete the X-men series. What a horrible mistake. He will never again look at that DVD again.",The New Mutants
1147,zmzad,omg!!!,1,4 February 2021,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but was totally and utterly gob-smacked. Why connect the film to the X-men series if it has nothing with X-men. It's stupid. What made it worse was the diabolical storyline. What was with stupid characters. I realise there is a tiny screening of X-men on a television screen at the beginning, but God please, the only thing remotely in common with this film was that it contained a mutant. I personally think they should've stopped after the first two X-men's, unless they're prepared to follow up with something bigger, better and something that makes some kind of sense. If you wanna be bored stupid I suggest you watched that film.",The New Mutants
1148,dkakg,One of the worst pictures ever made,1,5 February 2021,"The New Mutants is a horrible waste of film. I'm glad the producers decided to drop the ""different plot for each sequel"" and got bought by Disney. The whole hospital concept is absurd and the acting is so flat CPR could never revive it.

1149,ypaeto,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,5 February 2021,"The first X-men entertained the heck out of me, even edited for television.

1152,vupemy,The Last X-men (?),1,12 February 2021,The whole hospital premise is UNNECESSARY.

1155,qefuy,Unnecessary,1,12 February 2021,"The New Mutants was the worst and unnecessary part. This movie was not even needed. They could have easily ended the franchise with Logan (or Dark Phoenix if they wanted to complete the actual X-men story). This movie was neither scary nor entertaining. This movie only had bad qualities.The plot was senseless, direction was bad, the traditional x-men music was missing, the characters were okay. There was lack of screen time for the Mutants in action.There were too many unanswered questions. It seems even director didn't know in which direction is movie going.Overall, this was one of the worst movie of X-men franchise and you can watch it if you want a good sleep.",The New Mutants

Avoid at all costs.",The New Mutants
1159,gavyz,horrible!,1,12 February 2021,"I couldn't agree more with oqonac. This may be not only the worst sequel ever, but the worst horror movie ever! Nowadays, certain filmmakers think by throwing a name or specific place ( e.c. Magik, X-force), into the movie they're creating an acceptable sequel. This movie took 90 minutes of my life away, and I demand them back! (I know I should have had the smarts to walk out of the theater!)",The New Mutants

It's not the worst Marvel superhero movie...it is the worst movie ever made in the history of cinema.The small success of Dark Phoenix obviously has gotten into the heads of the director and the star/producer. But this garbage only revealed their lack of talent. Cancel Josh Boone and Anya Taylor-Joy for destroying New Mutant's name and legacy. Reboot and recast the franchise . . .

The New Mutants has nothing to do with mutants (just teenagers), The New Mutants also has absolutely nothing to do with X-men series. AHA but that's not all!!!! The guy who made the cover for The New Mutants didn't see ANY of the X-men films!!!! The original cover of The New Mutants has a sentinel (Not in Dark Phoenix or The New Mutants) chasing a mutant who doesn't even appear in any of the X-men movies!

Then imagine a film where those are the most expensive things in it. This is that film. The New Mutants - yet has no mutants. Just goblins. But hey. The first time I saw this, I wished I had been wearing a nappy or sitting on a very big sponge, it is that funny. Personally, I could not get up from rolling around on the floor, nor the people I was with, although they had it worse, as they kept falling off the bed. Unfortunately, it is funny without meaning to be, simply because it is that bad. It seems to just have people dragged in from the street in the leading roles, which could well be true. Maybe somebody was very drunk when they decided to make this film. Or when they made it. Or when they went ahead with all the stages of production. Just possibly. Anyway, it is hilarious. I got my DVD copy for £2. That says it all really I would say. Watch this film if you want to see: neon-coloured food, children in masks and dressed in sacks charging around a forest set to a dodgy 2020-theme, awful make up, worse acting, even worse dialogue, the funniest yokels ever (including Anya Taylor - 'nuff said) and the mightiest weapon ever seen in any film ever.

With a Director I believe that dealt with p0rn and an acting staff we hardly even heard of, I believe that The New Mutants is something that we can remark as simply entertaining. Everything is ""corny"" about this film and we can't get over the attempt of special effects. But the Mutants look funny beyond belief and that it seems that they have a crazy way of eating without the food ever reaching their tongue which springs stupidity to laugh about. Gotta love the encouragement not to eat healthy too (milk and produce). Well, what else can I say, this movie gets a 10 for worst greatness because I laugh my colon out all the time. In a way, this should of been a p0rn parody of the first film, but that's just my opinion. Until next time, take care of yourself and each other.",The New Mutants

First of all, every scene is not at all related to its previous scene. Seems like they had hundreds of different short films and they just joined them together. There is no continuation of the plot. Too many things going on without a clue. Who is going where or who is hunting whom you will have no idea. Second, they tried the old ""cliche/corny"" humor in almost every scene but it just didnt cut. I mean they were so bad and the timings were so off w.r.t. to the scene. Third, the dialogues didnt at all make sense. All of a sudden ""you are family"". I mean WTF !!! .... I think they had a ""Random Word Generator"" for the dialogues for any given scene.

Coming from a perspective were i know nothing about it, It was a interesting story. It didn't feel like a normal movie we always see with the same old plot. I like the way it portrayed their fears differently for each character, They wasn't some normal fears that everyone would had. It had some trauma-like elements that i don't see in movies. Their personalitys were portrayed very nicely. They weren't shoving it down your throat in a way. And I really like how it had a lesbian main character. You never see that ever in movies because most people are against it. So overall, I really like the movie. I'm not good at writing reviews so i'm sorry if i repeated some stuff",The New Mutants

The writing is terrible. The plot barely progress through out the film. The tie in to the X-men universe is confusing and unclear, and the place of the film in the X-men time line is unclear nor any placement makes sense.
moreover the powers of each teen is barely explained ans seems to do what ever the plot needs it to do.

Also she is a little mean at the beginning but that is just because she doesn't understand everyone and she feels alone and scared she finally understands them and becomes a great teammate.

The on you feed"". But the real story about the two wolves doesn't stop there. Not only I think this story has been overuse over the time, but none get it straight by telling the whole story. Here's the real ending of the two wolves story:""If you feed them right, they both win. You see, if I choose to feed the white wolf, the black one will be hiding around every corner waiting for me to become distracted or weak and jump to get the attention he craves. He will always be angry, always fighting the white wolf. But if I acknowledge him, he is happy, the white wolf is happy and we all win. For the black wolf has many qualities - tenacity, courage, fearlessness, strong-willed and great strategic thinking - that I have need of at times that the white wolf lacks. But the white wolf has compassion, caring, strength and the ability to recognize what is in the best interest of all.""You see, son, the white wolf needs the black wolf at his side. To feed only one would starve the other and they will become uncontrollable. To feed and care for both means they will serve you well and do nothing that is not a part of something greater, something good, something of life. Feed them both and there will be no more internal struggle for your attention. And when there is no battle inside, you can listen to the voices of deeper knowing that will guide you in choosing what is right in every circumstance. Peace, my son, is the Cherokee mission in life. A man or a woman who has peace inside has everything. A man or a woman who is pulled apart by the war inside him or her has nothing.""How you choose to interact with the opposing forces within you will determine your life. Starve one or the other or guide them both.""",The New Mutants

The fight with the bear should have been the climax. This had an amazing potential, but fell flat on its face. I don't know if it was planned to have a sequel or not but if so, that's what put this movie in the grave. They didn't end it in such a way to promote a sequel.

Magik needed to have the real Lockheed earlier though, and better reason for being cuckoo (fighting demons for hundreds of years in limbo will screw you up a bit)
And Rayne needed much more wolf less German Shepherd!).
So real pity we we won't see more of them.But the premise wasn't great, one doctor, in a prison, to ""keep them safe"", pretty weak.

The story doesn't really go anywhere, the characters aren't very interesting even with star actors like Williams, Taylor-Joy, and Heaton playing them, and the film itself seems confused as to what exactly it's trying to be. A thriller? A comic book film? A teen drama? I'm not entirely sure.The film definitely had potential, especially with how the trailers set it up. But unfortunately it was undone by poor decisions and the acquisition that took place between Disney and 20th Century Fox. And with the announcement that there wouldn't be any sequels, which could have improved what this film did, I think it's fair to say that this film was a waste of time and money, and could very well be the last we see of the X-Men franchise, which is very sad.In my opinion, watch the trailers instead.

1210,Mind_Dweller,Love it what it is don't expect it to be the next avengers movie,7,10 November 2020,I'm a huge fan of DC/Marvel and have seen all comic to film adaptations. New Mutants was a fun look into more of a realistic view humans would take if they considered some of the mutants powers as a mental disorder/problem. The main theme and core of the story was beautiful consistent throughout playing with your brain wondering what side of everyone's psyche good vs evil will succeed. It's no award winner or next big superhero hit. But a refreshing film with some great actors and a nice touch of darkness to marvel that doesn't always get represented.I only watch 6+ rated imdb films so I was hesitant to give this ago but glad I decided to make my own opinion. Go make your own.,The New Mutants
1211,justice_monkey,Bad writing lets down a great cast,5,5 September 2020,"I'm glad a saw this, but did go in knowing that I wasn't going to love it; purely based on the bad reviews I'd already heard.
I probably wouldn't even have bought a theater ticket for this if it wasn't for the current situation with the pandemic and the trouble this film has had with it's release.
But like I said; despite not loving it, I'm glad a saw it on the big screen so that even some part of it's difficult creation was fulfilled.The cast is great; everyone pulls their weight and you don't ever feel like you're watching people acting.
Some of the visuals fall a little flat at times when I was hoping for some achingly beautiful scenes - rain falling on the energy bubble for example. (This could have been made so much better and more vibrant if the lighting on the two characters was better.)The main problem for me is the writing; too cliched and too easy.
Characters overcome their significant fears without any effort and nothing feels earned. There's no sense of struggle and that diminishes the impact of the finale. This could have been so much better with some simple changes and little more faith in the viewing public - but this is what I have come to expect from popular film franchises; everything is dummed down for the masses instead of moving to educate theater goers to raise themselves up to a higher level.Its a decent go at a superhero/horror genre and enjoyable, but ultimately let down by lazy writing.",The New Mutants

Not sure who these people are leaving bad reviews but as a diehard comic fan I thought it was the best mutant movie other than deadpool and maybe Logan. Better than the actual New Mutants story line that it was based off but very true to the original material, Casting was spot on. I get hating to hate is popular but how any reasonable comic fan familiar with the original material could not believe that the director knocked it out of the park is beyond me. I guess as more comic fans actually see it the reviews will improve. As for me and mine we thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",The New Mutants

1215,ipz1,"A fine film, and a good watch",8,13 April 2021,"I don't read comics, I find them boring. I don't know anything about the ""lore"" of New Mutants, and I don't care. I'm not here to compare this film to other horror films, like Nightmare on Elm Street, or to compare it to other ensemble films with teenagers like The Breakfast Club. This is a 90 minute film that introduces 5 characters, I've seen some say the characters are one-dimensional, I suppose there's a bit to that, but I didn't feel like I didn't have at least some understanding/grasp on who these people were. It keeps you guessing if they are in a good place or a bad place right up until the reveal, I kept assuming the doctor's superior was Professor X, that's what the film suggests and wants you to believe. I don't spend my time watching films picking them apart, I let the film tell the story it wants to tell.The scares might not have landed as much as they wanted, but I found the creepy villains creepy. There's a scene where one of their fears comes after them and it turns out that it was a real manifestation, leaving a nasty burn on one character. I didn't expect whatever visions they were having to be real. I found that interesting.It's a good film that's mostly receiving criticism based either on the comic book (irrelevant) or because this film wasn't some other teen horror flick that the critic was more familiar with. I don't find either of those to be valid criticisms. Oh, there was also a criticism that the ""expected big battle"" wasn't big enough, while others lamented the need for a big battle. I didn't find the battle that big, and it stayed true to the film's story. Most of them didn't have control over their mutant powers and so they fumbled through the fight against the big monster. I didn't know if all the characters would survive, so I was genuinely worried for them. The monster wasn't a super huge, world ending threat, but it was real to the characters and put them in real danger. They were able to eventually overcome the monster when they each, in turn, faced the fear of their powers and overcame that fear. Which in a way, is what the whole movie was about: being afraid of yourself and learning to accept who you are.",The New Mutants
1216,FourTuneagent,Not Bad.. Entertaining to some degree..,7,25 September 2020,"I never read the New Mutant comics or knew anything about the characters. Just read some of the reviews so I was not expecting much from this movie. However, it seemed to interest me enough to go check it out.
The beginning leaves you open to interpretation as the opening sequence of events has you wondering what the heck is going on, and who is this girl, Dani(Blu Hunt). She ends up waking up handcuffed to her bed in some sort of medical facility. Freaking out, she is visited by the Doctor on staff, played OK by Alice Braga. Soon she meets the others who are detained at the hospital, which looks like a mental institution straight out of the 1970's. The cast of characters playing the other New Mutants are good to very good, especially Rahne(Maise Williams) and Illyana Rasputin(Anya Taylor-Joy). The Kentucky guy, Sam, played by Charlie Heaton is pretty good also. So maybe the first half of the movie is all of the characters interacting and developing relationships together, good and bad. I was OK with the character development, it was pleasantly interesting. They eventually find some common ground that they're all being held against their will, and not entirely sure what the hell for..
The situation escalates from there and proceeds to get more intense. A few things I thought were cool was the psychic monitoring and the psychological manifestations becoming physical, which I suppose is where the horror aspect of the movie would play in. But other than that, not too much horror, but a little bit of deep supernatural stuff going on.
Not really too deep though, as I would tend to find this movie geared for more of a 12-16 years of age audience. But, I did find it entertaining, slightly above average, despite a few flaws with some predictable and bland dialogue, but the strength of 3 or 4 of the characters helped it along. So not knowing anything about the New Mutants, I thought it was pretty good.. maybe you just need to approach it with little to no expectations..",The New Mutants
1217,trihell,Maybe More Enjoyable If You Know the Comic,7,13 April 2021,"I had low expectations before viewing given all the bad reviews, but I actually liked the film. There have been worse movies in the X universe... far far worse that people reviewed as better. New Mutants isn't secretly a work of misunderstood genius (it gets close sometimes), but I don't think it deserves as much hate as it's received. Reading over some of the bad reviews, I felt a need to counterpoint.I loved the original run of the New Mutant comics. Much like the movie, it was relatively self-contained - there wasn't a whole lot of crossover. Nominally they were X-Men in training, but ended up doing their own thing most of the time. If the movie tried to force in a better known character to lead the audience, I think it would have cheapened it rather than enhancing it. Let the new mutants figure it out.One review I saw complained about the accents - I would have been mad if they weren't there. Accents were represented in the comic text and an essential part of a character (shame on you other X films for accent stripping carelessly). Sam is from backwoods Kentucky, Rahne is from Scotland, and Illyana from Russia. 'Berto is from Brazil but for whatever reason his actor didn't bother trying (or wasn't directed to try). Illyana's movie accent is a little inconsistent - Russian accents are notoriously difficult and maybe they should have found a Russian or East European actor, but I appreciated the effort to make her true to her origin.Another reviewer said they didn't explain the character backstories. Maybe it's because I know the backstories, but I liked that they didn't try to cram in biography expositions, instead focusing on experiential bits of fragmented memories for each character. The other X movies have butchered character backstories so often that I was expecting the worst. Here I didn't have that complaint. While not 100% comic consistent, New Mutants does pretty well at encapsulating similar sentiments to comic canon, something other X movies have been way more careless about.The most impressive thing in the film though is the mutant powers. There was some creative license involved (one very notable embellishment), but this is probably the best portrayal of mutant powers in any X movie I've seen, as it not only was pretty accurate to the comics, but also really evocative and thoughtful about specific power nuance and how those powers might interact with the surrounding environment. Everyone involved with planning, shooting, editing, and adding special effects to those scenes did a fantastic job. Again here though, it might help if you know coming into it what each character's powers are, as they're a little more complicated than Cyclops eye beams (though even that has nuances that got lost in the movies).Finally, a lot of reviews seemed to be lost in the plot and not understanding why everything was happening. If you're familiar with the references (one of which has never really been fully explored in the movies but is huge in the comics), it all makes sense in the end and there's even some fun misdirection a long the way.But maybe that's why it flopped for a lot folks - like fan fiction for a crowd not familiar with the source material. There were definitely other issues like occasional odd scene jumps and the movie being unsure whether it was trying to be breakfast club, girl interrupted, or ""miscellaneous teen horror movie"", but I think it got a lot closer to making a unique blend than given credit. My biggest disappointment is that we'll probably never get to see this version of these characters ever again, because for all the shortcomings of the film, it treated the characters and their source material with a lot more respect than typically seen in comic films.",The New Mutants

1226,edwardoaguirre,A movie for the true X-men / Fox Cinematic Universe,7,28 August 2020,"The New Mutants was supposed to be released on April 2018, this movie is part of the Fox/X-Men franchise, so everything in the storyline belongs to that timeline and it is connected to the latest X-Men movies - specially X-Men Apocalypse, X-Men Days of Future Past, and Dark Phoenix. The movie itself is great for the X-men fans who (like me) were so excited about Fox finally exploring the story of the ""new mutants"", the ones that are not yet part of the X-men team, the rebels and the ones who were experimented on by other main ""Villain"". I found this movie a little slow sometimes, and the dialogues are sometimes predictable. Maybe that's because the movie suffered so many changes when it was rescheduled, then when the Disney/Fox deal happened, they cancelled the movie. Disney decided then to release it on 2020 but the ending was changed so the movie wouldn't be the first of a trilogy as originally planned.I recommend this movie ONLY if you are an X-men fan, or even if you just want to really see the last piece of the Fox/X-men franchise before we get to see the new version of the entire X-men universe which now belongs to Marvel.I give it 7 stars out of 10!",The New Mutants

This Movie did not know what it wanted to be. The Actors who seem like good Casting choices cannot keep the Accents consistent and just do not become likable at any point.The Core of the Characters were hucked aside to make a weak horrible want to be Horror Teen Angst movie.

With it originally being promoted as a horror movie I wish it was a bit scarier. It's still a dark and gritty, yet fun teen movie though.

I would give this a lower rating if it wasn't for the strong performance of these young actors. However, the script, setting, plot, and story are all just cut from a well-worn raggedy cloth.Based on the preview we already know that nightmares are coming to life. The first time we see their hospital campus we already know it is sinister - there is an angel of death out front just in case you didn't get the right feel from the dark hallways and cell-like dorm rooms and locks everywhere. Also she's handcuffed to the bed from the start. So what do we need to wait (a short) 90 minutes for? For a team of misfits to put their differences aside and the new girl can put on her big boy pants and overcome her (Spoilers)? The whole premise is like someone took a 4 year old's childrens book about dog training and tried to turn it into a horror story, throw in some same sex attraction for good measure, and try to appeal to the college crowd; but forgot to upgrade the story development and climatic ending. There is no way to sugar coat it - the ending is just laughable and downright stupid.So the story is not great. The setting of the hospital is suitably eerie, though predictable. Also they never leave the campus, so there is no change of scenery other than going to the different rooms - the attic, or swim house, or chapel, or solitary confinement, etc. They venture outside a few times, but can't get far.The script is pretty predictable and the characters fall into cliches.The music is done well and fits the scenes and mood and does not distract.In the end the only redeeming quality is the acting of the characters, though they have little script to work with and a tight setting and a predicable story arc after a million superhero movies out there (there is nothing new here). Even the coming of age and together as a team falls flat. But yet I believed in their characters. I didn't see them as actors delivering lines. They really came to life and pulled you into the setting, the challenges they faced, their history and past, their weaknesses and strengths. They made you forget about all the downsides of the movie and pulled you right in. You feel the characters are real, believable, and alive. There are even some quite authentic sounding accents going on that stay fairly consistent.So if you are a fan of some of these actors - I would go to see them perform and cheer them on. If you want to know what the movie is about, just watch the trailer and you've seen all you need to know.",The New Mutants

It doesn't succeed in all of these as much as it could have and misses on a lot of potential.The movie isn't particularly meant to be a horror flick so don't go with that expectation.

1258,thompson448,"Promising concept, but lacks purpose",7,9 July 2021,"I was rooting for this movie from the opening scene. It felt as if there was something special to be found in this approach to the X-Men comics, but it was just out of reach for the director/writers. There wasn't enough impetus behind the story. It's a shame really, because a trilogy with this cast and conception of the X-Men universe could have been wonderful. The movie isn't flawed so much as it is incomplete. If you set aside your expectations and just go with the flow, the parts that make up The New Mutants are enjoyable. It just never becomes whole. Lost opportunity...",The New Mutants
1259,vanschop,Has a chance,7,27 November 2020,"Some real brutal critiques here. Long story short, it has a chance to open up another universe within Marvel. Somewhat darker and not as comic book happy ending as everyone's used to with things like X-Men. They tried to make a superhero Horror film. The horror film part of it was weak, but again, I saw it as more of an intro to new characters and new storyline possibilities.
It was a shot at letting someone take their creative spin and try to make something new as opposed to retelling the same tired marvel stories over and over again.
Wasn't great, but I've definitely seen worse Marvel movies **cough** Fantastic Four **cough**

They have ruined X-Men. I hope they don't try to continue this story line because it was a complete disappointment. The story was so forced and without imagination, it has nothing of my beloved X-men. I'm going to try and pretend this movie never happened. There isn't a 0 star or a -10 which is what this movie deserves, no imagination what so ever, whoever came up with this script needs to never work on X-MEN ever again it did the franchise such a disservice, it's not up to standards!!!!!!!!

I think there's a serious lack of empathy in our culture; but if a viewer could imagine being in any of these character's shoes, they would find that it was an entertaining rollercoaster of emotions.
Maybe it's taking so much heat because with so many delays people had built it up to be something it's not. It doesn't fit perfectly in any genre box, it melds a bunch together. It pays homage to a bunch of classics for serious movie lovers. And it leads you to imagine how these characters would fit into the larger X-Men universe by giving you a teaser of their backstory. I personally would love to see these characters integrated into some new storylines with some of the classic characters.",The New Mutants

Probably, especially since they went away from the horror vibe it had early on from the trailers. I had no qualms spending $20 on this on release.

Each actor has high points and low points in the movie but not enough Expansion on any of their Stories.
What Exactly happened to Sam when his father died and afterwards?
What other experiences has Illyana had?
What are the Extents of Roberto's powers?
Also, is it just me or did they Reuse scenes of the Essex corp from the Logan movie in this one?

But with the amount of delays and reshoots it had you gotta give it its credit. It tried to tackle something new which I think landed. The way they tackled the horror theme, to me was perfect. People were expecting a full out conjuring horror with an endgame level ending which is obviously not what this movie was going for so for anyone expecting either of those your of course gonna get disappointed. It does start out a little slow but once the horror and trauma aspects of the characters start the movie is easier to get into. My family and I went into this movie barley seeing the trailers and not really knowing what to expect and we came out feeling like we got our moneys worth.

It's a refreshing perspective into the methods of Essex Corporation (which we last witnessed in Logan) of how the process of creating mutant soldiers actually works. The characters go through their own challenges, face their own demons which keep haunting them and learn to rise above. Amazing visuals, feels like Stranger things meets Defence of the ancients. While it doesn't not have a lot of strong moments, it creates a lot of space and lays the foundation of a link in the mutant story line. Definitely a must, for all mutant enthusiasts out there, but a usual weekend watch for the rest of the crowd.",The New Mutants

1294,thetayloreatman,Balance,10,5 November 2020,It's not out yet and everyone has a opinion based on assumptions. The most harmful tool in the film industry besides pirating is flooding a movie with poor reviews based on assumptions. Stop destroying something that hasn't yet been released based on a trailer or a out of focus bootleg from a basement. You are only hurting the people involved in making this film and not the executives who tried to sabotage production for a copyright deal. I hope this film does great and becomes a cult hit just so it can stay relevant since trolls drown it with irrelevance. 😉,The New Mutants
1295,brendenckline,"Low expectations, decent outcome",6,29 August 2020,"With all the reshoots, delays, and creative difference surrounding this movie, I had very low expectations. It was supposed to be a quiet exit for the FOX-owned mutant stories.However, this movie wasn't exactly quiet. Most of the characters were compelling enough for me to be excited for the next part of their story. Ilyanna (Magik) seemed problematic and violent but turned out vulnerable. Sam (Cannonball) was obviously traumatized and created a sympathetic figure (even though Charlie's exaggerated drawl was hard to listen to at times). Rahne (Wolfsbane) had an interesting storyline with her religious background. 'Berto (Sunspot) had maybe the most interesting power, but probably the least development of his past.Where the problem arises for me was the portrayal of Dani (Mirage). The character could have been compelling as the reluctant antagonist that can't control herself. Blu's portrayal along with a dreadful script make Dani more of a cheeseball, cringe worthy outsider. The emotions only occasionally feel real, and even then they're accompanied by lines like ""You don't know me"", ""everything's gonna be okay"", and ""I feel like I made you up"". Among the star studded young cast, Dani feels like a displaced Disney Channel character that does everything out of the ""good of her heart"". The romance with Rahne is a bright spot, giving her a true motivation for the second half.Overall, I wanted to like this movie, and can only say I kind of did. A much better ending to the (FO)X-men than Dark Phoenix was. The inclusion of Essex Corp was the remainder of a script that led to greater impact throughout the universe, that we will likely never see.TL; DR: Wanted to like it, main character flaws, not bad at all",The New Mutants
1296,weaponandy,Great Addition to the Series. Solid Film Overall.,10,3 October 2020,"It's pretty good regardless of weather or not you read the comics. It's not a perfect movie by far. But it's good. Way better than X-Men:TLS, Origins, Apocalypse, and Dark Phoenix. But it stands on it's own. It works as a original horror film, but even better as a story about mutants in prison who believe they are in a hospital. A lot of surprises in this film and quite a bit of fan service for what it was. Good Acting, Good Action, Good Horror, Great FX, and good Cinematography. The theme feels creepy throughout and has just enough jokes and chemistry between characters to give it heart and soul. Definitely should have been released two years ago, we could have got a sequel. Either way glad to add it on to my list as one of the good ones.",The New Mutants

I went into it with little to no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the experience I had. I found myself really connecting to the characters, gripped by the story, chuckling at the X-Men references, and completely enthralled by the wlw love story subplot. All in all, I'd say it was worth the wait. I'm going to assume the reason this is rated lower than Dark Phoenix is because it has significantly fewer reviews. But that might just be wishful thinking. Either way, it's nice to sit in the small circle of people who find enjoyment in something it appears many do not and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I have been a fan of comics for a long time and when this movie was announced I was very pleased. I am familiar with the comics this was based on and thought the film used the source material very well.
The cast was well picked and the portrayals of the mutants was good.
I thought the visual effects were very good and the setting was perfect.

If i'm being entirely truthful the cast was amazing except for the main character, who came off like she was in a bad disney movie throughout the whole movie and i really wanted to punch her in the stomach, but that's ok, because the other members of the cast distracted me from her annoyances. Apart from that, other than it being a little slow in some places and then being rushed at the end, it was a cool movie and definitely doesn't deserve half of the abuse it's been receiving.",The New Mutants

You can definitely tell where most of the money was allocated. I judge movies on a slightly different scale than others. Movies like this, I'm not looking for a cinematic masterpiece. I just want to be entertained, and it did its job. I also went in knowing nothing about The New Mutants comics or expecting any kind of horror element, so there was nothing really to disappoint me. I was bored at times, but, in my opinion, the insanely dope parts were enough to make seeing this film worth my time. I'm also a sucker for over-the-top sci-fi & fantasy.

You get this sorry excuse of a Marvel film. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all of the supposed horror elements. If you've seen Stranger Things, you've enjoyed a far better version of the ""mysterious facility for kids with powers"" story. The characters are flat and predictable. The plot is barely there. The film makers left so much material untouched. Where were the back stories of each character? Where are the revelations about who is really behind the hospital?

Minimal special effects that could have been made 10 years ago. I did not find anything entertaining or imaginative or attractive about the character's demonstrated mutant powers to identify with that I was looking forward to. I kept waiting for the plot to develop into the next phase of the story, but it was not there...you could have summarized the plot with three sentences.From an objective viewpoint of not reading the comics and not knowing the story line, the poor editing of the film made it difficult to grasp what was happening for the last 3rd of the film.Being an optimistic person and looking for progressive and positive change in the World, I was disgusted by the amount of nastiness and hate Magik hurled onto Mirage for no apparent reason other than to define her character. Do we really need to see this amount of hatred modeled for young people to see in this day and age?Furthermore, do we really need to see the possibility of suicide as an option demonstrated to solve one's problem presented to impressionable young people?My point is, as a filmmaker it is important to take some responsibility for what you present to your audiences as an positive influence to the audience...not just hold true to a required plot line.Not one person in the 30 person audience I was in laughed once the entire movie. Such a depressing dark movie that accomplished its mission to bring a comic book to the sliver screen. No reward for the viewer except to be informed by actors acting with a modicum of depth.As a parent, I see no value for teenagers to see this movie. It should have gotten an R rating due to its virulence on the viewer. The PG-13 rating is ironic compared to the X-Men ""Logan"" which was rated R for a reason but did not assault the viewer.",The New Mutants

1309,leoste-54938,From a fan of the 80s comic book,6,29 August 2020,"Well, I kinda grew up with those kids and their big brothers X-Men between other characters. So I was expecting the movie for a long time.Let's say it could have been far better. And yet far worse. The biggest problem to me is the lack of supporting characters, even,say, guards and nurses in the facility who would have helped giving it a more realistic view. The place feels hollow, and that makes it all looks cheap.
And as written by someone else, this movie needs a rock n' roll soundtrack.
Using a ""legend"" for children (heard so many times) in the beginning makes it sounds cheesy, and the horror vibe felt in the trailer never really happens.Yet... The characters are promising. If only they're given the opportunity to be seen again.
Illyana/Magik is the most interesting as already noted. Roberto/Sunspot is a funny and friendly one, and Sam/Cannonball gives the right human touch. Rahne/Wolfsbane can be improved, as she's originally much more incapacitated by her religious bigotry. Danielle/Moonstar, well... She lacks substance.
If only there was a sequel to perfect those points, and give the New Mutants a real chance... the potential is there, the characters created by Chris Claremont have a lot to give to the movies.
Last but not least, even with all its imperfections, I still had a good time.",The New Mutants
