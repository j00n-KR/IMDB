0,SnoopyStyle,Silly graphics Silly story but hot young Angelina Jolie,6,18 September 2013,"Dade (Jonny Lee Miller) is a young hacker who got caught when he was younger. He's in yet another new school, and soon he's fallen for Kate (Angelina Jolie). Little did he know, she's an elite hacker also. Together with other hackers, they intend to stop a security expert (Fisher Stevens) from stealing a big stash of cash and hide it by sinking oil tankers thru a computer virus.The story is kinda silly, the clothes are stupid, and the graphics is ridiculously silly. At least there's some cool music, and a hot young Angelina Jolie. No wonder Jonny Lee Miller put a ring on it. I guess there's some cult status value in this movie.",Hackers
1,gavin6942,What Hacking Looked Like in 1995?,7,26 November 2015,"A young boy is arrested by the U.S. Secret Service for writing a computer virus and is banned from using a computer until his 18th birthday. Years later, he and his new-found friends discover a plot to unleash a dangerous computer virus, but they must use their computer skills to find the evidence while being pursued by the Secret Service and the evil computer genius behind the virus.I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s and was involved in computer culture. I was never a ""hacker"" but I understood what ""phreaking"" and other hacking-related activities were. We knew what ""war driving"" was. The stuff depicted in this film was unrealistic then and remains unrealistic today (for the most part).It serves as an interesting nostalgia piece, if anyone can be nostalgic for the 90s. Also, this has to be one of Angelina Jolie's breakout roles. Who knew in 1995 that she would go on to be a celebrated director and something of Hollywood royalty?",Hackers
2,lee_eisenberg,hacking was only the beginning,8,12 April 2021,"The internet was still in its relative infancy when Iain Softley's ""Hackers"" got released. Now that we have Anonymous exposing all sorts of government information, the actions of the characters in this movie look tame. Nonetheless, the movie is not only a cool look into the world of hacker subculture, but also a look at corporate malfeasance (I wouldn't put it past any corporate exec to do what Fisher Stevens's character does).Obviously I can't vouch for the accuracy of anything depicted here; movies tend to play with reality a bit. Even so, it's a brisk ride from beginning to end. At this point, it's also known for early appearances of Angelina Jolie and Matthew Lillard (of ""Scream""). Also appearing briefly are Felicity Huffman (now disgraced for her bribing of a college) and Ravil Isyanov (who played a supporting role on ""GLOW"").",Hackers
3,Tweekums,Dated but still rather fun,7,26 August 2019,"This cyber thriller is centred on Dade Murphy an eighteen year old hacker who has recently moved to New York City with his mother. At his new school he quickly becomes friends with a group of fellow hackers... and crosses swords with Kate Libby, not realising that she is also a hacker. One of his new group of friends tries to prove that he can hack as well as the others breaks into the super-computer of a mineral company and copies a garbage file to prove he was there... he doesn't know it contains evidence of a scheme by the companies head of security to steal millions of dollars and then capsize ships to make it look like terrorist action by hackers! Soon he is arrested; now Dade, his friends and Kate must find a way to uncover the truth... that will mean more hacking and avoiding arrest.If you want a realistic use of the use of computers in the mid-nineties than this fill will only irritate you; however if you just want a fun thriller where you can laugh at the sillier moments it is worth watching. It is clearly trying to do for computer hacking what 'Pump Up the Volume' did for pirate radio but not as well. Johnny Lee Miller is solid as Dade and Angelina Jolie, looking great with short hair, impresses as Kate. The rest of the cast are solid enough even though some of their characters are rather irritating. Most irritating for me was the villain, Eugene 'The Plague' Belford; he wasn't menacing enough and the way he insisted on being called The Plague just made him childish. There is a degree of tension although one never feels that characters are in physical danger. Overall I'd say that this film has dated it is still good silly fun if you are in the right mood.",Hackers
4,blanche-2,not of my generation but okay,6,28 January 2008,"I had some trouble getting into the teens in ""Hackers"" because for me, even the 1995 types seem like they're from another planet. A cast of now familiar faces (Fisher Stevens, Angelina Jolie, Lorraine Bracco, Jonny Lee Miller, Jesse Bradford, Laurence Mason) tell the story of a bunch of hackers who are about to be framed for a fraud put together by the computer security person in a corporation (Stevens) and his girlfriend, also inside the corporation (Bracco). The beginning is especially good - an district attorney (Felicity Huffman) speaks of the dastardly deeds of the defendant, a destructive criminal - and the camera pans to an 11-year-old boy, Dade Murphy, who is Johnny Lee Miller's character as a child. The boy is forbidden by the court to have a touch tone phone or a computer until he turns 18. The story continues 7 years later when Dade is up to his old tricks and joins a group of hackers with handles like Acid Burn and Cereal Killer.As mentioned in several comments, a lot of ""Hackers"" is dated now - like the 28.8 modem - but it's still fun, with very colorful computer screens, many of which will take old-timers back to the psychedelic days. Though I enjoyed the movie, I don't think I was the target demographic.",Hackers
5,edwagreen,This Movie Should Have Been Hacked-Hackers *,3,27 June 2010,"Idiotic movie where a group of real high school losers are portrayed as the good guys here even though they're into hacking.We hear familiar names and words such as viruses, worms, Da Vinci Code and all sorts of mess in this totally mixed up movie.Angelina Jolie looks like she is an alien from another planet. Bad guy Fisher Stevens appears to look like the devil and Lorraine Bracco doesn't really have a clue to what's going on here; although, she is fully aware about the money going into her account.The FBI thinks they know what's happening, but they prove not to be savvy as well.The guy with the sack on his back gives a new meaning to the word retardation. He has appeared in similar roles in other films and by his same actions, he may best be described as a total jerk.Who computed this mess?",Hackers
6,BandSAboutMovies,Hack the planet,6,17 April 2021,"Before we begin discussing Hackers, perhaps the most 90's movie of all time next to Singles, let's apply our version of the Turning test to it to see if we can consider Hackers a true cyber punk film.Does it have the title of a Philip K. Dick book but not really have much to do with it?Nope. This is grounded in the world of phreaks and hackers, as best seen in real life in the documentary Hackers: The History of Hacking.Is there a lot of rain?Not so much.Does the male hero wear dress clothes and/or a trenchcoat?Oh man, everyone wears a trenchcoat at one time or another, as well as having their own very distinct style of uniform. It's kind of like The Warriors on a much, much smaller scale.Do Keanu Reeves, Ben Affleck, Dolph Lundgren or Udo Keir appear in it?No, but man, I sure wish they did.Does the internet do something it can't do yet, yet look dated AF?That's this entire movie. Seriously, a lot of the internet appears as if it lives in the characters' heads as clips from old movies and TV shows, as if this were Dream On (an ancient HBO reference I realize is going over the heads of way too many of our readers). Also: there's a scene where the Internet is used to turn off a Wally George-style show (I was born in 1972, people) and a videotape of The Outer Limits plays in its place. Low tech in the service of high tech.Are Stabbing Westward, KMFDM, Ministry or God Lives Underwater on the soundtrack?This movie didn't just have one soundtrack, it had three different releases. The first has Carl Cox, Machines of Loving Grace, Leftfield, Underworld and Orbital on it. The second has The Orb, David Bowie, BT and Moby. And the third has those artists plus Fluke and John Lydon. Even better, Simon Boswell, who did the music for Stage Fright and Phenomena, amongst others, did the score.Is it a crappy version of Blade Runner?Nope. There is a William Gibson reference, which I may need to add to the test.Are there numerous Asian-influenced scenes?Surprisingly, no.Do people use future terms that make no sense?Throughout.Are there a lot of whirring sound effects?Of course they do.Do people stare at the camera as it moves through a neon-lit strip club?Yes, it has a party scene that is so opulent that you wonder, ""How can these be teenagers?""Are there rock stars in it?Yes! Marc Anthony plays an FBI agent. One could argue that Angelina Jolie is beyond a rock star if you want to get technical.Is there a feral child?I'd argue that every single one of the Hackers is a feral child.By following the rules of this text, as designed by our team of engineers here - me, basically - the ruling is that Hackers is not post-apocalyptic (barring a Tenebre-level in the director's head twist) nor is it cyberpunk. It is, however, an ancient future film and one that had my wife wondering, ""Was this what the nineties were like?"" She was born in 1984 and I have to confess to you, dear reader, that my 90's were spent in college and working eighty-plus hour a week advertising jobs.I told her, ""This is what it was like all the time.""Back in August of 1988, a hacker named Zero Cool used his 1200 baud modem to crash 1,500 computer systems and cause a seven-point drop in the NYSE. It turns out that said hacker was really eleven-year-old Dade Murphy, who is banned from all computers and touch-tone phones - how would he call 911? - until he turns eighteen.Literally the day he turns legal, Dade becomes Crash Override and pulls off that VHS switcheroo we discussed above. He's met and countered by another hacker named Acid Burn, who kicks him out. Oh yeah - and he's also played by Johnny Lee Miller now.He has a new school and has to fit in. Magically, this school has an entire roster of hackers who all follow the Hacker Manifesto.""This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity.""They are:Ramon ""The Phantom Phreak"" Sanchez: Able to get into any phone system, he's played by Renoly Santiago from Dangerous Minds and Con Air.Emmanuel ""Cereal Killer"" Goldstein: Matthew Lillard is this guy, who seemingly dresses as if he was inside the Matrix four years before that movie ever got made. He's also edgy and wears dresses because he's a hacker and hackers do whatever they want. Lillard was also 25 when this was made, making him the oldest of the high school hackers.Paul ""Lord Nikon"" Cook: Given this name because he has a photographic memory, this hacker is played by Laurence Mason.Joey Pardella: Played by Jesse Bradford, he's the youngest member of the group and has not yet earned his hacker code name (when I went to my first hackathon, they have us all printed name badges that many of us covered up with electric tape so no one could tie our faces in to our handles; I was 14 and my parents dropped me off. I was the youngest person there by several decades).Kate ""Acid Burn"" Libby: Pretty much considered the greatest hacker around, she's the frenemy of our lead and a rich girl who throws indulgent parties. She's also Angelina Jolie and coming into her peak of power here. This part was originally going to be played by Katherine Heigl, who did the second Under Siege movie instead.Crash Override has to prove himself to his new hacker buddies, so he breaks into ""The Gibson"" - yay cyberpunk reference - the supercomputer that runs the Ellingson Mineral Company. While downloading a garbage file as proof, his mother - who is convinced he's back to his evil hacking ways - unplugs the computer.This brings him to the attention of sell-out hacker turned computer security officer Eugene ""The Plague"" Belford (Fisher Stevens, which when you think about it is amazing casting, as just eight years earlier he was playing the hero version of the hacker role in Short Circuit; Johnny Five would not be pleased by this turn of events). Yes, he is pulling off the Richard Pryor Superman III scam that would one day become the Office Space scam.It turns out that the file our hero has downloaded isn't garbage. It's a virus that will destroy a fleet of oil tankers that The Plague plans on taking advantage of and blaming hackers. He brings in the Secret Service to go after our heroes, who have to use their powers of typing, logging on and pranking people to win the day.There's also an internet TV show called ""Hack the Planet"" that for some reason has no buffering issues, which remain a problem in 2021 much less in 1995 when this was made.Also - how about getting Lorraine Bracco as our hero's mom, Felicity Huffman as an attorney and Penn Jilette as Hal, an IT guy who gets no nickname? Plus, that bearded London-based hacker? That's David A. Stewart of Eurythmics!This is my favorite fact about this movie: ""The cast spent three weeks getting to know each other and learning how to type and rollerblade."" Yes, rollerblading is an essential part of the plot!Director Ian Softly - who also made Backbeat - would go on to direct K-PAX, a movie in which Kevin Spacey eats a banana skin and all.",Hackers
7,michaelRokeefe,The trials and tribulations of computer wizardry.,5,28 April 2002,"This movie has some brilliant moments. This is computer wizard heaven/hell. Some young students/hacking computer 'geeks' stumble upon an embezzlement scheme and use their wizardry to thwart the criminal masterminds. I admit watching this for one reason...Angelina Jolie. Even with a 'butch' haircut, she is one sensual goddess. Fisher Stevens is outstanding as 'The Plague'. Jonny Lee Miller in the lead role is arrested as a child using the moniker of 'Zero Cool'. After serving a lengthy probation period he takes up the name 'Crash Override' and finds himself in competition with 'Acid Burn'(Jolie). This manic computer madness also features Matthew Lillard, Jesse Bradford, Peter Y. Kim and Darren Lee.",Hackers
8,hitchcockthelegend,A wakeup call for the Nintendo generation? Hit the snooze button instead.,4,4 July 2012,"Hackers is directed by Iain Softley and written by Rafael Moreu. It stars Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Jesse Bradford, Matthew Lillard, Laurence Mason, Renoly Santiago, Fisher Stevens and Lorraine Bracco. Music is scored by Simon Boswell and Guy Pratt and cinematography by Andrzej Sekula. Young Dade Murphy (Miller) gets banned from touching a computer again until his 18th birthday because of a infamous hacking stunt. Moving to New York with his mum, Dade meets like-minded techno heads at his new school. When one of them hacks into a scam masterminded by The Plague (Stevens), the gang find themselves framed and have to not only clear their names, but also avert computer catastrophe.I desperately don't want to be one of this middle aged squares who frowns at teenagers, I consistently worry about the widening generational gap. Yet Hackers is irritating beyond compare, a film that, were I a teenage techno geek, would probably be on my ""epic"" favourites list. The 90s saw a rush of cyberspace/computer based thrillers, think The Net, Antitrust, The Lawnmower Man et al, none of which had the savvy nous or intelligence of War Games a decade earlier or Sneakers from 92. The main problem with Hackers is that it forgoes plot in favour of bombarding the viewer with techno babble and flashy visuals, it thinks it's being immeasurably cool by having this bunch of genius hacker kids (who conveniently all go to the same school) take on the establishment, but it's desperately shallow and comes off as an excuse to showcase some pretty young things in a world that the writers know nothing about.Computer based crime is very real, now more than ever, and it's frightening, but this never comes to the fore here, the peril is preposterous and pushed to the sidelines. In fact the only thing scary here is Matthew Lillard's pig-tail plats! Softley, who made the rather great Backbeat, is more content with MTV style coolness than making his film stand on its own thematic two feet. It's all very colourful, but even the gorgeous colour only serves to make this teen hacker world seem like a space age cartoon, the fashions more at home in an episode of The Jetsons. If it was Softley and the writer's intention to create an alien teen world, one that the adults are bemused by, then that would be impressive, but I really don't think it's that at all, especially since it rings so false. The young actors are enthusiastic, but that's about it, leaving Fisher's villain to hog the limelight, while Bracco is woeful.I can ""dig"" fanciful entertainment and spandex, but I'd also like a bit of substance with my eye orgasms too, Mr Softley. Thanks but no thanks, dude. 4/10",Hackers
9,view_and_review,Made Computer Nerds Hip,8,3 September 2020,"1995 gave us ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" ""Virtuosity,"" ""The Net,"" and ""Hackers."" All digital age tech movies. Of the four, ""Hackers"" is by far my favorite. It is similar to ""The Net"" in that both movies showed the vulnerabilities of our cyber world. But before I start gushing too much over ""Hackers,"" I must first give credit to the mother of them all: ""War Games"" (1983).""War Games"" with Matthew Broderick was the first movie, to my knowledge, featuring a hacker. I don't think that word was used back then, but ""War Games'"" main character was using a dial-up modem at a speed God knows how slow to hack into military computers. This was back before anything such as the internet and when only the military was using anything such as a network. Fast-forward twelve years and ""The Net"" and ""Hackers"" showed the world how computers had taken over and were no longer just a tool of the military.""Hackers"" was hip, it was punk, it was grunge, it was fun. Actors like Angelina Jolie (Kate/Acid Burn) and Matthew Lillard (Cereal) made the movie pop. Add to them a suitable supporting cast and a dope plot and ""Hackers"" becomes a cult classic.",Hackers
10,zetes,Dumb but fun,7,6 September 2015,"Incredibly boneheaded techno thriller, but it's so goony it ends up being quite entertaining. A group of teens (among them an incredibly nubile Angelina Jolie with a darling pixie cut) are expert hackers, but they're up against an even more powerful evil hacker (Fisher Stevens) who is trying to frame them for a crime he is going to commit. Jonny Lee Miller is the male lead, a notorious hacker from a young age. Among others, Matthew Lillard also co-stars, and is as annoying as always. But, really, every character here is quite annoying, so he doesn't grate too much. The film gets by mostly on its weird, actually kind of fun aesthetics. Computer visualizations are always stupid, and, in a movie from 1995, they're going to look even more stupid to a modern audience. The costumes are particularly amazing. One might be tempted to say that this movie is incredibly '90s in its style, but, really, no one in the 1990s ever dressed or spoke like this. It's like a film slightly outside of time. I think the director wanted it to seem slightly futuristic. Instead it's just slightly crazy.",Hackers
11,Mr-Fusion,"High on attitude, not on story",5,17 December 2015,"I'm pretty sure I was the target age for this movie back in '95, but ""Hackers"" seemed to come and go with little fanfare. And then, for no discernible reason, it didn't reappear on my radar for another 20 years. And at 34, it's not really my cup of tea; partly because it's got undiluted '90s in its DNA and hackers-as-MTV-youth-culture, but mostly because it takes forever to get cooking. It's a movie that has to make up a lot of its cyber-speak because the future wasn't so clear back then (it's understandable; a lot of TV shows were doing the same thing), and it almost compensates with an aggressive pop style . . . but until our main ensemble discovers the virus, it's kind of a slog.Hollywood's done much better in the cyberspace department, and ""Hackers"" is maybe a step or two above ""Disclosure"" fare.Count me out.5/10",Hackers
12,Irishchatter,Best movie of Angelina Jolie and Johnny Lee Miller...,9,10 November 2015,"I swear, this movie really excites you because you get to learn all the hacking methods they used to get into computers. Now, I'm pretty sure the codes and computers back then looked to be completely rubbish but really, they had a lot of potential. Nowadays, I say hacking is easily accessible because we use a lot of technology. Don't worry,I'm not a hacker myself but in the movie, it's just mind-blowing to look at the equipment to use and how they can instantly hack with no problems! Man, you probably need to make an effort with your brain in order to do that stuff!Angelina Jolie looks really different with short hair but she hasn't changed a bit. Johnny Lee Miller made me satisfied this time, I'm still not that fond of him in Sherlock. However he would do better in other things then that terrible show. This film is well done, you better believe it!",Hackers
13,atlasmb,A Cute Cyberdrama,5,4 November 2013,"""Hackers"" is a cyberdrama from 1995 that fails to deliver much drama. The technical aspects of the film might be called ""quaint"" by today's standards. Of course it is always difficult to create drama on film when most of the action is someone typing on a keyboard. The answer is usually to offer graphic (mis)representations of the internal actions. And maybe to project screen images onto the faces of the typists. This film never generates much heat. The impending catastrophe never feels like it is of consequence. The hackers and their enemies have a conflict that could be described as ""cute"". In fact, this film is more comedy than drama.The primary actors are all young kids. Seeing Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller (exes who met on this film) in the lead roles offers the greatest joy in Hackers. In 2013, Jonny Lee is now playing Sherlock Holmes in TV's ""Elementary"" and doing a great job. Angelina has turned in some very good performances since Hackers and is now an icon of American cinema and culture. It is also fun to see Fisher Stevens, Lorraine Bracco, Wendell Pierce (Suits""), Marc Anthony, and Penn Jillette.Dated stories do not have to feel dated. Consider ""Wargames"" with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy. That story is not just about computer activities; it has a very human story that drives the action. Unfortunately, Hackers does not have that much depth.",Hackers
14,leplatypus,Trash the bin (dvd),4,25 November 2010,"This is a strange movie: the young cast are cool but the villain is laughable. The story was interesting at a time when hackers went public and it's written like a thriller. It offers great moments: skyscrapers becoming processors and an outdoor shot at the top of the Empire State Building in New York. For one time, the sexual tension between the lead actors doesn't eclipse the story because it lasts until the maximum. In addition, the female partner being Angelina, it's thus a worthy wait!But, excuse me: the universe of hacking is ridiculous. First, their computers are totally tuned and they aren't look like the ones we used. Second, They dress like i-don't-know-what-they-wear. They make parties in an unimaginable club. They have a passion for skating! Moreover, the hacking is depicted like a dream which it's against its nature: computing isn't mathematics law flashing in the air or scintillating towers and pushing buttons.In conclusion, this movie has surely offended both the real hackers and its audience!",Hackers
15,digitalbeachbum,Comedy period piece with absolutely no realism,9,23 March 2020,"I laugh every time I see this movie. During the 70's to the 90's, I was part of this scene but we didn't talk this way and we certainly didn't act this way. The characters in this movie are condensed copies of several different versions of people the script writers might have heard second hand stories and then threw them all in to a melting pot to be mashed together.The music is definitely is for this time and were all hot tunes for the ravers. The wardrobe is definitely a miss for me and sort of reminds me of a Jackson Pollock painting. The dialog is a mishmash of cliquish phrases which by the time this movie came out were old news.Any hackers I knew during my time never used Apple Macintosh to do anything. Everything was IBM clones because of either UNIX or DOS command prompt interfaces. This period was before graphic user interface because command prompts were so much faster than point and click, plus the use of scripts.The user interface on the Gibson computer inside the mega corporation is ridiculous and an attempt of the director to fulfill a visual for the viewer.Note - The Secret Service had nothing to do with hackers who committed crimes within the borders of the USA. All the work tracking down hackers was done by either The FBI or local security services for phone companies or credit card services.So overall, this movie sucks so bad that it is good. It really sucks, such as the final scenes where they are spitting out jargon which makes no sense. It is like trying to speak German but blurting out random words you might know but they have no continuity.",Hackers
16,Anonymous_Maxine,The computer geek's dream...,7,26 December 2006,"More than a decade has passed since Hackers was released and movies about computers do not stand the test of time very well (at least as far as the technology in the films is concerned), but I think Hackers has stood the test of time relatively well, more than likely because it has such great characters and it's just so much fun.The movie was cast pretty much entirely with unknowns, and even with their tiny budget they were able to make this into a clever roller-coaster of a nerdy thriller, fulfilling the fantasy of every hacker of being chased by and outsmarting the government. The cheesy romance between Dade (Johnny Lee Miller) and Kate (Angelina Jolie) works surprisingly well, and the performances are impressive throughout. There is a sense of union and camaraderie that is generated between the characters, which is impressive because they don't just throw something into the dialogue about how long they've been friends. Consider the scene where Ramon taps the phone to get the operator and secretly dial his friend - ""It's in that place where I put that thing that time!""Everyone involved very easily passes as genuine computer geeks, although the movie also commits that early sin of having images from the computers projected onto the faces of the users, so you can watch text and pictures crawling up their faces and they stare at the screens, a goofy invention similar to the tendency - which persists to this day - of having any kind of computer or stopwatch usage being accompanied by lots of clicks and beeps, I suppose to remind the audience that something is happening or about to happen. But the computer stuff in the movie is really beside the point, which is good because it's so outlandish. Like WarGames, Hackers will have you believe that any kid with an internet connection can hack into government mainframes and cause a global crisis, financial or otherwise. The story is about the characters, which is good because they are well-developed, in most cases, while much of the rest of the movie is not. There is a clever villain who is not so much a villain as much as another hacker who happens to have different objectives. He has some smart lines (""Never fear, I is here.""), and the rivalry between him and the main characters provides for some great scenes. Besides being a curiosity piece about some well known actors at early points in their careers, Hackers is a smart technological thriller that takes wild creative liberties with the capabilities of a still- emerging technology, but makes it into quite a fun ride.",Hackers
17,Fluke_Skywalker,Welcome to the future of the past,8,12 April 2015,"I saw this three times in the early autumn of '95, and those admissions likely accounted for about half of its box office. I was dazzled by its visuals and techno-electronica soundtrack, and mesmerized by one of its young stars; a Ms. Angelina Jolie.I knew the instant I saw her that she was going to be a huge star. In fact, many people in the cast--then complete unknowns--would go on to success. Johnny Lee Miller, Matthew Lillard, Jesse Bradford, Marc Anthony, Wendell Pierce. But everything and everyone else ceases to exist when she's on screen.I talked the movie up to everyone who would listen, but my pleas fell on deaf ears. 20 years later it remains one of my favorite films, and as I understand it, it's developed a cult following. Through adult eyes, its ""Hack the planet"" lip service is pretty obvious for what it is, but strictly as a piece of pop art, I absolutely love this movie.",Hackers

The teeny-bopper cast proved to be worthy enough to hold the story together, even if Phreak did disappear for the third act of the movie. With a strong electronic soundtrack and some memorable hacker moments, this movie was much better than the typical teen-oriented movie. Oh well, those who have missed this movie are missing quite a bit. Fisher Stevens was a great villain, and Johnny Lee Miller's and Angelina Jolie's chemistry was superb.

I caught this(or part of it) on TV awhile back and found it incredibly confusing and hard to follow but fun and edgy too-I'm not the type who likes computer science fictions but this was cool and very fast paced although clearly just entertainment. It contained good visuals and an action paced feel to it. The problem is you only have to figure out what the heck's going on. Once you do though, it's really enjoyable and time passes quickly. In spite of the fact this isn't the type of movie I'd usually watch, it was interesting and deserving of at least a 7 rating. An odd movie but fast paced, exciting and you get sucked in whether you want to or not. I'd give it 7 out of 10.",Hackers
20,justin-fencsak,A movie that's now known for its soundtrack than the film itself...,6,16 December 2018,"As a kid growing up in the 90s, the closest thing to experiencing big movies were the soundtracks that came out around the same time as the theatrical release date a few days before it came out (nowadays it's a week before or the day of release)..it was also fun to read the title descriptions for each track as spoilers (case in point, Episode I). This was not the case with Hackers, which spawned two albums during that decade and launched the careers of many trip hop artists to millions of music fans. As for the movie itself, it was a product of its times and very original. Released during the same year that The Net, Virtuosity, and Johnny Mnemonic came out in the era of the first generation of VR and early internet, Hackers was Angelina Jolie's second film (her first was Cyborg 2) and the one in which she dated then married Johnny Lee Miller in his movie debut before breaking up with him and marrying Brad Pitt before breaking up. It's also the second movie to feature Lorraine Bracco, whose first film was the R rated Goodfellas. I first saw this movie on pan and scan VHS and enjoyed it for what it is...a hip thiller that marked the cinematic debut of the Playstation game wipeout as well as featuring Angelina Jolie's character Kate wearing a Devils jersey the same year that they won the Stanley Cup for the first time.",Hackers
21,bkrauser-81-311064,How To Make A Movie About Something You Know Nothing About,7,17 April 2012,"""Hackers"" is probably the best film you will ever watch about people hunched over on their computers. I doubt its realistic, my computer skills are limited to me knowing what a blog is. Still I know enough to assume a computer mainframe does not look like ""The Matrix"" (1999) had sex with ""Tron"" (1982) with a pair of 3D glasses. Still, the story was interesting enough and the characters were actually pretty interesting and sympathetic. Even the villain, a fellow computer-geek working for ""the man"" was decent in a nefarious Steve Urkel kind of way.The only sour point really was the inclusion of Matthew Lillard. Don't get me wrong I don't hate him as an actor I just hate the parts he was type-cast to play, i.e. annoying sidekicks who scarf down junk food while yelling ""dude"". The very fact that the principle cast was saved by him is indication enough you shouldn't take the movie seriously. Still for every Matthew Lillard there is a pre-""Tomb Raider"" (2001) Angelina Jolie.

23,film-critic,We have just gotten a wake-up call from the Nintendo Generation.,2,6 August 2005,"I remember watching Hackers on television and possibly on video when I was younger and being somewhat impressed. Not from the actual film itself, but from the fact that Hollywood would take the sidekicks of every other ""action"" film and give them their own film. It was refreshing, even if the overall feature did not settle well. It showed that Hollywood was willing to take a step forward in the world of creativity, and for a few films it brooded well. Now in 2005, I watch this film again, and am completely devastated by the results. Now, when I watch this film, I see clichéd characters, an uninvolved plot, complete disregard for the law, and extremely cheap computer graphics, which heavily stamped a date on this feature. Is this what hacking is all about? Is hacking about fighting evil hackers with virus', about growing out-dated over time, and about finding that one Goth girl that has a boyfriend and making her your own? That is what Hackers demonstrated to me, so why shouldn't I believe it? Director Ian Softley really went outside of his tent when creating this film. Going from the feature Backbeat, about music's cultural icons, to this just doesn't  well  compute. He had this great opportunity to bring an unknown culture into a mainstream light, but instead he teeny-bopped it out of reality. He transforms these unsociable, outcast geniuses into superheroes, armed with nothing more than keyboards, high libidos, teen music, and an overabundance of clichés. If I were a member of the hacker community I would be outraged about this film. It is like making a movie about Superman wearing a Batman costume, two different cultures were intertwining incorrectly and nobody was there to stop it. We needed The Matrix, but all we got was American Pie. To help remedy this situation, we needed three distinct changes. We needed stronger actors to accompany their characters, a tighter story that dove deeper into the hacker culture, and we needed stronger CGI, which wouldn't date this early 90s film.Jonny Lee Miller was decent, Angelina carried her own, Jesse Bradford was wasted, but overall the most hurtful part of these characters was that they never quite ""gelled"" together. I never quite saw these main characters working together after this. I never saw them remaining friends or pursuing their computer degrees further. We opened with only enough information for us to feel sympathy for Miller and literally left with no care in the world what would happen to these characters after the credit sequence. This is not strong film-making. I like to end films with a sensation that life outside the camera will continue in a linear course, but with Hackers that sensation never erupted. I think some of this has to do with Matthew Lillard who just floundered his performance (almost to the clichéd ""T"") and decayed nearly every scene he was involved with. The only attribute he was able to succeed with was annoying, and I don't think that is what Softley was shooting for. These characters were painful to watch and thankfully were able to rebound after this film, sans Matthew Lillard.The story. Without detailing too much, the story was unoriginal. It felt as if we took a general action film, erased the main heroes, and instead substituted this band of hipster hackers as our heroines. Which means, a very clichéd story equipped with our very own over-acting villain, ""The Plague"". What was his role in this film outside of telling Penn Jillette what to do, and sleeping with Lorraine Bracco? His spoken words were hideous and painful to the ear, coupled with his one-dimensional character really left us with a villain that never quite covered the ""evil"" ground. Neither him nor Bracco felt ""evil"". Instead, from the moment we met them we knew what would be their fate. There was nothing that Softley could have done to avoid this  outside of making better casting decisions, a stronger story, and a decent climax.Finally, I would like to say that this film felt like the mid-90s. No matter how you look at it, the choice for graphics in this film completely dates the picture. If you think you are going to gather up your computer friends for a rousing night of micro-brews and this feature, you will find yourself definitely alone by the end of the evening. Softley's use of random letters, images, and computer-enhanced something-or-others, didn't even feel like computers. I remember playing computer games back in the 80s that made more sense than this. I felt cheapened after seeing these terminally poor graphics and wondered if this film was used to push computer companies into a better era. Either way, Softley's CGI use in this film was hysterically bad, causing a ripple of cheapness to cascade through this film.Overall, I wasn't happy with my future viewing of this film. Perhaps I should have left this film go in the 90s, but watching it today I felt cheap and robbed. Softley's inaccurate portrayal of this hacker culture only brewed a deeper dislike of Hollywood and their ability to capitalize on this unknown world. The cast was atrocious (Matthew Lillard), the story can be seen in dozens of other action-genre films, and the central focus of this film, the computer graphics, were apparently designed by Wal-Mart. Hackers is a disgraceful mess of a film that should be locked in the film vault never to be released again.Grade: * out of *****",Hackers

But good that it shows us how Angelina looked and lived when she was young, about the same age as me now. It shows us that she is just another random human being who is almost totally different than she is today. Much less famous, beautiful, and rich. But also that she may know some stuff more than we think she knows today. Also good insight into hacking and phreaking and teaches us many words from those areas. Still boredom dominates and bit tiring to watch. Ironically, shows us her real life boyfriends or husband a bit.",Hackers
25,classicalsteve,A Film About Hackers for Gen X Computer Geeks: Reasonably Good If Rather Fantastical,7,12 October 2015,"""Hackers"" is exactly as the name implies. However, much of the film makes it appear hackers can target credit cards, alter traffic light systems, and issue arrest warrants at will. Certainly, hackers have done things on a large scale, such as the recent hacking of Sony Pictures Studio and Target stores. If hackers really had the ability to do all the things implied by the film, we wouldn't be able to function in the mechanized world as it is.The film begins when Dade Murphy (Jonny Lee Miller), age 11, engaged one of the most successful and damaging computer hacks in the history of internet infiltration, crashing 1500+ systems. He's sentenced to probation, his parents fined $10,000's, and he's forbidden to use a computer until age 18. Fast-forward 7 years. Now he's at a high school in New York where he meets fellow computer hackers Kate Libby, a.k.a. Acid Burn (Angelina Jolie), Ramόn Sánchez (Renoly Santiago), Joey Pardella (Jesse Bradford) and Lord Nikon (Laurence Mason). At first they see hacking as a kind of game, looking to one-up each other.Dade and Kate then decide to have a competition: who can do the best hacking of one of the poor schmucks from the FBI who has been targeting hackers, Agent William ""Dick"" Gill. The stakes: if she loses, she has to go on a date with him and wear a dress, or if he loses, he has to become her slave. So they begin the competition, a kind of virtual football match, in true hacking style. They invalidate his credit card, put up a porn ad in his name and give out his business phone number where NY gays and transvestites can call him. They even pull the worst trick: they indicate in his file that he's deceased.It's all good fun until the youngest of the hackers, Joey, breaks into ""The Gibson"", an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer. He notices there's a strange virus in the system and downloads some of it, putting it on a partially downloaded 3.5"" floppy disk (remember those?). The FBI at the behest of their systems security analyst Eugene Belford, a.k.a. The Plague (Fisher Stevens), tracks down Joey and arrests him, but not before he hides the disk. Later, Belford and the FBI storm into Joey's house, and the systems security analyst Belford threatens Dade to give them the information they want, which is hidden on the disk. Dade declines saying he doesn't play well with others, to which Belford takes out his frustration on a piece of music equipment in Dade's bedroom. The hackers then discover a virus, which was not written by the hackers, is going to wreak havoc with the company via large cargo ships at sea. They realize the blame will most likely be put on them.While this is certainly not the best film of this type, it's a good one. Some of the visuals are stunning, and interestingly, the movie doesn't come off dated even though it was produced a couple of decades before this writing. The characters are rather interesting, depicting Generation X types who hack into computer systems, not for a living, but for fun. And I liked Fisher Stevens as the former hacker turned security analyst who understands hacker culture. This film was made from the point of view of young computer geeks of Generation X. The older generation, Boomers and Silent in other words, come off rather stilted and nondescript, which I agree is a good depiction, being a Generation X'er myself.",Hackers

The movie could have used a bit more of an attitude like hers, as none of the other hackers are nearly as interesting as she is. Fisher Stevens makes a decent nemesis, and if you only know him from Short Circuit, you'll be surprised. Hackers itself is a fun little middle finger to the establishment.

29,roedyg,"incompetently written, fun",5,7 October 2014,"Making a movie about computers is difficult. Even the latest equipment looks ridiculously antique within a few years of release. There is not really anything to see -- just people sitting at keyboards. You must interpret it poetically. There is not much action. The public has no idea what is really going on.The best attempts, like Tron, work at two levels, direct action for the kids, and subtle in-jokes and metaphors for the computer savvy.Hackers has lots of energy, but it is downright silly.For a start, the techno-babble is complete gibberish. The screenwriters did not even know the difference between a modem, a screen and RAM. I think they composed the dialogue by looking up computer jargon in a dictionary and throwing the words into a hat. They make zero attempt at plausibility.This incompetence quickly destroys the illusion we are viewing whiz kids capable of bringing down civilisation as we know if they so chose.Most of the dialogue is theme and variation on ""I'm the king of the castle, and you're the dirty rascal"". It sounds like something first graders would say. It is so juvenile, it is jarring.Another jarring thing. Dade and his mother stayed in a one-bedroom apartment where mom slept on the couch. Yet Dade had thousands of dollars to spend on clothes and hairstyling.There is a goony character called Cereal. He appears to be brain damaged, perhaps from too many drugs. Yet we are supposed to believe he took over all TV channels of earth.But the main problem with the movie was the lead Dade, played by Johnny Lee Miller. He was badly miscast. His hair was expensively bleached and each curl pressed into place. He wore a leather jacket costing thousands of dollars that Liberace might have coveted. His facial features were so sharp he could cut cheese with them, but he had no sizzle. He came across as soggy as yesterday's waffle, a sort of young Lawrence Welk. His voice was as flat as Houston astronaut ground control.Angelina Jolie did a great job with the atrocious dialogue they handed her. She was like a time bomb about to explode. It is too bad the movie was not written more around her acting skills.A touch I did like was the way the characters got around their city with dazzling speed on roller blades. It added some visual excitement and flash.Some of the CGI visuals to poetically represent hacking into computers were of course completely unrealistic, but at least interesting and metaphorically evocative.A movie is a team. The writers were incompetent though the basic plot was quite clever. Most of the actors were great. The visual effects people were ahead of their time (but of course dated now).

The bit about recording the sound of quarters falling into the pay phone, aspects of social engineering and dumpster diving to gain corporate information were all tried and true methods. And, with the exception of the phone thing, the other two are still valid aspects that people use to gain access to secure systems. Then some other more fanciful aspects of it like the inside of the computer, the graphical interfaces and some of the attempts to make hacking look suspenseful were pure Hollywood. Trust me when I say that hacking is dull and most of the time is done using a text editor like Notepad or Pico.But beyond that, the movie is fun and shouldn't be taken too seriously.",Hackers
33,chrisbrown6453,"This movie is great, just don't expect a 'Matrix' type budget!",9,8 September 2000,"Hackers is by far a fantasy movie.  Where else could you find cool teenage kids totally engulfed in computer hacking?  This movie in completely full of ridicules computer screen shots and creates a mockery of computer hackers. Even with all this said, I liked this movie very much, and still believe that it's great acting, and well-written story should be considered when viewing this movie.Hackers begins by showing us the early life of Dade Murphy or `Crash Override' to his hacker buddies.  When he was 9 years old, Dade crashed computers all over the world.  He was caught, and his sentence was, among other things, the inability to own a computer, or a use a phone for `hacking' purposes until the day of his 17th birthday. 
Fast-forward to his birthday, and he and his mother have since moved, and Dade now knows no one, and cleverly introduces himself to Kate Libby known to her friends as `Acid Burn'.Hackers is a movie about a group of friends who are framed for setting up an oil tanker to spill over into the ocean, which is owned by a company that employs Eugene Belford or `The Plague' played by Fisher Stevens.  Eugene has framed the group of hackers to throw off the powers that be to his illegal embezzling of his company's money.The story is well written, and the choice of actors was well thought out. Newcomer Jonny Lee Miller (Dade Murphy) is perfect as the `leader' of the group.  The always beautiful and newly recognized Angelina Jolie (Kate Libby) is perfect as the love interest of Dade, and plays this role perfectly.  The always funny and crazy Matthew Lillard completes the cast of hackers.As good as this movie is, you can really tell that they had a very small budget, and they rushed to put it together.  The editor of the movie must have been sick the day he was supposed to screen it because it is full of mistakes, and scenes that are clearly out of order.  This movie will only be liked by those who know nothing about computers, or those willing to sit back and enjoy a very well written story with a very good ending.  Forget the mistakes, and you will enjoy this one!  Besides, Angelina Jolie is in it!",Hackers
34,johnnymacbest,Entertaining '90s movie.,7,31 July 2009,"Despite being somewhat of a hit, ""Hackers"" is a cult classic, featuring a younger Angelina Jolie. Having just watched it recently, I didn't even now it was her until the end credits rolled in; surprised I was. Any how, that's not only the good thing about this film. There's a lot of entertainment value to be had here and the actors involved turn in a above average performance. Don't expect something along the lines of Shakespeare, this is just a fun little movie to relax and kick back to on a boring Saturday afternoon but above all that, the film gives us a vague glimpse of the power of technology and how it can be used for good and evil purposes. The main villain is simply wacky with a campy, tongue-in-cheek persona that works really well with the film.

35,HelenMary,90s cyber-punk cult classic for the Nintendo generation,6,28 January 2013,"Hackers is one of the original 90s hacker-slacker tech-geek movies off the back of, and updated, eighties' Matthew Broderick classics like Ferris Beuller and Wargames etc and early 90s films like Sneakers. It is stylized, not true of ""real"" hacking and the graphics and images (using city streets and building to represent circuitry), similar in look to some cyber parts of Johnny Mnemonic which was out the same year as well as a few other films from around the same time. It's a sexy, funny, much quotable romp with a sub-plot of romance. The main plot is mega-corporation conspiracy to hold tankers to ransom using a computer virus called Da Vinci and it's some College 'elite' hackers vs the FBI to be first to solve who is to blame and clear those who are innocent. Jonny Lee Miller is the hero of the piece and is gorgeous and confident, playing it cool and smooth opposite a young (and already stunning) Angelina Jolie often sans appropriate underwear. She is haughty and cold, and for only her first major film role completely sizzled. The chemistry between her and Miller was smoking, in art as in life.Overall the acting is a little overplayed and I feel that much of the film was tongue in cheek and not to be taken seriously, almost like a comic-strip adaptation. All the characters in the ""gang"" are larger than life from the extremely weird and intelligence-ambiguous Matthew Lillard as Cereal Killer (as in fruit loops) to the hyper 'boy wonder' Jesse Bradford as underdog-wanting-recognition Joey. Fisher Stevens plays manchild with boytoys 'The Freak' and does the role with crazy eccentricity and hubris together with his equally crazy partner in crime Margo (Lorraine Bracco) who is terminally hammy and over-the-over-the-top of everyone else but in a rather wooden and unconvincing kind of way. Look out for a young Penn Jillette (as in Penn and Teller). It's a great 90s film with a fab soundrack and wardrobe, especially Crash and Burn (Miller and Jolie), and a really exciting finale. However, whilst I like it a lot I don't think it aged well to appeal to a wider generation, but it remains a favourite of mine, which I watch every now and again for giggles and to bring back memories. That all said, the stand out message from this film is most certainly: ""Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right!""",Hackers

Miller, at a younger age, is shown to already possess the skills to do anything he wants with a computer.  When he comes into his own, he meets what could be his match in Jolie.  Only they don't know anything about each other yet.  It becomes their own personal competition court.  Miller, falling in love with Jolie, doesn't know whether he should kiss her or continue matching wits with her.But, once they discover who the other really is, they find they have a common enemy in Stevens, who wants what all bad guys want.  But, before he can collect, he has a few teenage mouths to shut, preferably permanently.Iain Softley did a very good job in promoting the characters throughout the film.  Knowing where each one came from upon their entrance onto the screen made me feel like I really knew them.  Stevens character was a bit of a wash because you could figure out what he was up to from the beginning, but it raises an age old question about how fine a line is there when it comes to breaking the law...then try to figure out who is really breaking it to begin with...",Hackers

So this film has many factual errors in it- its a film so as far as I am concerned any piece of fiction does not have to be based on fact.  This is not a documentary on Hackers, its a piece of entertainment concerning some extremely intelligent cyber punk kids who get framed.  If you don't focus on the story too much, but more the scenery, the pumping soundtrack and the style of the film; it will take you to another dimension. What I like about this film is its so easy to watch- there's nothing in this film that could make you squirm.  Its very nicely packaged, with a cast filled with up and coming young actors.

Which is not to say it's a perfect ten, it isn't. But it's a great combination of good cheeze and pure fun. Suspend all disbelief, it's not about realism. And try not to nitpick (we all know graphics would not have been possible using Unix, we all know that those archaic modems couldn't run that fast, etc. etc. etc.)That aside, this film is really funny. It also laughs at itself on a regular basis...I mean just look at dade's wardrobe, and then remind yourself that you know half a dozen people who dressed like that in 94. I know a people who mirror just about every character in this film, which makes it even more enjoyable.The dialogue is often over the top, and some of the acting is overdone, but tis the nature of the beast. Jonny Lee Miller (who never ceases to amaze me) pulls off the American accent quite well (though he tends to slip on occasion) and Dade is certainly no Sickboy. But that's just an example of range (he did it again in Dracula 2000...and almost saved it). Matthew Lillard, though occasionally OVERLY annoying, is perfect as Cereal Killer; his best role ever, though Scream comes close. Renoly Santiago is a funny and loud Phantom Phreak, a role only second to his role in Con Air, and his lines are always great; and Laurence Mason as the ultra-cool Lord Nikon a very close tie with Tin-Tin in The Crow for coolness (and he's done some *cool* spots...Floyd D in True Romance (not to be confused with Brad Pitt's character 'Floyd';) and Roach in an awesome ep. of Law & Order...) his character is by far the coolest of the Elite. Lorraine Bracco in a *very* early role...and speaking of *early* - Early Edition's Fishe Stevens is amusing as the arrogant swine Eugene 'The Plague' Belford. And how can one not like a film with Penn Jillette in it???But all that aside, Angelina Jolie stole the show (as she often does). Looking like a cyber-elf straight out of ShadowRun, she's sultry and sexy in a way most actresses these days can't manage. I can't think of any films I haven't liked her in...even if I didn't like the films themselves. She's simply awesome here, she even takes bad dialogue and turns it into fun, good lines. And *her* outfits are really nice, save for that horrid dress she was stuck in at the end. And she has a Massive Attack startup on her puter!! (with a 28.8 bps modem!! ;p~~~)Overall: sure it's unrealistic. Sure half of it's impossible. Sure it's overacted and the dialogue needs work. But the cast are all under-rated, and most of them went on to better roles, some to much fame. And the soundtracks are absolutely AMAZING!! I own them and listen regularly... This should probably rate a four or five, but I can't help but ignore all critics and pronounce myself as one of the large cult following of adorers of this film.

40,renaldo and clara,One of my fave movies EVER!!,10,12 March 2001,"(2nd com. on this film)This movie, along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Real Genius, The Crow, Manon des Sources, Empire of the Sun, Rushmore goes down as one of my fave movies of all time.Why? It never falters; it's ALWAYS entertaining. Just like the above films, which vary in genre, it is completely engrossing, and it is all the elements in the movie woven together in a finely-crafted fabric that is Hackers.
Hackers is laughed at by ""real"" computer hackers. Let them laugh. I don't even need to explain myself, but as a previous reviewer so brilliantly realized, was that the screen-saver-""like"" images that pop up on the screen are actually what they see in their minds; the pieces of a puzzle coming together. I think it's brilliant; I've never seen that tactic used in a film before. And even if the images weren't meant to be a digital composite of the hackers' minds, I don't care. The computer nerds don't have to watch this film.Hackers is total cult potential and cooler than most other cult films. It's a really funny flick; Angelina Jolie is probably getting better at acting in dramatic roles, but in my opinion, this is her BEST type of role. Sassy. Smart. Buff, but ballsy. Rabid, but cute! Short-haired...... She's in her element here. Ihad (AND I AM TOTALLY SERIOUS) absolutely NO earthly IDEA that Johnny Lee Miller was a Brit. He pulls off such a good Seattle accent here. I loved the Hispanic who played Phreak, he was so cool. Then, of course, there's Matt Lillard, and the others. But nothing next to Angelina Jolie. She is perfect in her techno hair, flare, and attitude. (ANGELINA JOLIE SHOULD WEAR THESE CLOTHES EVERYDAY!!!!!!!!!!!)ANYWAYZZZZZZZ------  I'm sure most of you reading have probably already seen it, but let me assure to those of you who haven't:1) This is NOT a B movie! No F___N WAY!!2) You will glamourize the use of computers and techno style once you're done watching this.3) It's soundtrack will swallow you whole.4) I'm a straight girl and I thought Angelina Jolie was the sexiest thing on the planet when I saw this film!Hope my points are tantalizing enough to persuade y'all!

I sure didn't miss much except knowing that it's one of the most poorly made movies ever made.Okay, since when did hacking involve all these 3D computer graphical game-like images? I would of been more awake looking at the actors type on a black dos screen instead...The actors were really bad even Angelina Jolie. They did a really good job of looking like WANNABE hackers though. Oh wait, they were really suppose to be hackers? I think Sandra Bullock (in the movie ""The Net"") did a better job ""pretending"" to know a lot about computers then these actors. I don't know if the director intended to give more of a comedy like feeling but that just made everyone sound stupid... ""I hacked into the FBI!"" ""I hacked the bank!"" ""We're elite hackers o'kay!""... Then there's also the bad guy riding a skateboard and these ""hackers"" on roller skates? You got to be kidding me... This movie was very corny and the feeling was much like a TV movie.""The Net"" with Sandra Bullock which also happened to be released in 1995 was a lot better and actually had thrilling moments unlike this movie.I would of probably skipped the movie K-PAX if I saw Hackers back in 1995 knowing Iain Softley directed them both.

It's obvious that everybody involved, both the actors and their fictional counterparts, is having a great time. Angelina Jolie is especially notable for her rendition of semi-goth girl hacker ""Acid Burn."" Both she and Jonny Lee Miller are still deservedly in the rising arc of their careers. Oh yes, in case you couldn't guess: they hack into some really important stuff involving the government and big business (duhhh).

This is one of the best cyber movies made. It sticks to it's story, and that's what i really like about it. Jonny Lee Miller did a decent job in this role, along with Angelina Jolie. In this movie, Jolie's character, Kate, really isn't crazy about Miller's character, Dade. In fact,she hate him. But Dade has a obsession with her. Later on in the movie, Kate shows some compassion for him and then at the end of the movie, they're a couple. This is where they both met for the first time, and then later on got married. A year later they seperated and in 1999,they divorced. The best parts of this movie is when Dade is NOT thinking about Kate sexually,or other wise the Love scenes(when i say ""Love scenes"" i mean when Dade thinks about Kate, or when Kate thinks about dade, or when they just dream about each other, etc.).

It's not embarrassingly bad, but it's far from great. First, it's good points: energy, hackers make intriguing subjects, and fairly interesting, likable protagonists. It's bad points: a ""Superman""-like plot master-minded by a supremely cheesy villain. The effects got annoying after a while, and there was plenty of ""information"" about computers that was not accurate. I""m not sorry I saw it, but I wish someone would make a movie that would be a correct portrayal of hackers.

Then with the teenagers, when one ""hacks"" the school's system to set off the fire sprinklers for a girl's revenge, I can't help but laugh at the whole situation, he's got an umbrella and if the school knew who did this, it would get him a nice introduction of the police along with a very possible sue to at least pay for the damage.I will admit, when I first saw this movie in the 90's, you could call it a favorite movie. But I have to say, when I look at it later on, I can't help but laugh at a good majority of the movie, especially the whole Hacker term. The term Hacker at least in the IT field is nothing but a computer nerd, someone who can analyze things to understand how they work. Usually doing this to customize products for their needs, or just understanding how they work out of curiosity. Apple Computer's co-founder Steve Wozniak is a classic example of a true Hacker.",Hackers

Race, creed, outlook and money mean nothing to these people. It's what you know not what you have. Lastly, this film is just plain fun. Its clearly trying hard, but for some reason if you just take it for a ridiculous film all the good stuff shines through. Awesome soundtrack from the nineties.

None of them watched Star Trek, Babylon 5 or any other Sci-Fi. Also, they got caught, cool hackers wouldn't get caught.

Being a modern age computer programmer and website developer (who also knows quite a bit about how ""hacking"" works), this movie is right up my alley.First off, I will talk about the negatives, as I usually like to attack them first before getting to the good stuff. The hacking process, the 15 computer monitors, the 3D interfaces, the cool clothes, the groups of friends who are computer hackers... none of that exist in the real world of hacking. Hacking takes several hours and months to learn how to do. Most hackers make lame, poorly coded programs in Visual Studio to make computer viruses with and to hack websites, emails, and programs with. They do not hack into big government programs and create global threats with their skills. To the positives of this movie now.The theme of this movie fits perfect! The electronic music, the colors of the movie, the cool decked out computers, and the computer lingo, it all fits the modern computer age perfectly. The movie definitely caught my attention, and I think anyone else who is into computers or works with them for a living will enjoy the movie.I don't got much more to say except that this movie is a good rental.

The true life of hackers is a very boring one. The film lets itself go from the true world of hackers and we get a better film in the long run. The cast gels together in a way that few other films could hope for.Despite the films forays into sounding cool with techspeak which really makes no sense if you can suspend you dis-beliefs for a while you will find this film immensely enjoyable. Even the hacker game against the FBI agent does have its basis in fact. A writer did challenge hackers that they really could do nothing to hurt him and within 24 hours the writer had no credit and was listed as dead to all the computers that matter. Still if you are looking for a film were you don't have to think to much and you just want some good mindless fun, you could do worse than watching this film.

I did get nostalgic when i heard things like 28k bit per second and PCI bus with direct memory access. I wonder if the actors knew that a modem was short for modulator/ demodulater :) For this story to work it had to have some magic, as someone else highlighted ... ""if you really see a real hacker at work it is truly boring stuff"" btw computers do zeros and ones at best .... not these mathematical formulas that was blowing past screen but that would be boring. Amazing graphics on these PC screens didn't exist back then which IMHO made it date better than other Computer movies of its day.I liked how some scary facts about the government holding files on its people which you would be amazed today on what they hold on you. And you would be surprised just how many skimming scams are going on .... these issues hold true today.It was a more innocent time when only a select few knew how to do things and I even remember doing the tape digital sounds .... oh those where the days :)Enjoy it for what it was .... oh and you get to see sexy Jolie when she was only 19 .... pretty simple story line and some truism that even today not many people would know. I loved the early days of computers and we all thought it make the world better, safer, provide us with freedom, make it more transparent. Sadly it has made it for the worse and even our civil liberties are all but gone.

If you ignore the flashy and mostly meaningless computer graphics, you may notice some good in-jokes and a remarkable chemistry between many of the characters  Crash and Plague, Lord Nikon and Cereal Killer, and especially Crash and Burn.  Apart from Lorraine Bracco, who seems completely lost, everyone seems to be having an enormous amount of fun:  grab a can of Jolt, forget everything you know about programming, and join in the game.",Hackers
55,Sentinel-15,"This movie is fun, fun, fun!",8,31 March 2001,"""Hackers"" has recently become one of my all-time favourite movies. This film is pure light-hearted entertainment. The movie just *looks* great (especially on DVD - check out the great use of colours!), has a killer rave/techno type soundtrack (which has to date spawned no less than 3 CD albums - all highly recommended, BTW) and features an eccentric bunch of interesting characters. Matthew Lillard immediately comes to mind, but also Jonny Lee Miller (from ""Trainspotting"" fame), Angelina Jolie, and many others. And as someone else mentioned, even the bad guy is fun, in a way.
A common criticism on this film seems to be that is ""isn't realistic"".Well, D'UH! :-)It should be *obvious* the people who made this movie weren't going for the ""realistic approach"". Instead, the movie paints a more symbolic picture.For once, computer users aren't depicted as complete nerds (read: complete retards) but instead as rather cool, hip & interesting (and, yes, likeable) people.And yes, I know about the distinction between crackers & the ""real hackers"". Most if not all of the characters could arguably be categorised under both categories (since they know how to crack systems, but also happen to really know programming languages, hardware, etc..) So for all intents & purposes, I have no problem with labelling them as ""hackers"".By the way, if you want to learn more about ""real"" hackers, check out Steven Levy's classic book ""Hackers"", which - once again - is highly recommended.Anyway, this movie is highly recommended as fast-moving entertainment. It is not a real portrait of any real hackers - nor is it supposed to be - but rather a ""feel-good"" movie, one of those films you can see over and over again, and just enjoy.

Especially amusing is the discussion of Kate's laptop...""It has a killer refresh rate"", lol; You kind of have to laugh at such things; They get some things right though. Like calling the compiler design book the Dragon book...it was named that when I was in collegeObviously weak is the portrayal of computers and hacking.

The story is very simple, it's about hackers getting framed for something and the CIA and FBI going after them. While this may seem very generic it has it's unique charm that it adds.The movie isn't super serious, it has a lot of comedy that keeps the light mood and silly 90s visuals of what hacking looks like. Near the end the main character even puts on this thing that looks like the Google Glass! The light tone makes this movie enjoyable and fun for multiple viewings.The acting is okay, nothing great or bad. This movie was in the early careers of some of the actors, so you may recognize some faces of today's good actors.Now, I have to talk about the soundtrack. It is filled with 90s electronic beats that add so much to the atmosphere of the film, making some scenes really intense and fun. If the film would have been made with the generic songs of the era it probably wouldn't be as great.Hackers is a long time favorite of mine. I saw it as a kid and have loved it since then.

I can suspend my disbelief quite a bit but there are enough impossibilities and technical errors to make Plan 9 from outer space look like a documentary.It doesn't end there though. The plot is a rehash of dozens of other movies and the ""new kid at school gets the girl in the end"" story has been done more times than I had hot dinners.

You have to turn on your suspension of disbelief, just check the trivia, I agree that most the stuff that happens with the actual hacking is not possible but it is sure fun to watch. Angelina Jolie is hot as ever, and really does her role nicely. I love Matthew Lillard's character, funny as hell to watch. This movie has it's moments of greatness, but overall I found it to be somewhat corny. The main villain, ""The Plague"", refuses to be called by his given name. He is an adult in his thirties, but acts like any teenager, got a skateboard, and talks like a teenager. So, I would reccemend this movie, it is very enjoyable, and most will like it. My only warning is this: don't place very high expectations on Hackers, it is a movie for fun, not much else.

Matthew Lillard was his usual self, yet I couldn't even chuckle at him since the film was so bad. Possibly I am not technology-and-gadget-minded enough, and this film is very obviously intended for computer geeks, because I did not know what the point of any of it was. Absurdly unrealistic and completely drawn out and eventless, not to mention predictable as all hell.

I watch this movie at a minimum a few times per year and never get sick of it.It's great to watch some of the actors in their earlier roles, it almost has an 80's look to it with some of the clothes they wear, I connected with it when it came out due to I was similar in age. Maybe that's why I still like it today because I saw it when I was much younger. It is very silly and not accurate at times but I didn't watch it for it's authenticity of hacker / computer terms, I watched it because it looked like a fun movie and I was right.Matthew Lillard's character had me rolling a few times and when they mess with the secret service agent in charge of catching them was great. Reminded me of being young and messing with someone in similar ways. The soundtrack is excellent, it made the movie for me.

Jolie looked like a boy. They gave it enough times and now word hackers mean something unlike back in the day. So I saw it recently. I really liked it. My type of film. It had weird actors I like in it. The Black guy from the crow. I had thought that was his only movie. The arab guy from Short Circuit 2. Scream Actor who I've always been a fan of. Lorraine Braco from the sopranos in a sexy role. Fbi black guy whos in a lot of stuff. Most of these actors are unrecognizable in these roles. If I weren't good in films I wouldn't recognize them and in such odd but cool roles. The roles that they are typical famous for doesn't suit them in the sense that you can tell they've got talent and could do such much more. I enjoyed watching these stars in cool 90's trip films.Now to get to the story. Though Im sure back in the day some people knew what hacking was I don't think is as relevant as it is today. Im sure this film wouldve been more successful had it been made today. Perphaps a reboot. So many cool 90's films fall victim to this like Johnny Dmnoneic. I think the matrix though hard to believe is a good example of this. It probably wouldve made more money today since even than the world wasn't as gadgety as it is today.Don't know why Anjelina doesn't get recognize for this. She used to make such cool bad ass films in the 90's. But shes mostly recognize for the new big budget films. In this film she was almost ugly. Her character was cool and interesting. I've always enjoyed the cool trip chick that was down with tech stuff but not she looked almost like a boy. You can easily tell she got a ton of surgery and probably had to to get where she is now. But my question is was it really worth it? I much prefer her back in the day even with all her uglyiness.So in conclusion Im glad I finally watched this now.

It's eye candy to avoid the public from running away from it. If they did a realistic hacking movie, it would probably be very boring. This wasn't done to please those with enough computer knowledge to know that it isn't realistic, but to please a more general audience, with little computer knowledge.With all this in mind, in order to enjoy ""Hackers"", one should not expect to see a great movie or a realistic approach to the world of computer security experts. Don't take it seriously. If you do, you'll probably rate it very low. If you don't maybe you will have some fun.They did choose a good soundtrack.I'll give it a 5.5 (5 in imdb's rating) out of 10.",Hackers
76,saahdrahcir,The Hacker Ethic,8,16 April 2011,"If you stumbled upon this title solely because you saw Angelina Jolie was in it, you will get to witness the cute Jolie before the full-blown sexy Jolie you experienced in ""Gia"" and everything thereafter (and you geeks will like the storyline too!). The film itself plays out very much like a cyber-thriller that collided with a high school teen comedy— with less sex and nudity; however, there is a split-second of what could be considered nudity in Dade's dream with Angelina Jolie, but who could blame him.Characters in this film are unbelievable. It's not that they are bad, just strange. For instance, it is hard to believe that a gorgeous girl such as Kate (Joli) could be a computer nerd, second of all, that Matthew Lillard's character, Cereal Killer, could be that eccentric. I'm not quite sure why, but Cereal acts like a Jack Sparrow on LSD. And, ultimately, the story is a bit hard to believe as well yet fear not, my fellow movie gurus, the film is awesome.The opening scene sets up the mood automatically. You know this is going to be a serious film (Lorraine Bracco of ""The Sopranos"" is in it) and at the same time, you know you're going to laugh at it (Penn Jillete of Vegas' Penn and Teller duo is also in it); except, I don't know what to say or how you should feel about singer Marc Anthony, who randomly plays a government agent in this movie. The truth is, you pretty much know what you're going to get with director Iain Softly (""K-PAX,"" ""The Skeleton Key,"" and ""Inkheart"") and writer Rafael Moreu of ""The Rage: Carrie 2.""My only beef with the film is that several characters randomly disappear towards the middle of the movie and never comeback. Other than that, I loved it, and so will you. It makes me wonder, what do you think Dade and his crew would do is WikiLeaks and Facebook existed back in 1995? The movie might have been called ""The Social Network."" (LOL)Watch this movie; you will not be disappointed. It is a great flick and certainly deserving of your time.",Hackers

Most of the movie is fake (Hacking from the top of the Empire State Building, using a Minicassette recorder to get free long-distance phone calls, and the ""3d"" effect of the Gibson supercomputer.) You can't hack from the top of the Empire State Building for three reasons. 1. No phone lines. 2. No wireless network. 3. You can't go to the top of the Empire State Building. You can't use a minicassette recorder to get long-distance phone calls. You could in the 80's by using a blue box, but since all phone systems are digital now it's impossible. And, third and most unbelievable of all; the ""3d"" effect of the Gibson supercomputer. First of all, if this was a company server it would most likely be running UNIX, Linux, Solaris or some other variant. The ""3d"" effect was bizarre, but I guess it wouldn't be very exciting to watch them hack from a Command Line. =) After I got over these and other inconsistencies, I just watched the film for fun and an escape. It's pretty cool. I give it 8/10.",Hackers
78,jrodway,Not Bad Enough to be Good,3,23 September 2015,This is a very dated movie about technology so immediately that makes it pretty campy. It does star a young Angelina Jolie (who oddly looks like an elf) as well as Matthew Lillard (who is unbearably bad).There's no plot and the effects make no sense. The costumes (including lots of roller blading) and settings are cartoon-ish but I'm not sure that was on purpose. A movie like this shouldn't be judged as a piece of quality film making but instead as an entertaining couple of hours. I get it. However Hackers ends up being one of those movies that's not quite bad enough to be fun and far from good enough to be watchable.My recommendation is see WarGames for a second time and ignore Hackers completely.,Hackers

Still, the lavish (almost excessive) visual effects and the stereotypically outlandish appearance of the characters does not rescue flat, also stereotyped characters and a much-recycled plot.  The ""romance"" manages to be both predictable and unbelievable; the action follows the exact same pattern as every other youth-friendly adventure movie that came out of the 1980s.Amazingly enough, the catchphrase ""Crash and Burn"" did not turn out to be a prophetic statement about the future of the film, which is a lot better than it could have been.

The special effects are quite inept, if you know how a real computer works. Cyberspace is not like ""the Lawnmower Man"", and I wish Hollywood would stop portraying it that way. The casting of this movie is what really shines. I am a big fan of Miller, who plays Dade Murphy. He was brilliant in ""Trainspotting"" and his co-star is a ""better than usual"" Angelina Jolie. Rounding out the cast is Matt Lillard(Scream), Fisher Stevens (Short Circuit), Laurence Mason (the Crow), Jesse Bradford(Swimfan). Renoly Santiago(Con Air) & Lorraine Bracco(Sopranos). The cast seems to be having fun, which helps the audience to have some, as well. The direction is well paced and fluent.

For those I've met who know nothing about real-life hackers have enjoyed all the pretty interfaces and the characters who are very different from any of the hackers I've known personally in that they are for the most part good-looking, Angelina Jolie in particular, as well as popular, whose on-screen chemistry is the type of chemistry that doesn't exist in real life but a lot of people wish it would. The script, not including the computer talk of course, is good despite the fact that amongst lesser characters the dialoge is pretty stifled. The acting by the leading roles are well-done, with the exception of Jonny Lee Miller and Fisher Stevens' characters, who seemed pretty uninspired. If you look past the flaws with this film it can be really enjoyable, and it did make some of my non-hacker friends jealous of hackers, which is a good change the computer-nerd stereotype jokes I'm used to.

The characters, though arguably thin, are larger than life, heroic, admirable, and extremely likable. You want to be Dade Murphy (Miller). You want to flirt with Kate Libby (Jolie). You want to know everyone else in the film. The story is linear; but thing is, that serves to aid the movie in a multitude of ways. The non-complex plot acts as a vehicle for character development, style, and a great soundtrack.I'm a student of computer science, so obviously I can see how shoddy the technical underpinnings of some of the material are, but honestly, that has no effect on my enjoyment of this movie. The film almost acknowledges its unrealistic use of special effects with various hints dropped throughout the movie that would be lost on laymen, like the Metropolis poster in Kate's bedroom, the mention of various (in)famous pieces of technical literature, ""hacking a Gibson"", and Plague's use of the alias ""Babbage"". Where it can afford to, this movie has a pretty good grasp on hacker culture, so don't crap a bird and check your petty skepticism at the door; the movie is using visual metaphors to depict the intricacies of ""hacking"" to people who wouldn't be able to understand them otherwise, and it does it in a fun, stylistic way.I have no doubt that seeing this movie at a young age cultivated my admiration for not only computing (and Angelina Jolie), but New York City as well. The film portrays the island of Manhattan as a sprawling, wired playground that never sleeps, rife with energy; a breathing invitation to stay out all night, win the girl, and hack the world around you.The DVD cover sure as hell doesn't make it apparent, but this film is about the closest (and likely best) adaptation of William Gibson's cultural fission, Neuromancer, that you'll ever find. If you enjoyed this book, seek this movie immediately, and vice versa.From the minute the flick starts, it yanks you in. Every time.

However, after a recent viewing on TV I realised what the director was aiming at - nothing dates faster than computer technology and its visual representation, it's just part of the way that it works. Softley went for a deliberately abstract depiction of the technology in order to give the film some relevance to audiences that might have be years into the future. There's no way that anyone in 1994/5 could have predicted how the internet would evolve or how UI design would progress - the creatively lead look of the hacking sequences in this film still work today because Softley chose to avoid sticking netscape logos all over it.

The only stretch is in the visuals that are just there to keep the audience more entertained.  Who wants to look at a bunch of matices and letters that seem to have no meaning.My other favorite part of the movie is the passion between the two leads: Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller.  They met each other at ""Hackers"" and got together during it.  Shortly after filming ended they got married.Definite recommendation.",Hackers
109,PessimisticGrace,Underrated and magnificently done! Angelina shines.,10,27 August 2001,"When I went in to watch Hackers, I was worried because some ofthe reviews here.I don't think we saw the same movie. From scene one, I wassurprised the characters were teenagers. I knew Angelina wasonly 19 or 20 when she did this movie, but I hadn't realized thatuntil I saw it.The romance and interaction between Angelina's character andJonny's is classic. Really. It's great. When they're arguing orfighting or dreaming about each other spitefully, it's fun to watchtheir little denying their attraction and criticizing one another. BeforeAngelina Jolie, I did not have a favorite actress. I knew actresses Iliked several films of, but hated others. Angelina Jolie is different. She's my favorite actress now. It's notbecause she's pretty, although she is. It's because she has amagnetism, charisma and draw that I've never before seen in anactress of the 90's. This shows through in her portrayal of Kate""Acid Burn"" Libby. She's cocky and difficult, with a rebel charmwe've seen in many of this star's movies. If you love Angelina Joliefor reasons OTHER than how large her chest is or nudity, pleasesee this. The performance may not have been academy awardwinning, but it's a great performance. Very fun to see where shestarted out.The rest of the performances are also very good. Jonny's Dadehas a puppy dog charm, in that you feel sorry for him and can't helpbut laugh when things don't go his way. He is in no way Mr. Deep,but he's smart with a funny exterior. Matthew Lillard never fails to make me laugh, and he's prominentwith his pigtailed braids and goofing off. I must give kudos to the villain. Sure, nothing unpredictable or new.But he's positively funny. ""Never fear, I is here."" And arrogant andquirky. I loved the special effects. I loved the plot. I loved the premise. Iloved the romantic relationship between Kate and Dade.This is not an academy award winning movie. It's not extremelydramatic or epic. But it sure is a GOOD movie. It's fun, it's acomedy, it's a drama, and it's just great to watch. I very muchenjoyed the technology used, and the entire movie as a wholemade me smile.If you are looking for an epic movie of high proportions with bigname actors and a hole-less plot, stay away.But if you're looking for a movie that will make you smile at theantics of the multi-dimensional characters and their escapadesand problems, set in a technological world and featuring a cuteteenage romance, go see it.

Some will go to extreme lengths to access it. Those who do, are those smart enough not to get caught. And so goes the story of ""Hackers"". In a society where everybody should suspect everybody, they are the only ones who stand up for the rights to free information. This movie is a flashy cybernetic insight into the computer sub-culture of the 90's. Excellently portrayed by fresh-faced actors such as Jonny-Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie, are the roles of two hackers at war. Crash Override, and Acid Burn. Youth is exuberant in these two fine actors, who will  go on to do bigger(but not necessarily better) things. The computer consognoti or ""hacker"" of today is as or even more heroic as an athlete winning gold at the Olympics. How, you ask? Well, how hard is it to don a pair of swimming trunks and swim up and down a pool as fast as you can? How hard is it  to crack into high-tech security of vast companies, who pay thousands to people to prevent it happening. Exactly. Plus it is much harder to think of an original handle. The youth of today are somewhat underestimated, as they are in this film. Initially triggered by ""Tron"" and later ""War Games"", ""Hackers"" shows us the realities of today and the technological world. A technological marvel, computers were considered back in the 80's. Now, they are powerful tools used in the everyday building of modern society. And hackers, are the only ones who use them to their full potential.",Hackers

From terrible writing, to hammy acting with a nonsensical plot it could be easily hated. However it has just enough character and charisma wrapped in lovely coat of 90s attitude that I can totally understand why this has become a cult classic.Definitely NOT to be taken seriously in any way and as long as you know what you're getting yourself into, it can be a great fun 90s ride.Hack the 90s.

You gotta love the naive. Unless you have an intranet any computer can be hacked because the codes are written by humans which means there are flaws. Now some of the hacking setups in the movie don't make sense that's true but never underestimate the ""keyboard cowboys"".

126,llamaherd,One of the worst films I have ever seen...,2,4 July 2001,"I am completely surprised and perplexed at how many people I've known who are just completely taken with this film.  Just reading the reviews here at IMDB, it can be seen that many people have quite an affection for this piece of cinematic garbage.  Let me set the record straight: this film is a complete waste of time.  After watching it, I felt really bad about losing an hour and a half of my life that could've been spent doing something more worthwhile.Even if you try to keep an open mind about how ""unrealistic"" the film is, the movie just does not work on any level whatsoever.  This movie is not ""fun"" in any way.  The performances by the actors ranged from average to sub-par.  The only redeeming aspect of this movie is when you catch a 3-second overhead shot of Angelina Jolie in a see-thru shirt.  Besides that, this movie is the equivalent of a dung heap.  It's one of those movies that takes itself way too seriously, and tried too hard to be ""hip"" and cool.
When my friend raved to me about how cool the movie was before showing it to me, I was hyped up, and expecting an intelligent movie with cool special effects and a convincing storyline.  Boy, was I in for a disappointment. Instead, I'm treated to a handful of goofily-dressed, shallow characters who I am somehow supposed to believe are a bunch of bad-assed computer hackers, and am dragged along through a really tired and cliche plot.  The director was so careless in his handling of the plot and characters, that one of the relatively main characters (Ramon) gets arrested about mid-way thru the film and disappears for the remainder of the movie, without a follow-up or explanation as to what happens to him.  Sadly, I didn't even really care. The effects for the computer displays were pretty sorry and unconvincing, too.  I might have excused this if the film was made in the 80s, but this was the mid-90s, folks.  I especially laughed at the effects for the supercomputer, with the 3D operating system that made no coherent sense whatsoever.I have a feeling that the director intended to blow away the audience with his vision of ""coolness"", by trying to take a really hip concept (computer hackers) and appeal to a wide teenage crowd by dumbing it down, so that the masses would understand it and not be turned away by it's computer-driven theme.

These are both complicated and wonderful romances set against fascinating circumstances. When the average movie-goer sees Hackers, however, s/he don't see a romance,s/he sees a youth-oriented computer-adventure movie. What this person misses, however, is that the evil plot set in motion by The Plague, portrayed by Fisher Stevens, and the hacking sub-culture of urban New York are not the main focus, but merely a setting for the romance between Dade Murphy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Kate Libby (Angelina Jolie). This is a shame, because not only is this a wonderful movie when viewed in that light, it is one of the most compelling love stories ever documented on film. Titanic looks like Resevoir Dogs in comparison. Though some of the dialogue is downright corny, and the villains are notably one-dimensional, Hackers deserved better than it got.

And in the mean time a sub-plot which involves a girl and a guy that hate each other in the beginning and fall in love with each other throughout the movie. Nonetheless, i still rated this movie very high. Why? because in my opinion it's still a great cult classic. It gives a very good image about how people thought about computers a few years ago when not everybody had one yet. The handlenames are mysterious (""acid burn"" ""the plaque"") but would be ridiculous in this age. People are overjoyed when they get to see a 28.8 BPS modem (who needs T3 anyway? ;) PLUS they pretend as if you can see a program running like it's some sort of great graphic animation.

If you look at a computer ad from 1995 now, you would complain that it was stupid since ""the Pentium 200 is not the fastest processor you'll ever need.""  I mean really; does this movie portray hackers better than MTV did?  Definately.  Does it do better then the media?  Yep.  Does it make the hackers themselves into stereotypical geeks from ""Revenge of the Nerds?""  No.  What do you really expect from Hollywood?This movie was entertaining and gave the general idea of what hacking is about.  That is the freedom of information.  I'm not saying that it could not have been better or it is even close to my favorite movie.  All I'm trying to say is that it's the best that's going to be around for anytime soon.  Back to you ""hackers,"" though, how would you make it better?  By showing hacking in its true form, just sitting in front of a monitor typing in commands and the like?  Try making a movie out of that!  Please realize that the general public has to be able to understand the movie, and if that means that all they can say about RISC processors is that ""RISC is good..."" then so be it.I'm sorry to be on such an offensive here, it's just that there are too many stupid people who go see certain movies expecting them to be something that they aren't and were never supposed to be and then writing scathing reviews that are pointless and stupid.  Anyway, to get to the point, I'd give this movie about a 8/10.  If you ever wanted to know a bit about the philosophy of hackers themselves, this will give you a general idea, although (if you haven't understood a word I've said already) it does NOT make you an expert or even begin to explain the technical aspects of this hobby.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

132,krupowicz,A completely unrealistic and cheesy take on hacker culture.,1,4 May 2002,"This is a pretty movie. It has nice eye-candy effects and some attractive actors, but unfortunately, it's also a dumb movie.
'Pretty but dumb' can summarize everything that happens in this movie. Cinematically, the movie suffers from horribly cliched one-dimensional characters who spout catch-phrases that will make you roll your eyes, or maybe even gag. It uses a silly premise about oil tankers that can be held hostage by a computer virus and that the Secret Service even has jurisdiction over the crimes that take place in this movie (this more likely should have been handed over to the FBI). On the technical side, the movie starts off with a nice example of 'Social Engineering' but everything is downhill from there. Macintoshes are virtually the only computers the 'hackers' use, which is simply ridiculous, as is everything else related to this aspect of the movie.

There is no getting around the fact that this movie is grossly inaccurate, inconsistent and generally poorly made. The plot is contrived, overused and generic. A group of young hackers create some trouble until they find out about an evil plot. Then it becomes a bad action, romance hybrid... with outdated computers... that never existed.Indeed, the movie hackers breaks at least two dozen fundamental pieces of computer knowledge that anybody even moderately trained could catch. Most of these somehow involve over the top dramatic camera angles and cut-away. The script moves in a kind of jumpy staccato shuffle, with the occasional inconsistency or absurdity making you jump for a moment. For instance, while finding the infamous hosts of the show ""hack the planet"" (which manages to crack into the TV station every week at a predictable time and stay on air for half an hour with a live feed) They are held at gun-point by a robotic arm!

135,CrazyZombie12,"Captures the culture of ""Hackers""",6,25 November 2006,"To put it plainly, the movie Hacker captures the hacking culture but nothing about the movie actually shows what being a hacking is all about.I find many things in the movie extremely funny and it sometimes makes me laugh out loud. For example, when the characters type on the keyboard, a ""echoing"" sound affect is added which is extremely funny. Also, when they show a ""virus,"" it is graphical and it talks and interact with you, which is extremely funny. The last thing that made me laugh was the actual ""techno"" talk that they do. It is almost funny and hysterical as most people know something about computers and they know most of the techno talks in this movie are complete blabbing of the mouth. Finally, it seems that this movie is bent on the fact that hackers can take over TV networks and make shows appear in the wee hours of the morning and make traffic lights turn red and turn on sprinklers at certain times. Almost funnier is that the movie is bent on the fact that all hackers are from MIT and that any hacker must go to that school in order to be ""elite.""The one thing I found unusual is that at the time of this movie, laptop computers weren't exactly cheap like they are now. If I remembered correctly, laptops can cost upwards to 2-3 thousands dollars at the time, and I seriously doubt that highschool students (as portrayed in this movie) can just go out and buy one. I also find it odd that the movie portrays hackers take their crimes at payphone boots with laptops and all sorts of hookups to conceal their identity. I even find it more odd that there is a subculture where every hackers know each other. In this movie, it's like, ""Do you know a hacker named Acid Burn,"" and then suddenly everyone knows who it is.One thing this movie is true is the fact that nearly all ""casual"" hackers are teens (someone who is in highschool). Rarely do you hear hackers who are in their late 30s or 40s. I must say that based on real life cases, the most destructive hackers are the one who goes to college, whereas, the ones who stalks and terrorizes individuals are teens.Overall, I am pleased with the movie. Even though the movie is far from anything technical, it captures the culture of hacking. Namely the clothing style and the attitude are very true to someone who is ""techno"" (not exactly a hacker, but someone who really likes computers).",Hackers

It's about people living on the fringe of society, who express themselves through a connection to the electronic world.The storyline is simple, a young man is found guilty on his 11th birthday of using a virus to infect multiple network systems and causing them to crash. Subsequently, he is put on a probation that restricts him from owing or operating a computer & touch tone telephone. Fast forward to his 18th birthday, and after a broken family, a move to New York with his mother, and a change of schools; he falls into a group of people who live as ""Hackers"". After one of them inadvertently copies incriminating data from a Mineral Company computer, the company's head of computer security hatches a plan to track them down. With a couple of plot twists, and a Good/Evil story, its an easy watch. Angelina Jolie even briefly gets her nipples onto film for the first time.The downside comes in the fact that the characters are very one dimensional. It's hard to engage with them, as they all seem to be trying so hard to be interesting and edgy. The computer jargon thrown into the dialogue is appropriate for the time frame of the movie, but it really has not aged well. Its a mess of bad cliché and cheesy one-liners that creates a nasty cringe factor.Using New York as a backdrop, the film is shot nicely, giving a gritty urban feel, and allowing it to seem larger in scope than the sum of its parts. However, with wooden acting & delivery, the characters seem to fade into the background, not taking advantage of the settings they find themselves in.The low rating is more for the poor acting, lackluster dialogue and cut'n'paste storyline. This, though, does not mean its a bad film. Hackers has a great soundtrack, with quirky tracks that work perfectly for the material. It also seems to work on a visceral level, providing entertainment and laughs that it wasn't really intending.The best bet is to turn your brain off, grab some popcorn, and (if you have a passing knowledge of computers) have some belly laughs at the utter cheese of it all.",Hackers

They use a laptops to hack from the top of the buildings, from the roofs, from the subways - because the laptop is such a powerful tool (in movies hackers almost always use laptops) - this device is meant to display ""ACCESS GRANTED""! And the fight between the automated machines that change movies in the TV station office? Give me a freaking break! I rate this movie 2 for some shocking stupidity and frightening inadequacy.P.S.

Like any teen film from the mid-1990s, this film is riddled with techno music and out-of-place slang. If you do enjoy computer technology (and are proficient in it) then this film will undoubtedly bring you to tears, since that was most likely the way you were in middle school. Yet another inaccuracy of this film; I thought being a computer cracker (not hacker, I know my lingo) was cool in middle school, but once I moved up to a slight amount of maturity, I realized I looked like an idiot.

Johnny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie does have a special bond throughout the film, unfortunately, it isn't enough to carry the whole thing. The supporting cast is so uptight and stiff, it's almost horrible to look at, not to mention that the other hackers seem too ""artificial"". In fact, the whole movie comes off a bit ""artificial"".However, a decent storyline and the occasional laugh, here and there, pulls it up to a small 7 in my book.

For those movie-watchers who don't want to see it because of it's cheesy cover and uninteresting-sounding summary, listen to me now. This is such a good movie that it makes such an unglamorous thing (computer hacking) seem glamorous. It practically makes you want to become a computer hacker after you see it. My favorite character was SO Matthew Lillard (Cereal Killer). HE WAS SO FUNNY! Like, I love the part where he's like, ""Woah, you guys: Crash- and Burn! Woah!"" I also love Kate and Dade's 'wars.' Those made me laugh so hard.Alongside the humor, this movie is action-packed and heart-pounding.

This movie is intended for children and young adults looking for a good laugh at corny jokes and cartoonish situations.The big thing this movies projects is Not all hackers are bad! This is actually very true. Hackers are just people with extensive yet never ending sources of knowledge of electronics. The real bad guys in this cyber-world we live in are Crackers. They are the malicious people who use viruses and Trojans to look cool and elite. I do wish this movie would talk about crackers a bit too because it still made The Plague look like a hacker and not a cracker.As a following note I hope more people will learn the difference between Hackers and Crackers.

Overall,it's a great film. It makes you want to be part of the thrilling world of a computer hacker. A pretty realistic film for the subject matter, and it kept me glued to my seat constantly.

It's a romanticized view of hackers, depicting them as a cool subculture not harming anyone, but also showing the potential threat they can become. Although an older film, the computers they used at the time were more or less up to date, which is all the more credit to them (compared with the simple mistake made in ""Simone""). I absolutely like Angelina Jolie in the role of Acid Burn. She's so much more natural than in her later films, but already shows the ""tough chick"" personality and spirit so well known from her later performances. Johnny Lee Miller (probably best known from Trainspotting, at least to me) isn't too bad either. There is chemistry between them. Matthew Lillard does what he can do best: be the most flamboyant character in the film. You can't but love him. The plot is simple and well known, someone has to clear their name for something they didn't do. As for the soundtrack, it fits seamlessly in with the atmosphere the film breathes, and consists of Orbital, Prodigy and Urban Dance Squad, amongst others.

One wonders if there was any research involved in the script. The computer operating systems are more like Tron then what they really should be, which is a bunch of Windows or Unix machines with boring information displayed in a pedestrian and boring manner on regular CRT's.

It's *still* a bad movie. The ""Crash Override"" character gets 7 years of probation in 1988 by cracking into some computers that somehow have TONS of online information accessible by anyone with a modem. Huh? This predates the modern WWW by about five years, so there was little information that could have been gotten this way (at least, SENSITIVE information).Okay, I won't harp on about the technological realism, but I still find a movie full of fake techno-speak mumbo-jumbo to be extremely annoying. Worse, using a recording to cheat pay phones was a 1970's-era phreak tactic that was completely useless even during the 80's. These ""hackers"" log into computers they're not supposed to, with modems, and then all of a sudden, the Secret Service is after them?? Computer security is NOT the jurisdiction of the Secret Service; it would be the FBI and the NSA that would be after you.This movie also fails to explain why ""Crash Override"" has to move to New York City in the first place, and, without placing following events into any realistic context, he just *happens* to run into ""Phantom Phreak"" at his new high school and is ""whisked"" into this local ""hacker"" underground that takes place at some mid-90's ""cyber"" hangout that represents no subculture I have ever heard of. Then ""Crash"" plays some 3-D arcade game and now ""Acid Burn"" (Angelina Jolie) is now ""Crash""'s cracker rival because he beat her high score on a videogame. Huh?? According to this movie, male crackers also have a tendency to have girlish curled hair, wear leopard-print clothing, braid their hair, and otherwise look like girls.

Everything about this movie was blown out of proportion.  First, the 'hackers' were stereotypical cyberpunks that wear futuristic clothes.  I am yet to meet ANYONE who dresses like that, and why wasn't I suprised to see Dade sitting in front of his computer with sunglasses... in a dark room.  Then came the computers themselves, nothing about them was realistic in any sense.  This put me in a different mind state, this was not a movie that had anything to do with computers really, this was a movie meant for teens who live off MTV and pop-culture...  A long drawn out ""action"" flick that doubled as an advertisement for its soundtrack.  But then I was quickly turned around with the mentioning of the Rainbow Books (those colored books they were talking about at the table (when Dade was first introduced I believe) for those who don't know), and the talk about Unix and everything.  Okay, so maybe this movie isn't so bad I thought.  Then it was back to the same technically innacurate bland pseudo-action.  Joey was the only character in the movie I liked.  And did they really need to throw in the evil system administrator coming up to the computer on a skateboard?  Please.  Then there's the whole virus thing from the payphones ""They're infecting us with a rabbit virus!"" ""Give it a flu-shot!"".  Say WHAT?  Is this hackers, or some low budget horror film on Mystery Science Theatre gone bad?  Oh, wait, it's still hackers.  This movie should be taken for what it is, an advertisement for it's soundtrack.

This film is such a beauty, I started watching it for the second time, just minutes after the end titles rolled down my screen... Now, what makes this picture a masterpiece? After a quick summary of the story, I shall give my answer.Dade, an 11 year old hacker, breaks into ""some"" Wall Street computers and causes major agitations within the authorities, and after being captured by the Secret Service, he's sentenced a ""no computer ban"" until he reaches the age of 18. Well, this doesn't stop our young hero - when one of his new hacker friends at his last year at high school fall for the temptation of cracking into a high tech super machine, we are thrown into an inferno of nasty digital war, as he and his group are fighting an evil twisted hacker, named ""The Plague"". I won't reveal what they are battling for, though, that might crack the tension.The reason for my raptures about this movie is practically the unique mood that is created by use of a smooth plot, good acting, some crispy special effects and, last but not least, the smashing music that adds that feeling of coolness during the entire ride. Here you'll find everything from digitally inspired techno to magnificent guitar riffs, all in step with the visual action. I should also mention that the film has it's wits. The foreplay between Dade and his female opponent are quite an amusement, even though it's pretty ""standard"" film jokes that are being served.The best thing about ""Hackers"", though, is the feeling of power and curiosity that are radiated during this picture, and that is, in my opinion, what makes it's deadly sexy.

173,ixieee,A massively under-rated collision on film.,8,21 November 2001,"In the same way that Neal Stephenson's _Snow Crash_ isn't *just* about computers (and/or ""h4xors""), _Hackers_ isn't just a movie about the government's fear and misunderstanding of computer-literate youth trying to fight a Big Evil Corporation.  As has been said, Hackers is a rather cute romantic movie, but it also incorporates other elements that make it so much more than a mere romance, or ""stick it to the Man"" story.  (Although the _Sleepless in Seattle_-esque lights on the building was a nice touch.)The film focuses on Dade's point of view -- including a creative take on his thoughts or emotions, in the form of clips from other movies (come on -- the scene where the woman is being strangled after the pool on the roof?). Dade's new friends -- possibly the most extreme ""individuals"" in that high school -- all have great quirks and personalities of their own.  Many a good quote comes from Cereal, or Nikon.  Admittedly, the bad guys are essentially universally under-developped, but since the story isn't about them, it's not a big problem.The soundtrack is amazing, as are a good deal of the shots in the movie (from a purely aesthetic point of view).  The buildings chosen all have great lines, and the aerial shots are interesting, if not breathtaking. As to the hacking, the ""coloured equations floating through space"" thing made what is, visually, a rather boring topic interesting in a way that didn't pretend to be realistic (a la _The Net_).  There just isn't a way to make people typing frantically interesting.  It can't be done.  So they didn't.I think that sums up what I love about this movie.  It isn't just the plot, or the characters, or the amazing cinematographic details.  It's the way all of them are collaged together to make a bright, dizzying film that lets you focus on anything, because little touches have been tucked in everywhere.",Hackers

Sure it is cheesy and in many ways does not truly represent hacking visually or socially. But it inspired a lot of people to start messing with computers more. As I watch it now there are three things that surprise me.1. The Stars: Johnny Lee Miller was a god to me at time and trainspotting secured that. Jolie is at her hottest(right after Gia). Matthew Lillard is great and provides a lot of great slogan. As far as the supportincas, I was surprised that I had not noticed on any viewing Marc Antony at that early age. Alberta Watson from La Femme Nikita and 24 is a very strong character and is for some reason still very much a MILF. However, Sopranos Lorraine Brocco Leaves much to be desired, though that may be due to the script.2. The Music: I forgot how great this soundtrack was. Massive Attack, Cirrus, and even stuff from Kruder Dorfmeister that I didn't really get into until 2002. The music alone is worth the viewing.3.

Projecting the screens onto the actors faces, the super computer as translucent forest of structures, morphing the New York skyline into a circuit board; all amazing and novel.In summary, not 100% true-to-life, but for the better. They simultaneously try to pay respect to real hacker culture at the time, while extrapolating it into a stylish and exciting universe. Unappreciated in its time, but a cult classic that still holds fans for a good reason.",Hackers
177,zacwitte,i quite enjoyed it,8,2 February 2008,"I actually quite enjoyed this movie. I haven't seen it in a few years, but in high school I could watch it over and over because I kinda liked the glorified depiction of the hacker character. Yeah its not realistic, looks cheap, and many of the technical details were wrong, but who cares - it was a lot of fun. Now I'll admit that I found it much more engaging than normal people because I'm quite a geek but I like to do it big and I identify with the kind of characters in the film. I also liked to see an image of hackers as more social and not without ""style"" which was a breath of fresh air from the greasy nerd stereotype. In fact some of the smartest geeks are some of the most hip trend-setters in cultures in almost every country. I REALLY want to find some venues resembling the hacker hangouts and arcades in the movie. My paradise.",Hackers

Sure it isn't accurate by any length on the tech but how else would one purvey the ""action"" of computers to the general public in NINETEEN NINETY FIVE? It's dated, it's cheesy, and it's a bit over the top. But it's fun and not so serious, colorful and nerdy while making you cringe at the janky (90's lingo) one liner's and ridicules antics.

I mean, the acting was bad and so was the production, however it had one shining element going for it, it is the only computer related movie worth watching. When you look back on the year that was 1995, you see a booming industry, so why not make a movie to capitalize on it all? This was clearly the attempt made by United Artists, however it failed miserably as a movie, but succeeded as a geek-cult legend up until even now, year 2003. The bottom line is if you're a fan of computing, and understand a little about them, you'll love this movie. If not, hey, it's still an easy target to constantly make fun of.",Hackers

Every Single thing in this movie is VERY possible through hacking so don't comment about believability unless you know what you are talking about (and when it comes to the graphics)  the graphics are used to represent what the hackers see the (archaic typing as  meaning) would you rather  they show you a boring unix shell?

But its not ""bad"" hackers, its about a few young kids that use their computer knowledge to survive, a way of their lifestyle. All is well until they get framed and blamed. Then they get back at the people who framed them. This is not your average movie about people who's framed and then they plan a revenge. No this is a different movie, a different feeling all along through the movie. Its kind of hard to explain...... This is one of the best movies i have ever seen....anyway. All through the movie there's this cool feeling, a feeling of happiness and great pleasure. You feel like you want to be a part of the movie, a part of the colorful characters. Who it indeed has.

185,LipeAR,Cult Film (for some of us),8,5 October 2021,"I will start by saying: yes, it is cult, you cannot expect a masterpiece in this type of film, but: the film has a very good soundtrack linked to the environment and context (late 90s), it has a kind of ""magic underground ""that gives you a certain"" comfort "". The characters are chords for a film of his entity, they are clearly superficial, but they sit well in the story, in those times, little known of a group of hackers.The shortcomings that are easily exposed are: the exaggeration of technical reality and a high quota of surrealism at all times.It has some memorable scenes, such as: Cyberdelia (the party), an event that is currently being organized in reality at the DNA Lounge in California.Beyond everything, I remember that in the environment it was said: ""finally a hacker movie that somehow exposes that not everything is nerdy when talking about the subject"", for those of us who are linked to the subject in some way, it is a unique film, the best in this regard.",Hackers

187,kdouglas003,hackers is a film based out of cyberculture of north carolina,10,7 February 2014,"its been enough years now that it can be said - this is a story out of north Carolina, and the general atmosphere of computing in north Carolinait allegedly involves a mother, but they crossed that out and put in an actor and a well majorly actress, to support that role- which was the idealit is a great film, it was well put together the interest for it was mined off of the netbut there's a bit of an issue that the people that were used for the story for the film remember having seen it in a theater - when they never did - and witnessed it in their sleepthere's enough supporting evidence to support this , but as the film that made Angelina jolie - her career appears to have not done so well because she was detached from the origin of the film, and its possible appropriate credits were not givenI rate this as a 10 star film, since I know the main story that it was based on - and can provide photos and all of the background information that the film was based on to prove it - but I am mostly concerned that it was kind of a twist on a story that was not good, to promote it as good - and the general production didn't particularly understand that the original story was not good, when releasing it to the ... distribution, indicating that it was a good thing - when its a good spin on a good thing and a good depiction and a great movie",Hackers

189,nvnohi,"I really want that finger armor, lol",8,20 December 2004,"First off, it's true that many of the phreaks and hacks the kids used in this movie were bogus but who in their right mind would put /real/ stuff in a movie such as this? I certainly wouldn't. Heck, I won't even tell most of my non-geek friends how to look at the Registry. People don't know what they're doing as it is without giving them the means to screw things up _really_ bad. You don't give a small child a sharp knife and expect them to cut their food rather than themselves, right? Zheezh!My first watch of the film occurred while I was taking Cisco classes a couple years ago. A friend in my class was astounded that I'd never seen it. He said it was a ""staple"" of our ""diet."" Well, it's certainly a fun movie to watch and analyze if you enjoy the field and can understand the terminology. The special effects are pretty cool IMO and very intuitively geared toward people who see circuits everywhere they go - the city turning into a circuit board, for example... I was startled to see that occur just as I was thinking the same thing! The typical moviegoer might get some fun out of this movie, too, even if doing some head-scratching, and the effects might not be true to what real computers are like but they certainly are neat and give a good interpretation of what it's like to be thinking inside the box (literally).Hackers was the first ""real"" movie (other than Star Trek movies of course) that I ever truly paid attention to since realizing I wasn't alone in my love for computers. Before watching it I didn't care about watching TV because it was a waste of my valuable computer time. Now, however, I understand the value behind such ""entertainment."" Since this movie I've come to love a few other ""staples"" such as Lord Of The Rings, Tron, The Matrix, SwordFish, and of course the classic for all of us stuck in small spaces fighting with stupid copiers and arrogant bosses, Office Space.Regardless of whether you're geared toward computers or not, though, I'd highly recommend this movie. It's a fairly good introduction into the whole concept of the hacker mindset (insatiable curiosity, obsession with working out problems) and the whole techno subculture (or whatever it's called). Looking at it from a nontechnical person's standpoint, it's a fun story about a bunch of good but misunderstood kids who stick together to bring down those who would otherwise manipulate the general public and thwart the minority just to get away with something unethical. And, it also helps to point out that there are indeed two types of hackers in real life - the white hat variety (such as the kids in the movie) and the black hat types (more commonly known as crackers). The media today has soooooo badly corrupted the word hacker that one can't even mention the word in some places without immediately being labelled as suspect. You definitely don't want to let it slip out at work, especially if you work with computers!Me, I'd watch it just to see that finger armor on Angelina's finger and daydream about wearing it myself. Unfortunately, they simply don't make that type of jewelry in size 6. Ugh. One of these days I'll get into metalworking and make my own. HACK THE PLANET!!",Hackers
190,dtalley_2000,I love Hackers,9,29 December 2004,"This is currently my favorite movie, and has been for about three years since I found it. Sure, it's old. Sure, the technology is laughable... but isn't. I like the fact that there is a mix of very dated techno-talk (they gush over twisted matrix and risc technology) and the technology shown is far beyond what we have today -- and is still plausible future technology.I'm currently basing one of my PC projects on the Gibson Farm visuals of the place Joey hacks into.I love the quotable scenes throughout the movie. I love the fact that Angelina Jolie is SO young and yet has the same attitude she has in Tomb Raider. I think it's fun that I didn't notice the several very revealing shots of her until I'd seen it 6 or 8 times.I keep this DVD on my PC, and play it as background distraction while I program. It is a worthy companion. I'm sure I've watched it a couple of dozen times -- enough that it has become part of my life dialog.I'll bet that 99.99% of the people who watch the movie based on my recommendation will think it's stupid and boring. That's OK. It just happens to strike me right.",Hackers

All the other reviews give it way too much of a break, IMO. The sheer number of inaccuracies, stereotypes, and clichés is overwhelming, and cumulatively destroyed my ability to suspend my disbelief.

But ""Hackers"", director Ian Softley's documentary on the ravages of adult bulimia, is a classic in every sense of the word, and it inspires like nothing I've seen since Erroll Morris' biopic of environmental crusader Al Gore, ""The Toxic Avenger."" Mr. Softley wisely backs away from his material, and allows his characters to tell their own stories of the mental and physical anguish resulting from their sicknesses. Case in point the following quote from transgendered IP tech Angelina Jolie, heartbreaking in its elegant simplicity: ""I don't wear dresses."" I applaud Mr. Softly on his decision to tackle such a difficult and heart-wrenching subject, and I expect nothing but brilliance from his upcoming film ""K-PAX.""",Hackers
195,gamemaniac05,A good attempt at showing the world what hackers are somewhat like.,8,18 June 2005,"In the past there haven't been very many movies about hackers or the culture in general. Because of this many stigmatize hackers to the geek and the kid who never sees the light of day. Hackers shows us something a little different which in many ways is refreshing. As far as the use of computers in the film, there is nothing that movie showed that couldn't be done in real life. Many of the so called hacker culture use many variants of Linux and Free BSD, and in most of these operating systems the GUI can be customized quite a bit (example: Symphony Linux, currently in alpha testing.) I felt the movie conveyed what it wanted to show. There are hackers out there and not all of them are bad. The acting in the film was somewhat above the average. Yes there were a few spots where Johnny Lee Miller's accent came through but most of the time he held a very good American accent. Many of the techno jargon thrown around in the film was very good, and believe it or not many techno junkies talk about things like that as common conversation.All in all the film was an awesome attempt at showing many what the hacker culture may be, as many of us do not really know, and also that even in todays world there are those in power that can exploit these capabilities.

Jesus this thing was crazy back there, all these new stuff, all those things punched hard on me, then, from time to time i watch it again, and every time i watch it, i come to understand that the guys who made it, were some big genious. Today i walk the streets and see too many ppl with diferent hair styles and cloths, we are not yet on the level of the cloths of this movie yet, some places are, but not everywheres. I saw too many bad reviews about the movie from ppl that claimed to be IT people, to these people i say: You People are nuts! People complaining about APIs, really? today we have too many free softwares with worst APis than we have on hackers, they did that way so people could related to it, try imagine Kate Libby writing her api so she could hack some stuff, this would be so boring!
The movie introduce so many concepts and good ideias about the thing, the visuals we watch on the screen are to put in some perspective on whats going on, a column of data base adress for files where they find the trash file, things that looks like midllewares. the social hacking, calling to get a modem number or password, the public telephone signal, all those stuff exists in some point of our planet, they have to put some visual effect to it, anyways otherwise would be strange to people that doenst know anything about I.T; the worm thing, they draw a worm to represent the ideia. this movie is AWESOME. if u are a tech person and find this movie bad, sir u should reset your life and start again, the nintendo generation is powerfull today.",Hackers

In reality this is not the case and hackers either feel under appreciated by the majority of people or wish that hacking is indeed as easy as shown in the film.I think that this film is OK but i also think that it should not glorify hacking and could cause misconceptions about the hacker mindset and values.
