0,TheLittleSongbird,Slick with stellar performances,8,15 January 2010,"I haven't seen the 1960 film for a while, and plan to re watch it shortly. But I will say I did enjoy very much this film. True, there are a lot of characters so sometimes the film feels shallow, and sometimes the pacing is a tad too pedestrian. But there are a number of things that made it a slick and well done film. First, the direction was excellent. Steven Soderbergh is a talented director, and he direction is super efficient. The plot is good, about Danny Ocean and his ten accomplices planning to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. The soundtrack is cool, the cinematography is professional and the script is witty. But it is the stellar performances that make the film. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould and Bernie Mac all give fun performances, elevating what could've been a predictable and unoriginal film into a quite enjoyable one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Ocean's Eleven
1,bkoganbing,Crackerjack caper,7,7 January 2018,"I imagine that followers of the legend of the Clan would find it unforgivable
that George Clooney remade the ultimate Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. But I
think even Frank, Dean, and Sammy would be happy with what Clooney and
director Steven Soderbergh did with it. It's nothing less than a crackerjack
caper film with a few stars to gaze at also.The point in the original is that this was a film almost made as a lark for the
participants while the main players were appearing at the legendary Sands
Resort in Las Vegas. These were old army ranger buddies who decide to put their training to use and heist five casinos.Clooney and buddy Brad Pitt's film has them in the Frank and Dean roles and they're a much more professional outfit who are only doing one of them. But it's the one Andy Garcia owns and Clooney has a score to settle
with him. He's taken Clooney's wife away played here ever so briefly by
Julia Roberts. In the original Angie Dickinson had the part. And it was also
a brief part.Clooney and Pitt go out and recruit a crack team, some they know, some they don't. But it's a professional job and close run thing.Garcia is in a part the equivalent of George Raft from the original. It was 
business for Raft and business for Cesar Romero the syndicate guy he hires
to find them. But Garcia's a nasty character who settles his own accounts.The film has got a whole lot of nice touches stylistically and cast is expensive and first rate. For those familiar with the original the irony of that ending is replaced by something completely different. More in keeping
with George Clooney than Frank Sinatra.Nevertheless I think the Chairman of the Board would like this Ocean's Eleven.",Ocean's Eleven
2,Leofwine_draca,Classy heist thriller with an all-star cast,7,6 September 2016,"An enjoyable enough crime story from golden child Steven Soderbergh, perhaps not achieving classic status but still very amiable to sit through. This remake has many things in its favour, not least in Soderbergh's direction; this is a man with the power to turn the most mundane plot events into fairly gripping, watchable drama. His film looks and feels good, reaching a classy level far above anything most Hollywood directors these days have the capability of achieving. The plot, it has to be said, is fairly clichéd and predictable, but there are one or two surprising twists and a witty script gives to some fine interplay between the characters. Of course, it goes without saying that the star-studded cast is the main reason to sit through this film and enjoy it.George Clooney heads the bill as Danny Ocean, a suave and snappily-dressed criminal who devises the perfect robbery. The more I see of Clooney, the more I like him; in fact he may be one of the only stars in Hollywood today to recall the charm and charisma of the old school actors like Cary Grant and Clark Gable. Combining dashing looks with strong acting methods, Clooney is a real gem of an actor and it's astonishing that he began in television when his forte is so obviously the cinema. Not that I want to sound sycophantic, but Clooney is one of the good guys. His foil is none other than Andy Garcia, who seems to have been off our screens for a decade, so who now looks suddenly a heck of a lot older than he used to. Garcia crafts a cold, cold character for his casino owner, Terry Benedict, combining smoothness with menace with barely uttering a word.Brad Pitt has a supporting role as Clooney's accomplice and is, well, Brad Pitt. He doesn't have a lot to do but he seems to be enjoying himself. Julia Roberts is the conventional love interest but I have already expressed my dislike of the actress elsewhere so I'll leave it at that. With so much of the screen time devoted to many different characters and actions, not many of the other actors get much of a look in and instead appear to be along for the ride, adding ""name value"" to the poster. Matt Damon barely registers as the young, smart pickpocket; Casey Afflect and Scott Caan provide dubious comic relief; Elliott Gould has aged in an astonishing way so this distracts from his acting. Congratulations to Carl Reiner, putting in a tour-de-force acting performance in a very small part. Watch out for Joshua Jackson as a card shark and Don Cheadle, whose character appears to have been influenced by Dick Van Dyke in MARY POPPINS. OCEAN'S ELEVEN is a pure popcorn movie, but at least it credits the audience with some taste, intelligence, and refinery, unlike most big bucks blockbusters these days.",Ocean's Eleven
3,SnoopyStyle,Giant Stars at Play,7,9 February 2014,"Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a career criminal who just got released from prison. He quickly sets his signs on robbing three of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas, The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. All of them owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). They plan to take them down when they have the biggest reserves during the big fight.Steven Soderbergh is an expert director, and his skills are fully used here. This is a slick fun production. George Clooney and friends are having great fun playing crooks. This is strictly play acting. There isn't any realism here. It's fun to see so many giant stars playing with so gusto. However there is a lack of tension or suspense. We're all just star gazing.",Ocean's Eleven
4,Prismark10,Three casino heist,6,27 August 2014,"Th 1960 rat pack original was not regarded as a good film which apart from Peter Lawford, the rest of the rat pack did too much partying to take the shooting of the film seriously.Director Steven Soderbergh's remake is light in its feet, he has the actors in shape and makes good stab at a lighthearted, stylish caper.Danny Ocean is a con man straight out of prison who gets a gang together and plans go rob the Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand on the same night. All casinos owned by Terry Benedict and he is the man who is now going out with Ocean's ex-wife.The teaming up of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle garnered a lot of excitement and press attention. They even managed to get two rival World boxing champions to meet in the ring on screen. Lennox Lewis who was the world heavyweight champion at the time was so distracted by filming his scenes he subsequently lost the defence of his title.The true assets of the movie is the director and screenwriter who constructed the plot and kept the movie sharp and the egos restrained.The film is fun as you go from the idea of the heist, planning to the recruitment of the team members and then actual robbery itself. The film is escapist fun, its just a shame that it feels a tad overlong, maybe the film could had ended when they watched the Bellagio fountains at night.",Ocean's Eleven
5,kosmasp,What a cast,8,9 May 2007,"But it's more than that! The story is great, the actors enjoy their roles. And so will you, if you watch the movie! The movie has many players, but still concentrates on one central one (George Clooney's) for your attention. But I was a little bit surprised that Don Cheadle is not listed in the credits (according to IMDb) ...It's style and funny dialogues from beginning to the end. Andy Garcia is a great villain here too. Someone you like to see fall down. But the question is, does he? You'll have to see the movie for that. Be excited, be very excited! Especially if you know the Original (with Frank Sinatra and others), because this movie is an example, that a remake can in fact not only be as good as the Original, but be even better! Watch it and you'll see! :o)",Ocean's Eleven
6,classicsoncall,"""It will be nice working with proper villains again.""",8,13 February 2018,"That's Don Cheadle's character, Basher Tarr, in my summary quote above, but when I check the cast of characters on the IMDb title page for this movie, he shows up in an uncredited role. No excuse for that, without his 'pinch' contraption, the Ocean crew wouldn't have been able to pull it off.Well, the whole idea is wildly implausible, but just like the 1960 original with Frank Sinatra as Danny Ocean, this is a highly entertaining and often amusing flick. It's probably a toss-up as to which film had the bigger celebrity cast; for me it's hard to top the original Rat Pack. And just like the original, virtually nothing goes wrong in the execution of the plan here to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Not very credible, but if you put that aside, you get lots of commendable support from George Clooney's band of supporting players. Taking things literally though, one must take exception to the movie's brief description, again on the picture's IMDb title page. It refers to 'Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices, but if you're paying attention, the eleven includes Ocean himself. If you want to make a case for Julia Roberts, go ahead, but she didn't have anything to do with the caper.With it's writing and flashier style, this 2001 remake does come across somewhat better head to head against Sinatra's crew, but that decision can be made by the viewer. I enjoyed both actually, and this one had enough going for it that it makes me curious to catch the two sequels, Ocean's Twelve and Thirteen. They're coming up soon on my watch list.",Ocean's Eleven
7,lee_eisenberg,You'd better believe that I'm in!,9,14 January 2006,"I've always had a low opinion of Frank Sinatra, so I've never seen the original version of ""Ocean's Eleven"", but the remake was pretty neat. The plot of course has ex-con Danny Ocean (George Clooney) getting eleven people to help him pull off a heist in Las Vegas. The neat factor mainly comes from their planning, which takes up most of the movie. Really cool performances from Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and everyone else, make this one neat movie. Apparently, it has a different ending than the original had, but obviously only those who have seen the original will even know that. Really cool. I have yet to see the sequel.",Ocean's Eleven
8,jboothmillard,Ocean's Eleven,7,14 September 2005,"From director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich, Traffic), I only found out this was a remake some years later, but it is not the same film at all, and I'm glad I watched it again. Basically Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has just been released from his New Jersey prison having served his time for robbery, but he is already planning his next heist with his partner in crime, card master Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt). They get some funding and advice from Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), as they plan to steal from three big Las Vegas casinos, The Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand, all belonging to ruthless entrepreneur Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). The stealing isn't just for the millions of dollars, Danny also wants a little revenge for Benedict having an interest and seemingly taking away his beautiful ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). So Danny and Ryan gather together a team of eight other master minds to carry out the job: pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), explosives mind Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Malloy brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan) are drivers, card dealer Frank Catton (Bernie Mac) as watch, retired Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) playing cards and living in the hotel, Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) placing bugs, and Chinese acrobat artist Yen (Qin Shaobo) using his skills to turn off alarms. Using sophisticated technology, an identical built safe as simulation and a camera trick, disguises, gymnastics, cons, double crossing and blackmail, they pull off the robbery and steal the millions, and in the end Danny seems to get Tess back. Also starring Lennox Lewis, Henry Silva, Angie Dickinson, Steve Lawrence, Wayne Newton, Joshua Jackson and Shane West. Clooney is cool and calm, Pitt is good looking and suave, Damon is nervy but reliable, Garcia is aggressive, Roberts is innocent and beautiful, and the supporting all star cast members get their time too, with a witty sharp quick-fire script and one or two exciting and engaging set pieces, it is watchable action crime caper. George Clooney was number 72, and Brad Pitt number 15 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Clooney was number 7, and Pitt number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Pitt was number 30 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Ocean's Eleven
9,Tweekums,A fun caper film,7,5 August 2009,"I'm aware that it is a remake of an earlier film but as I've not seen that I can't say if it is as good or not. This is a fun caper film with a star cast who all appear to be having a great time, that isn't to say that they don't do a good job however.The film opens with Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, being released from prison. He has no plans of going straight though, he has a job planned, a big job that will require a large team of expert criminals. The job in question is robbing a Las Vegas casino, something considered impossible by most people but he thinks he has found away.The early part of the film concentrates on recruiting the team and their preparations for the job itself, when they start their on site preparations it becomes clear that money isn't Danny's only motivation for robbing this particular casino; its owner is going out with his ex-wife. The robbery itself is pretty exciting even though the viewer is never in much doubt that nothing bad will happen to our anti-heroes, after all it is a fun film not a gritty drama.I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to watch a fun will that doesn't contain lots of violence, it might not be all that realistic but if you can suspend your disbelief it is a well made, well acted caper film.",Ocean's Eleven

11,moonspinner55,Flipping the switch on Sin City,7,15 October 2007,"Sharp, canny, dashing remake of the Frank Sinatra Rat Packer from 1960 about the ultimate Las Vegas heist. Master thief George Clooney and pal Brad Pitt enlist a disparate group of con-artists to rob billionaire casino owner Andy Garcia of his millions in his highly-guarded vault--and, just for good measure, his girl too. Wonderfully fast and hip, with a sleek direction by Steven Soderbergh (who never stops teasing the audience) and a glittering array of stars and character actors, all of whom get a good slice of the pie. Of course, the byzantine (and expensive) plot these guys concoct could never be duplicated in reality--and that outlandishness does spoil some of the fun. Still, the cartoony way this motley crew takes over the Bellagio, with Soderbergh's camera zipping around the action like a fox, provides high entertainment the whole way through. *** from ****",Ocean's Eleven
12,dbdumonteil,Soderbergh's good movie,5,21 September 2003,"I think that ""Ocean's eleven"" is an overrated movie (7.5 out of 10 on imdb) but it's nonetheless a pleasant movie. It goes down well thanks to a clever and often inventive directing, smart dialogs and a well-run troop of actors. George Clooney dominates the cast. Steven Soderbergh's movie also enjoys a screenplay that is well put together. Perhaps a little too well put together because it's hard to follow Clooney' operation and there are details that can escape your attention.A good movie but not a masterpiece.",Ocean's Eleven
13,blanche-2,Just great,8,28 January 2007,"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Shaobo Qin, Miguel Perez, and Livingston Dell make up ""Ocean's Eleven,"" a 2001 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film also stars Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. This is a remake of the rat pack ""Ocean's Eleven,"" which I've never seen so I can't make comparisons. I suspect that this version has more emphasis on plot and the older one has more emphasis on the pack.The mastermind of a plot to rob Las Vegas' Bellaggio Hotel vault of $160 million is Danny Ocean, a very recent ex-con who had lots of time on his hands in prison to plan it. With the help of his buddy, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) he recruits 9 people who specialize in a particular expertise to carry out the elaborate heist. Problems come in when Ocean, obsessed with his ex-wife (Roberts), approaches her, to the annoyance of her present boyfriend, the owner of the hotel, Terry Benedict (Garcia). He ""makes"" Danny by sending out a bulletin with Danny's photo to the hotel staff, which puts him out of his own plot at the insistence of Rusty. But Danny isn't one to exit easily, in either marriage or robberies.This is a fast-paced, tension-filled, exciting movie that's highly entertaining. The plot is completely improbable so you have to take it for what it is - fantastic fun. And you never know whether something is going wrong or if it's part of the plan. The chemistry between the actors, particularly Clooney and Pitt, is great, and there is some wonderful acting. Clooney is solid as Ocean, a passionate man of quiet determination; Damon is terrific as an insecure participant; Don Cheadle, sporting a Cockney accent, is hilarious as an explosives expert; Elliot Gould is outrageous as their financial backer; Carl Reiner is excellent as an older con man who can do accents. Just as they all contribute their different talents to the heist, they do so in this movie. This includes the acting in the smaller roles played by Bernie Mac et al - everyone is perfect. Andy Garcia is fabulous as Benedict - both elegant and scary, he whispers instead of shouts and stays in control for the most part. Megastar Roberts is wasted - she doesn't have much to do.Any actress could have done the role, but I guess the producers wanted an all-star cast.Highly recommended for blockbuster entertainment value and star power. Just don't look for it to be realistic.",Ocean's Eleven
14,Quinoa1984,"A little predictable, but entertaining fare anyway, from Oscar winner Soderbergh",9,10 December 2001,"Steven Soderbergh, a really good director who (deservedly) won for Traffic, comes back with a type of film sort of remenicent of Out of Sight (mainly in style and humor which is low key but cool) but also a remake of the 1960 caper film with Frank Sinatra.  Here, Clooney plays a recently released inmate who schemes with Pitt to gather up a crew total of 11 (it might seem more, I lost count) to rob three casinos in Las Vegas all owned by Garcia. It goes through the motions almost too easily, yet this movie shouldn't be taken totally seriously as how Soderbergh most likely intended.  A good, enjoyable flick, not as great The Score of even the recently released Heist, but still worthwhile.

He conspires with his old pal Rusty Ryan to rob 150 million dollars from an underground vault that serves three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos. Between the two of them, they recruit nine other men, each with his own criminal specialty, to assist in the mission: finance man Reuben Tishkoff, card dealer Frank , pickpocket Linus, aging con artist Saul, British explosives pro Basher, tech expert Dell, rude-boy brothers Virgil and Turk, and professional acrobat Yen. What Ocean doesn't tell the group is that there's another reason he's coordinating the heist: the three casinos they're robbing are all owned by ruthless gambling mogul Terry Benedict, who just happens to be married to Ocean's former love Tess.As fast-paced, witty, and entertaining as it is star-studded and coolly stylish, Ocean's Eleven offers a well-seasoned serving of satisfaction and entertainment.It was smart and fun story that viewers from all ages and audience who love movies from all genres will truly enjoy.It was a fun heist movie for everyone.",Ocean's Eleven

It relies very, very heavily on the chemistry between the main leads (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts) but there is a decent story being told too.There's lots of witty banter and one-upmanship that is entertaining and the heist itself is well directed.It can at some points come across as being a little overly smug though, in a sort of ""how can you not like this film?"" way.

20,hitchcockthelegend,"I got two words for you, mini-bar.",9,16 November 2008,"Literally fresh out of prison, Danny Ocean is busy setting up a seemingly impossible robbery. The plan, along with ten other experts he has roped in, is to rob the main vault at Las Vegas that houses the takings from the three main casinos.The original Ocean's 11 released in 1960 is an OK film, more watchable for the Vegas setting and the irrepressible cast of Rat Packers than for any purpose or structure. That this Steven Soderbergh remake trumps the original in every department is a triumph of entertainment values over pure star appeal. Some would put a case up for the cast of Soderberg's film using stars to entice the audience in? But really at the time of release it was a stretch to put George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (all excellent here) on the same pedal stool as Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin.The most striking thing about this remake is that the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves, mainly because they are not being asked to over exert their performances from their very astute director, they really are just asked to turn up, enjoy each other's company and deliver one of the coolest pictures to have been made in the decade.The film is purely out there to entertain, it has geniality pouring out from every frame, this is a character based heist caper full of laughs and derring do shenanigans - even Don Cheadle's ill advised (and pointless character arc) cockney accent manages to create smiles instead of being an on going hindrance. Some critics said the film is far too shallow to have any real worth! What the hell do they want? So the crooks are nice guys, it's a refreshing change to see a Vegas sparkling bright without any seedy undercurrents, where these robbers aren't using AK 47s to obliterate the opposition, it's wits and dashes of cool that fills out their respective armouries.The soundtrack and scoring are themselves cool characters in the piece, whilst a big shout out goes to the bona fide stunt work from the wonderfully elastic Shaobo Qin - which merely puts another cherry on this already delightful cake. All the cast (too many to mention) are great, from Andy Garcia's suave and mean boss, Terry Benedict, to Julia Roberts' (walking like a goddess) Tess Ocean, all things in the film deliver a feel good movie that when all put together, and all things considered, is a film made by lovers of the medium for, well yes, lovers of the medium itself! 9/10",Ocean's Eleven

The plot revolves around 1 ) Introducing the characters 2 ) Explaining how they're going to carry out the heist 3 ) Grab the money and ...4 ) Sometimes have a twist at the end What sets this film apart from many others from the same sub-genre is the cast . Okay a heist film needs at least one massive big name to carry it while OCEANS ELEVEN contains four in the shape of Clooney , Damon , Pitt and Roberts who are ably supported by other well known names such as Gould and GarciaDepending upon how you look at it this film is either a failure or a success due to the cast . If you watch movies for the same reasons everyone used to watch classic Hollywood cinema then you will not be disappointed at all . Unfortunate if you're watching for any other reason then you'll notice failings such as the predictable plot or Don Cheadle's incomprehensible accent or the fact that Soderbergh has made a relatively shallow film . But it's another Hollywood Summer blockbuster so it's stupid to complain too much",Ocean's Eleven
22,jotix100,Why bother remaking this film?,7,7 December 2001,"As it was, the original Oceans 11, wasn't a masterpiece of filmmaking!Whatever was in Mr. Soderberg's mind in taking this project, is beyond comprehension. The plot is ridiculous, to put it mildly. It is very convoluted and just to think this gang could carry it off just goes to show us the arrogance not only of the director, but the whole production company involved with this mess. Are we the only ones to think that Brad Pitt is a bad actor? He just doesn't register an emotion in this film, at all! What about that other over-rated star, turned producer, actor, screenwriter, Matt Damon? He is just beyond help. These 2 actors could improve a lot by taking serious acting classes before they even venture out again. Their characters are phoneys, as they're portrayed by these 2 on screen. The only one that shines in this film is George Clooney. He is an actor with a terrific screen presence and a natural, in comparison with the rest of the others. His scenes with Julia Roberts show a rare chemistry and we believe in their past and present involvement. The rest of the cast is just blah. Why doesn't Hollywood use writers and directors who can give us original stories with plots that can be believed instead of remaking films that had their moment and don't merit a remake in any way, shape, or form.

Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful so why does she look so bad?

24,CinemaSerf,Well assembled on just about every level.,8,17 October 2021,"As remakes go - I think we will struggle to find one that is better than this across any genre. It's not just that the cast is full of A-listers, it is that Steven Soderbergh has invested just as much time with his story and with the characterisations as he has with the visuals, the gadgets and, of course, just about everyone from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Julia Roberts and Matt Damon. The premiss being that Clooney ""Danny"" assembles a group of skilled operators with a view to relieving casino owner ""Benedict"" (Andy Garcia) of a great deal of money. Their planning must be meticulous - each having their set tasks that they must deliver precisely to support the overall - dangerous - plan. All looks to be going along well until the boys discover that Julia Roberts (""Tess"") - the ex-wife of their leader - is now dating their mark. Could that compromise their entire operation? The action builds well, here - the contributions from each - especially, for me anyway, Carl Reiner as the curmudgeonly ""Saul"" and Shaobo Qin as the lithe and supple gymnast ""Yen"" - who reminded me somewhat of Burt Lancaster's equally acrobatic buddy Nick Cravat - are charismatic, enjoyable and impressively they all gel quite well too. The ending is a masterstroke, and there is a suitably fitting ""Clair de Lune"" to sign it all off. Good entertainment all round.",Ocean's Eleven

I think Steven Soderbergh (who also wrote and did the cinematography for this movie) really used his big name to get together such a great cast with big names such as: George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould and Andy Garcia. All of the actors portray some fun and enjoyable characters. Characters such as Yen, Virgil and Turk Malloy and Basher Tarr, which are the most enjoyable.If you liked ""The Italian Job""(2003) you'll love ""Ocean's Eleven"".

28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Stylish, clever and cool heist flick, but in the end, it's just an empty film with a pretty cover",7,29 May 2005,"I finally got to see this, after hearing so much positive stuff about it. People were raving about how it was the definition of cool. I believe someone even told me that it rivaled the likes of a Tarantino film. Well, having seen it, I can say that it's definitely got a lot less style than a Tarantino film, and none of the associated substance. It's basically an empty shell, albeit a pretty-looking one. The film has plenty of acting talent, but not even half of it is put to any use. There are just far too many characters, so many of them spend the better part of the film, following their initial introduction, sitting around, not really doing anything at all. Maybe the film should have been Ocean's Five instead... so we actually got some semi-interesting and well-developed characters instead of these cardboard cutouts spouting hip lines every chance they get. The dialog is witty and at times clever, but it's almost entirely superficial. The plot is decent. Another thing is that there's not really anyone to root for; it's a film about dishonest criminals stealing from other dishonest criminals. The pacing is OK. I found the film to be far too long and drawn-out. It could easily have been cut by at least half an hour. Once again, we don't care about these people. Submit any viewer of this movie to a lie detector test and ask if they saw this for the heist or for the characters. If anything less than 90% prove to have seen it entirely for the heist, I'll be very surprised. Then there's all the unneeded scenes, probably done to establish relationships(between the characters that we don't care about). Add to that, the plot holes and completely random actions of some of the characters. This film reminded me of a Danish produced film... Klatretøsen, or Catch That Girl, as it's international title is. It's a children's film, and I found it far more interesting, involving and plausible than this. Note that I didn't claim it was more entertaining. That's what this film is; entertaining. Nothing else. As a matter of fact, you should probably either see the Danish film, or the American remake(which I haven't seen... yet) as you'll probably find more substance in either of them than this film. If you insist on seeing this, just prepare yourself to be underwhelmed and possibly disappointed. I recommend this only to the biggest fans of the stars and people who look for an attractive film rather than a meaningful one. 7/10",Ocean's Eleven

I love it when a good plan comes together, and ""Ocean's Eleven"" was a good plan. So many movies of this type fail because of plot holes, bad directing, bad acting, or a host of other issues. ""Ocean's Eleven"" brought all parts together seamlessly and cohesively, which was amazing considering the grand scale of the theft that took place. Once again, this was a remake of an original I never saw, but it would be hard to believe that the original was much better, if it was better at all. All of the performances were good, which boded well because many star studded line ups tend to disappoint. ""Ocean's Eleven"" certainly didn't disappoint.",Ocean's Eleven
30,anaconda-40658,Most Overrated Film Ever?,1,4 March 2016,"Ocean's 11 (2001): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle: Disastrous remake starring George Clooney as a thief named Daniel Ocean (how clever). He is released from prison after serving time for being part of Batman and Robin, and immediately hooks up with fellow thief Brad Pitt to (ominous drum roll), rob a casino! The casino is owned by Andy Garcia playing Al Pacino and he is dating Julia Roberts who dumped Clooney due to his lifestyle. For every great film Steven Soderbergh makes he tops it with sh*t. For example, Traffic is terrific while Erin Brockovich is overrated garbage. One can suppose that this is his bad counter to his effective Out of Sight. The cast sleepwalk through the charade with Roberts embarrassing in her pitiful grinning in the backseat bull- crap when she accepts the redeeming Clooney. Yet we are suppose to be proud that they pulled together a cast that play like a high school class of roll call. The original film isn't much better with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin leading a large cast through the same charade. The remake is so much worse in its pointless bull and yet somehow this garbage managed to gain popularity. This is one that Soderbergh doesn't score high in terms of character driven writing, but it can claim to be one of the year's very worst films. Score: 0 / 10",Ocean's Eleven
31,gradyharp,An amazingly involving escapist film!,10,28 July 2020,"OCEAN'S ELEVEN may be a near twenty year old film, but its potency is durable. Director Steven Soderbergh paces this well-crafted film with firecracker action and laces it with enough humor and passion that it satisfies on every level.The plot - an ingenious plan created by recently released ex-con Danny Ocean (George Clooney) to rob the conjoined vault of the MGM Grand, the Bellagio, and the Mirage casinos in Las Vegas, all owned by smarmy Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Danny partners with Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and the two create a team of eleven assorted personalities - Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Eddie Jemison. Shaobo Qin, Carl Reiner. Matt Damon, Don Cheadle - each with a special gift to carry out the heist. Oh, and Benedict is with Tess (Julia Roberts) who happens to be Danny's ex-wife - and a key reason the caper is planned!Filled with some of the most interestingly complex concepts for staging an impossible robbery, the film keeps the viewer completely involved in the suspense through the intricate planning and rehearsal and final deed, all the while offering dialogue that is smart, funny - and on point! The climax and ending place a crown on the film - a very solid story offered with sophistication by a superb cast and director. For those who love slick flicks, this is a terrific diversion for these endless quarantined nights at home!",Ocean's Eleven
32,JamesHitchcock,Thou Shalt Steal,6,24 December 2009,"In recent years George Clooney has produced or directed a number of films such as ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" or ""The Men who Stare at Goats"", most of which reflect his left-liberal political convictions. These convictions are not, however, always so well reflected in his choice of films as an actor. Witness, for example, the macho action-thriller ""The Peacemaker"". Or, for that matter, ""Ocean's Eleven"", a caper film which- like all caper films- preaches the message that ""Greed is Good"" and which- like an increasing number of modern examples of the genre- adds a further message to the effect that ""Crime does Pay"".Here Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a career criminal who comes up with a plan to rob a vast sum of money the vaults of three Las Vegas casinos, the Bellagio, the Mirage and the MGM Grand. Now the man in the street might think this scheme to be a thoroughly dishonest one, but for the purposes of the film we are expected to regard it as a highly laudable enterprise because the owner of the three casinos, Terry Benedict, is portrayed as an unpleasant, thuggish gangster. Benedict is also the current lover of Danny's ex-wife, Tess, so under the moral code which governs caper movies Danny has two quite legitimate reasons to steal from him with a clear conscience.Now the Las Vegas gambling scene may have been under the control of the Mob back in the days of Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, but I always understood that these days the Nevada Gaming Commission are keen to keep it squeaky-clean and to exclude anyone with criminal connections from having anything to do with running the casinos. It therefore seemed odd that the film-makers could, without falling foul of the laws of libel, imply that three major casinos (all of which are real institutions) are owned and run by an obviously crooked individual like Benedict. It seemed even odder that the real owners of the Bellagio welcomed the film and allowed the team to shoot on location. It seems that in some businesses any publicity is good publicity.I won't go into details of Danny's scheme to relieve Benedict of some of his ill-gotten wealth, except to say it is extremely complicated in order to overcome the casinos' elaborate security precautions. (You probably have to watch the film several times to understand it fully). Suffice it to say that it is so complicated that Danny needs to recruit no fewer than ten former colleagues and other criminals, each with his own special skills, in order to pull it off- hence the title of the film. To British eyes the title ""Ocean's Eleven"" would appear to have sporting overtones, as both soccer and cricket are played between teams of eleven men, but as both sports are much less popular in America than they are here these overtones were presumably unintended.Given such a large cast, it is not surprising that there is no serious attempt made at characterisation and hence no really outstanding acting performances. Although the film was made with an ensemble cast, however, the film-makers managed to attract a surprisingly large number of big-name stars, including not only those two great male sex-symbols Gorgeous George and Beau Brad but also the likes of Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Andy Garcia and Don Cheadle.""Ocean's Eleven"" is a slick, glossy piece of popular entertainment- a sort of superior popcorn movie; I enjoyed it more than the rather dull sequel ""Ocean's Twelve"". (I must admit that I have not seen either ""Ocean's Thirteen"", the third episode in the franchise, or the original Rat Pack ""Ocean's Eleven"" from 1960). My main concern about it is its apparent rewriting of the Ten Commandments so that the eighth now reads ""Thou Shalt Steal"". It is by no means unique in that respect among modern films, but at least the likes of ""Entrapment"" were honest about their own dishonesty. ""Ocean's Eleven"" seems to be going out of its way to justify theft and robbery provided that the owner of the stolen property is sufficiently unpleasant to make him a legitimate target. 6/10",Ocean's Eleven

But was I that excited about this movie, not really.George Clooney and his con friends are devising a plan to rob one of the biggest casino's in Las Vegas. Over $150 million, they have their heads in deep. So, they obviously have to find people for different jobs. What they are good at and who has the connections.I would recommend this for a watch. It's a good movie. But like I said, it's not that big of a deal. I felt like either there was too much said or then they didn't say enough.

36,KineticSeoul,"Cool, slick and entertaining",8,3 March 2013,"This is a heist movie that is slick, cool and entertaining. And doesn't rely on the grittiness of the heist or the violence. But the clever and intricate way the team works together to pull off the heist. Although some parts don't seem plausible, it doesn't get to the point where it gets dumb and irritating to watch. The movie is directed by Steven Soderbergh which is why some top well known actors and actress at that time decided to be part of this movie. It may seem like it just has top actors and actresses combined to make a movie. But this movie is actually cleverly constructed with each character playing a part and crucial to the story. Well at least for a movie that has over a dozen characters in a time frame of around 2 hours. The team for the heist where they are planning to steal from not 1 but 3 casinos. Is composed of Danny Ocean who is the leader aka The Idea Man. Rusty Ryan aka The Pro or Danny's right hand man played by Brad Pitt. He sort of reminded me of Tyler Durden in this, well Tyler Durden who is trying to steal from casinos and not just fat to make soap out of. And these two are the two cool guys of the bunch. The rookie or the pick pocket guy is played by Matt Damon. And these three are like the main characters of the bunch since they are also the most well known actors on the team. The team is also composed of The Getaway, The Basher, The Bankroll, Eye in the Sky, Inside Man, Grease Man, and The High Roller. And than there is The Target, the man they are trying to steal from who is played by Andy Garcia. He plays a character named Terry Benedict, who runs the three casinos and is very good at what he does. And is one of the main conflict when it comes to pulling off the heist. I think it's kinda cool for a guy that is passionate about his job and there really isn't anything that makes him the bad guy. Besides him appearing and working like a machine. But he has Danny's wife who she is with on her own freewill and that woman is played by Julia Roberts. Yeah she was a popular actress at that time but she just didn't seem to fit this role well. Maybe it's just me since I never really found her attractive. And a really attractive woman was needed for this role and I rarely say this. But some parts I just couldn't buy into because of her. Overall this is a well crafted and slick heist movie that has some cool dialogues and is worth checking out.8/10",Ocean's Eleven
37,sddavis63,An Uninspired Remake Of An Uninspired Original,3,6 January 2003,"I was not a huge lover of the original version of ""Ocean's Eleven,"" but would still give it the nod over this rather weak and uninspired remake. Basically what makes this the weaker of the two is the cast. In the original, there was the chemistry of the ""Rat Pack"" to at least keep things interesting. Here, George Clooney et. al. are never able to establish that same rapport and a movie that boasts some big names (Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, etc.) is never able to convince me that the cast was working as a team.The same problem that infected the first version is apparent in this as well: the plodding beginning which takes us in great detail through the planning of the casino heist. Here, though, the planning itself leads to questions. To do everything that this bunch did in preparation would have required (it seems to me) a fair bit of seed money. Sure, $160 million is a lot of money, but I found myself wondering at times why they needed it. In any event, the planning of the heist is not exactly spell-binding. This version goes into far more detail about the heist itself than did the original, but it loses points for its ending, which was quite weak compared to the ""Rat Pack"" version.Since I wasn't a fan of the original I wasn't really expecting much, and that's exactly what I got: not much!3/10.",Ocean's Eleven
38,thesar-2,Are you in or out?,10,21 August 2010,"I actually do like a lot of rebooted/remakes, such as Dawn of the Dead, Halloween or Star Trek. But, of course, for every three that are good, a dozen or more are mediocre at best. That's not the case here.Granted, I have not seen, nor really desire to see the original Ocean's Eleven, after what I read and researched about it. I'll just take this movie at face value.More than just a remake, this movie ranks HIGH on my all-time favorites list. I have probably seen it twice the number in the title and plan on more visits to one of the most creative, funny and just plain entertaining movies I have ever seen. It helps that I am a George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon fan and I can enjoy Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia from time to time. But, put all of those, plus a lot more, together and you have probably the highest level of chemistry between any casts in any movie.Ocean (Clooney) is released on probation from jail and first things first: he starts high-rolling his latest heist scheme by rounding up the usual suspects through his buddy, Rusty (Pitt.) Their diabolical plan is to rob three Las Vegas casinos in a single night, all from the same vault under the Bellagio. To do so, they need (almost) a dozen men and everything to go as planned.That's the basic premise, but there is so much more richness to this movie that causes oodles of repeat watching.Number one: Even though the chemistry is pitch perfect across the board, even involving enemies, its Clooney and Pitt that make this jump three levels. Their banter and understanding of each other while finishing each other's thoughts and sentences hasn't been seen since the 1950s. Usually that involved Cary Grant and a various female lead. Here, sexuality aside, these two cats had it down. They added humor, pose and you rooted for them every step of the way, even though, in reality, they're the bad guys.Number Two: The remaining cast was excellent. Each held their own, each had their own depth. Not two alike. Damon was great as the nervous and up'n'coming'thieving Linus, brothers Virgil and Turk were played hilariously by Caan and Affleck and Jemison played the computer nerd wonderfully. Those are just four. Mark my words: EVERY SINGLE actor in this film was perfect in their respective roles. I could go on another 1,000 words on each one and not do them the justice they did for themselves.Number Three: It's pure fantasy. I consider myself somewhat a Vegas Expert – I've been following, studying and visiting Sin City since I was about 13-15. THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN. Even if one aspect of their master robbery plan would partially work, it would be thwarted in seconds. And that's part of the fun. You know this is unrealistic, yet, we're so drawn into it, it's extremely enjoyable. That's due to (#4 below) the dialogue and character depth that acts as a (no coincidence) diversion to the improbability of what's happening on screen.Number Four: The dialogue was original, deep, snappy and quotable from line one. Speaking of which, those first two words spoken, by both the probation officer and repeated by Daniel Ocean, ""Good Morning"" seriously became my tagline, no matter the time of day. I would walk into Santisi Brothers, my local pub and watering hole for going on ten years and tell my favorite waitresses ""Good Morning."" I did it so much, that I didn't catch myself sometimes and some newbie's would tell me it was evening. I always replied, ""It's morning somewhere.""I mention that story because this movie had such an impact on me, it became part of my subconscious. Oh, and there's plenty more lines I absolutely love: ""Whiskey. And whiskey."" ""I only lied about being a thief and I don't do that anymore. – Steal? – Lie."" ""All reds!"" There's more than a hundred more. Admittedly, some still go over my head including ones about the caper lifestyle I'm not familiar with. Though I can't necessarily follow what an ""Ella Fitzgerald"" is, it just proves how brilliant this movie is. (And no, I refuse to Google it. I love my ignorance and the movie's intelligence.) It's nice to revisit a movie and either hear/catch things I haven't before or enjoy the dialogue I did.Number Five: I get cranky when it comes to Vegas-Themed movies. They rarely get it right – Con Air and 21 being the most offensive and misappropriated views of the city. This movie got it right. And it was gorgeous. Though now a (only a tad) bit dated – it's 9 years old, after all, it still captures the essence of the beautiful strip, inside the casino and out. It doesn't just take the finale in front of the Bellagio water fountains to tell you: they knew Vegas.Number Six: Simply intelligence. This script was perfect. Rarely will I encounter such a well written, well rounded script from minute one to the end where they introduce Julia Roberts. Everything worked here, from dialogue, to interactions, to tension, to comedy. In a word: masterpiece in writing.If you have yet to experience Ocean's Eleven, you are missing out on a modern classic. Whether or not you like George Clooney or Bad Guys as heroes, you will love this. This worked in 2001 and will be timeless enough to be shown in 2050 and have the same impact.

40,Robert_duder,Just a friendly get together...,8,2 January 2005,"I have not seen, but probably will soon, the original Ocean's Eleven but I have no doubt it was made for the same reasons, and with the same intent that this remake was done by Steven Soderbergh. The idea for both is this...get the hottest names, the hottest people in Hollywood, pull them together for a fun, caper movie filled with one liners, killer action, and some great twists and let them have a great time for audiences to see. Ocean's 11 the remake certainly accomplishes this goal full throttle. The stories of the off camera antics of the HUGE Hollywood cast are already legendary. Clooney and Pitt's lavish pranks, as well as the gifts the whole cast exchanged. Throw in the setting of the world's hottest night town and you can't lose. I think that Soderbergh understood this much better than Lewis Milestone who directed the original.Ocean's 11 is about Danny Ocean an ex-con who is released from prison after being sent up for robbery. He wastes no time tracking down his old buddy and hatching the biggest scheme ever in the history of robberies not only to accomplish the biggest score but nail the biggest revenge. Rusty, his partner in crime, agrees that in order to pull this off they are going to need the most elaborate plan the best crew ever to get it done. So they recruit nine of the best of the best, con artists, electronics, brains, thieves, acrobatics...it's the ironic cream of the crop of crime (pulled from the creme of the crop of Hollywood.) Ocean's enemy Terry Benedict is the target as he owns no less than three of the largest Casinos in Vegas.This film's magic is captured within it's purpose as outlined above. It's all about the Hollywood elite getting together for this on screen party. Clooney, Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia (okay he's not elite but he looks good as the bad guy), Carl Reiner...and some great cameo's from the second string Hollywood Topher Grace, Holly Combs, Joshua Jackson, Wayne Newton, Angie Dickinson (who played Danny Ocean's wife in the original.) They all play themselves in various cameo's throughout. One of the best scenes of the film is when Topher Grace, and Joshua Jackson are leaving the club they are at and they are bombarded by photographers and autograph seekers while Pitt and Clooney walk right by. The film is filled with this little off camera/on camera little tricks and it adds something to the magic.The actual film is actually quite good as well. For a caper movie it's pretty straight forward, nothing new here, but it's definitely pumped up a few notches. It's far more complex and elaborate because it needs to be to pull it off. Their plans basically go off without a single hitch, even when we as the audience think it's a hitch...it's not...it's all part of their plan. It was brilliant writing that puts the audience at the center of their plans without ever revealing what that plan is so we are still surprised and delighted with their clever little plot. Everything is perfectly organized and I don't just mean the plan...the scenery, the cast, the story, the plot, the crime, everything. It's too perfect and that's what this is all about. It's as cool as it possibly could be. And it still holds a certain amount of old time Hollywood charm in there. I could even stand to watch George Clooney as Danny Ocean and he usually drives me insane. The rest of the cast is well fit to their roles although the only one who really seems to have to act would be Matt Damon playing the introverted Linus.I am looking forward to seeing the sequel and even though I am sure it will fall short of this one I can completely understand why the cast would want to try and capture some of what they created in the first one so I will be happy to oblige and watch it. Until then, everyone check this movie out, it's worth it and a good time to be had.8/10",Ocean's Eleven

It's this aspect and this fun approach to 'Ocean's Eleven (2001)' that makes watching the film so entertaining, like an untaxing puzzle to be unravelled as it goes along, and its easy-going attitude makes for a laid-back watch with some twists to keep you on your toes and great character writing to keep a smile on your face. 7/10",Ocean's Eleven

49,sol-,My brief review of the film,8,9 January 2005,"Clever and amusing fun, Soderbergh puts in some nice touches here and there, but the film is weighed down by being a bit of a conventional crime caper, with nothing new to add except a different clever theft scheme. It is, however, the character that Julia Roberts plays who really brings the film down a lot, as she is unnecessary to the plot, except for spicing up a familiar revenge theme, which the film does not work all that well with, and hence could have done without. As entertaining as the film is to watch, it is far from perfect, not only because of Julia Roberts, but a number of others marks of conventionality too.",Ocean's Eleven
50,briancham1994,What a ride,8,20 August 2020,"This is one of the best heist films I've seen. There is a big cast of suave characters but they are all given good screentime and integral roles. Their plan is (mostly) well thought out and revealed slowly through a real rollercoaster of a story. There are lots of misdirections, twists and turns. It is paced quickly so you just get absorbed in the ride.",Ocean's Eleven
51,Dr_Coulardeau,The first steps of a saga,9,24 June 2009,"The first film of the Ocean saga, trilogy, so far, The first one is the prototype and prototype it is. One simple situation. A casino in Las Vegas. A complicated security set up but nothing impregnable because impregnable is not in Hollywood's dictionary. A whole set of gangsters led by Brad, Matt and George, and enjoying themselves very much. Of course they succeed with a little bit of high tech. And they stage the whole thing for the casino entrepreneur who falls in the trap of what he sees on his video cameras and on his surveillance screens and then he finds out he has been tricked and that the bill of the trick is something around 163 million dollars, maybe less, maybe more, who knows, but sure more than the trick his female, or male, employees are selling to the hotel and casino customers. It is apparently easy to lure this business gangster or this gangster businessman: flatter his vain and arrogant ego by flattering his security because he believes he has the best security in the world, and then you can go through. Apart from that tricky complicated situation, the film is very simple, if not ordinary. But after all it is only a matrix: it has to remain simple to breed good sequels, and this one bred two sequels. Good entertainment, for the actors too I guess.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",Ocean's Eleven
52,zkonedog,A Fun Caper Film,8,8 March 2017,"Too many times, films that contain a lot of ""flash"" or ""style"" are lacking in one particular area: ""substance"". This is where ""Ocean's 11"" rises above the mold in its ability to put a fantastic plot to all the pizzaz.For a basic plot summary, ""Ocean's 11"" sees master thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney) get out of prison and embark on a new thieving expedition...the Bellagio Hotel owned by casino mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). In order to tackle the monumental task, Ocean puts together a burglar's ""Dream Team"" (starring the likes of Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, & Matt Damon, among others).This movie primarily succeeds because it does so many things well. For example...-The casino-robbing plot line is intriguing and never really gets old or stale. Something is always happening that keeps your attention.-The characters create such great chemistry with each other that they are a joy to watch. The subtle humor embedded in the interplay between such characters also lends some needed lightness.-For those who like ""glamour"" films (e.g. guys in sharp suits cracking wise, flashing lights, Vegas atmosphere, etc.), this one will remain in your video library!Overall, ""Ocean's 11"" is a fun caper movie that does a lot of things well.

53,Floated2,Stylish and highly entertaining,8,30 April 2017,"Ocean's Eleven (2001) is one of the more stylish and most elegantly filmed movies from its time. This film may well be the best of the franchise, in terms of overall plot, style, substance, and entertaining factor. Although Ocean's Thirteen is quite well made. All the actors play their roles well, lead by George Clooney as the title character, as well as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia. The pacing of the film is solid as everything appears to be there, and with a large cast, we are to see them all perform. Director Steven Soderbergh seemed to have fun making this movie. He shot this film very intimately often allowing the camera to stay close on the actors a tad longer than expected which lets their personas shine through their personalities draw you into the movie as much as the caper itself. It's not often you see a movie where the direction has as much wit and cleverness as the plot itself. All together, Ocean's Eleven makes no pretense to be something other than a clever heist movie.",Ocean's Eleven
54,filipemanuelneto,A light film that entertains the audience well.,6,21 February 2017,"This movie tells the attempt to rob the vault of three major Las Vegas casinos by a group of professional thieves led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney). It's a very light film, made for entertaining, with an improbable but fun plot, full of moments of intelligent humor that look good in the movie. In addition to Clooney, who has done here one of his most popular works, we have Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts among others. Clooney and Pitt stood out for the positive, being able to amuse and to make humor without losing the charm of their characters or overshadowing the colleagues. The story is relatively simple but allows almost all actors to have room to appear. And although I said the story is unlikely, the biggest problem of the script for me was the love trio Clooney-Roberts-Garcia. The idea was good, but it did not work out because Julia Roberts never seemed very willing. The romantic chemistry between her and her two colleagues was zero and I ended up thinking about what the actress really thought she was doing in the movie. Andy Garcia has already made more inspirational performances but was decent enough on his character. The scenarios are very good and realistic, from the safe to the gaming rooms, and the great sights of Las Vegas are truly beautiful and look good on the screen. The soundtrack is great and stays in the ear.",Ocean's Eleven

58,Anonymous_Maxine,Hell yes.,8,14 December 2004,"The remake of Ocean's 11 is a tremendously entertaining movie. I personally find Brad Pitt and George Clooney to be among the most watchable actors working today, so I found the movie to be hugely appealing despite numerous plot holes, an almost nonstop barrage of clichés, a ridiculous ending, and Don Cheadle. Before I go on, I should mention that I think Cheadle is an immensely talented actor with some great performance's under his belt, such as his work in Boogie Nights, Traffic, and A Lesson Before Dying (sure, he can't pronounce Vladivostok, but it was still a great performance). The problem with his character here, probably the most controversial role of the entire movie, is that he was forced to take on this ridiculous accent, making him the Jar Jar Binks of Ocean's 11. Pretty sad, but I hope it serves as a lesson for how dumb it is to have well known actors take on thick accents. It does nothing but call attention to itself and invite criticism for the actor's ability to pull it off. And given the content of the discussion boards on the IMDb, Cheadle didn't pull it off so well. That being said, the rest of the movie is enormously entertaining, even though Andy Garcia, who I have had an unjustifiable aversion to ever since Desperate Measures, turns his character of the ridiculously rich Terry Benedict, owner of three casinos in Las Vegas, into an almost cartoonish villain. George Clooney plays the title character Danny Ocean, recently released from prison where he had plenty of time to develop intricate plots for robbing three casinos simultaneously. The parole board asks him if he thinks he would ever return to a life of crime were he released, he smiles, gets released, and promptly returns to a life of crime. This is the kind of character that Clooney was born to play.Brad Pitt plays Ocean's Second, the second man in charge and much of the pull behind getting this whole thing together. We get the usual montage of hilarious antics being committed by those that are to be sought to be among Ocean's 11 (edited together on the same template used to introduce us to the colorful characters in Armageddon), each one fulfilling the need for another stereotype. In this way, the movie is pretty weak, but it is so entertaining to watch the robberies pulled off that it makes up for a lot of these shortcomings. Brad Pitt lends his massive presence to the film as Rusty, an old friend of Danny's. Rusty is an interesting character, sort of a freelancer in Vegas, living his life in the casinos, obviously raking in comfortable amounts of cash from his less than legal endeavors, and willing only to dress in the highest of fashion. Strange, however, for a man to constantly wear such high priced clothing when he is ALWAYS eating. Matt Damon plays the part of the pickpocket, whose skills come into good use in the plot in ways which I will not reveal, Don Cheadle plays the demolitions expert, Bernie Mac gets a great role as a card dealer with a not so clean past, and Elliott Gould makes a huge turn from his character in American History X to play the part of a washed up con man, eager for revenge against Terry Benedict, who put him out of business.The idea is to rob the central safe that stores the cash for the three casinos in question. Supposedly this is the most ingenious and impenetrable vault ever created by mankind (as this is generally how it is described throughout the movie), which begs the question of why the blueprints for the vault are kept under the watchful eye of a cheaply rented night security guard. That's like leaving the keys to Fort Knox in plain view outside the vault and protected by a thin pane of glass. (spoilers) Complicating matters, conveniently for the script, is the little factoid that Benedict is now dating Ocean's ex-wife, who left him because he was involved in a life of crime. It's interesting to see the movie take place in what is to me the familiar setting of Las Vegas, but it is not enough to distract attention from the disastrous romantic content of the movie.Not only does Tess (Roberts) come off as a stiff and exceedingly unpleasant woman, but she left Danny in the first place for being a criminal and landing himself in prison. Then he pulls off this astronomical heist, stealing millions and millions of dollars from her current love interest (as well as managing to get him to admit on camera that he cares more about money than he does about Tess), and THEN she wants him back. What, she didn't want to be with him before because his criminal life landed him in prison, but now she wants him back because he's GOOD at being a criminal? Please. Nevertheless, while the ending almost completely ruined the movie because it leaves such a bad aftertaste, the rest of the film is hugely entertaining, bad fake accents notwithstanding. There are lots of twists and turns, lots of people get what is coming to them, and as is to be expected from a movie starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts, the star power is substantial. It ends badly, but it's great up to that point. It's just too bad that the bad part is so near the end and therefore in the front of your mind at the end of the movie.",Ocean's Eleven

60,Vartiainen,One of the penultimate heist films,9,18 March 2015,"I think that Ocean's Eleven is the film a lot of my generation recalls when they hear the term heist film. And for a good reason. A reboot of an older film by the same name, it updates its story to the modern era, features an all-star cast of high end actors and as a whole is the very definition of slick and cool. Exactly the qualities a good heist film has going for it.Objectively looking Ocean's Eleven doesn't really do anything revolutionary. The story, while more sympathetic to the crooks, is basically the same as far as the premise goes, the plan is clever and will keep you guessing until the end, but doesn't contain any huge twists, and the style is something we've seen before. It's just a matter of how well it can pull those clichés off. And this movie is the very definition of tropes are not bad. Everything in it is textbook, but in the best possible meaning of the term.To be fair, a lot of that is due to the two main leads, Clooney and Pitt. These two are cool and suave in everything they do, and together they are dynamite. It's no wonder they got two sequels out of this. I'm actually somewhat disappointed they didn't get more.You've all seen this film already. It's a part of our cultural understanding nowadays, a cliché, a definition, an understanding of something that just is, a trope in and on itself. And in the end, that simply means that it's a movie worth seeing.",Ocean's Eleven

62,elshikh4,Ocean's Eleven Robots !,6,2 January 2010,"It's the score this time. Not the scorers.(Soderbergh) wanted the trust of the studio?, wanted to be a big player?, wanted to fulfill his own dreams by directing Hollywood dreams first? Whatever the reason was, the man delivered. But despite being loved or successful, the popcorn movie which he made was so unfunny and spiritless. Maybe it's (Soderbergh)'s real unconcern of the project's nature coming unconsciously on the surface. Maybe that's his very sense of humor. Or maybe he got a desire to insert something extra in a genre movie?!With unceasing warm colors, so smooth editing and soothing, low tone, soundtracks, the movie's time managed to be anesthetic; like seeing everything through hued glass of many bottles of wines while being a bit drunk; which took a lot from the movie's supposed suspense.Despite the considerable halo of coolness around the actors, I knew pretty little data about all of their characters, with no moving matters. So I couldn't care less. You must notice that they don't make mistakes either; the problems are always around them, not inside of them, which's surely inhuman, read: boring thing to attract any attention. Plus there was no interplay between them, or anything like it. To tell you the truth, it pushed me at times to think that (Soderbergh) was intending to show us the bad affect of the contemporary modernism on the human's relationships. Sometimes they're like actors with so insignificant material to do while the stars' charm does the rest. And sometime I believed that the insignificant material was silly, and the stars' charm was lost, rather speechless, amongst it.It looks nice, but it doesn't feel the same, since there aren't that nice characters in the first place. I watched bunch of outwardly different replicants who work together for money. Well, at least the original movie, which many consider goofy in comparison, made them one band of friends who work for money, having some motives as well. Showing the whole gang scrutinizing their unspoken dreams while watching a dazzling fountain, celebrating silently their must-be-in-the-dark glory with Debussy's Clair de Lune playing in the background was well expressive moment, but nothing in the world can prevent me of convincing that it would've been more deep, emotional, and long-lived with an early glance over their actual dreams.Save the idea of the lover thief who wants to get his love back and ""hit"" his rich opponent, nothing was human. I sensed a human breath in only 2 scenes (Clooney reunites with Roberts for the first time after going out of jail, and the one where Damon and Mac were bluffing Garcia). In fact, the cuteness and cleverness in them looked not present in all the rest. There were places that beg a witty line or gag, but nothing was done. And even the real *funny* gags were whether too cold, or too American to be followed.For instance, in a second viewing, I discovered that every time we get to see (Pitt), he's having a snack. Is that funny? Maybe with other, real funny, situations it could've been smart touch. Because being as it is alone was poor, giving a feel that this cast was just enjoying a vacation in Vegas where they eat and hang out together while doing, and saying, nothing funny!With another cast that would've been way less interesting. However, while the stiff personality suits the character played by (Andy Garcia) to be that scary, it was unfortunate that most of the rest looked the same under the name of coolness!The absence of the A-list, star-studded, heist movie since the 60s's end and the 70s's start was part of the reason why this was a hit. Simply this kind was long-time missed. Plus I believe that its success opened the way during the whole 2000s for similar projects like The Italian Job (2003), Inside Man (2006), The Brothers Bloom (2008), let alone 2 (Ocean) sequels, to be made, returning the ""Hollywood"" heist to ""Hollywood"".For me, I enjoyed part of the scheme, the good image, and the nostalgic, high class, soundtrack, but none of the characters. And with this outcome, it isn't a very good or finely memorable movie. It's only a good one to pass the time with.Losing the interplay between the characters and their viewers is a calamity. So again, is it (Soderbergh)'s indifference? Is it just his dry fun? Or is it his own satire; where it becomes all about the score, taking the humanity out of its scorers as long as they do it right anyway? But even if that was the point; then this is the movie to display that, and to be an example for it in the same time too!P.S: (Brad Pitt)'s voice and persona were so recognizable as the SWAT team's leader in the walkie-talkie. I have no idea why to blow up the movie's biggest twist prematurely as easy as this?!",Ocean's Eleven

All the characters have a moment to shine and they have distinctive characteristics. But the real star is Soderbergh who injects a lot of style into the film, using screen swipes, split screens, disjointed timelines and expert camera movements to transition to different scenes. There was even a great scene of flashbacks, shot in the styles of the era. Ocean Eleven's is one of Soderbergh's more mainstream efforts and he made a witty, entertainment heist flick.

64,dfranzen70,Three casinos. A lot of security. Eleven guys. $150 million. No problem.,8,13 December 2001,"Thank goodness for popcorn movies. Okay, so this one doesn't completely qualify, as at certain moments during the film the brain is encouraged to wake up and breathe a little, but it's still an exciting escapist movie. The plot centers around a massive heist - three major casinos in Las Vegas, all robbed simultaneously. The ringleader is Danny Ocean (George Clooney), recently sprung from the big house. He has an ulterior motive for robbery (well, other than the $150 million); seems his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who left him while he was in stir, is now with the owner of the three casinos, Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), a suave, cool, egomaniac. He looks like he's been patterned after Steve Wynn, who owned (still does, probably) many casinos in the desert and who was always at odds with his eastern rival, Donald Trump.
So Danny's out, and he has a plan. Plans are always good. He first recruits old pal Dusty (Brad Pitt), who's busy teaching poker to nincompoop Hollywood actors. Dusty and Danny get together the rest of the gang, sprawled all over the country, including the Malloy brothers (Scott Caan and Casey Affleck); Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), a novice whose dad worked with Danny; Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner!); demolitionist Roscoe Means (Don Cheadle, sporting one heck of a cockney accent); Yen the acrobat (Shaobo Qin); Frank the blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac); and their financial backer, Ruben Tischkoff (Elliott Gould!). It's a game cast, and it looked like they all had a lot of fun making the movie. I was surprised to see old hands Reiner and Gould in this one, especially since so many Gen-X people are involved. Reiner's character is a lot like that of Lawrence Tierney in Reservoir Dogs, except that Sol's not in charge of anything (and, in fact, has to be coaxed out of retirement). And Gould looked to have put on about 70 pounds - whether that's padding or he put it on for the movie, I'll never know. The rest of the cast did a fine job. The best performances were by Pitt, Damon, and Clooney. But Julia Roberts - well, she had no chemistry with the man she was with (Garcia), none with the man she had been with before (Clooney), and none with the camera. In fact, she looked terrible in closeup, as if someone had strapped her down and injected her lips with about 10,000 cc's of collagen. I know she has full lips, but sheesh! Plus they were supercoated with this Mary Kay lipstick that only served to enhance the gaudy image.This takes the basic plot of the original 1960 movie (starring the Rat Pack, with Sinatra in the lead) and reworks it a little. It's more stylish, more elegant, more thrilling than the original, and how often can one say that?
But of course the real story's the caper. They have to bust into the vault, get this money - and it's in CASH, mind you - and walk out. No one's ever come close. This is a movie where you definitely have no problem rooting for the good guys. It's part robbery thriller, part Robin Hood, part Mission:Impossible. It's well-written, although it's not as multilayered a film as some of Steven Soderbergh's other movies, such as Traffic, Out of Sight (with Clooney), Erin Brockovich (with Roberts), or even sex, lies, and videotape. But it really is a blast.",Ocean's Eleven

66,meeza,Sure Gamble!,8,2 January 2002,"One of the slickest films of the year has to be `Ocean's Eleven.' Director Steven Soderbergh has remade this Rat Pack classic about a heist in Las Vegas with a golden nugget touch. It also contains some excalibur performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, and Don Cheadle. It also has made some booming business at the box office that has probably made some MGM executives grand with anger that they did not produce the film. Clooney plays Danny Ocean an expert thief who recruits 10 skilled crafty characters to rob 3 casinos in Las Vegas. The look of Las Vegas has never looked so `luxor'ious in a film until `Ocean's Eleven' that it deserves to be inserted in some type of stratospheric category.

The end result is a slick, mildly overproduced adventure that's smart and suave, though not quite so much as it seems to think it is. Much of the movie is blown on excessive, ""look what we can afford to do"" antics that are, admittedly, fun to watch but ultimately do little to endear the cast to their audience. Rather than a case of pillaging the rich to fill the coffers of the poor and desperate, this first installment of the Ocean's franchise feels more like a case of the filthy rich reaching into the cookie jars of the filthier. The heist genre loses a bit of its inherent suspense when a film's protagonists have access to a garage full of police paraphernalia, server racks spilling over with imaginary ""future tech"" computer equipment, Italian sports cars, cushy upper deck hotel rooms and access to all the blueprints they'll ever need. Clooney's charisma does buy him a degree of invulnerability to this phenomenon, which makes him an ideal centerpiece, but after the first viewing most of the team's close calls seem far too easily resolved.

There are so many characters in this film and they are all fantastic from George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts all of them are great and the chemistry that all the characters have is one of the best parts of the film.

It is just one of the many, many character beats that are presented along side the heist plot and while Ocean is undoubtedly the protagonist not enough time is given to develop either his marriage or the rivalry with Benedict.

Just think of the 2001 Ocean's Eleven as an ordinary action comedy, and you'll still have a great time.The screenplay has a vital role in this movie's success: the plot is expertly constructed, so that it will be captivating but not too complex, and Steven Soderbergh brings it to the screen with brilliance and elegance.But what really makes this film special is the cast: every single actor is absolutely comfortable with the various roles, and even though the focus is on some people (Clooney, Garcia, Roberts, plus Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), the other members of the ensemble (including Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould) have their chance to shine too. I was particularly impressed by Garcia's performance, which somehow reminded me of his unforgettable Godfather character (""Congratulations. You're a dead man."").Highly recommended. It won't annoy you for a second.8,5/10",Ocean's Eleven

This is a great crime caper flick which will have you guessing from start to finish! That is the main thing that I can say about OCEAN'S ELEVEN. If you ask me, the best things about this film were the lights and casinos of Las Vegas. Also, in my opinion, Danny (George Clooney) was a very smooth criminal. To me, Tess (Julia Roberts) was a very beautiful woman. My favorite outfit of hers was the gold dress she wore when she and Terry (Andy Garcia) went to the boxing match. Anyway, I thought that everyone involved did a good job, the cast was perfectly chosen, and the direction was excellent. Now, in conclusion, if you like George Clooney, Julia Roberts, or any of the key players, I highly recommend this excellent crime caper flick which will have you hooked from start to finish.",Ocean's Eleven

76,slokes,So Much Fun It Ought To Be A Crime,8,22 March 2012,"Watching George Clooney and Brad Pitt battle it out for smoothest cat in Vegas shouldn't be this much fun to watch. ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a smart, breezy caper comedy that glides along on enough wit and cool, jazzy energy to make you enjoy getting snookered by the pretty boys.Clooney is Danny Ocean, a con man who just lost four years and his wife to a term of confinement in the New Jersey penal system. Now he wants to get even, with interest. He plans a scam involving himself and ten confederates, including right-hand man Rusty (Pitt), targeting three of Las Vegas's richest casinos in a single evening for a nine-figure haul.Asked why, Danny shrugs and says it's because ""it's never been tried."" Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack would say otherwise, but this ""Ocean's"" is cooler, funnier, and more suspenseful than theirs. Normally I'd rather watch Frank and Dino than George and Brad, but the latter two made the better film.Ted Griffin's script and Steven Soderbergh's direction do a lot to sell you on a clever if shaky plot. When Danny asks his wife Tess (Julia Roberts) why she dumped him, she responds with a line that keys in on the way the picture operates: ""You've met too many people like you."" Danny, Rusty, and their merry criminal associates seem to communicate mostly through nods and one-liners, not wasting time explaining things.""I owe you for that thing with the guy in the place,"" is how one of the Eleven, money man Rueben (Elliott Gould), puts it to Danny. This in-the-know argot works for everyone else, too.A lot of movies try for the big ensemble cast, but this one finds the right balance between star power and character performances. My favorites: Andy Garcia as a standout bad guy and Carl Reiner as the oldest, most sympathetic member of the Eleven.While there's not a lot of depth, you hardly mind when what you see and hear gleams and purrs the way ""Ocean's Eleven"" does. ""Eleven"" is both a puzzle picture and a love letter to Vegas at the turn of the 21st century, with its dizzying array of gaudy monstrosities and gyrating dancing girls. The music is a frothy stew of Elvis, Perry Como, Berlin, and Debussy. It pulls you in, and keeps you from thinking too hard until long after the credits roll.Yet I find ""Ocean's Eleven"" more enjoyable on re-viewings. I say this despite the plot holes in the way things work out. Plot holes or not, ""Ocean's Eleven"" puts care into how it works. You get to actually enjoying how the film sets up its misdirection plays and basks in the impossible smoothness of the lead characters. And the dialogue is hilarious.**SPOILERS BELOW***** SPOILERS Everyone has noted one thing I missed, the stacks of flyers that magically appear inside the vault. But about Danny spending all that time being ""beaten up"" in that guarded room, especially when the lights go out? Aren't there too many witnesses to trace Danny and the others to the scam? And what about the mini-scam played on young Linus (Matt Damon), when he is told Danny has been taken out of the operation, only to be surprised when Danny greets him inside an elevator? Why pull that on your youngest, least experienced team member? Well, it was a fun reveal, and I guess that was the point. SPOILERS END ***",Ocean's Eleven

I think this film would have been better without the star studded cast. In my opinion, Julia Roberts should have been chucked for some other actress, simply because her role was so small and worthless. Nonetheless, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were superb. I also felt Scott Caan and Casey Affleck were a perfect match for the bickering Malloy brothers. I didn't like the fact Steven Soderbergh made a film as mainstream as this (considering his previous work in The Limey, Kafka and Traffic), but I guess he had to sell out eventually.

79,questl-18592,Ocean 11: A New Heist,6,3 May 2021,"I've never really been a fan of the Ocean's movies. To be fair, I don't know that I ever really gave them a shot either so seemed like time to rectify that, sit down and watch the trio and give them a fair shake.The result? These movies aren't for me. The cast is stacked and fun and that's really the saving grace of this movie because honestly the plot is just boring. We bounce around, watching them plan and execute the perfect heist and it should be fun but it's soooooo obvious at every turn. There's never the slightest moment of doubt, we always know that, no matter what happens they're going to succeed with minimal struggle or recompense.Also, it's pretty well discussed at this point but seriously? They do all that work, get all that stuff to do this and the payoff isn't anywhere near big enough to warrant it. If the movie veered into the territory of exploring Ocean's addiction to theft even at the cost of himself then that could be an interesting take but that's barely an afterthought.Still, this movie is harmless enough and makes for solid background noise. I just didn't find it capable of really holding my attention because there's no question as to what's going to happen, not even the slightest moment of suspense. Not every movie needs that but this one is so much polish and not enough substance that it could've used something more.",Ocean's Eleven

It also has a very handsome cast.The script is incredibly witty and the lines are delivered with skill and timing. I love that Brad is eating throughout the film, it's those little touches that make a film better than others.I do think they seemed to spend a lot of money just in the preparation of the plan- vans, suits, replica vaults, etc, but I suppose you have to spend to accumulate and I do like the genius of the plan, but I'm a little hazy as to how it all happened days before, but that doesn't spoil the adventure for me.I personally would have chosen someone other than Julia, I don't think she made a stand out performance or added anything really, but Brad caught my eye this time and George looked stunning in his DJ and bow tie. The classic characters of Benedict and Saul also play their parts well.It's a great edit of a fantastic story, with a good cast.",Ocean's Eleven
81,valleyjohn,They are having more fun than me,7,5 February 2021,"When i first watched Ocean's Eleven my overriding thought was that these guys are having more fun than me.
Twenty years later i decided to re-watch to see if my opinion had changed at all but no , They still were having more fun than me!
Dapper Danny Ocean is a man of action. Less than 24 hours into his parole from a New Jersey penitentiary, the wry, charismatic thief is already rolling out his next plan. Following three rules: Don't hurt anybody, don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it, and play the game like you've got nothing to lose. Danny orchestrates the most sophisticated, elaborate casino heist in history.I believe this film has a better reputation than it deserves.
Don't get me wrong , its mildly entertaining but for the most part it's very unremarkable.
The biggest problem i have is there is no jeopardy.
Terry Benedict , played by Andy Garcia is supposed to be this big time casino owner who you do not steal from but there is very little indication
that he is a menace or a gangster and the fact that they are having fun backs that up.Now to the elephant in the room. Don Cheadle.
Some people may find his accent hilarious and he may even be doing an English accent badly on purpose but think it's unforgivable. and lazy.
Surely they could afford an accent coach to at least make him sound slightly authentic.Ocean's Eleven is an example of style of over substance and the 1960's version is no different.

I really enjoyed ocean's eleven very much, even more then I thought I would. The movie features an absolutely amazing star studded cast and the movie is like a roller coaster, the plot steadily builds until by the end your freaking out waiting to see what happens.Definitely a great entertaining ride. I think the actors/actresses had a great time making this. In addition to being a really fun movie to watch one can almost feel how much fun the cast had being in it. It's really great to see a movie where the mood is so infectious and this is a movie one just gets swept into.If you haven't seen it be warned: the first 20 minutes or so is a bit draggy but that's just to build momentum, the movie more then compensates for that during the rest of the film. The movie Pulls the viewer into keeping eyes glued on it and stays Consistently engaging and on the edge of your seat exciting. I think everyone was great in this and this is one of those rare movies that has a rare energy where you really don't wanna BLINK less you miss something. This is also a movie one probably needs to see more then once.Ocean's eleven easily rates an 8.5, possibly higher.",Ocean's Eleven
83,Spleen,"It turns out Soderbergh IS an artist, after all",8,28 May 2002,"As in ""The Limey"" and ""Traffic"" Soderbergh will now and then (in the earlier films he did it all the time) use a visual gimmick that's pointless and ill-advised - like the useless, split-second split screen he introduces and then immediately drops during one casino sequence (why during THAT sequence, and not another?), or the jerky, stroboscopic motion of Danny and Linus running into one another on the train.  It's a pity.  Visually, ""The Limey"" and ""Traffic"" were ALL hollow gimmickry, which meant that no particular Jean-Luc Godard touch (like Godard, Soderbergh uses ""experimental"" devices as though he's trying to patent them) did much harm - but the photography in ""Ocean's Eleven"" is, at heart, simply wonderful: tinsel colours, beguiling bright lights, tight framing.It's not just the visuals.  Soderbergh's three previous films (the only other three I've seen) come across as mere exercises.  ""The Limey"" (the worst) appears to be a classroom assignment that accidentally saw the light of day; ""Erin Brokovich"" is a formulaic commercial exercise; ""Traffic"" is a propaganda exercise.  Soderbergh has said that in making ""Ocean's Eleven"" he wanted to make a purely entertaining film, and the way he said made me think that he viewed it, too, as just another exercise, but it entertains so well and with such intelligence and grace that the artistry must be regarded as real.There's so much that's right that could not have been got right simply by accident.  The thieves are all civilised: the co-operate, and when they disagree, they disagree in a civilised fashion.  So many other directors would have made the tensions between them the point and driving force of the film - to give the film ""depth"", perhaps.  But Soderbergh realises that it's eleven versus the casinos, and that factional warfare would neither complicate, nor deepen, nor enliven the picture.  These thieves really are cool and intelligent.  When Danny meets his ex-wife, he admits that his advice on her love life is neither disinterested nor unbiased, and then adds, ""...but that doesn't mean that I'm wrong.""  He simply SAYS this, and Tess actually digests the comment and admits its force without being one over by it, and my God, can it be, is this an actual CONVERSATION taking place on screen?  Scenes that other films would have played up as contests or clashes of passion, this one milks for their value as dialectic.  It's almost a first.  THAT'S why the dialogue (which by and large isn't, alas, as clever as it should be) sparkles.And the heist itself is pleasingly clever.  It's a charming film.Spoiler ahead!Yet, as I said, the remaining flaws somehow gnawed at me.  The ending in particular.  Danny and Tess shouldn't have got back together - reaching an amicable understanding would have been better for both them and the audience.  And we shouldn't have seen them being tailed without, at the very least, being told whether or not they knew they were being tailed.  Trust Soderbergh to make two opposing mistakes at once: weakening the intelligence of the ending for the sake of sweetness, without actually making the ending any sweeter; then taking away the sweetness for the sake (I presume) of logic, without making the ending any more intelligent.",Ocean's Eleven

However, the first OCEAN'S ELEVEN wasn't exactly CASABLANCA or CITIZEN KANE. Steven Soderbergh assembles a spectacular cast -- which I don't need to mention since practically everyone who's seen the film knows it will have Soderbergh s usual suspects and some new ones -- but if there is an ultimate star in this, OCEAN'S ELEVEN, it is he. Every shot, every scene, the very construction of the heists that Danny Ocean's pack of sophisticated thieves execute, along with cracking dialog and vintage music creates not only a sizzling reconstruction: it transcends its genres limitations, and it flows elegantly with Soderberghs inimitable stamp, and that is film-making at its best -- the art of creating cinematic jazz.",Ocean's Eleven
86,Kamurai25,"""Hungry Baker's Dozen""",7,30 August 2020,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.As far as heist movies go, it's excellent, but I think I'm very picky when it comes to heist movies. In order to get me behind the criminal protagonist, it needs to be overly complex, but not complicated, and there needs to be an alternative motive, such as ""get the girl"".This entire franchise does a decent job of this, keeping the motives and implementations interesting. Part of the problem with that is that because of how complex the heist is, have the movie is an explanation of how the heist is going to happen (with JUST enough information left out for misdirects), then there is the actual heist, with some misdirects, and an explanation of the gaps, if not the heist itself, then a resolution.That's the formula for every heist movie ever, which is part of what makes it boring. It has to be special to really grab a audience and make it memorable.This movie does all this with a great cast, and certainly enough production value. While it is certainly really interesting and entertaining, I can't really say its a great movie. We can chalk it up as personal bias, but I do think everyone should see this version as it has some historical value and is well worth the watch.",Ocean's Eleven

88,brando647,Cool Cast + Complex Heist = Fun Flick,8,4 December 2007,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never gets old. Steven Soderbergh has remade a classic and updated the style for the twentieth century. The movie centers on freshly-paroled Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his plot to rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night. The movie grabbed me at the first scene and I was entertained until the end. The two components that make this movie what it is are the spectacular cast and the intricate heist plan.For a movie with thirteen characters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffin did a great job of giving each enough screen-time and personality to make them each interesting. Clooney and Brad Pitt are charismatic as usual in their roles as the heist's ringleader and primary accomplice. Andy Garcia is cold and calculating as the owner of the targeted casinos. Though, some of the best performances come out of the supporting cast. A lot of the movie's best scenes feature Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Elliot Gould. Julia Roberts is a bit under-used in her role as Tess, Danny's ex-wife, but makes for a pleasant distraction. Playing just as large a role as any person in this film is the setting, Las Vegas. We are treated to great visuals of Vegas and it gives the movie a grander, flashier vibe.The heist in this movie is definitely complex, and there are still parts I'm not too clear on. I also felt that they got a little too high-tech during the vault break-in (i.e. the little ""knock-out"" disc and the getaway van). Other than a couple hiccups, the heist was fun to watch build up and come to fruition. Soderbergh did a great job revealing little details throughout that seem insignificant until you see the end result.Steven Soderbergh's remake of a classic caper makes a great popcorn flick. It's got sharp humor, great performances, and an intelligent design that almost makes you think, ""That just might work..."". There may be a couple plot holes but that never slows the movie down. So, check this out if you haven't already...and keep an eye out for the cocktail waitress that gets clothes-lined during the chaos. It's probably one of the funniest images in the whole thing.",Ocean's Eleven

Soderbergh made this brilliant masterpiece back in 2001, and even now this movie is watched with a real pleasure, as it goes on with a gusto, excellent tempo, mesmerizing music and impeccable sense of humor. This is a remake that is way better than its Frank Sinatra original. Here, the shining cast of excellent stars make this film a real treat and a real chef-d'ouevre to digest at any time. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, among many, made this film such a tremendous trip. The soundtrack is a huge winner, too, with all that cool jazz, dance tunes, Presley's hits and lounge tracks, adding much to the seemingly nonchalant and brisk beat of the movie.

The plot including the hold-up planning, is not very detailed to avoid holes, feeble points and illogical situations. But its execution is made with clockwork precision. The first part of the movie is a bit tedious with the narration of the plan for the hold-up and its preparation but the second part has a lot of suspense and reserves several good surprises to the viewer including the end. The acting is excellent and serves the plot very well. And last but not least there is a moving romantic touch concerning the relationship between the chief crook and his ex-wife now dating the owner of the held-up casino.

93,MartianOctocretr5,Not fun enough as a comedy; not properly constructed to be drama,5,5 June 2010,"So-so redo of the classic rat-pack comedy/adventure made 40 years earlier. Although the movie has its moments, it lacks the heart and humor of the original, while taking itself way too seriously.An all-star cast, but several people in the cast are relegated to two minutes of screen time, a waste for this calibre of talent. The people we do see most often are George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. Of these, Pitt and Damon fare best with the crime suspense approach the film takes. Clooney's character is written as the kind of failure in life type that could never devise and certainly not pull off a major caper like this. If the movie had shot for comedy, that would be OK. But it's not; it burdens itself with an absurd side plot of the casino crime boss, Roberts, and Clooney being in an old love triangle. And of course, Clooney is after revenge. Come on. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but accepting that theme requires suspension of sanity. Julia Roberts, by the way, plays her unlikely character's situation way too straight. She's so low-key, she looks like she's asleep half the time. As for Clooney, his mugging wears thin after a while.The way the casino security is depicted is ridiculous; again this would have been OK in a comedy. There's never more than about five or six of these brain-dead glorified bouncers running around; none of these inept fools could even catch his own Siamese twin. The state of the art high tech systems used in Vegas, according to this movie, couldn't prevent a blind man from wandering into a casino vault.On the positive side, it still manages some brainless popcorn level entertainment. On that basis, it's about an average quality movie.",Ocean's Eleven

I am just so amazed at how he manages to carry the entire cast if not the movie.  There are many great scenes of the Vegas Casinos.  The only thing one must remember is that it's just a movie.  There is no way somebody could break into the Bellagio (trust me on this one).  That place is very secure.  The movie delves deep into the constructs of it.  Andy Garcia plays his boss character superb!  He was the 2nd highlight next to Clooney.  Brad Pitt delivers the goods as well.  Then again, he always does when it comes to being the ""cool crook"".  I rate this one VERY high!",Ocean's Eleven
95,Howlin Wolf,Ocean's eleven are an entertaining bunch... (DEFINITELY SPOILAGE... ),9,22 February 2002,"... as, for that matter, are guys like Elliot Gould's decadent mentor and Andy Garcia's ruthless casino boss. Every (male) member of the cast comes together to contribute tellingly to a very entertaining movie. Okay, there are flaws; Don Cheadle's Cockney accent is needless and inconsistent, and the character of Tess Ocean takes a backseat to the boys schemes, but these minor quibbles don't prevent enjoyment in watching an audacious job so slickly executed. For both the central conceit and the movie itself could have proved to be nothing more than a daring folly committed by people with ideas above their station. Thankfully, in both cases everything goes off without a hitch, and the result is a fun watch.There is little to be said about the two considered 'leads' of the movie.Both Clooney and Pitt are rarely dull in their on screen endeavours, and this is no exception, it's just that the effect is doubled by having both in the cast at once. Matt Damon is great to watch in a different role from his often brash characters. Cheadle is OK, but if anything is the weak link in the team (he is definitely not helped by his odd patois.) It is nice to see Roberts here, but did she really need to be in this? I don't think so. Her presence only clutters up an already complicated roster and is ultimately an unnecessary distraction to both lead characters and audience.Garcia shows just what a class act he is, and Reiner is nothing less than amazing in such exalted company. Director Soderbergh makes control of the film look like second nature, which probably means that every single shot was painstaking and laborious. Even though I personally was one of the few who failed to be charmed by ""Out of Sight"", it was clear from watching THAT effort that the helmer was enormously talented. With films such as ""Erin Brockovitch"" and now ""Ocean's 11"", he adds yet more credence to that theory.At times the film almost becomes TOO cool. This at first seems like an absurd criticism to level at the film, but the brains behind the operation are so self assured and confident that they will succeed, there is never any doubt about the outcome. ""This is Hollywood"", you cry, ""and therefore it is obvious they will win in the end"". That may be so, but most movies make concessions to dramatic tension, this one doesn't really bother.This is best illustrated by Clooney/Ocean's capitulation towards the end.The character gets caught for very specific reasons that are revealed before the film draws to a close, and it is made obvious that this needn't have happened unless it was planned by the crook, since the other 10 get away scott free. It is this cheeky jab in the face of authority that makes you feel like nothing could go wrong for the gang, except if they wanted it to; and it doesn't.This development also brings up the only other minor flaw that I can think of. I am prepared to accept the notion that Ocean (oops, poet and don't know it!) is willing to endure prison in order to win back his 'lost love', and I can even understand why Tess leaves Benedict after seeing him prepared to ditch her for his money. Why, however, does Tess not being with Benedict suddenly in one swoop resolve all her differences with Ocean? Why? Because this is Hollywood, that's why; and it's a plot element that needed a little more attention in order to be convincing, but because it is so near the end, this problem gets neglected in the rush to conclude.I've only mentioned two major flaws, and it's a stretch to even ATTEMPT to come up with any more, because by and large the job done is so professional. The cast and crew obviously put a lot of effort, craft and fun into making this, so you should reward them for their efforts by checking it out. See it.",Ocean's Eleven
96,dunmore_ego,"Whatchoo talking bout, Cheadle?",5,30 December 2003,"As the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (and every other provincial, back-slapping institution for the purveyance of ""arts"") quite often does, another faux-prestigious award needs to be invented for the sole purpose of giving it to just one guy: The Most Embarrassing Fake British Accent Of All Time  awarded to Don Cheadle in ""Ocean's Eleven"". Surpassing even Keanu's Idiot-British in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" or ""Much Ado About Nothing"", ""inauthentic"" would be a compliment to Cheadle's uneducated abomination of the mother tongue. Cheadle played Sammy Davis Jnr. in the TV movie ""The Rat Pack""  a role which called for the most talented actor of The Pack, as he had to mime not only singing, but tap-dancing, trumpet-playing and six-gunning, so it is with great concern that we view this exemplary actor's abject ignorance and lack of perception of one particular inflective tongue, based on his own spoken language! (Well, actually, *preceding* his spoken language, but this ain't the forum for resolving etymological beefs.)Still, casting Cheadle as a warbling limey was only nominally more sensible than casting the shovel-mouthed Julia Roberts as a ""beautiful woman"". And as casting choices go, this movie was at a disadvantage from the outset with the impossible task of filling the shoes of one Francis Albert Sinatra. In a role which Frank insouciantly tossed off as a lark (which cast all the more sheen on it for its rebellious bent), head-waggling George Clooney steps up as Danny Ocean. And fails.With ""Ocean's Eleven"", as with ""Robin and the Seven Hoods"", or ""Jailhouse Rock"", or ""Every Which Way But Loose"", we're not so much dealing with ""movies"" as we are with ""movie STARS"". (In sooth, this 2001 ""Ocean's Eleven"" observes that tradition with the wealth of wasted talent deployed in it.) Re-making films such as these will not capture the consecrated quality afforded the originals by the passage of time and the involvement of their particular god-status icons. It is merely a fiscal exercise, involving brand-name recognition (buy the original rights and wretchedly sully the nostalgia), curiosity quotient (we'll get the Frank & Dino fans into the theater at least *once*), next-generation retro hipness (""I'm so kewl cos I like the ""classics""), crossover marketing (with this ensemble, we're *bound* to get *someone* through the turnstiles) and providing A-List actors with work to keep them off reality shows. The premise to heist major casinos in Las Vegas is the only tie with the original ""Eleven"", as this remake's storyline had to be noticeably updated to cater to the state of advances in hi-tech security, the writers sensibly eschewing re-creating The Rat Pack's lo-tech heist note for note.Of the heist gang, Brad Pitt is Clooney's ""Dino""; Matt Damon meanders one- dimensionally, Bernie Mac does his ""black thing""; Cheadle does his ""cockney(?) thing""; excepting Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner, the remainder of the Eleven are populated by ""passengers"", including Ben Affleck's brother and James Caan's son gaily taking on half-dimensional roles.Maybe it's just admiring that previous generation's devil-may-care tilt at Life (or at least, the *media's* reporting of it) that gives the 1960 ""Eleven"" more of a rose-colored flare than all the gadgetry and gags this remake offers as collateral. Though there are attempts at capturing the magic and camaraderie of the original (Clooney's best line to Pitt, ""Ted Nugent called  he wants his shirt back""), this movie's redemption is in its slick production value  it may ring hollow as a buddy-piece, but it is truly a guilty ocular pleasure, highly watchable for its appealing camera-work, lighting and set design. Inadvertently turning this piece into a *nolo contendre* flame-fest, I might as well fire home the last barb in stating that the original ""Eleven"" packs a hilarious, if not frustrating, twist ending - unequivocally a more substantial wallop than the anchor that this remake is built on: the interpersonal fizzle of George & Julia's latent love. Let's face it, an action-comedy movie with an ending where Nothing Happens leaves us holding the proverbial injured aquatic bird (i.e. lame duck). With this ensemble, one would expect roiling acting chops flung at the viewer like raw meat to lions, but the only players who consistently chew their roles delectably are Andy Garcia (as the casino owner heistee), Gould and Reiner. Everyone else is flailing for substance, including Pitt and Clooney who only have a few good moments together; the rest of the time, they're just being Brad Pitt and George Clooney, vying for enough screen time to try to top each other for one of those provincial, back-slapping, faux-prestigious awards that already exists: People Magazine's World's Sexiest Man.My vote is for Frank Sinatra.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Ocean's Eleven

98,Sirus_the_Virus,A great film.,9,9 August 2009,"I truly do love 2001's somewhat remake to Ocean's eleven. Ocean's eleven is directed by Steven Sodeburgh(Out of Sight, Che)and I can see how. Sodeburgh is a good director, and he directed the whole trilogy. The film has a great cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Bernie Mac, and others. Just to name a few. The film has a great heist also. These people are way too smart for me. I never could've thought of a heist plan like the one Danny Ocean's group came up with. The heist is brilliant in this film, and it's pretty surprising. Ocean's eleven is great, fun entertainment.The Plot: When Danny Ocean is released from prison, he hires ten people to rob from Terry Benedict, who owns The Belagio, and The MGM Grand. Danny also finds out that his ex wife Tess is engaged to Bennedict. So the gang isn't sure whether Danny is trying to rob this guy because of his wife or not.",Ocean's Eleven

The cast are perfect, they provide great performances and make the audience laugh and hold you on the edge when attempting to rob the place.Clooney seems to be playing himself in this movie which is perfectly fine, while Pitt takes on the role of a comedian and delivers.One for the collection.",Ocean's Eleven

The cast is absolutely top-notch and works in great ensemble fashion, the plot is exciting if a little far-fetched, and the direction is excellent.  The quietly macho interplay between Cooney and Pitt is particularly good; the script in general is often memorable with few awkward lines.

The 7.5 rating it does get is rather silly.  Basically means alot of people are giving it a ten.  Which it doesn't deserve.  Sure the star power is excellent, but there isn't alot of back story on it.  Just before the robbery the story almost falls off the earth.  It's like it was okay for awhile and then it got really weak and boom  kewl.  And it also has a confusing ending.Then of course you've got that nimrod Julia Roberts who doesn't act.  She's only been good in one movie (Michael Collins)  This girl doesn't have any raw talent.  She basically goes thru the motions.  I've tried really hard to give here the benefit of the doubt here, but really... after watching The Mexican  (her worst acting so far) I see little improvement. 
SPOILER??   She has a hint of a chance up in the bedroom watching her boyfriend on the tv, but that's just about it.  Pretty bad casting there.  Everyone else is pretty good.  Although for the most part Matt Damon is wandering about without a lead.So if your looking for a good picture... this could be it.

104,mattymatt4ever,Didn't do it for me,5,16 December 2001,"I haven't seen the original ""Ocean's 11,"" and I tried to find it at my local video store, but I couldn't.  However, so far many people who I've heard from who did see the original think that the remake is much better.  And as Richard Roeper said, ""The original 'Ocean's 11' was more popular because of what happened behind the camera than what happened on camera.""  Rarely, do I see a remake that people appraise much more than the original.  I have an English teacher who cringed when she found out they were remaking ""Great Expectations"" with Gwyneth Paltrow and Ethan Hawke.  Not because of the actors, but because they were remaking such a great story.  I like the Rat Pack, both as actors and singers, so I'm still curious about the 1960's version--no matter how campy they say it is.All I know is I don't think too highly of this remake.  It's not bad, but it's dull.  And I usually like Stephen Soderbergh's work.  I still say his low-budget sleeper ""sex, lies and videotape"" is his best work up-to-date. ""Traffic"" is his second best, ""Out of Sight"" is his third and ""Erin Brockovich"" is his fourth.  I haven't seen ""The Limey,"" but I've heard good things about it, so I'll probably get around to seeing it soon.  But so far, I would place ""Ocean's 11"" on the bottom of the list.
One of Soderbergh's talents is bringing out the richness of his characters. The problem this time around is there are too many damn characters!  Some of them just seem thrown in for the hell of it--or better yet, so the movie can be called ""Ocean's 11"" as opposed to ""Ocean's 8.""  Bernie Mac seems useless, his only purpose being to serve as the ""black guy"" in the group and blurt out a few ""puttin' da black man down"" jokes.  Scott Caan and Casey Affleck, as the constantly-brawling twin brothers, really seem useless.  Their annoying characters serve no purpose whatsoever--other than to help fill the running time of two hours and fifteen minutes.  I usually like Brad Pitt, but in this movie he looks as if he's in a coma--he probably knows how the audience feels.  Don Cheadle is fairly amusing, and I thought his British accent was convincing--and I'm a stickler for accents.  George Clooney is smooth and charismatic, like always, and so is Julia Roberts--though she only appears on screen for about ten minutes.  I really wish their relationship subplot could've been developed more.  There is a great scene of dialogue where they first meet in a restaurant, after years of separation.  The dialogue is delivered with great timing--in the spirit of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in ""His Girl Friday.""  But the relationship is trivialized to Hollywood fluff.  Roberts is going out with Andy Garcia, who's rich and powerful, but they never establish any sort of chemistry. So it comes as no surprise that she's going to break up with him and run off with Clooney.  But why was she going with Andy in the first place???  No one knows.  It's part of a stupid, meaningless formula.Because of the abundance of characters, they're reduced to caricatures.  I just got finished watching ""Out of Sight"" and it's interesting how these two movies contradict each other.  In that movie, I was deeply engaged because of the development of the colorful characters.  In this movie, I was dozing off because of the lack of character development.The story is scant, and the whole movie basically revolves around the planning of the heist.  Thin characters and thin story?  It's not my fault I couldn't get into the film, occasionally dozing off.  In my film class, my professor made a good point:  ""A good film director doesn't waste a single bit of footage.""  Soderbergh is generally a good director, who doesn't waste footage, but he struck out this time.  Can anyone explain why we needed that stupid card game with all the teen stars from the WB?  That's right, you heard me right.  Brad Pitt playing cards with Topher Grace, Holly Marie Combs, Barry Watson, Shane West and rest of those young studs who grace the covers of ""Teen People.""  Serves a purpose?  I think not.  OK, so this movie doesn't take itself seriously, but the humor falls flat.  Some good laughs would've helped me overlook the film's shortcomings, but even the great Carl Reiner didn't deliver any laughs.  Hey, what can ya do?
My score:  5 (out of 10)",Ocean's Eleven
105,classicalsteve,"Not Just a Dingy Vegas Nightclub Act--Much Better than the Original Rat Pack's 1960 Version, and the Best of the Three Movies",9,11 June 2008,"For some reason, I never tire of seeing this film. It's not an academy-award winner, it doesn't make a statement about the human condition, and it certainly doesn't reference anything remotely truthful about real Vegas casinos. What it does do is simply entertain at a first-rate level for roughly two hours. And it's 100 times better than the original offering from 1960.In 1960, several of Hollywood's biggest name talent, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, turned up in Las Vegas to shoot a movie called ""Ocean's Eleven"". They shot the film by day and played the Vegas strip by night. These live acts proved so popular that the group returned to Vegas many times for years after the sets of the film were torn down and the production moved back to Hollywood. The film was about a Vegas heist by some amateur gamblers, but the live act, made up of the legendary ""Rat Pack"", became ever-associated with Vegas. However, the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" does not share the status of the Rat Pack's live offerings of the 1960's. Apparently, while shooting, Frank Sinatra refused to do multiple takes in many scenes as if he was bored with the project, and consequently the final cut of the movie suffered immensely.Fast-forward 40 years. Stephen Soderbergh, on the heels of ""Traffic"", was given a large budget to remake ""Ocean's Eleven"". The cast is a host of current Hollywood notables, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Julia Roberts, and George Clooney as Danny Ocean, the character played by Sinatra. Strangely, the original 1960 production seems like a low-budget bad Vegas show when compared to the 2001 version. Not only is the more recent production much slicker and more finely tuned, the acting and the plot are far more compelling. Sort of like comparing the Flamingo Hotel to the Bellagio or the Venetian Room. There's no comparison.The plot itself is simple enough: Danny Ocean and eleven brilliant but shady characters attempt to enact a heist on one of the major casinos in Vegas. Add to the stew, Tess, played by Julia Roberts, who was previous Ocean's wife but is now hooked with the casino's head-honcho, Terry Benedict, played with mostly cool detachment by Andy Garcia. This is not akin to robbing the Sands Casino when the strip was made up of these little 6-floor casinos where you could get a room for less than 10 bucks. The new version is like trying to rob the MGM Grand where billions of dollars enter the casino every year. The ultimate outcome is an outstanding textbook example of misdirection that is well worth a DVD purchase. It seems unusual today that there are few productions that are both as well-produced AND well-written. Unfortunately, the subsequent sequels do not measure up nearly as well.",Ocean's Eleven
106,jhclues,"Entertainment with A Capital ""E""",9,7 December 2001,"Call it improbable, or even a highly imaginative flight of fancy; either/and/or, all of the above are correct.  But whatever you choose to call it, this is one of the sleekest and slickest caper movies you're ever likely to run across, and what you're really going to end up calling it is pure Entertainment (yes, with a capital `E').  Incomparable escapist fare, impeccably crafted and delivered by director Steven Soderbergh and a dynamite cast, `Ocean's Eleven' is a joy ride that gives you a chance to root for the bad guys and feel wickedly good while you're doing it. Because, after all, what's so bad about a bunch of regular guys ripping off a bazillionaire casino owner, who in the first place isn't such a great guy himself?  Remember, the key word here is `escapist'; don't worry about moralizing while you're watching this one, because a movie like this is made to let you to live vicariously for a couple of hours, so just sit back, relax and go with the flow.  Just remember:  These are professionals; don't try this at home.	When Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison, he doesn't waste any time.  Taking a rather indirect route after leaving the place he's called home for some time, he winds up in Las Vegas where he quite simply plans to rob three casinos owned by one Harry Benedict (Andy Garcia), an extremely meticulous businessman, who is also-- if his reputation serves correctly-- an extremely ruthless individual.  He's not a guy you want to mess with.  So why does Ocean want to pick on Benedict, who has the means and the muscle to crush him like a bug with a mere nod of his head?  Suffice to say it has something to do with a personal agenda, as well as the possibility of a paycheck worth around $160 million, which-- even after splitting with the ten other guys he's about to recruit for the job-- will land him a share that won't be too bad for a day's work.  And, of course, there's the challenge; Danny Ocean and his buddies are about to attempt the impossible.  What he is proposing is something that has never before been accomplished, a gamble with nearly insurmountable odds; but, hey, this is Vegas-- and that's what it's all about.	To be sure, Soderbergh had the deck stacked in his favor right out of the chute with the cast he assembled for this film; but like any self-respecting odds-makers in Vegas will tell you, nothing is a sure thing.  Soderbergh still had to mix all the ingredients just right-- cast, story, photography, music, action, humor-- to make it cook.  Well, he may not get the Oscar for Best Director for it, but if there's a Golden Chef's Hat Award, he's a shoo-in for preparing this feast.  This is a veritable smorgasbord for the senses; it's easy on the eyes, it'll give you some laughs and make you feel good, it's easy to digest and in the end is a totally satisfying experience. There may not be anything ground breaking about this movie, and certainly nothing especially new, but Soderbergh presents it with nuance and finesse, as well as that special artistic touch of his that is so definitive of his work.  Neither was a haystack anything new in Monet's day when he chose it as a subject for one of his paintings, and the rest is history.  It's how the artist renders the subject on canvas that's important, and it is in this that Soderbergh excels.  	As Danny Ocean, George Clooney demonstrates that he has the charm of Grant, the magnetism of a young Brando and the down-home agreeableness of Jimmy Stewart.  With his personality alone, he defines Ocean in no uncertain terms.  From the opening frame you know exactly who this guy is.  Still, there are a few surprises along the way that keeps him interesting.  Mostly though, he's just enjoyable to watch as he puts his plan into action, and it's easy to believe he's who he is and doing what he's doing.  And that's part of the charm of this movie and, moreover, goes to show you what a good performance Clooney actually gives here.  Unlikely as the story may be, he sells it in such a way that it works; and as the customer, you not only buy it, but walk away with the extended warranty and go home satisfied.  And that's a good bit of acting in anyone's book.	And though Clooney is clearly the star of the show, Brad Pitt checks in as Ocean's friend, Rusty Ryan, and emerges on fairly equal footing with his illustrious co-star.  Like Clooney, Pitt turns on the charm and serves up Rusty as a credible enough figure, with a performance that may not be much of a stretch for him, but one that is certainly engaging.  The character is lacking somewhat in depth and definition, but Pitt manages to give you a clear idea of who Rusty is without too much by way of development.  Call it a fast-food characterization; nevertheless, Pitt does a good job, and for all intents and purposes, he makes the character work. 
	The single question mark in the casting may be with Julia Roberts as Tess, Ocean's estranged wife.  She looks good and gives a solid, if not memorable performance, but she seems to miss the mark slightly in capturing the true essence of the character, which may have been better served by someone like Catherine Zeta-Jones or even Rene Russo.  But that's a purely subjective observation, and I'm sure there are those who will argue that Roberts was perfect for the role.  In either case, Tess is an integral part of the story, and Roberts neither enhances nor distracts from the overall proceedings; most importantly, she does make Tess believable.  And in the end, with a terrific supporting cast (too lengthy to mention here), `Ocean's Eleven' is one you don't want to miss.  9/10.",Ocean's Eleven
107,educallejero,A perfect heist movie,10,9 June 2020,"At plain sight, is a pretty standard heist movie. A couple of leaders that wants to do the heist, the recruitment of the people needed with their special abilities, establishing the heist for the spectator and the action.But what's different here is how perfect everything is. The cast is insane, because it's not just about being good actors with these type of movies. You need certain glamour, flair, that can give flavour to the often rigid story related to the heist itself and the required details for it to work and matter. That space given to the actors to spice up the needed exposition is the key to separate themselves from the mediocre ones. The editing and score are important to make the exposition as dynamic as possible too. Finally, the action in the third act has to create tension and surprises related to the original plan, and in this one, is created with perfect timing and subtlety.

111,jon.h.ochiai,Ocean's Cool,9,21 December 2001,"Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" epitomizes cool with a classy ensemble cast, sharp dialog, romance, and robbery. Leading the pack is George Clooney as Danny Ocean who as the movie begins is just released from prison. Being the reformed man that he is, Ocean quickly devises a scheme to rob the 3 biggest casinos in Las Vegas-- the Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and the Mirage.All of them are owned by Terry Benedict played with icy ruthlessness by Andy Garcia. Also Terry is now with Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife. Danny seeks out his point man, gambler, Rusty Ryan (Brad Piit). Rusty and Danny get a financier and begin assembling Ocean's 11. It soon becomes evident to Rusty (Pitt): Is this about the $160 million or Tess? If it were only about the money, ""Ocean's Eleven"" would be an exercise. It is not. George Clooney is a movie star. His Danny Ocean is slick, smart, and a charmer with an underlying substance-- he's a romantic. Brad Pitt is also at his best as Rusty. Pitt exudes the charisma and cool, and he is also very funny. There is hilarious running gag where Pitt is eating something in almost every scene. Clooney and Pitt together nail the crisp and very lean dialog. Julia Roberts is particularly sullen here which is called for in the role, surprisingly out of character for her. The great supporting cast includes Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner, who all have their moments to shine. Soderbergh orchestrates the movie cohesively with great style. I saw a Barbara Walters interview with the cast of ""Oceans Eleven"" where Clooney said that Steven was not making a statement movie with ""Ocean's"". He is correct.

The story is a very tricky one in the sense there are many things the director does not want the viewer to know, until it makes sense. However Soderbergh fails to create real thrills and tension in the viewer, although he has several aces up his sleeve. As beautiful as the film is shot it is at times too long. I bet the excellent cast (by reputation) had a wonderful time as so much great actors were combined in one film. It is not that I did not enjoy this film, but rather that it leaves a very odd taste in my nervous system. This is a film without much suspense, many thrills, laughs or anything above normal rate and despite some flaws still manages to entertain. It just has a certain something I cannot really name, although I suspect what it is. It is the fact that the job is pulled by decent criminals, led by the most decent, gentleman - like villain there ever was in film history, George Clooney. The fact that he is around gives this film extra charm that makes it worth seeing. George Clooney puts in that certain something.

113,fernandoschiavi,"Presented in a totally different guise from the 1960 classic, the film overflows charisma on the part of its cast, which makes many consider it better than the original film",8,16 January 2021,"One of the most revered films of the 60s, Ocean's Eleven (1960) was an epoch, mainly due to the team of stars it managed to gather. In the direction, Lewis Milestone (1895-1980), consecrated with the classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", of 1930. In the cast, the members of the group Rat Pack, the friends Frank Sinatra (1915-1998), Dean Martin (1917- 1995) and Sammy Davis Jr. (1925-1990), simply the greatest stars of the time. And even though the work is not so widely accepted by the public and critics, it is still essential for the subgenre of assault films.For a new version, it would be complicated to assemble a team of stars like that - without making production unfeasible in the face of millionaire fees. For the heartthrob George Clooney had a crazy idea, worthy of Daniel Ocean, the leading character of the gang of gangsters. Partner of director Steven Soderbergh at producer Section Eight, Clooney joined the project with an innovative solution. He would give up his millionaire salary and convince other big stars to do the same, to act for a symbolic amount. Thus, Ocean's Eleven, the 2001 adaptation, was born victorious. In the direction, the label Soderbergh, a great Oscar 2001 champion with Traffic and Erin Brockovich, would guarantee the quality and repercussion of the film. When it came to casting, Clooney's plan was already starting to work. Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle and Julia Roberts complete the list.In the plot, Ocean's Eleven, led by Ocean (Clooney, of course), plan to loot the three largest casinos in Las Vegas in a single night. Supported by eccentric businessman Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the Bellagio, Mirage and MGM Grand have the most complete and complex security system in the world. Only a team of specialists could carry out the theft. Well then. Rusty Ryan (Pitt) abandons ""poker lessons for promising Hollywood stars"" in order to help friend Daniel Ocean. Thief Linus Caldwell (Damon) also joins the team. Basher Tarr (Cheadle), an explosives expert, adds to the list, which still has two drivers brothers, a gambling entrepreneur, a master of disguises, a hacker, a fake dealer and even a Chinese acrobat.Steven Soderbergh, who had won recognition with Traffic (2000), establishes an interesting visual identity for his work, opting for different angles and camera movements that bring a special charm to the narrative. The director delivers great dynamics with transitions, close-ups and quick camera openings, with panoramas within the environments and the frames have become a franchise's trademark. The work establishes a third person view that makes it look like the viewer is present in the action, sometimes with a camera on top of a car, sometimes with a fixed camera in a restaurant, in a casino, and so on. Not to mention the beautiful aerial plans of Las Vegas, which help to build the necessary ambience for the film.Another highlight is also the great photography, incidentally also commanded by Soderbergh: the Las Vegas of 2001, in a first arrangement by Soderbergh, is more dynamic, unlike the original work. From external to light stripping, the remake of Ocean's Eleven gains momentum when resting its fluidity in a skillful edition. Responsible for a photograph that prioritizes Vegas night and the warm colors of the casinos, Soderbergh provides the ideal mold for the style of the narrative - and here, everything rests on the style - to gain prominence. It is no exaggeration to say that the film breathes the largest city in Nevada. The use of colors is also extremely important, allowing the public to notice the difference between scenarios. For example, the more diffused and peer-reviewed lighting in the red, brown and gold tones of the casinos contradicts the backstage of the same scenario, whose warm palette gives way to the technological coolness of blue, white and gray.It is clear that a surprising narrative and full of twists like this could not support itself. It is not surprising, therefore, that Soderbergh creates an adorably thought-provoking image composition that plays with the scenic anachronism, placing several chronologies that converge on their own climax that is based on comedy, drama and police. In this way, the director makes countless explanatory advances to Danny and Rusty's plan - an enlightening method that would even be repeated by several works of the genre and that would definitely mark an era.The big difference between the original version and the new version is that each member of the group has a specific talent that will be explored throughout the film, instead of everyone being on an equal footing, so to speak. And at this point the script gets it right by focusing less on the action in the assault action, and more on developing the personalities of each one. Whether by a smile, a silence, a sigh or a look, each of the Ocean's Eleven is presented with a minimum of background and personality. It is clear that Matt Damon gains more space than Shaobo Qin. The surgical delivery of lines, however, goes through all the actors. It is they who subtly dictate the difference between Pitt's and Clooney's cynicism, the longing for Bernie Mac and Cheadle, or the comic insecurity of Damon and Eddie Jemison.Although Clooney and Pitt are the real protagonists (Rusty eating the whole movie was a great move from the script), there is enough time for each character to gain layers of context that are essential for us to empathize with them. Clooney and Pitt not only bring the usual charisma to the scene, but also incarnate protagonists so well outlined that it is difficult not to fall in love with the quick dialogues they create with each other and with the arc that they use with such determination. Not to mention the supporting actors who, although they seem a priori disposable, actually have a lot to offer for the continuity of the work. In short, each of them functions as an essential piece of a well-crafted puzzle - and if one fails, the chance of the plan becoming an epic disaster increases exponentially.Although they function as anti-heroes, it is easy to discover who the real antagonist of the story is. Andy Garcia does a spectacular job giving life to Terry Benedict, tycoon responsible for the administration of the three casinos and also for ""stealing"" the seductive Tess (Julia Roberts) from Danny's hands, who still has feelings for his ex-fiancee. Rusty soon realizes that one of the reasons why Danny insists on invading these specific places also rises as a personal vendetta against the one who has caused him so much harm - even if it costs him both his own and his friends' freedom.The soundtrack by David Holmes brings many elements of jazz, as well as the original film, but allowing to add striking songs at certain times, such as ""A Little Less Conversation"", by Elvis Presley, as well as some punctual electronic beats. Stephen Mirrione's editing is also worthy of applause, it is not easy to edit in an agile way amid the many parallel plots and giving equal prominence to so many characters. The editor ensures a frantic pace, especially when the plan comes into action. In addition, he is able to establish the essential elements for the outcome of the narrative, delivering just enough for the viewer to assemble the puzzle in his mind, but making room for him to be surprised nonetheless. Without the singing excesses and acts of cabaret perpetrated by the 1960 film, the delight of suspense is given by the team's formation to the execution of the plan, with very few drops of rhythm.Technically, Ocean's Eleven mixes elements of the classic The Sting (1973) with the agile Snatch (2001). From the first, it copies all the detailed preparation of the big coup. Of the second, it reuses editing and editing, speed and soundtrack resources, as in a video clip. The result pleases, logically, for the energy that comes from the stars. At this point, the viewer already maintains a strong connection with the plot, with the stars and with their characters. Soderbergh not only manages to arrest the public, but also avoids or misses some small drops in rhythm that the film may present. But don't be alarmed, they are few. It should have existed more often during the beginning of the projection, but the director manages, with great merit, to make the part of the ""junction"" or organization of the team right at the beginning of the projection one of the funniest and most interesting of the entire film.Charming and with a fine sense of humor, Ocean's Eleven by Soderbergh is a film that has aged very well. Its jazz soundtrack and metalinguistic details only contribute to a combination of ornaments punctuated with extreme attention. A film with its own tone, discretion and grace, is and has always been the antithesis of the noisy, hysterical and needy blockbuster. It was a surprise at the time of its release - even more for turning a primary story into something far superior. And perhaps most interesting of all, it is one of the few works that does not care about conventionalisms between ""good and evil"", even allowing anti-heroes to manage the robbery perfectly. Presented in a totally different guise from the 1960 classic, the film overflows charisma on the part of its cast, which makes many consider it better than the work that originated it. Whether or not it goes according to the opinion of each one, the fact is that the source material must always be respected, after all, it is from there that everything originated.",Ocean's Eleven

OK, it's not the first movie a its genre. A great heist, this time three casinos. But there's little twists, here and there, that make the movie original and funny. But... why stick with the same old love-revenge story. Why do we need Julia Roberts character, I mean I surely don't mind her presence, but it's not relevant to the movie.
Still a good movie, an entertaining one.Out of 100, I gave it 81. That's good for *** stars on a **** stars rating system.Seen at the Famous Players Uptown Cinema, in Toronto, on January 8th, 2001.",Ocean's Eleven
116,Pedro_H,Self-congratulating and preening crime thriller that is more style than substance,7,14 March 2004,"An old-time con gets out of the can and comes up a grand master plan to rob a casino strongbox. But is it business or is it personal?
Movie makers are so short of ideas that they are prepared to remake movies that weren't very good in the first place? Having said that, this product belongs in the ""Star Is Born"" mould of film: A frame to put your star product rather than anything special or unique by itself. All star cast? Well about six people here could be considered stars (Andy Garcia we will count as a falling star, Elliot Gould as well and truly fallen!) and even most of these look like overpaid extras. Matt Damon needs to be looking for more substantial roles than this - he is getting a bit old to be the wide-eyed tea-boy. I think Brad Pitt has a good set of washboard abs and a nice face, but has he ever convinced you that he is good at anything other than bench presses? Master thief - don't make me laugh. Julia Roberts isn't much more than a muse but does well enough with her well paid bit-part. Very dignified.
George Clooney has been lucky in life. Nice TV face that has been given a chance with movies because there isn't really anybody else coming along. While mediocre in mediocre material he is quite good with this type of light and throwaway material - understated and cool. That guy should market antiperspirant.We shouldn't go in to how they plan to turn over the casino given this is so much of the movie. However I am sure the casino security people wiped tears of laughter from their eyes watching things unfold.The security they have is unbreakable and criminals don't rob big vaults anymore - when was the last big robbery of this type? Besides they would simply kidnap someone important even if they were mad enough to give it a go. Sorry film makers - if you want to focus on crim's then small timers and drugs dealers are all you are left with.All faults to one side, this is quite an acceptable  little package, but there is something missing at the heart of it. Namely tension. I couldn't really care less if they got caught or not and frankly without this bank robberies become men-at-work movies.Good to see that while very few people have seen the (excellent) British comedy-drama Two Way Stretch (with Peter Sellers) the authors of this piece clearly have! It would be interesting to show the two films back-to-back to an audience and see which they preferred. I would bet on the low budget Brit-pic myself.",Ocean's Eleven

This remake is definitely better than the wasted 1960 effort but I can only imagine if this newer version was done rated R style,with a little more depth and plot attention to detail in the mold of PULP FICTION or SNATCH.Still,if you are into Las Vegas setting comedies of are a big fan of any of the lead actors here and you don't mind your crime caper movies done in a PG-13 style,you will get your money's worth with this one........",Ocean's Eleven

Soderbergh doesn't do one thing wrong in this all spectacular con-movie, the way he sets Las Vegas in flames with great music and great camera-sliding is truly classy. The cast is all amazing, every one from George Clooney to Don Cheadle and Brad Pitt to Bernie Mac and back again. And although Ocean's Eleven doesn't do any surprising jumps or turns, it always stays true to it's message and meaning; entertaining you to the last second. Andy Garcia's super-serious Terry Benedict keeps a firm maturity to a story even a kid could understand, and the Clooney/Pitt cooperation works like childhood buddies just having another laugh robbing millions from three of Las Vegas' most impressive casinos. It's a movie that can truly change the mood of your day, as its bright and jaunty tone will keep you wanting more and more of Ocean's striking eleven.",Ocean's Eleven

He recruits 11 of the finest career criminals around and they plan the ultimate never before done robbing of a Las Vegas casino.This movie is really good but it is strange because I have never bothered to watch the sequels mainly for the reason that Im scared its going to be too much like this one.

In the past there was a similar film starred by Sinatra, Dean Martin and other actors, this one is coming with sophisticated means for robbing the casinos, new tactics and some other modern elements, but the content is the same, i.e. the ways of robbing casinos belonging to Mr Terry Benedict acted by Andy Garcia, perhaps the best acting of this film together with the one of Brad Pitt.

A spectacular cast, a slinky soundtrack, lots of charm, a sufficient plot, and steady direction make for a zippy two hours. Almost every actor gets to play it cool; and all of them come together to form a good ensemble. I love the music in this film. It is perfect. It fits not only Las Vegas, but the crime caper genre as well. The characters and plot may not be praise worthy, but they are enough to allow the actors and, unlike the sequel, the audience to have fun. The scene between Danny and Tess in the restaurant may be my favorite as Tess' digs into Danny have some real weight for a lite movie. As much as I like this movie, I notice everything that will go horribly wrong in the sequel in this movie as well. This movie thinks it is too cool for school as well, but I think that it is Steven Soderbergh's direction that keeps this movie alive and kicking. He keeps the demons of improbability and smugness at bay and allows the fun to happen.",Ocean's Eleven

Danny is the charming mastermind, Rusty is the sarcastic right hand man, and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) is the innocent newcomer. It's a great caper flick and it's really hard not to like it.

124,oneloveall,A classy guilty pleasure,7,26 May 2007,"Worthy remake of the famous rat pack caper found a whole new pack taking over from Sinatra and the boys with Steven Soderbergh at the helm. Oceans Eleven is a glitzy, snazzy, and most importantly, fun recreation of the classic bank robbery film. The production value alone keeps everything shimmering along quite nicely, but it is the first rate cast, directed through Soderbergh's experienced lens that takes the infectiously entertaining piece over the top.In less skilled hands the film still would have been a fun, if unnecessary comedy caper diversion, but with this cast and crew becomes one of the most easily digestible and classy pieces of adult fluff entertainment to emerge post-millennium. Sure, the smug ensemble cast tends to wear a little thin after a while, but they are directed in such an entertainingly concise way that their indulgences become our own. Whatever doubt one may cast in the face of so many Hollywood A-listers gathered together to competitively mug the camera becomes cast aside after realizing how smooth the direction really is.Deceptively elegant, the Las Vegas cinematography compliments Soderbergh's smooth transitions perfectly. For all the late-game revelations that joyously unfold as the robbery occurs, the director really got to shine leading up to that elaborate heist. It is in the seductive filming of this outlandish proposal that elevates the crime comedy to a level of class film of this caliber rarely achieves present day.",Ocean's Eleven

In fact every single thing in Ocean's eleven is well done but on the whole it's dull.I had the same feeling after seeing Out of sight with Clooney. Perhaps Soderbergh doesn't know to shoot action movies. His directing skills are out of scope here. Would you dare to speak of chemistry between such key characters as Clooney's and Pitt's, Clooney's and Roberts'?Every new element in here falls flat for every scene is anecdotical; hence this set of anecdotical stories forms an heartless feature.",Ocean's Eleven

George Clooney steps into Frank Sinatra's shoes as Danny Ocean, the ex-con who gets together with a large crew of cronies to rob three Las Vegas Casinos owned by a Las Vegas bigwig (Andy Garcia) who is now dating Danny's ex-wife (Julia Roberts). The screenplay is a little on the complex side and sometimes it's a little hard to keep track of what Danny and his crew are doing, but the film is so great to look at and the cast appears to be having so much fun, you really just let little plotting devices slide and just go with it. Clooney has never appeared so smooth and slick on screen and is backed by a great cast including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Elliott Gould, and in a casting stroke of genius as a veteran con man, comic legend Carl Reiner.

128,skepticskeptical,Fairytale for underdogs? thinly veiled socialist propaganda? or just plain incoherent?,5,31 December 2009,"This movie is relatively entertaining and provokes a few good laughs. It exhibits the classic structure of the Fairytale for Underdogs, leading the viewer to root along with the losers (Ocean's 11) against the powerful and rich (Andy Garcia's character). We are to hope that this mad-capped caper will succeed so that the eleven losers will no longer be insolvent, and the rich guy will lose big.The odd thing about this version of the fairytale is that we have no idea why we should detest the King of Three Casinos. Is it because he's a crook (which we don't really know)? Apparently not, since the losers who are taking him on are also crooks. Is it because he stole the ex-con Ocean's wife (played insipidly, as usual, by Julia Roberts)? That seems to be the idea, but we haven't a clue as to why SHE divorced him (and not vice versa), except for the fact that he was in prison for a number of years, and she is clearly angry with him about something. Perhaps, having been left in the lurch, she simply decided to move on... But now we are supposed to side with the loser ex-con upon his release from prison as he endeavors to rob $160 million from her new boyfriend, while winning her back as well.There seems to be a bit of a socialist undercurrent here, for even if the Andy Garcia character is a crook, he's a successful crook, unlike his adversaries. So it looks as though we are supposed to hate him for being competent and rich! Julia Roberts plays a woman who appears to have been hurt deeply by her ex-husband the ex-con, but is ready to hit the road with him again, upon his successful heist of $160 million from the guy who has provided her with not only companionship during her ex-husband's incarceration, but also a job as the curator of a museum in one of his casinos. (Hmmm... Was it love that attracted her to him?) Honestly, I don't get. At the end of the day, this morally sanctimonious chick appears to click with whoever is rich!The socialist waters become even more muddled at this point, for now that Ocean's eleven are rich, shouldn't we side with some other cluster of underdogs who should now want to rob them? (It looks as though I'll have to watch the sequels for the answer to that question!) In fact, if we (the moviegoers) were to take the premise of this film seriously, we should all conspire to rob George, Brad, Matt, Julia, et al., of the millions that they each earned for starring in this thing!!!OCEAN'S ELEVEN was never meant to provoke thought. Just some raucous laughter and the primordial desire to side against anyone who's better off than one's self. Or maybe just the idea that a bunch of losers might be able to pull off an impossible heist despite the fact that they make blunder after blunder, almost blowing it about a dozen times. So, against all odds, fortuna takes their side. Maybe that was it.",Ocean's Eleven

The usual elaborate preparations are made, Ocean preparing the heist for ""Fight Night"", when he knows the vault will be at its fullest.The vault is gotten to by the criminals, but the casino owner is aware of this-and Ocean forces him to surrender half the money or have all of it destroyed by explosives. Of course the casino owner complies-even though he is supposed to be scary and powerful, and his losses would be covered by insurance. This adds an anticlimax to the heist.What else is wrong? Slow pace, overlong scenes, bad acting all around, and little tension like heist movies are supposed to have. I don't know about the original, but skip this snooze-fest.",Ocean's Eleven
130,FlickJunkie-2,An entertaining caper flick,8,20 May 2002,"I have trouble calling this a remake, because it doesn't share much in common with the `rat pack' original except the name of the lead character and that it is a casino heist.  Actually, this is a better film than its namesake, apart from the fact that the cast of the original was filled with entertainment legends.Director Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) takes a vacation from serious filmmaking with this film, which on his resume is something of a lark.  Everyone seems to be having a good time and it is clear that the actors enjoyed making this film.  The overhauled screenplay pops with snappy dialogue, riddled with deadpan humor and a decent, though somewhat far fetched plot.  It has a little of the whimsical feel of `The Sting', though the screenplay isn't as strong.  A crew of professional thieves plans to knock over three casinos on a fight night by raiding the impregnable vault that serves all three.  The plan is elaborate, full of high tech wizardry, daring deceptions and acrobatic stunts.  The caper runs into more than the normal amount of foul ups, but our devious team of burglars is always up to the task of working around the glitches.The cast is very solid.  George Clooney is perfectly cast as the brainchild of the scheme.  He is dapper, macho and smooth with a sardonic wit that keeps the film's tone serious yet light.  Brad Pitt plays the always eating Rusty, who is really the brains behind the operation, coordinating it flawlessly.  Except for `The Mexican', this is much lighter material than Pitt usually tackles, yet he gives a suave performance seeming very comfortable with his character.  Despite the fact that this is an ensemble cast, Pitt carries a lot of the weight and makes the story as close to believable as could be possible given its improbable nature.Don Cheadle continues to impress, rendering a terrific demolitions expert. His cockney accent is great and with this part Cheadle shows once again what a terrific character actor he is.  In a little twist of irony, Cheadle plays an analogous part in this film to that played by Sammy Davis, Jr. in the original, and he also played Sammy in the TV movie entitled `The Rat Pack'.  Poor Andy Garcia has the thankless task of playing the heavy in a tongue-in-cheek film, but he does a marvelous job.  Matt Damon plays the rookie, giving the character a charming naiveté and a mischievous bent. Julie Roberts is nothing more than a throw in, with a minor role as Ocean's ex-wife.If you don't take this film too seriously, you are in for an entertaining evening.  It is smartly done without too much melodrama, and provides just enough suspense and realism to keep it from being a farce.  I rated it an 8/10.",Ocean's Eleven

As my Dad is fond of pointing out, in real life people hate thieves - yet Hollywood insists on turning them into heroes, time and again!  I wonder why.  Could it be that Hollywood loves underdogs?  That can't be the case in ""Ocean's Eleven""; somehow I can't see Clooney, Pitt, Damon and co. ever qualifying as ""underdogs.""  They're rich pretty boys who want to steal some cash so they can become richer and prettier.  Yuck.  Here's a few disturbing elements to chew on: we've got a full range of stereotypes on display here, from the Funny Asian Guy (defined exclusively by his physical ability) to the Angry Cockney Guy (defined exclusively by his accent and his anger!).  Julia Roberts, the only woman on display - and boy, is she ON DISPLAY - is defined exclusively through her relationships with men.  What, can't she have a subplot that doesn't involve romance?  No, of course not - she's a female character in boys' own rubbish. 
Still, somewhere in the depths of my cynical being, I am mildly entertained by these gaudy proceedings; some deeply-buried part of me enjoys watching the white collar crime antics of these People magazine celebrities.

I saw the sequel in theaters which I actually liked and wanted to see the first one but never saw it. So upon entering a friends house I picked out Ocean's Eleven from his movie collection and took it home and saw it. The movie is quite impressive. The characters are all great and their performances shine as bright as a flashlight and Rusty, who was played by Brad Pitt, was my favorite character. Ocean's Eleven is just a pure stylish and smart film. The heist scenes are so cool, it makes Mission: Impossible look like Spy Kids. But above all, the movie is funny and has a lot of laughs that boosts the movie up along with a great script. This is a highly entertaining film with a stylish and unique point to it.

137,EmperorNortonII,Retro Meets Techno,8,12 January 2002,"The original ""Ocean's Eleven"" starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack was a classic of coolness.  The remake starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt and a host of others tries to shoot for something close to that.  The movie uses a retro cool jazz score, and has a lot of gimmicky camera shots (like the rear view of Clooney and Pitt as they drive).  And it was interesting to see new technology added to the story, bringing the 1960 original into the 21st century.  But, all in all, I must say the original was better.  It had a certain charm to it.  The remake was done adequately, but if not for names and premises, it just seems like a completely different movie altogether.",Ocean's Eleven
138,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: solid but nothing special,6,31 March 2002,"Can we talk? Really talk? I'll let you in on a secret. I'm an action movie buff all the way. I didn't care that ""Rumble in the Bronx"" had no plot, or that Arnold Schwartenegger can't act. If stuff blows up, I'm happy. And I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate dramas. But -- I do appreciate an intelligent plot or characterization that does something original, makes me think, and when stuff blows up there had better be some good tension and great action.""Ocean's Eleven"" is a straightforward heist flick without much of the above. It's not exactly bad (like ""The Score"" which I found offensively boring compared to its promos), but just uninspiring. The all-star cast does nothing to lift this impression.Who should see this film:-- action buffs who have nothing better to do on a rainy day,and haven't formed false expectations from the all-star billing-- I can't think of anyone else. Arty types definitely stay away.he film is not a comedy, and unless you've got quite a seriouscrush on one of the stars, I would not go just to see them.I'll give Ocean's Eleven a respectable but not eye-opening 6 out of 10.",Ocean's Eleven

141,departed07,Clooney and the gang in one great heist,10,26 December 2004,"Ocean's Eleven premiered when I was a senior in high school, and I got to say that the film is excellent in every way making it one of the best films of 2001. George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, out on parole and decides to lead a heist on three Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia). He hires Rusty (Brad Pitt), Basher (Don Cheadle), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Linus (Matt Damon) and others to help out with the heist. As much as splitting 160 million dollars in 11 way was a problem, there is another problem along the way: Tess, played by Julia Roberts, happens to be dating Terry Benedict. Taking money from the person he's robbing is one thing, now Danny is after Tess as well. What really excites me about Ocean's 11 is that it is the type of movie that never lets the audience down. It's funny, dramatic and none the less, thrilling. The actors are pitched perfect, the dialog is sharp and every scene in the film never gets out of your mind.",Ocean's Eleven

Considering there was 11 in the squad as well I never lost track of the characters which is quite common in films which contain a lot of main characters. To sum up if you haven't watched yet I'd definitely give it a go. I'm going straight into the sequels nowOnly real negative to this is that I just wasn't bothered by the romantic/love side of the plot. I could not care less if Clooney got his ex-wife back or not. It just seemed a bit pointless in the grand scheme of things. It didn't take anything away from the film, but it didn't hook me in as the heist did.",Ocean's Eleven

Regardless this was an entertaining movie. A little side note (Contains Spoiler):Okay let's get down to the plot hole! So they're supposed to rob three banks but they only rob ONE!!!!

145,FilmFanInTheHouse,Very Enjoyable,7,5 November 2007,"Ocean's Eleven (2001, Dir. Steven Soderbergh) Danny Ocean wants to score the biggest heist in history.

It's not going to be easy, as they plan to get in secretly and out with $150 million.You look at the cast lost on paper, and you have an amazing ensemble of talent. What an amazement to get stars such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia. You are definitely not disappointed by this film. It's just so flashy.

146,CinematicInceptions,Great crime with excellent character balance.,8,26 July 2014,"For me, an integer is not specific enough to grade a movie. I really would have given this movie an 8.5, but decided to round down since an 8 still brings the overall rating up. This is the best crime movie I have seen as well as the most successful one ever, most likely due to the cast. I think the cast is quite good and embody their characters convincingly (apart from George Clooney, but that's a personal opinion). The thing that really makes this picture stand out, apart from the very well thought out burglary, is the balance of characters. No character is given too little screen time or too small a role in the robbery. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for most movies, even Twelve and Thirteen. Everyone will probably have a character that they love and one that they hate because of their diverse personalities. For me, the only character I didn't really like was Danny Ocean. The Benedict blow-over is perfectly thought out and yet perfectly impossible at the same time. The subplot of Danny, Tess, and Terry Benedict's relationship is emphasized enough to attract viewers that might otherwise not choose to watch the movie, but not too much to turn away people that would have otherwise enjoyed the story. There is a good amount of humor in it, especially from the parts with less famous actors like the Malloy brothers, Livingston, and Basher. The twists are so utterly simple and genius that it's funny how well Benedict falls into a trap that he almost weaves himself. For anyone who likes a good laugh or a good plot, Ocean's Eleven is worth a watch.",Ocean's Eleven

The elaborate plan involves a series of clever deceptions, most of which are refreshingly not signposted to the audience in advance. Although that means that youre never quite sure what will happen next as the elaborate robbery and its many attendant scams unfold, the supreme confidence of Clooney and his team means you never really doubt that they wont succeed. However, perhaps surprisingly, this doesnt take from your enjoyment of the film. It has an eminently watchable cast, with Clooney and Pitt in particular creating an onscreen chemistry reminiscent of Paul Newman and Robert Redford in ""The Sting."" Only Don Cheadle lets the side down with a frankly awful supposedly cockney accent and terrible dialogue as an English munitions expert.

152,lagudafuad,One of the best heist film there is,7,18 March 2013,"Ocean's Eleven is a remake of a Rat Pack 1960 movie of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra. This movie is just graceful, that is the word. It features one of the greatest ensemble cast that you can find and having them come together for one purpose and one purpose only to take down a casino. And the merging of these talents was well done by Steven Soderbergh, who was the director and cinematographer of the movie.Daniel Ocean and his crew made robbing a casino look easy, since all you need is some background cash and a crew of different people with unique skills. If you have these people in your back pocket then you, ""the robber"" are game enough to take down anybody.Steven Soderbergh and Clooney came together with the aim of putting this film together and after the wonderful display of acting from all the cast, let's not forget Julia Robert and Andy Garcia were also in this movie, the movie was well received and led to a trilogy.The movie is about Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who just got out of jail and the first thing on his mind is to perform the perfect steal. After Danny got out he started to recruit the team members for his heist, they were:In order of recruitment: 1. George Clooney as Danny Ocean 2. Bernie Mac as Frank Catton 3. Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan 4. lliott Gould as Reuben Tishkoff 5. Casey Affleck as Virgil Malloy 6. Scott Caan as Turk Malloy 7. Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell 8. Don Cheadle as Basher Tarr 9. Shaobo Qin as ""The Amazing"" Yen 10. Carl Reiner as Saul Bloom 11. Matt Damon as Linus CaldwellThe job looked impossible but Danny believed they could do it, so together they formed the master plan to take on the Bellagio, The Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos, these casinos were owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).There is also a catch to this heist; Danny's Ex-Wife (Julia Roberts) is now going out with Benedict.This movie was extremely popular and the movie grew from just a fun movie to watch, to having a huge fan base that led to the release of two other Ocean crew movies that also had the same cast from here and featured new popular cast. This movie cost nothing less than $85 million to make, due majorly to the cast, but it made its money back and over in the box office and it stands as the best of all the three in the franchise.My favorite take from the movie is that 50% of the time when Brad Pitt is on screen he is eating something.www.lagsreviews.com",Ocean's Eleven

One boring day, I decided to watch and I had very low expectations. After watching it, I HAD A BLAST... at the film's 2nd and 3rd acts.Acts 2 & 3 - FUN AND SMART! The planning and execution of the heist was a brilliant ride from act 2's start to act 3's end. These acts were near-perfection! (Some parts were slightly boring)ACT 1 - The film has a lot of supporting characters which, sadly, meant a lot of dragged and sometimes uninteresting introductions to said characters. If act 1 was the entire film, I'd give ""Ocean's Eleven"" 4 stars. Thankfully, it's not.NOTE: Though the character introductions were too long and, at times, uninteresting, the actors did their best. Their on-screen charisma made these scenes slightly better.I still have one more flaw with this film: Julia Roberts' character. Despite her amazing performance, her character was just a plot device for Danny Ocean. Yes, a plot device is important but when a character is a plot device, the film shouldn't make you feel that said character IS a plot device.Overall, I had a blast with ""Ocean's Eleven!""",Ocean's Eleven

I have seen several reviews attacking the film because it has nothing serious to say and attacking the director for, well, selling out because he opted to make a film that is just fun. This is like criticizing a lemon pie because it doesn't taste like apples. This is a good old-fashioned caper movie made by a bunch of talented people who want to share that fun with the audience.

Danny Ocean (Clooney) needs another 9 men though to pull this off (get it, Oceans 11) and goes about finding a group of specially skilled cons to help pull off his elaborate plan (great cast including Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac and Matt Damon).For the genre the action is fantastic, and there's no guns.

It's a completely ensemble cast including Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts amongst others. It's clever, witty, multi-layered and something of a film that you can watch again and again and see more things each time. It's one that I had to watch a few times to get the entire plot and each time I see it I don't remember the full points so it's a good yarn. The writers were brilliant.It's shot excitingly, with lots of crisp cuts, and jumping between scenes using a split screen occasionally, giving it a retro feel. The plot is convoluted enough that it's believable, if a little slick (given it's got Pitt and Clooney in it that's a given), with some clever time wasters to ramp up the tension, and I just adore Brad Pitt's characterisation - he's ALWAYS eating! Don Cheadle (uncredited, apparently due to a disagreement) is a funny Britt who speaks primarily in cockney rhyming slang is a bit of a hoot as well.

The fact that the flaw could have easily been corrected makes it all the more disconcerting and you leave the movie shaking your head. But ultimately the memory of the geniality of the project wins you over. It's definitely minor Steven Soderbergh but that's the point: after the seriousness of both `Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich' this must have been a welcome relief and he has a lot fun letting his actors indulge their hipness quotient. The large cast does just that, with George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts among others preferring to underplay rather than ham it up (although the always-welcome Carl Reiner has some very juicy scenes impersonating a Russian). Soderbergh revels in the testosterone heaviness of his film--there are some shots of backlit Vegas fountains exploding that would seem almost silly if they weren't tinged with the bit of melancholy that occurs after orgasm.

Soderbergh was expected after the triumph of Traffic and his double nomination for the oscars, and he came out with this remake. In one end he succeded, the film really has coolness to spare.

Oh, I forgot, add a black person with a cockney accent, that is always good for a laugh.This of course is appealing. Movies take us into a world where we can't go. Sometimes where we don't want to go, but often where we would love to be.So Eleven is successful but says nothing about what this time of crime.

I enjoyed the film's many twists and smart writing. I had forgotten about things that were set up early on that ended up paying off later. There were several moments where I found myself going ""Oh no. How are they going to get out of this one?"" Much like the vault the main characters try to rob in the film, it had many twists and turns. It was just an all-around good old fashioned heist movie though a bit dated. You can definitely tell by the pop culture references, lighting, fashion/hairstyles, and cinematography that this was made in 2001. But maybe it was cool at the time. I don't know.

Julia Roberts was skinny and sullen and not at all the beautiful object of desire as referred to in the movie.  I found myself repeating ""Hey Collegen Man"" whenever she appeared on screen.  Don't you think something is wrong when you have to be told through the script that the person coming on screen is supposed to be beautiful.  Shouldn't the appearance of the actress say it.  Some of the female extras were much better looking.  Many of the supporting cast were fun to watch and the plot twists were, though expected, entertaining.

Matt Damon could have done with a bit more conviction here, though and his character(Linus Caldwall) doesn't properly develop. Julia Roberts is another let down here and gives a wooden and very unconvincing performance. She smiles but doesn't really act here. You'd think that she just showed up for one day of filming and for the rest of her scenes they used a wax model of her. (No-one noticed the difference) But this is still an entertaining two hours.

And he's got a bunch of stars to adorn this project of his, also helped out by taut and smart script. I haven't seen the Sinatra-starred film on which this is based upon, yet I don't think that one can never come close to this in terms of both story and standard.Speaking about the cast, I must say finally George Clooney is a relief to watch this time, after all the intolerable films he has done in recent past. Matt Damon, highly unutilised in this film, glitters in his short opportunities. Julia Roberts is as sophisticated as usual, bringing a classic touch to the atmosphere. Don Cheadle tries a fake accent which could have been a disaster if he would get a bigger role. However, the two actors who really stole the show are Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia. Pitt gives a perfect and passionate performance as Rusty. He's got the looks, got the attitude and here he does the job. Garcia's take on Benedict nicely shows the role's multifaceted character.I wouldn't spoil too much by discussing the story. I can only say, the major plot twist is just brilliant. I have seen such type of films quite a lot and I never predict even a particle of their original plan. The ending, some may not like it, I thought very necessary. In the end, ""Ocean's Eleven"" may not be a classic film, but certainly one of the best films of its genre.",Ocean's Eleven

The money? Or the entrancing Tess (Julia Roberts), Danny's ex-wife and now Benedict's girlfriend? This is one of the few remakes (Poseidon and - as I have heard - The Hills Have Eyes are other two examples) that manage to be even more entertaining than the original (in Poseidon's case, even making a silent movie would have been more entertaining than the original movie).The script gives us so many twists and turns that we never know what's going to happen next, while keeping that slick, classy-comedy tone, all the actors give the right tone to their characters (Clooney, Mac, Cheadle, Affleck and Caan are especially a treat, as are the firecracker dialogues between Clooney and Roberts, which bring back to mind 'The Philadelphia Story') and every single other part works toward making 'Ocean's 11' a must-see movie.Ocean's 11: 8/10.",Ocean's Eleven

Director Steven Soderbergh is admirable in making this film which is definitely the better of the remakes that have been coming out lately. The rest of the talented cast including the late Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Guild are just as impressive as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Ocean's Eleven is a film thats better to see without knowing too much about it because any kind of spoiler can ruin some of the surprises in store for those who watch it. Despite some flaws with the film juggling a bit too many characters and a slow pace at times, Ocean's Eleven is still a good movie. Overall I was very impressed with this one and if you give a chance I'm sure you'll enjoy it too. Ocean's Eleven has an intricate story with just enough humor, drama, excitement, surprises, and exceptional performances by the whole cast who definitely make this caper film worth the time to watch.",Ocean's Eleven

The real thing is the revenge that he wants on the owner of the casino, who just happens to be marrying Danny's ex-wife.  The entire movie is excellent.  The direction is awesome.

I enjoyed watching the film, but enjoyed reading the commentaries more !! ...and I didn't see the original, so can't comment on that.....but, I've performed in shows in Vegas and am fairly familiar with the security-systems they use. This film was like a ""kiddies"" version of ""Casino"".ALL of the cast were believable and each showed good acting, with the simple script they were given - what a picnic for Matt !! He could've done this role asleep. THAT was Elliott Gould ???? If that's the actor I'm thinking of, he had the best role in the whole film. The handsome George Clooney was the handsome George Clooney, as always.....no acting involved. Brad Pitt promised a good role in the beginning, but what did he have to work with? Julia Roberts was a waste, but isn't she usually? The rest of the actors did their jobs well and provided an old fart with good entertainment for an evening, as most posters commented.

Indulgence for the stars and fans of the stars. I normally detest such films, but I liked this one. How could you not like a movie with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, and Don Cheadle? It is obvious the actors had fun with this and so did I to a certain extent. The film is a remake of a 1960 Frank Sinatra vehicle and it appears that director Steven Soderbergh may have even improved off of it. Like Men in Black or Ghostbusters, it is just fun for the stars and it's fun for the viewers too. Although I disagree with the two sequels to the film, I enjoyed this installment.",Ocean's Eleven

A good, very classy film, in which the villain (George Clooney) is as sharply dressed as the ""not so villain"" (Andy Garcia). Where every shot is picture perfect, where all shines and sparkles, and where everything is just picture perfect.

The plot is also very interesting and the movie and characters, even though there are a lot of them, develop rather nicely. My favorite character is probably Don Cheadle's though. He plays the role of reckless British explosives nut flawlessly. I thought there were a few plot holes but none that actually affected the critical plot points regarding the heist so they are easily overlooked. I think they could've spent more time on the actual heist/planning process but the movie would've probably been too long if they did. Overall, this is a really good movie with solid acting and, while it's isn't exciting, it still provides for some nice entertainment value.",Ocean's Eleven

185,buzznzipp1995,No small riptide... Ocean's stands tall.,10,24 July 2006,"After the (2001) Ocean's Eleven re-make they should have left it alone. Lightning struck, but not twice unfortunately. Having a second time around where they get 'caught' by Garcia's character is slightly more than just a little embarrassing. Get my meaning from the spelling there?! It made them look like a bunch of 'Wussies'. That is how silly this new Ocean's twelve is. The biggest thing for me about this is that I like these players. They all brought a ton of talent and pulled this thing 'off' with incredible style and ease. With the first remake, not only were the camera-film shots very pleasing and artistic in set up, but also complete in story view/telling. The lines felt as if they were straight out of ""the book of cool"" from the sixties, only with a current 'pop' to them. Pitt was perfect. Always sporting a good appetizer platter with him and a well-delivered line not too much, not too little, just right. Along with Clooney and the rest, just fell solidly into place. Epic, right down to the soundtrack that blended into the foreground and back drop, bounced and moved along in and out with a silky-groove-dream sequence sensibility. The score (music) was the additional character that should have made that one 'Ocean's twelve'.The story I thought had graduated into current times and left the sixties version at a deficit. The interaction between the players from the two Utah brothers,(Caan and Affleck) who were more like elementary school kids than skilled heist men, that was obviously part of the fun! To the blackjack dealer with attitude (Bernie Mac-man) Clooney's Danny Ocean was one of the funnest characters he has had along with other good supporting guys (Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner) they all were top drawer in this hip-heist film. It was an 'edgy' story that made it out alive...Then they had to make a sequel. How many sequels truly make it. Probably less then more. Anything to make money right? Naw, couldn't be, ""We're having a lot fun!"" They said. Well good deal for them, but in the mean-time write something else good, and or original. But for me this is a library addition keeper of a good time. Ocean's is tops. (****)",Ocean's Eleven

187,robsta23,The Plan is Almost Too Perfect,7,2 May 2015,"This was a movie that kind of confused me as a kid in that this was one of the first movies I saw where the protagonists commit a crime. I remember asking my dad, ""so these are the bad guys?"" His response was along the lines of ""well, they may be stealing something but they're still the good guys."" I still liked the movie as a kid, but this concept confused me a little bit. Many years later, it is still a delightful B movie to watch.It is pretty awesome that they have so many people on their team to create an ensemble cast, but some of them get barely any screen time when I would want to see an equal balance of the cast. For example, all we know about the little acrobat is that he is really good at what he does since he doesn't speak much English, besides dropping the second use of ""f***"" in the movie. We also don't delve too deep into the back story of certain characters, such as the oldest member on the team. We know all of these guys either have a connection to Ocean or Pitt's character or that they are found, and for this senior citizen we know he has a connection to Pitt's character and that is about it.The funniest bits of the film come from the twins, one of whom is played by Casey Affleck, who really gets how annoying his character is supposed to be. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Affleck's character's toy car is going faster than his brother's monster truck just to get destroyed by his brother.Getting back to the point of the movie, the heist seems to go way too smoothly, which is meant to satisfy the viewers I guess, but a great film requires conflict - no matter if it is external or internal - but this film's struggle seems mainly to be internal struggles within Ocean and his enemy played by Andy Garcia. One is trying to win his ex- wife back, and the other is dying inside as his money is getting stolen. As Brad Pitt's character points out, it is really selfish of Ocean to concoct this plan with some motivation to win Tess back. Romance makes a good subplot in movies - in fact a lot of producers want at least some type of romance in their movies - and while it holds up and illustrates that Ocean is a better man than Garcia's character, but it seems to stray from the focus on the rest of the team.While watching this my friends were pointing out how gadgets in this movie go unexplained, especially for a film released in 2001 where this type of technology wasn't even in many James Bond films. Each step of the plan seems to go almost too well, with the exception that they almost blow the acrobat away.This is an enjoyable heist film that makes us feel for Ocean, but I wish there was more connection to the other characters in the film.",Ocean's Eleven

This is the movie that sort of brought back the ""caper"" film, a style used in older films such as ""The Sting"" and of course the original ""Ocean's Eleven."" Convict Danny Ocean (George Clooney) assembles a team of twelve men to pull off a heist to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Supporting characters like Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac (rest his soul), and Elliot Gould are all excellent, but for me it is Brad Pitt that manages to steal every scene and deliver every line in the funniest, smoothest way. Andy Garcia is also perfectly cast as Terry Benedict, the casino owner who commands authority just by his actions. This is one of the rare films that everyone in my family (Mom, dad, brother) all enjoyed equally. It's easy to watch and completely entertaining. I like ""Ocean's Twelve"" even better than this film, since the comedy in that one is even more brilliant and improves ever more with each viewing. This, however, ranks nearly as high as that sequel.

(It's fantastic to see veteran comic actor/director Carl Reiner in a role again!) The best scene is the card game early in the story, (the one that features Joshua Jackson in a cameo). It has good personality and tension and a lot of style.I think the main problem with this movie is that it ""shoots its wad"" too early. There are great set pieces and twists in the first two-thirds, and then it all peters out at the end. Sonderbergh seem to fall back to his art-house roots and gives us a lot of pretty pictures and a loud soundtrack, while the plot just fizzles out and the movies cruises to the end on sheer charm alone.I'm going to stick my neck out here and say I think the original Rat Pack film actually worked better. It saved it's biggest twist to the end, right before the classic final shot of them strolling down the street; and actually maintained a strong plot line right to the end.Of course, both of them pale in comparison with the leading films of the genre; THE STING and THE Italian JOB.",Ocean's Eleven

Is it an accomplishment when you remake a bad film badly? So why remake it? Uhh, so Brad Pitt and George Clooney can try to be suave? Yeah, I guess so. It certainly was not to let Julia Roberts display her acting prowess, this is a phoned in performance all the way (poor Julia, she wanted to look cool as well).

A fun heist movie does not need an emotional motivations, emotional climaxes, emotion at all. Ocean's 11 is a fun remake of the 1960s rat pack movie of the same title, and essentially the same plot. Las Vegas casinos can never be robbed enough in the world of movies. A fun movie which stars almost anyone and everyone: George Cloony, Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck (Ben's brother), Scott Caan (James' son), Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, and introducing someone named Julia Roberts. The movie has a simple plot, a crew of ten specialists, headed by Danny Ocean (Cloony) plot to steal over $160 million from 3 Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict (Garcia). The fun part of Ocean's 11 is that it uses three real Vegas casinos, the Bellagio, the MGM, and the Grande, and uses real boxers in a match-up fans of the sport could only dream about in 2001, Lennox Lewis and Vladimir Klitchko. They may sound like small details, but the success of Steven Soderbergh's movie is in how maybe this heist could actually work in real life. Sure there are a few lapses of logic, just how a team of people could transport duffel bags of hooker brochures into a large vault, I do not know, but the overall style overcomes them. The music, the lighting, the filter used on the cameras all bring about a sense of coolness, high energy that keeps the audience into the plot as much as the thieves. Humor from unexpected sources also helps keep the audience engaged in the movie, and the fun dialog helps as well. Popcorn entertainment? You betcha. Anything to make you think? Nope.

The plot is a bit flimsy, as is the lame, half-cocked romance between George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and definitely the underwhelming acting. Pitt and Clooney aren't given a lot to work with here, and most of the time it's all clichéd super-slick con artist posturing with little to no actual emotion or anything put into it. Seriously, this could be really good if our main characters had ever shown any emotion aside from the conniving smirks and poker faces they usually seemed to have on, but as it is, all I can say is that this is too generic and unmemorable to merit any of the praise it has been given.It does get some points for an entertaining climax and the well constructed heist, but that doesn't make a movie.

199,Semisonic,More glitter than gold,6,21 September 2016,"You know this type of people whose broad and most sincere smile only means that they have come up with some tricky scheme to screw you over? Well, George Clooney seems to be that kind of a person. Once you see his smug face, you can definitely be sure that whatever you buy that he's selling is gonna be the truest of fake.Now add some serious cast, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Julia Roberts (still in her prime), a convoluted heist plot, and enough reason to dislike the bad guy - and you'll be literally waiting for our A-Team to succeed and cheering when it does. Yes, it does indeed. Did you really doubt that for a second?Ocean's Eleven, released in 2001, still belongs to that (hopefully) gone era of Hollywood cinema when easy was fun and style was enough to substitute substance. And damn, how in style this film goes! All shiny and sparkling, with enough fun little twists and moments of humor, with Clooney and Pitt exchanging impeccable smiles and snappy one-liners, with a sleek kingpin of an antagonist and his dumb nitwit minions - and of course with the charm of Las Vegas and its vibe of easy money and endless entertainment - Ocean's Eleven makes you feel like a spectator at a very expensive and exclusive show.But that era is over, and even the general audience is into trying to dig a film's surface, not necessarily deep but enough to expect a second layer to show itself. And that sort of thing Ocean's Eleven is kinda short of. The big talent is wasted on walking around, looking perfect and sounding confident, while the only character carrying at least some emotional charge is the usual suspect of a good person's ex-wife and a bad person's current love interest. So we can only thank Julia Roberts for being a good actress enough to make those small things count and show a variety of emotions on her face. Because it seems that the rest of the stellar cast only took a single facial expression with them on stage.It is said that a casino is built like a labyrinth to keep visitors in. Huge, loud and blinking, but still a labyrinth. And so does this film, like a race through a maze, try to keep you thinking of anything but its essence. The truth is, the real essence of this movie is not Mr Clooney's smile or the wads of cash he and his friends try to steal. It's that fir-shaped car air freshener that is shown to us for long enough to suspect some bizarre case of product placement. A screamingly strong-smelling piece of unidentified material that doesn't really make the air enjoyable for breathing but instead is only suitable for distracting you from realizing how stale and stuffy it is. Well, you could of course let yourself be fooled for the whole ride, but it's much healthier not to take it at all in the first place.",Ocean's Eleven

Other than the fact that it had one of the most recognizable casts in history and the fact that it was very slick, it lacked quite a bit. As a ""theft"" movie, it really offered nothing new. The twist was interesting, but not one of those things where you hear yourself say, ""wow"".I like this type of movie and I like the actors, so I don't feel cheated. A 7 is better than everything below it! Nevertheless, the chemistry was notably lacking in my opinion. Also, since I was miserably assaulted by TRAFFIC not all that long ago, any movie made my Soderbergh will, at least for awhile, have the Soderbergh stench.If you are interested only in movies that have even the slightest amount of believability, don't bother watching this one.

They all go to rob all of the money that they made.Oceans 11 is a great film. It was cool to see how they made you like the robbers. That is how to write a story. The actors also did a great job of making you like them. This had one of the best acting crews ever. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon and Julie Roberts. They all did a spectacular job acting. They felt like really life robbers. The setting was great. It looked like a real casino. The 90's did this great. The casinos looked awesome in the 90's.

George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon etc all in the same film! It doesn't disappoint, its an enjoyable caper, where George Clooney gets together a squad of crooks to steal over 160 million dollars from a three casinos in Las Vegas, except there is a bit more to it than that as the owner of the casinos (Andy Garcia) is sleeping with his ex-wife (Julia Roberts). All the stars are on good form, and its a great way to spend a couple of hours. Recommended ***7/10***",Ocean's Eleven
208,Jonathon_Natsis,Uber-Coolness On Demand,9,1 February 2011,"Three casinos. One hundred and fifty million dollars (the stakes, not the film's budgetbut you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise) and just under a dozen of modern cinema's most capable and recognised stars combining to create I daresay the greatest heist movie of all time. As Jake LaMotta once said: 'That's entertainment.'Hit-and-miss director Steven Soderbergh assembles George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who in turn assemble Damon, Gould, Mac, Qin, Reiner, Jemison, Cheadle, Affleck (the good one) and Caan (the young one); a crack team of thieves and con-artists poised to rob Terry Benedict (Garcia) of his wealth and, if all goes well, his girlfriend (Roberts).There is a lot to like about this film from an artistic perspective. The cinematography is always slick and co-ordinated beautifully with the required speedy pace. This is particularly impressive upon a second viewing. Because of how few individual shots were actually used in this film compared to most other contemporary efforts, one has to admire the skill in direction; being able to convey so much activity in so few shots without leaving the film feeling sluggish is a real credit to the production team.While dynamic filmmaking from behind the lens is part of the reason for how well Ocean's Eleven engages its audience, it is the actors that set the tone perfectly. Heavy-hitters like Damon and Garcia are persistenly in control of every scene, and are complimented by some above-average performances from the rest of the cast. But it is the fantastic interplay between Clooney and Pitt that makes the movie. Accommodated by an offbeat script that plays towards these two actors more than any others in the film, they inject a believable 'buddy-comedy' undertone, which doesn't feel at all out of place, probably because the movie refuses to take itself seriously. Rather than trying to convince us that to steal money from a casino in this way is actually possible, Soderbergh positively lets the mechanics fall by the wayside and instead puts his primary focus on pure entertainment.As a rule of thumb, the ending of a heist film does not have to be its strength, as knowledgeable audiences are content to have simply gone along for the ride, and whatever ending the film throws together to justify the series of events will usually suffice. For Ocean's Eleven, this is where a refreshing point of difference lies. A twist ending of sorts, the conclusion is altogether satisfying, unique, and has clearly been well thought-out, so as to avoid a minefield of potential plot holes.This film is as much about the essence of Vegas and excess as it is about a crime syndicate. A sexy soundtrack (the kind of music you expect to hear in the Hard Rock Hotel foyer), fun references to other genre-moulding crime films (including The Godfather and Sinatra's original Ocean's Eleven), expansive shots of The Strip's skyline and cameos galore make the film utterly enjoyable in the plainest sense of the word. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

A salute to Hollywood's golden era where glamor and glory graced the silver screen, Eleven was a cool breathe of pure cinematic fun when it initially hit theaters during the winter of 2001. Being a remake to a forgotten Rat Pack 1960 release only added more glitter to the story  as director Steven Soderbergh managed to recruit some of Hollywood's finest current talents to this intelligent remake. When you come to think of it, there really isn't that much room for mistake when you have living-legends George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia as your main leads.If plot is of any importance to you, you'll probably want to know this is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), an ex-con who just got out of a 5 year period behind bars. Determined to make a final heist before he retires from crime (yeah right), Ocean finds the perfect target  a casino owner named Terry Benedict (Garcia) who has his eyes out for Ocean's ex, Tess (Roberts). With the help of his ten newly recruited accomplices (each individual specializes in a different field of theft), he plans the perfect crime  simultaneously robbing three Las Vegas casinos owned by Benedict. The suave gang of criminals soon set their plan in motion, working every little detail leading up to their final move.The slick and sly group hand out a magnificent performance as they make you realize that sometimes, in certain aspects and circumstances, crime does pay  and with an interest. Kudos go to Soderbergh and his gang for this one, as I truly had a ball watching it, as I'm sure they did making it (btw, the sequel, Ocean's Twelve, is a far inferior predecessor to this film  but the threequel, Ocean's Thirteen saves the prestige of the trilogy).",Ocean's Eleven

Like the heist plan these thief partake in, everyone's role is vital to make the film work and each deliver in their respective parts perfectly.

212,senortuffy,Vacuous entertainment.,5,1 August 2003,"This is a weak remake of a movie that wasn't very good in the first place. 
There's no acting per se - just the plot, a casino robbery.  George Clooney plays George Clooney, Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts is The Girl. Elliott Gould looks old, Carl Reiner is old.  The actors do just enough to advance the story, nothing else.  There is no character development, just characters.And the plot isn't good enough to carry the show.  The film is basically the planning and execution of a casino robbery, and the way they carry it out isn't a bit believable.  I don't know what Steven Soderbergh was thinking of when he made this film. It's the equivalent of airline food - it looks like a movie, but it's really just a cardboard imitation of one.

A classic like Scorses's Casino? Well, theoretically...Only one thing. More demanding viewers will find it too shallow, some may even say, that there is a lack of chemistry in love story, but perhaps the biggest blame was, that the actors just didn't do their job correctly. That the entire crew looked just ""too cool"", wearing classy clothes, big smiles and trendy sun-glasses.Ups, i named more than one thing, so the impression is, I didn't liked the movie. Errr, wrong.

216,vasco_cid,The ending worths the movie.,1,18 March 2002,"When one sees the movie poster of Ocean's Eleven, one sees it is directed by last year's academy award winner director Steven Soderbergh, and it stars a fantastic cast, uniting some of the most talented actors nowadays. The story isn't new, everyone knows that, a man recently came out of prison, wants to rob three casinos. Starts hiring professionals to do it, but soon we know that he is not doing this work only by the pleasure of stealing. He is also doing this because the casino's owner wife happens to be his ex-wife, whom he wants back. Done. The movie itself is disappointing halfway in, I myself wondered in what mess I was, and how much disappointed I was, also, I became aware that Steven Soderbergh ISN'T the director they make of him.  He is not that great. There are some directors, which we recognize their work, miles away, by being unique. Soderbergh's work is recognizable not for it, but to be similar to many others: shoulder camera Only when the end was coming I start thrilling myself. Twists. A worlwhind of twists one after another, all of them making perfect sense. By the end I could tell what elegance it was, not the beginning, not the middle, but the ending. All eleven characters working together at the same time. The robbing itself was great, and Brad Pitt's call was humorous but expiring charm and intelligence. After all, Ocean's Eleven is not what many expected of it. Is just us watching a talented cast doing something good and fun.

219,DanB-4,Escapism,8,15 June 2005,"Ocean's 11 is the kind of movie you want to watch when you want to be entertained, you want to think but you don't want to have to think, if that makes any sense.I would describe this as an 'honor amongst thieves' film in the line of The Sting, and of course its original predecessor. There are no good guys, just various levels of likable and dis-likable bad guys. The straightest arrow of the cast, casino owner Terrry Benedict (Garcia) is made to be the film most dis-likable character.The story is about Danny Ocean (Clooney), who is just released from prison. His first act is to break parole and the state for Las Vegas, where he meets up with his old buddy Rusty (Pitt). They decide that they want to do the impossible, knock over 3 casinos simultaneously, with their impenetrable security systems. They assemble a team of nine thieves, and the bulk of the movie is the caper itself.In spite of the star power, this is a skillfully made ensemble drama, with the likes of Don Cheadle, Elliot Gould, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia all content in breezy supporting roles. The true joy of this film is watching the robbery unfold. Steven Soderberg does not make a single wrong directorial decision here.Ocean's 11 is a fun ride - a movie worth owning. It has zero social value, but at the same time, there is nothing really objectionable. It has a completely implausible plot, but we never care because it is wonderful escapist entertainment. ***1/2 out of ****.",Ocean's Eleven

222,Mr. Pulse,A damn entertaining movie.,9,12 December 2001,"Ocean's 11 is nothing less than the most fun I've had in a movie theater this year.  It doesn't have huge laughs, or gigantic stunts, or expensive effects.  It's got a tight script, great stars in top form, and some snazzy photography.I'm probably biased; Steven Soderbergh is my favorite working director. After a year with the phenomenal Traffic and the underrated Erin Brockavich (Both nominated for Best Picture Oscars), he aims for nothing less than a pure entertainment movie.  And he flat out succeeds.  There are few scenes in Ocean's 11 that don't burst off the screen; and after the fifteen minute mark of the film, it doesn't rest until the epilogue.  In between, it's a pure heist picture that will gratify fans of the genre and probably just about anyone else.In the amoral world of the film our heroes are a (almost) dozen crooks, thieves, scam artists, cons, and experts, led by Daniel Ocean (George Clooney), recently released from prison and out for some serious cash.  His crew's played with flair and a lot of cool by (among others) Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, and Don Cheadle with a nasty British accent.  They're looking to knock off three casinos owned by the nasty Terry Benedict (the glowering Andy Garcia).  Since he's really mean, and he's with Danny's ex-wife Tess (The glowing Julia Roberts) casino robbings made both fun and right.I kid; it really doesn't matter that these guys are crooks.  They, along with the whole film, are so likeable, it doesn't matter.  Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffith pull off surprise after surprise, constantly wratcheting up the pressure on the heist.  Kudos also to the precise, calculated editing.  The movie is a manipulative ride, and it never stops working.You walk out of the movie feeling cooler just by seeing it.  There's a swagger in your step and a glint in your eye.  So it's not just a fine film; it's a public service for geeks.  Just go see it folks.",Ocean's Eleven

225,Captain Ed,Cool and clever dialogue makes this a guilty pleasure,8,10 January 2003,"Ocean's Eleven is never going to be mistaken for Shakespeare. However, its cool and clever dialogue and typical heist hijinks makes it a good popcorn movie, especially in light of its all-star cast.While there is some truth that at some points the cast gets so cool they almost seem asleep, for the most part they fulfill their primary purpose: to deliver their well-written quips and, basically, look good.  George Clooney and Brad Pitt are terrific at this, and Andy Garcia is both menacing and cool as the casino owner that the gang targets, for multiple reasons. Scott Caan and Casey Affleck are funny as ever-quarrelling brothers.  It is delightful to see Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in meaty supporting roles; so often, Reiner only makes cameo appearances, and I can't remember the last time Gould was fully engaged in a role -- maybe American History X, and before that who knows?  Julia Roberts operates on autopilot as she isn't given much to do here, and the normally outstanding Don Cheadle affects an atrocious Cockney accent and utters the worst pseudo-cool lines:  ""We're in Barney ... Barney.  Barney Rubble. TROUBLE!!""  Oh, please.  As for his voice, think Nicolas Cage in ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", and you'll get an idea how annoying it is.All that aside, the movie starts out slowly but builds momentum throughout. Soderberg uses the camera stylishly (what else is new?) and gives the heist genre a new look.  Lastly, the score is terrific and matches up with the dialog and action, but never overpowers it.  Obviously, this is lightweight material, especially for Soderberg after ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"", but give the man a break -- he's allowed to do something for pure fun occasionally.  That's what this movie is, pure popcorn-munching fun.  Are you in or out?  I'm in for an 8.",Ocean's Eleven
226,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Exhilarating, Delicious, Super-charged Fun",10,2 June 2004,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is the kind of light-hearted, enjoyable crime caper which becomes better, more enjoyable, and more intelligent upon multiple viewings. My initial overview of this film was that it was too much technicality and seriousness to be enjoyable and worthwhile. Now, having seen this film over and over again, I become bemused by its charisma, sophistication, and suave enterprise on a most exciting concept. The film plots parolee thief Daniel Ocean (Clooney) and ten of his selected ""instruments"" in the brilliant, if precarious scheme of robbing three prestigious Vegas casinos in the hopes of collecting on ""eight figures each"". Sounds enticing, yet how could such a scheme be executed, especially considering that nobody has ever succeeded in pulling it off? This film chronicles the endeavor and style of this cool, unerring gang to succeed in the impossible, to score magnificently, and to salvage certain losses (Ocean rebounding his wife, Tess, from the man he is determined to rob). The beauty and genius of this delightful, smart crime caper is its palatable premise (diverse characters working toward individual goals), its confident conviction (detailing every aspect and technicality of its theme), and its eventual denoument (which I can attest is the most consummate and rewarding conclusions in my knowledge of cinema). Every character shines, the script is smart and witty, and the style is more cool and suave than any scenario out of James Bond or Shaft. Glorious, triumphant execution of the most delicious of concepts. How cool can any film get? **** out of ****",Ocean's Eleven

I think the best role was played by Brad Pitt, he was just brilliant and hilarious. The whole cast had chemistry which I think is an essential element if you want a movie like this to work. I have to say Julia Robert's role was very hyped but it was so minor, she was a good ensemble but nothing special.I loved it!",Ocean's Eleven
228,smashattack,Exceptional!,8,10 November 2002,"Like Mission:  Impossible's excellence in espionage performance, Ocean's Eleven follows along the same track with cunning thievery, great cast, enjoyable music, and above average plot.  I was surprised to find this movie to be much, much more than a dim-witted attempt at something like Gone in 60 Seconds (which was a poor remake of an ancient film).George Clooney hits the spotlight as a recently released prisoner.  He wants to go back to his life of crime and rob a ring of casinos in Las Vegas. Immediately the movie jumps into the plot, as he meets up with Brad Pitt's character and together they plan the world's greatest robbery.  The amount of time spent and effort put into this theft is amazing, and I could not tear my eyes away from the screen as their plan slowly took form.  The moviemakers surely have brains with enormous capacity to do all this.Ocean's Eleven is based off an older movie, but I'm not sure how closely it matches its counterpart.  I've not seen it, so I can't comment on that.The music, although not a huge part of the movie, was great and fit in perfectly.  Not too heavy and loud, but up enough so that it filled the atmosphere with a sneaky attitude that made me think of the NOC list download in Mission:  Impossible.The only downside I can find of Ocean's Eleven is the huge lack of character development.  Most of the super-thieves we meet in the movie are hardly explained.  We know little about them.  They are a great addition to the movie, and some of them provide excellent comic relief, but I felt the audience should know a little more about them.That problem is nothing compared to the sheer brilliance of this movie.  It kept me intrigued the entire time, as the actual theft began no less than halfway through the movie.I was extremely impressed by Ocean's Eleven.  I can recommend it to anybody, as it has no nudity or extreme violence.  The language gets a little harsh at some points, but overall it's a decent movie.  The actual idea of thievery is underscored by a deeper purpose which attempts to send a clear message that thievery is still not right.  Morals, although masked, are still present in this exceptional movie.",Ocean's Eleven
229,nzpedals,"Alas, it's all fantasy",8,13 January 2016,"In the commentary by Damon, Garcia and Pitt, one of them points out that in any other town, these people would be the bad guys, but because it is Vegas, and they are rolling a casino, it's OK, and we all applaud! But of course, the casino owners know that too, and that is why the security is so tight and so few attempts get very far (search for casino robbery to learn fascinating stuff!).It is so slick, it flows so well, we know who every one is and what they are doing - mostly. The basic idea is simple, use some ""Mission Impossible"" type fancy technology and equipment and then just go. All the acting is superb, and there is nothing wrong with the production and directing. Although lots of goofs have been spotted, they are all trivial. There are also lots of great lines, (check out the 'quotes' section)My problem is in later trying to work out just how they did it, ie, Ocean explains to the others that the $150+M will be split evenly between them, but later, he trades half of it all to get his ex-wife back?

That's the only interesting part of the movie, watching the actors interact and see them doing their work. Although I like most of the lead roles, I've seen much better performances. The plot is simple enough, a robbery of a casino. The only problem is that it's not a bit exciting. Everything goes smooth, nothing fails, and they get the money. Although a bit clever, it feels like the original parts are stolen from movies I have yet to see. When all's said and done, the movie leaves you with a feeling of being cheated of something; How did you get so many stars to make this boring movie?

Soderbergh is in full control and delivered a work which seems effortless. Like making a film(and a robbery) could not be easier than this. I enjoyed this film very much and everyone who like to be enjoyed and entertained should go and see the film.",Ocean's Eleven
237,shimenpf,Always moving,8,3 July 2019,"This is an example of a screenplay that keeps the conflict up and, therefore, is entertaining from beginning to end. Every single scene has conflict, sometimes so subtle it's artistic. The main characters are very likable, the revelations, specially in the climax, are very well executed, and the action is non-stop, even if it doesn't mean weapons and shots all over the place. The pace is fast, which might cause a little trouble following, and perhaps a little more of setting up some of the stuff of the third act would've been nice, since there are a few points in the script the audience could've never anticipated with the provided information. Even with that, it's a great, very entertaining experience.",Ocean's Eleven
238,matlefebvre20,The greatest sin of Sin City,7,29 July 2006,"There are some stories which you know from the start that it won't be worth five-star. The only thing you can do is making the best with what you have and hope that it will be worth the try. Caper movies are like that. It's too much unbelievable, high-tech gadgetry is overly used and robbers rarely appear to be real human beings.""Ocean's Eleven"" is that kind of movie, but the major difference between it and the other heist movies is that it works well, whatever the difficulties might be. Directed by the always excellent Steven Soderbergh and starring Soderbergh's favorite George Clooney as the title role, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of the best heist movies since a very long time and I appreciated every bit of it, from the first to the last second.Released about six months after the disappointing and violence-laden ""3000 Miles to Graceland"", ""Eleven"" only focuses on the complicated and meticulous planning of the robbery and the robbery itself, instead of making it a silly and looking-easy launching element, like in ""3KMTG"". And that's all we need. We don't need an aftermath with stupid inner battles about who's gonna keep the loot and what is gonna happen to the robbers' associations. There's also a surprisingly low amount of violence and there is no gunfight and no car chase, which is well-welcomed in that domain.In a sense, it's like ""The Score"" from the same year, but on a much larger and more spectacular scale. Instead of two guys stealing a single scepter in a federal building of Montreal, you get eleven guys who try to rob $160,000,000 from three casinos in Las Vegas.The eleven guys are the following ones: Danny Ocean (George Clooney), a charismatic and professional thief who's leading the operation; Rusty (Brad Pitt), Ocean's loyal right-hand man; Reuben (Elliot Gould), an extravagant casino owner who is also a longtime friend of Danny and Rusty; Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), two very dysfunctional brothers from Utah; Livingston (Eddie Jemison), the electronic specialist; Basher (Don Cheadle), a bomb expert; Yen (Shaobo Kin), a Chinese acrobat; Saul (Carl Reiner), a con artist; Frank (Bernie Mac), a croupier and Linus (Matt Damon), a young pickpocket who becomes the rookie of the gang which makes that he's not aware of the strict rules and codes of the caper game.That's a very long list of characters. But the casting has some kind of genius. The characters are so different and so good that we never lose ourselves among them. It's not like in ""Platoon"", where the casting is some kind of labyrinth.When you listen to Ocean describing the vault and all of the obstacles that await the 'Eleven Team', you wonder how they're gonna make it in the most realistic way possible. Well, the screenplay is so well crafted that it can only make the viewer satisfied. Screenwriters include plot twists and safe-cracking elements without losing themselves in the complex storyline. And some scenes are so surprising that they're funny. Not ridiculous. Funny.The boxing championship tournament is an excellent background and it's good to see Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko marching pass the crowd in the MGM Grand arena. The way that Soderbergh pictures the scenes give some grandeur to this event, which is not something that every filmmaker do.Anyway, every Vegas spot is well shot and it makes you see that Sin City is not an ordinary America town. The crowds' reactions to the provoked black-out are eye-catching and brilliant. The final 'Team' scenes near the Bellaggio fountains are gorgeous and beautiful. So, all in all, every shot is well done...George Clooney is good as Danny Ocean. He's as cool and charismatic as he looks, but he ends up getting too much Mr. I-know-all for me. But every character does the adequate job. Julia Roberts' performance is very mixed, but when she's good, she's good for real. Her relationship with Terry Benedict, the casino owner played by Andy Garcia, is not very convincing, but her loyalty for Danny Ocean is quite good.Directed on a very epic scale with an incredible list of A-rated Hollywood actors, ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a real success, from the very first scenes to the very last scenes. No less, no more. It's a pure delight.",Ocean's Eleven

I have already watched and enjoyed the first one a long time ago so when I saw it available for purchase on Google play for only $24,99, I didn't hesitate to buy the bundle.I don't regret my purchase. I watched the first movie and I got hooked immediately. The script is not very deep. It's one of those stories about one guy, Danny Ocean, an ex con who just got out of prison on parole and who decides to get back the woman he always loved, Tess, in add of robbing the man she loves now, the very rich and ruthless owner of the three biggest casinos of Las Vegas. In order to do that, he assembled a very typical crew which we follow in the preparation and execution of this very risky job.The main force of this movie is the cast which is very glamour and cool. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia among others are bringing their touch to the movie and it produces a lot of appeal. We could imagine their ego to take the best of them but actually the alchemy between them works as magic. They are funny, the movie is not violent at all and there are memorable lines throughout the movie.Then you have Las Vegas and its ambiance of constant party, where money is pouring out everywhere in a very lavish style. As the main setting of the plot, Vegas is a character on its own and it's very beautiful to see especially at night.The music is also very matching the general mood of the flick. It's jazzy and enjoyable to hear. It adds to the general feeling that Ocean's Eleven is a polished movie with a glamorous cast and an entertaining story.Now it's time for me to go watch the second movie, Ocean's twelve, which should be as good as this very nice intro.

242,knucklebreather,A real winner,9,26 December 2011,"2001 was unusually awash in heist movies. Ever a popular genre, 2001's crop included one with top box office draws (Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell in the horrible ""3000 Miles to Graceland""), a pairing of two cinema legends (Robert de Niro and Marlin Brando in ""The Score"") and acclaimed writer David Mamet's take on the genre (a film simply called ""Heist"").With all of this competition, perhaps the least likely candidate to yield a memorable film was ""Ocean's 11"", which was a remake of a long-forgotten rat pack movie directed by the hit-or-miss Steven Soderbergh with a cast (other than Elliott Gould) better known for their looks and celebrity than their acting chops at the time.Movies are often more than the sum of their parts, and ""Ocean's 11"" is not just the clear winner of the crowded 2001 class of heist movies, but one of the greats of the genre. With a jazzy soundtrack that literally hits all the right notes for a hip, sleek movie, ""Ocean's 11"" is shot much in the style of then-recent movies like ""Casino"" and ""Boogie Nights"" with a rolling, non-stop story set to a great soundtrack that keeps presenting you with interesting new things and never making you sit through a tedious scene.The story is wonderfully simple, and gets around the basic problems of the heist genre (revealing too much too soon about how the climactic heist is going to work) in a fun way that isn't heavy-handed. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) recruits a crew of odd but talented criminals, each with their own specialty, for an unprecedented robbery of three Las Vegas casinos. And, as the gang is surprised to find out, this may be as much about getting back Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts), who is married to the ruthless and ice-cold owner of the casinos in question.No one is going to confuse this with a serious movie about criminality, this plan would no more work in the real world than the idiotic one in ""3000 Miles to Graceland""), but the charm of ""Ocean's 11"" is that it's so sleek and fun with its great music, frenzied pacing and larger-than-life characters that you don't really even care about the deviations from reality.Forget the sequels and the other heist movies of 2001, ""Ocean's 11"" is the only winner here.",Ocean's Eleven

244,WilsonLau,Ocean's 11 - Julia Roberts = very good movie,9,19 August 2002,"You probably already know this but I just want to express my positive opinions about this remake. This film was the best multi-star casted movie I have ever watched. Most movies with this much star power only relies on it and forgets that theres more to making movies than casting. Ocean's Eleven exceeds those expectations and achieves the most important things. It first of all has a well executed plot, secondly it has believeabilty in plot as well as characters, and finally achieves the most important thing which is to entertain the audience and avoids insulting the intelligence of the viewer. It doesn't require over-the-top stunts and explosions to thrill, doesn't need to jump off cliffs, get chased by avalanches, or integrate phony martial arts sequences. However Ocean's 11 doesn't get and 11, or a 10. It is a good movie, well put together but it seems to fall short from greatness just a little bit. The talentless phony Roberts ruins it for me. She proves the point once again that anyone could have played her part and that theres no need for her. 8.5/10",Ocean's Eleven

The first 45 minutes had a few slow spots and you could tell by the restlessness in the audience and then things started to happen. Many surprises along the way. Those little plots within plots that keep you guessing and edgy for the whole movie.

They are all wonderful in their roles. The script is snappy, slick, and very good dialogue. I love the speech to George Clooney gives to Brad Pitt, who then asks, ""You've been practicing this speech, haven't you?"". Also, the heist itself is brilliant.

249,RolloTomasi,Easy money,7,13 December 2001,"Danny Ocean and his co-conspirators are looking to do the impossible. They're not even as careful as they should be about it. They want to see just how far they can push their luck. So it's appropriate that the establishment they are knocking over is a casino (actually, three casinos that share one ridiculously secure vault). Steven Soderbergh is trying to continue a streak of great directorial efforts, to give us an encore after winning an Academy Award. To do it, he's assembled a cast that reads more like a producer's wish list. Soderbergh got all of 'em. Knocking over three casinos in one night? Impossible. The guy responsible for two out of five Best Picture nominees last year making a movie that people will want to watch starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Matt Damon? Well heck, that's just easy. Whether it's good or not is a different proposition and, perhaps, a moot one.     
The film takes no time to explore what's at stake for any of the eleven, except Ocean himself. Each man's take is not that much in movie terms, roughly $13.6 million. So why risk it? Even exploring the lives of three of four characters would have sufficed. So I guess they just want money. For what? Well, because--the house always wins. Elliott Gould's character, when the idea is proposed to him, tells Ocean he'll need a crew just as crazy as he is. So assemble he does, many crazy fellows. But what exactly makes them so crazy? Why are they selected? Soderbergh didn't want to spend too much time on assembling the group, so he had to leave much crucial information out. And it hurts. Not that Soderbergh and HIS crew don't put on a good show anyway. He's brought several actors together who are used to carrying films by themselves and asked them to play minor character roles. Budget plummets, net profits soar. This move should represent something very positive in the filmmaking community--the idea that acting is fun and work is work (though even the reduced rate each A-lister here was paid is more than the average American makes in ten lifetimes). The problem is they risked nothing. This film could not miss. Everyone involved is obviously having a blast, but the film never finds a soul. It's too busy being cool and clever.   So cool is ""Ocean's Eleven"" in fact, that I missed that there's barely a curse word, no sex, no violence. Nil. A caper movie like this typically has plenty of each, but not this. Not that  Soderbergh seems to be necessarily avoiding them. These things that are meant to add something to films--sex, violence, profanity--are like a subject in a conversation that just never comes up. Soderbergh shoots this one himself, as he did with ""Traffic."" I wonder how much the guy actually directed on this one. With this kind of acting talent, who tries to direct? Even before he won his Best Director Oscar, he was probably thinking about a project in which he could be mostly a cameraman. That's why ""Eleven"" falls far short of ""Traffic,"" ""The Limey,"" and ""Out of Sight."" But then, you can't hit one out of the park every time you step up to the plate.Grade: B-",Ocean's Eleven
250,huggy_bear,Cheesey but Fun!,5,21 October 2003,"Great acting all about this movie, just finding one part of it believable is the trouble.  Yeah, I know, it's only entertainment, but hey, at least some of it can be believable.  To say that anyone could talk eleven people into robbing a casino without telling anyone is highly unlikely.  But I have to admit, it was a fun movie to watch.  Nice to see the underdog come out ahead.  I would recommend this.",Ocean's Eleven
251,Manthorpe,Ocean's Impossible.,7,8 July 2004,"Bust out the popcorn and leave all of your realistic criticism at the door and be prepared for some good old-fashioned entertainment. We all know Soderbergh can make a very gritty and realistic film as we saw him do with Traffic, so it's a little hard to rip this movie for it's lack of realism since it's safe to say that it was never meant to be so.
An ensemble cast with mostly decent actors definitely helps OE, although there are a few that I think we could've done without. Maybe it's just the fact that Julia Roberts makes me want to gag, or maybe it's the fact that Don Cheadle can't pull off a British accent that well, but something about the characters annoys me. Overall though, they're fairly decent but could've been a tad stronger. Andy Garcia and Brad Pitt are the definite standouts.The premise of the film itself, the scheme to rob three casinos simultaneously, is let's face it, completely impossible although entertaining. And some of the tools this crew uses are straight from James Bond's workshop and are very unlikely to be available to anyone. But hey, it's not trying to be realistic and really doesn't need to be. It's simply a fun popcorn caper that never expects the viewer to take it too seriously. The plot to the heist itself is fairly amusing and clever. Overall great entertainment even if not a great film. Don't expect too much, especially realism, and you won't feel disappointed.",Ocean's Eleven

Even with some of the most popular faces, gifted director and publicity machine of war, I experienced a film that was averagely interesting to watch, at best.

In the scene where Dany and the staff next to him entered the safe, the Chinese man would have been seriously injured if they had not detonated the bomb a little late. The movie also strikes the fact that some people's religion is money. ""If I gave you $ 160 million, would you give up the Thesis?"" Actually, this question is asked to the audience secretly somewhere. Which of you would give up your lover / spouse !!!.The music is exactly the kind that reflects the spirit of this kind of movies. Rusty's message of constant junk food, unhealthy food, even to the subtle American people, is a message that you are on your way to becoming an obese generation that eats like this.

There were no scenes of ya-hoo nor hurrah after they pulled off the heist.  No scenes of them counting the money.  And we do not get to see all the money they stolen afterwards. There was no emotional nor dramatic pay-off for the audience.                                               What really unnerved me was that old let's-move-the-camera-fast around the room trick.  The cameo appearance of Angie Dickinson was all to quick and then the camera rushed over to Wayne Newton.  I would have loved to have seen Angie Dickinson a little bit more than just a blink of an eye.  They should have given Ms. Dickinson a good, juicy role to play in this film.  I missed other cameos too. They must have been all too quick.  I am all for happy endings, but the very last scene (""three to six months later"") was dull.  Only a sequel could make up for it.  Could they make a sequel?  Would we love to see this cast together again make another casino heist?   You betcha!  But considering all the trouble and red tape it took to get this film made and the voluntary pay cuts the actors allowed to help get this film made, I think a sequel is highly unlikely.

256,Jackblyth8,A Real Treat,8,28 January 2021,"The American heist directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Ted Griffin provides us with a fast-paced theft performed by an excellent ensemble cast, including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia, Bernie Mac and Julia Roberts. The film is a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is released from prison and violates his parole by travelling to California to meet his partner-in-crime and friend Rusty Ryan to propose a heist. The two go to Las Vegas to pitch the plan to wealthy friend and former casino owner Reuben Tishkoff. The plan consists of simultaneously robbing the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos. Reuben's familiarity with casino security makes him very reluctant to get involved, but when he starts to think of it as a good way to get back at his rival, Terry Benedict, who owns all three casinos, Reuben agrees to finance the operation. Because the casinos are required by the Nevada Gaming Commission to have enough cash on hand to cover all their patrons' bets, the three predict that on the upcoming night of a highly anticipated boxing match, the Bellagio vault will contain more than $150,000,000. Ocean is clearly quite rebellious in his ways, and somewhat greedy. His release from prison for him is just an excuse to assemble a group and steal north of $100,000,000. The heist itself is carefully thought by Danny who gathers Rusty instantly, Brad Pitt's character seems extremely artful and cunning, his coolness playing blackjack in our first viewing of him reinforces this. The pair recruit eight former colleagues and criminal specialists: Linus Caldwell, a young and talented pickpocket; Frank Catton, a casino worker and con man: Virgil and Turk Malloy, a pair of gifted mechanics; Livingston Dell, an electronics and surveillance expert; Basher Tarr, an explosives expert; Saul Bloom, an elderly con man; and ""The Amazing"" Yen, an accomplished acrobat . Several team members carry out reconnaissance at the Bellagio to learn as much about the security, routines, the behaviours of the casino staff, and the building itself. Other members create a precise replica of the vault with which to practice manoeuvring through its formidable security systems. During this planning phase, the team discovers that Danny's ex-wife, Tess, is Benedict's girlfriend. Rusty urges Danny to give up on the plan, believing Danny is incapable of sound judgement while Tess is involved, but Danny refuses. The 11 men involved manifests the title, but the specialists recruited are chosen all to play to their strengths, making the heist doable through the hope that everyone plays their part efficiently. At this point of the film it seems to come together quickly, with Soderbergh keeping the watch entertaining and enticing. With Tess currently partnered to Benedict, the heist (if pulled off) would be all the sweeter for Ocean who evidently still has feelings for Julia Roberts' character. On the night of the fight between Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko, the plan is put into motion. Danny shows up at the Bellagio purposely to be seen by Benedict, who, as predicted, locks him in a storeroom with Bruiser, a bouncer. However, Bruiser is on Danny's payroll and allows him to access the vent system and join his team as they seize the vault, coincident with activities of their other team members in and around the casino. Rusty calls Benedict on a cell phone Danny dropped in Tess's coat earlier and tells him that unless he lets them have half of the the money in the vault, they will blow it up; Benedict sees video footage confirming Rusty's claim. Benedict complies, having his bodyguards take the loaded duffel bags to a waiting van driven by remote control. Benedict has his men follow the van, while he calls in a SWAT team to try to secure the vault. The SWAT team's arrival causes a shootout that sets off the explosives and incinerates the remaining cash. After affirming the premises otherwise secure, the SWAT team collects their gear and departs. The eleven, completely in their element, execute the plan so far to perfection and are able to catch Benedict in two minds. Rusty is at the heart of the operation, and his portrayal across the screenplay is perpetual, his ongoing nature of strong etiquette and focus allows the heist to run smoothly and is dearly trusted by Danny. As Benedict heads to examine the ruined vault himself, his men stop the van and find the bags were only loaded with flyers for prostitutes. Benedict studies the video footage and recognises that the flooring in the vault on the video lacks the Bellagio logo, which had been added only recently to the vault. It is shown that Danny's team used their practice vault to create fake footage to fool Benedict. Furthermore, they themselves were the SWAT team and used their gear bags to take all the money from the vault right under Benedict's nose. Benedict goes to see that Danny has seemingly been locked up in the storeroom throughout the heist and thus innocent of any crime. As Tess watches via CCTV, Danny tricks Benedict into saying he would give up Tess in exchange for the money. Benedict, unsatisfied with Danny's plan to get back the money, orders his men to escort Danny off the premises and inform the police that he is violating his parole by being in Las Vegas. Tess leaves Benedict and exits the hotel just in time to see Danny arrested. The rest of the team bask in the victory in front of the Fountains of Bellagio, silently going their separate ways one-by-one. When Danny is released after serving time for his parole violation, he is met by Rusty and Tess. They drive off, closely followed by Benedict's bodyguards. The film, lasting for 127 minutes, symbolises the integral ability of teamwork, organisation and leadership in a team. Looking beyond the fact that the 11 are robbing a casino, they need to be credited for pioneering their way to the execution of the plan. Danny Ocean's arrest is worth the money he'd installed from the theft, and his seemingly innocent role in the heist is extremely impressive. The image of the 11 watching the fountain waves in unison, allows the viewers to join each individual in considering the mastery of an extraordinary heist. Certainly worth the watch.",Ocean's Eleven

Viva Los Onces!,10,31 May 2002,"a week after seeing lord of the rings (outstanding movie by the way), dad asked my brother and i if we wanted to go see oceans eleven. i said, sure, it deals with vegas, why not? well, we went to see it and i must say, this is a great movie! i compared it to the 1960 version, and i must say, the newer one is better. the 60's version just got big names together, like frank sinatra for example, and did nothing else with the movie. it was pretty cheesey too. the new one, on the other hand, provided a great cast, a better touch on the storyline, and some funny lines and moments. this is a great movie to see if you ever wanted to see ""high tech"" bank robberies. go for it!",Ocean's Eleven

Quickly it's a quirky, kind of funny thriller and, as my dad says, ""cop and robber"" movie"", only you are rooting for the robbers. George Clooney plays the leader and the whole ""Scooby Gang"" gets together to do some big heist or something and pulls it off against all odds. The cast in all of them is stellar. It's a tour d' force of good actors. Nothing about them really stands out and I don't really run out to see them, but they are always pretty fun entertaining, never a complete waste of time.

260,tbabe29,Letter To Steven Soderbergh,7,8 December 2001,"Dear Steven,Please quit putting Julia Roberts in all your movies. She's not THAT great. I realize she is the most famous movie star in the world and the studios love her bankability.....but. You know better. Come on......she was not right for the Oceans 11 role.  It should have been a woman with more grace, say...Catherine Zeta Jones.  Julia is a little too rough around the edges. She plays a hooker well and a single mom of three....a street walking cinderella, if you will.I love George Clooney. You have my permission to use him in every movie you do for the rest of your life. Okay. Maybe only roles he is best suited for. So far so good. You also could have cast Tom Cruise in that role. That would have been pretty good. He's smart, sexy and very likeable.Brad Pitt....egh. Not bad, not great either. Matt Damon....ROCKS. Andy Garcia....ROCKS. The Guy who played the card dealer rocked. Cheadle....what was up with the unnecessary accent? Affleck & the other young guy: HILARIOUS. Sometimes less is more. Good job with them. Elliott Gould: I love this guy! Carl Reiner: How cute.This movie was cute. Entertaining, predictable and cute.

264,DorianWynHowells,An entertaining film,8,20 February 2002,"I haven't seen the original 'Rat Pack' version, and to be honest, from what I've heard, I don't want to. So instead, when I heard good word of mouth and read some good reviews, and was aware of the cast, I had to see this!This film is very slick. Very cool. And very laid back. Perhaps a little too laid back. Nevertheless, this film offers it's audience an entertaining time.Pitt, Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, Damon, Cheadle. Mouth-watering? Yep! Good old Steve has rounded up a top notch cast here, and the results are very good. Clooney and Pitt work well off each other, and they ground the film.The locations are beautiful, with Vegas actually looking great - well it is! Andy Garcia puts in a performance worthy of his talents, he is truly menacing without resorting to Al Pacino screams! He projects a quiet menace.The actual robbery is very good, the build up is great, and the way they do it, is just pure audacity and sure planning. This film oozes cool. Clooney does well in his role, and is as charming as ever. And when you see Brad Pitt in a hair-piece that looks like a dead cat, I guarantee you'll laugh! That was one of the best moments of the film for me - a 2 second shot! Priceless.  If you've got nothing to do on a Friday night, and you and your mates are restless, go and see this film, you'll come out with a smile on your face I'm sure. And Girls? You should go to see it for Clooney, Pitt, and Damon...and of course the plot, the locations etc etc!Doesn't deserve a perfect 10, but it did make an entertaining night out!8/10Enjoy!",Ocean's Eleven
265,Ysman,A lifeless cash cow that could have been great,4,20 December 2001,"Ocean's Eleven is a boring, smug, lifeless film.  The real shame is that it could have been oh so much better.  All the elements of a great film are there: intriguing premise, incredible cast, and an Oscar winning, stylistic director.  So what went wrong?  The premise really is never interesting as it seems.  The heist goes off so smoothly that the film never builds any tension whatsoever.  The bad guys are never as bad as they are made out to be and stealing from Vegas seems to be as easy as taking candy from a baby. The cast is all star, however they have all been better elsewhere or they aren't given much to do.  Clooney has played this role before in Out of Sight (a much better Soderberg film).  Brad Pitt is cool but he never adds much to the film other than a handsome set piece.  Andy Garcia is the much feared baddie who does nothing but turn the other cheek when his fortune is being robbed.  Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Gould are woefully misused as set dressing rather than full fledged characters.  The film would have been much better had it focused on these characters rather than Clooney and Pitt.  Julia Roberts' skeleton has a mere cameo role and really adds nothing to the picture.  That said, Ocean's Eleven is not a bad film.  It has a few moments of genuine cleverness and a couple of chuckles. But it could have been so much better.  Mamet's Heist, Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Soderberg's own Out of Sight are much better at the robbery game.  I really hope this is a minor stumble in the career of Soderberg and it isn't the Oscar curse that is overtaking him.  We shall see.",Ocean's Eleven
266,johanleupen,"There's nothing remarkable here, but Ocean's Eleven is very entertaining nonetheless.",7,11 January 2002,"In this eagerly awaited, star-studded remake of the 60s rat-pack crime-caper of the same name, Soderbergh manages to combine his dry sense of wit, beautifully stilized camerawork and a few enjoyable performances in a very pleasant way. Admittedly, Soderbergh ignores the fact that his plot doesn't really hold together at times, also the insertion of various catchy one-liners feels fabricated and forced on a few occasions, but all things considered there's a lot of fun to be had here if you don't take it all too seriously as some critics have. Granted, Ocean's Eleven doesn't tacklesocial problematics (nor did Soderbergh aim to in the first place of course)  and it certainly isn't a masterpiece but it creates a very uncomplicated, laid-back vibe that is really enjoyable most of the time. This must be largely accredited to the dialogue which is very witty most of the time. The actors all seem very at ease and it is easy to sympathise with these charming crooks, a special notice goes to Versace-clad ex-casino bigshot Elliot Gould. Which leaves for a few minor mishaps which I will address briefly. First of all the character of Julia Roberts isn't very essential to the plot, nor is her appearance special in any way. Therefore it's a shame her storyline with George Clooney takes up so much time in the later part of the story, which concludes in an unnecessarily predictable and well rounded ending. I believe a cameo-appearance would have been more than enough and I'm afraid the scribes were forced to squeeze Roberts into the story. Secondly there is very little character-development or motivation for that matter. Also, no effort is taken to bring any nuance to the 'villain'-character of Andy Garcia, whereas it would have been more interesting to see any redeeming traits in his personality. Garcia delivers a very unremarkable performance that won't raise any eyebrows. Just don't expect Ocean's Eleven to change cinematic landscape for the years to come and you will be fine after two hours well spent.",Ocean's Eleven

I really enjoyed the cleverness of the Oceans Eleven Team that they used to try to get the money. The only thing that I didnt like about this movie was the ending because you didnt know what happened!! But other than that I really enjoyed the cast, all wonderfully casted and gifted. Familiar faces are also seen within the movie. Ocean's Eleven...pretty damn good.",Ocean's Eleven
268,thorodinson-50130,Paved way for heist movies,8,4 September 2021,I heard because of this movie the hype of heist movies are increase. This is the good movie on this genre. Far better than so called overated Money Heist.,Ocean's Eleven
269,RJBose,Clooney's Ego,5,22 January 2003,"The original ""Ocean's 11"" (1960) famously starred Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin and several other well-known stars of the era.  The so-called ""Rat Pack"" were friends and the movie, a quickly slapped together story involving robbing the vaults of several Las Vegas casinos, was as much a lark for them as the movie-going audience.  The modern version shamelessly appropriates the title and plot of the original film, but completely misses the point, and several major components of the first version, settling instead to be a vanity piece for the smirking but boring Mr. Clooney and company.In 1960 Las Vegas was a relatively new venue, which had erupted from the desert in what was still a very undeveloped and rustic Nevada.  World War II had ended only 15 years before, and the United States was going through a period of tremendous economic growth and optimism.  The original Danny Ocean (Mr. Sinatra) and his crew had all served during the war together in the 82nd Airborne Division, and therefore were trained commandoes, and very used to working as a team.  The concept of the movie is that this team of commadoes uses their wartime skills to plan and carry-out an elaborate scheme to simultaneously rob the vaults of the adjacent casinos on the strip in Las Vegas.  In the original, the plan moves smoothly, until a very unexpected development deprives them of their ill-gotten gains.  They leave, satisfied that their plan worked, and that the widow of one of their team is provided for, but otherwise none the richer for the criminal activities.The Clooney fantasy is unencumbered by any such notions of plot or message; it's simply all about George and the assembled well-known Hollywood faces recruited to mimic the style of the original, which include Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.  Not war heros and comrades who are used to putting their lives in eachothers' hands, but simply an amalgamation of two bit hoods and convenient ""experts"" with apparently limitless funding from a sympathetic gangster (a premise also borrowed from the original)Clooney- himself a small-time robber just out of jail- smugly stumbles his way through the exposition as though this was some type of ""Mission Impossible"" TV show setup.Ridiculous, inane and outright dopey, the updated ""Ocean's 11"" sails along through frantic attempts at clever plot twists and the bad guys make off with the loot, and handsome George seems to be on track to win back his former wife, Julia Roberts.  Guess what? Crime does pay!  Apparently so in this case of stolen ideas and smug self-congratulatory celebrity. Montsrously enough, there are rumors of a sequel.  What's next? Clooney re-recording ""New York, New York""?",Ocean's Eleven
270,ayric,Slick and Fun,8,21 December 2001,"I had to check to make sure and I found out I have seen seven of Soderbergh's films, and they were all good. The least impressive film of his five last was Erin Brockovich and that says it all. Soderbergh doesn't make bad movies.For once, Robert Altman's movie of the year does not hold the most important cast. I think it took nearly one hour before the last star was introduced in Ocean's Eleven. George Clooney is perfect in his role as the mastermind. He is constantly compared to Cary Grant, but he is more than Grant ever was. Pitt continues his row of cool roles, while Andy Garcia makes a a cruel and slick villain of the kind audiences love. The only objection I have to the cast is why they had to bring in Julia Roberts. Her role is so small and uninteresting, she just seems like wasted money. The film is an elegant and clever robbery flick. It is not of the most complicated of the genre, but you will have to be attentive to understand all the plot points. The usual characterization of the movie is that the eleven thieves ""rob three casinos"". This is misleading as they only make one robbery. I believe the vault they were going after contained money from all three casinos, which makes the catch phrase sort of unnecessary.
This film is pure entertainment, and it is not going to be on the Academy's lips - but I believe that was never the intention. Enjoy!Rating: 8/10",Ocean's Eleven

The bank owner (Andy Garcia) is a ruthless man who will stop at nothing to keep his money in his wallet.Several stars join the fun, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. It adds up to a good heist thriller I am glad to have seen...once.

273,Zingbot_9000,Over-rated Big Time,3,3 January 2002,"This movie is about a punk ex-con who is bitter about losing his girlfriend to someone more successful than himself. I personally didn't care for anyone of the characters.  Carl Reiner was the best of the lot.  They were way too bland and because there were so many involved in the heist they didn't have enough time to develop the characters.I expected more.  There was hardly any action or suspense.  Basically a dialogue movie.  And the only dialogue was ""are you in?""  ZZZZZZZZZ. Did any of you think for one second the plan would fail?  Personally I wished it did.  Clooney's character was a punk.  Get over it you are a loser ex-con and lost your girlfriend to someone who was more successful than you.3000 Miles to Graceland was a similar movie that didn't get the positive reviews this movie got and was far more intense and action packed.  The performances were better too.  NO ONE can say that Clooney was better than Costner.  NO ONE.  This movie got great reviews because of two things:  an excellent cast and Soderberg the director.  In my opinion go rent 3000 Miles to Graceland if you can take a lot of violence and foul language (the only reason for poor reviews).",Ocean's Eleven
274,tripper0,uninteresting at best.....,5,19 December 2001,"I really thought 'Traffic' was an excellent film.  It was inventive and extremely interesting.  'Ocean's 11' is the complete opposite.  It is a constant waste of good talent.  The direction is adequate, but it isn't Soderbergh's best work to date.  In fact, it may be the worst thing he has done thus far.  Julia Roberts is under used and her character is of no importance.  She is obviously just in the movie for name sake.  George Clooney is adequate as well, and he and Brad Pitt have excellent chemistry and timing.  Unfortunately the dialogue isn't quite up to par with the talent that they bring to the table.  The only thing in this movie that I loved was the poker game at the beginning of the film with Topher Grace, Joshua Jackson and Holly Marie Combs(I think thats her).  That was the only thing in this film that stood out, and otherwise it was all fairly bland.  A huge disappointment that I couldn't in good conscience recommend.  5 out of 10.",Ocean's Eleven

276,Abby-9,Slick and Tiresome,4,21 March 2002,"Hard to believe that such an elaborately made film could be so boring.  The actors walked through their paces, some adding more interest than others, but few connecting with a core energy. Where was the core energy?  Danny Oceans has big brown eyes (Clooney of course).  It was just a total RELIEF when one of the actors flickered or sizzled for a moment.  Pitt, Roberts, Reiner, Gould-- and the great electronics guy, whose name i don't have. Matt Damon looked hopeful for a while. But, alas, back to old Brown Eyes . . . . Devices were plunk-plunk-plunked and plop-plop-plopped, and then exploded. The sub-juvenile bad boys did their schtick. Actually, i saw this one back-to-back with ""Stuart Little"", which also has an electronically operated situation in it.  ""Stuart Little"" was more exciting. This should have been a good movie, too, even better than S.L.  Did it have an attitude problem?  Was it just a cardboard front so that Soderbergh could film his parody of the Sally Rand scene from ""The Right Stuff""?  (Suddenly, I wanted Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid and Scott Glenn more than i can even say.) And tell me, are the crooks big heroes?  Is their love of money a spiritual experience we should all aspire to? A movie based on assumptions.  Unclear purpose.  A little wit, plenty of cheap thrills.  Maybe too many.",Ocean's Eleven

The cast is really hard to maintain, it's like a dream team, and all want attention. The film is split in three parts, the introduction and recruitment, the planning, and the heist. The film is not only enjoyable for the heist and how it's pulled (which is a surprise only once) but in fact the whole film is enjoyable AGAIN because of the ""bad boys on the run"" tone which is very funny in the way characters are introduced.A sure DVD buy which will give you fun on several viewings.",Ocean's Eleven

279,MissCzarChasm,One Word: WOW,9,8 December 2001,"When i first saw trailers for Oceans 11 i was amazed that they could get a cast like that into a film. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are among Hollywood's elite and the lesser known actors such as Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, and Casey Affleck have made big impressions in other films that they appeared in. Whenever big hollywood actors are in a movie i always want to see if they're actually making a good movie or if they're just putting them together to make a profit and a bad film. Then i heard that Steven Soderbiergh was directing. By that time i was hooked because he directed one of my favorite films; Traffic. After all that time of waiting last night was the night. Opening Night with about 12 of my friends and a semi-packed theatre. After viewing the film i have to say my verdict is......WHAT A DAMN FUN, ENTERTAINING, and CLEVER FILM. Words can't describe how much i loved it. These actors weren't in it just to make a profit they were in it to make a memorable film. I don't want to give any of the plot away because it's just too good but i will tell you what i liked and some things i didn't like about the film.What I Liked:George Clooney and Brad Pitt are the embodiment of charisma. I'm a straight male but there is no denying that these guys possess a lot of style and charm. Not to mention talent. I've always enjoyed George Clooney as an actor and with each film he does he becomes an even better actor. i've always been a fan of Brad Pitt as well. He's just seems like an everyday guy in his films. Very natural and laid back. He's truly at home in this role.The supporting cast is uniformily good. To see Julia Roberts in a supporting role was odd at first but even in the few scenes she's in you can't deny that the girl has talent. Her scenes with Clooney are priceless. The dialouge in these scenes are suitably sassy and snappy. Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac making a lasting impression as well. Don Cheadle is becoming one of my favorite actors and Mac is obviously on his way with this film and his own hit TV show. Matt Damon is good in his role and his chemistry with Clooney during the last act provides us with some truly entertaining and hilarious moments. Andy Garcia makes for a truly suave villian in the film. I haven't seen him in much lately which is quite a shame because he's a wonderful actor. Scott caan and Casey Affleck are a dynamic duo. They provide some of the most hilarious moments in the film and it's because of their off-beat chemistry.Soderbergh is a wonderful filmmaker. He has an obvious love of films and this aids him in making good movies. He knows all the tricks of the trade and he uses them throughout the film. Subtle things are also down through the use of music. Images fly over a hip soundtrack that give the film an edge. This is especially certain during the final few scenes. Soderbergh is probably one of the best directors of our generation.Vegas is a pretty interesting back-drop for everything that goes on. Vegas is basically another character in the film and through Soderbergh's work on the film he gives it a life of its own.The final half of the film is outstanding. So much is going on yet the story flows at a nice pace so we know what is exactly going on.What I didn't Like:I tihnk i only disliked one thing about this film. Some of the dialouge was a bit cheesy but what film doesn't have that. My major gripe in the film was Julia's lack of screentime. She's good in the scenes that she's in but because her character isn't well developed you don't really care about her plight. If julia wasn't playing her however i don't know if any other actress could make you almost care with the screentime that she possesses.It's rare that i dislike one thing about a film. Ocean's 11 has already made it's way into my top twenty and it's most definitely the best film i've seen this year. Very nice work9/10",Ocean's Eleven
280,laursene,Nice use of 'Clair de lune',7,28 December 2004,"Except for the ""3 to 6 months later"" coda, the last 5-6 minutes of the movie is edited so that it's choreographed to a plush orchestration of Debussy's ultra-romantic ""Clair de lune"" piano piece. Very nice little tour de force by Soderbergh, and makes up for the emotional chemistry that doesn't really exist between Clooney and Roberts. One critic famously described how ""Clair de lune"" evokes fountains rising majestically in the moonlight, and that's exactly what we see as our heroes gather to contemplate what they've done. (Not that there isn't something a bit phallic about that particular shot as well - there is, I'm just choosing not dwelling on it here!) What about the rest of the movie?

Talented actors can't turn a boring story into an interesting story, and this movie proves it.I believe that the production companies should learn that a big budget and some big stars isn't the same as a good movie.

I did like Andy Garcia's performance, but it required not much more than looking dark and threatening.  Matt Damon was a big blah and the Cockney guy drove me nuts.  Who the heck is he?  He reminds me of the balloon pilot in The Mummy Returns and he drove me nuts too.  I was impressed by Brad Pitt, however.

George Clooney's normal sparkle is missing: Matt Damon is even more wooden than usual: Brad Pitt is anonymous, and even Julia Roberts is so subdued that you cannot see why Andy Garcia and Clooney are in the least interested in her.The plot - yet another heist - builds up slowly through the standard Hollywood stages - recruitment of team, preparation using a simulation, the robbery and the smart escape. But it's all been done before (not least by Tom Cruise in 'Mission Impossible'). There's no excitement, and the quickfire(?) dialogue is muttered so indistinctly by the cast that half the time you need subtitles to follow what's going on. Worst of all, the hope of an unexpected twist at the end - all that kept me awake through the final stages of this boring film - is ruined by a final sequence crudely and obviously set up only with a sequel in mind. A waste of time.",Ocean's Eleven
289,nucksfan4life,"Great movie, except for the ending",8,18 June 2002,"I loved this remake of the casino heist story. It has an incredible all-star cast that performed brilliantly in their respective roles. The music is also exciting as it lacks almost any vocal parts. Its just a lot of instrumental pieces that really propel the movie to another level of excitement. Watching the thieves plan and carry out the robbery was captivating. This movie never had a dull moment, the action and the fun kept coming. Garcia is great as the owner of the casinos and plays his role so well that you come away cheering the group to rob him of all he's got. I came really close to letting the ending ruin the whole movie for me. It wasn't necessary, and I felt the scene just before the last would have been a perfect ending for the movie.

298,AW_McGOWAN,"Clooney and Soderbergh ""Steal"" Vegas Heist Film",7,26 November 2020,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is a uniquely Las Vegas movie. The lights, casinos, hotels, fountains, and televised boxing matches - all shot on location along the strip - will captivatingly resonate with anyone who has spent time in the Gambling Capital of the World.Sin City is inextricable from the film's plot as well. After being released from prison, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) plans a new heist to rob Vegas' three biggest casinos in a single hit. With the help of his former partner Rusty (Brad Pitt), Ocean puts together a team of eleven to infiltrate and empty the collective vault for the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand.The movie is an ensemble project if there ever was one. Today, the star-power would almost seem overwhelming as Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner and others join Clooney and Pitt for the heist. Matt Damon does not even show up until the film's near-thirty minute mark, playing no more than a tertiary protagonist to complete the titular eleven.Outside of the heist team, Andy Garcia plays the cold, calculated owner of the three casinos. Non-coincidentally, his character is romancing Ocean's ex-wife, played by Julia Roberts. This dynamic feels a little forced, but it effectively adds a hefty dose of humanity to Clooney's devious character.While all of the stars deliver quality performances throughout the film, Clooney undeniably steals the show. Danny Ocean is the textbook definition of a smooth criminal, and Clooney plays the part with such confidence and charm that we both empathize with him and feel his persuasive influence, even as he leads others into perilous situations.Based off of a 1960s movie of the same title and plot, ""Ocean's Eleven"" casts Clooney as a character originally portrayed by Frank Sinatra. Such shoes appear near-impossible to fill, but Clooney manages to fit them with seeming effortlessness. He makes the character his own, but doesn't do so by deviating from Sanatra's old-school masculine suaveness. Instead, he actually manages to polish these traits with added likability, refining the archetype for modern audiences.Star power aside, though, this movie does not take gutless shelter under its rock star cast. The reason why ""Ocean's"" succeeds while other ensemble films fail is because of its smart story. Although there's not enough time to get intimate with all eleven members of the team, no character lacks an identity. Meanwhile, the narrative is complex, suspenseful, and twisty - especially towards the end.Simultaneously, whatever the plot lacks, director Steven Soderbergh makes up for it in style. He clearly gets the best out of his cast, ensuring the characters retain good humor even in the diciest of circumstances. This is in large part thanks to the clever, perfectly timed editing from Stephen Mirrione, who won an Oscar for his pervious work with Soderbergh on ""Traffic.""Under the pseudonym Peter Andrews, Soderbergh also serves as cinematographer. He captures the lavishness of Vegas with the appropriate amount of glamour, but never loses a sense of reality. Once again, it is a Vegas that anyone who's been there can recognize, and the film itself plays like a high-stakes game of chance. Until the end, the audience never really knows who has the best hand; everyone wears their poker faces with a smile and the pot only grows up through the final minute.Like most movies with a major twist, ""Ocean's Eleven"" might not be as stunning the second time around. Nevertheless, it's a bona fide classic in the heist genre, and Soderbergh and Clooney shine so brightly that a rewatch, though not as impactful, could still be quite engaging.",Ocean's Eleven
299,taikman,"Formulaic and nothing deep, but well-acted and very entertaining.",7,5 March 2002,"You could point out how ridiculously complex the robbery is. You could wonder why Tess dated the casino owner in the first place. You could even analyze the underlying sexism in the story, but by doing so you're really missing the point: 'Ocean's Eleven' is not supposed to be deep or meaningful - it's just very fine entertainment.Danny Ocean (George Clooney), master con-artist and thief, has just been given parole after a few years in prison for the one crime he got caught for. So naturally the first thing he does is get in touch with old partner Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), now teaching stupid Hollywood teen stars how to play poker, and they assemble a crew (his 'Eleven') for a stunningly audacious heist - he's going to break into the vault that holds the cash for three of Las Vegas's biggest casinos during a world heavyweight title fight. Ocean also plans to steal his ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the owner of the casinos.It's a heist movie, and as such there are a few basic elements - experienced pros, talented youth (Matt Damon), beautiful love interest, evil villain, super-secure safe. Yes, it's predictable in its basic plot, but the real pleasure in the movie comes from watching the ingenious robbery unfold, twists, turns, problems and all, and the considerable charm of the stellar cast. The deadpan Pitt and Clooney  and the snakelike Andy Garcia are particularly good, and there are some excellent lines:Clooney: 'What happened to Billy X?' Pitt: 'Dead.' C: 'He got shot?' P: 'No, skin cancer.' C: 'You send flowers to the funeral?' P: 'Dated his wife for a while.'There's not much substance in the film, but there sure is a lot of style.RATING: 7/10Tane",Ocean's Eleven
300,konover,"You know, I don't get it.",5,16 November 2002,"Ocean's 11 isn't a bad movie. It's just too familiar. Caper movies are caper movies, but Ocean's 11 acts like it's covering new ground when it isn't. I caught this movie at a dollar theater and I thought: Soderbergh? Clooney? Roberts? Pitt? Garcia? Gould? Cheadle? Damon? How could I go wrong?
What follows is an extremely predictable series of events that I saw coming way before I was supposed to. For example, as soon as we find out Clooney used to be married to Julia Roberts and is now seeing Andy Garcia, we can easily see what will unfold an hour and change later. The Clooney-Roberts relationship is an unconvincing, tired cliche, and it takes the whole movie to show us the predictable results.As soon as Clooney discusses his extravagant and unlikely plot, we know he's going to get away with it. And when the twist arrives, you just shrug and say ok. Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors and while he occasionally brings up the occasional vibrant scene, he can't get past what is easily one of the most predictable capers in recent times. Just about everything in the movie telegraphs its punches. I also saw Heist and The Score, but those movies had dynamic dialogue, dynamic relationships, dynamic performances and enough verisimilitude to draw you into the caper and leave you wondering what the characters were going to get away with. The dynamic in Ocean's 11 is ""Look how cool we are."" There's very little danger. You never get the sense that the characters are real people and therefore we never really care about them. The only exception being Carl Reiner's Saul.Clooney and company are fun to watch for the most part, but the story is strictly by-the-numbers entertainment with Soderbergh only occasionally pausing to inject some welcome Soderbergh-like visuals.
All in all, it's not a total misfire, but it could've been trimmed and would've benefitted from an injection of humanity and originality. Highly recommended for people who haven't seen very many capers. Everyone else, don't expect the movie to blow you away.",Ocean's Eleven

The characters have some nice moments, George Clooney (Daniel Ocean) and Brad Pitt (Rusty) have good chemistry here, and their interactions are well done. The romance in this film wasn't all that great for me, I thought that it just didn't work that well but it was passable. It has some nice cinematography here and there, and the movie flows really well, which is a sign of good camera work. This movie isn't realistic by any means, but it was a fun time.

303,happytoms,The impossible heist,7,26 September 2019,"It's the impossible movie heist recipe which requires a couple of big-time movie stars, one bad guy, a team, a plan which most likely isn't planned that good, quite a lot of things which should fall conveniently down to luck or chance to happen smoothly, enjoyable music, atmosphere in which the movie takes place, playing illusions with the movie characters and you to reach the final conclusion of how they pulled it off.
I remember watching this movie when I was young and I remembered quite a lot of things even watching it now. As a young kid I enjoyed this movie but watching it now I enjoyed it too but I applied logic to make sense of the heist which I shouldn't had.
Overall I think it's not an excellent and
not a bad movie. It's somewhere in the middle for casual watching but you shouldn't try to apply logic too much or you will ruin it for yourself.Would recommend to anyone who wants to see one of their favourite movie stars pull off a heist but it wouldn't be my first choice.

The actors have a great chemistry together. George Clooney was great in this movie ( and was it just me or did anybody else also expect him to say ""Jack Foley"" when asked for his name in the first scene??) but Brad Pitt definitely outshone him.

The leader of this heist is Danny Ocean (George Clooney), fresh out of jail, and his right-hand man is Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt). Things become more complicated as we learn that the owner of the casino in question, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), is involved with Danny's ex-wife Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). The plan unfolds bit by bit, and ultimately unravels in a thrilling conclusion.*possible spoilers*OCEAN'S ELEVEN isn't really meant to be a thinking movie, but it does what it comes to do very well. It's a fun popcorn movie, that's really slick and very stylish and cool. Aside from the fact that this could never happen in real life, the movie makes the heist and all of the details of it seem brilliant. Of course the outcome of it is entirely predictable, but the fact that the whole plan unravels perfectly is very impressive. The movie is a ton of fun to watch.Though this is a big ensemble movie (and with a great cast, too), there's no definitive star. There are a lot of big names, but one of the biggest, Julia Roberts, doesn't get a lot of screen time and has a minor role (an unnecessary and irrelevant one, as well). All of the cast does excellently, though. They aren't given a lot to work with except sit back and look cool, but they pull it off perfectly. Brad Pitt has probably the coolest role, with George Clooney in second.OCEAN'S ELEVEN won't provide many twists in the plot or even real substance, but there's a lot of flash and it's very fun to watch.

The acting was good, especially the supporting actors, though I dont think this movie really had a lead.  The plot is ok, though a little farfetched ( pulling of that heist with only 2 weeks planning).  The ending could have been a little better, like having a scene with the whole crew together.       One thing about the movie that annoyed me was the camera work.  That nearly ruined the film.  There were some scenes where I was getting dizzy watching the movie.  Aside from that, I enjoyed the film thoroughly.",Ocean's Eleven
307,davidholmesfr,Forty Years On,6,20 February 2002,"This is not a bad film  but neither is it particularly good. On the plus side, how pleasant to have a caper movie that doesn't involve guns, violence and multifarious `things exploding'. On the down side, however, if it is a caper then it really needs a bit more tension and suspense to engage our attention. The eleven crooks of the title are all OK guys (allowing that Don Cheadle obviously learnt his accent at the Dick Van Dyke School of Cockney). Wouldn't it have been so much more enjoyable if one of the eleven had been incompetent, or even better, a potential traitor in their midst? That really would have injected some tension. But the casino owner (Garcia) is not an OK guy so the outcome can be guessed without too much difficulty.
Then it's all a matter of hi-tech skulduggery as the thieves plot to make their way into the casino vaults in an attempt to help themselves to a cool $160m. The plot has as many holes as a Swiss cheese. But who cares when the whole caper nearly grinds to a halt for want of a couple of AA batteries just after they've managed to black out the whole of Las Vegas.
Many will see this film for no other reason than the star cast list  just like the original version of some 40 years ago. Most of the crew seem to be enjoying themselves and Elliot Gould steals every scene he's in. Julia Roberts wanders in and out, although quite why is anyone's guess. She looks lost and confused for much of the time. But then she does appear in the credits as `Introducing Julia Roberts' so maybe she's right to look perplexed by all that's going on around her.If you've nothing to better to do on a wet Wednesday in Wigan this would be a harmless and reasonably enjoyable way of whiling away a couple of hours. But if it's real excitement or suspense you're after don't bother. It ends on a worrying note  a potential sequel seems to be lined up. Let's hope it's another 40 years before it gets made.

A lot of times, there may simply be too many stars in a film to make it work. But despite all the big name actors in Ocean's Eleven, it works out well. All of the actors gave excellent performances, and it makes a big difference in this kind of film. In fact, the acting and characters are done so well that it's easy to root for the crooks in this film, rather than the ""good guys.""

314,RagingDraugr,"Talk about ""the perfect crime"".",8,2 March 2019,"In terms of an elaborate heist story that keeps building and revealing the full extent of the plan as the film goes on, I haven't quite seen anything else like 'Ocean's Eleven'. The way this film unfolds is something to marvel at, and is practically worth the price of admission on it's own. Fortunately, it has more going for it than just a well thought-out heist plan that accounts for every single eventuality. What also stands out are the characters and the soundtrack. Each of the heist members are distinct and memorable, much like the soundtrack is - with classical tunes mixed in with then-modern beats, as well as a funky, jazzy score that evokes the spirit of a romanticized era of film and music and thus, gives the film a sense of timelessness...if it weren't for the chunky early-2000s mobile phones, that is. But those, in all fairness, can be easily overlooked.The movie also has a good dose of humour, but it never detours the film for the sake of making a joke or needlessly 'ruins' a serious or emotional moment. Rather, it helps to flesh out the characters and make them feel real and believable. In addition, the humour is interwoven with the dialogue, which has no small measure of wit or cleverness to it and again, contributes to improving the overall characterisation. Finally, the pacing is actually remarkably strong - even in the slower moments, it never feels like the film is dragging its heels and instead, manages to maintain a breakneck pace with ease. My only major criticism with the film is that some of the editing can be...odd. Specifically, the transitions and occasional effect such as the ever-""classic"" 3D flip transition and the intentionally choppy footage in the scene where Ocean spots a potential heist member on a train. These editing choices seem bizarre and amateurish, and do drag the film's rating down somewhat.Overall: 8/10, maybe 9 or higher if it wasn't for some of the weird editing decisions.",Ocean's Eleven
315,kmberger,Tons of fun.,8,15 December 2002,"It's refreshing to see a film where the principals involved seem to be enjoying themselves immensely.  'Ocean's Eleven' is just such a film.  Rumor is that George Clooney got the star-studded cast to waive their usually high fees as a favor to him.  As a result, he ended up with a massively talented group of actors working their way through a remake of an old Rat Pack flick, with acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh at the helm.  What else do you need?Recently paroled con Danny Ocean (Clooney) assembles a crew of eleven con-artists and thieves to pull off the heist of a lifetime:  Robbing over $150 million from the vault of three Las Vegas casinos.  Without giving anything away, the caper itself is imaginative and completely unrealistic - which is why it's fun to watch play out.  Refreshingly, the mark of the con, casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is no dummy.  He's smart, clever and careful, and that plays into the twists and turns of the heist.The best part is in watching Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Carl Reiner and the rest diving headfirst into their roles.  They have parts that are built on style and attitude, but rarely ham it up.  They have natural chemistry (especially between Pitt and Clooney - their rapport is great).  The dialogue crackles crisp and stylish.  These thieves aren't vulgar or violent - they're smooth and refined and almost never lose control.  'Ocean's Eleven' is a display of cool, a production of style, and a very enjoyable heist flick to boot.

But the director here is Steven Soderberg of Traffic and Erin Brockovich fame. And he used the all star cast and Vegas backdrop to create a very, very, very entertaining film. There are many funny moments in this movie, however a lot of them are subtle and may not be as funny to someone who has never been to Vegas.There are a few problems with the movie. First off, with so many characters we really do not get to know any of them other than the principles. And although I won't spoil it, I will say the ending is more than a little weak. But there are some laughs, a really strong cast and the movie is very stylish.It's a real shame we don't get to see much of Matt Damon in this movie. 7/10",Ocean's Eleven
318,Empire-3,Average...,5,22 February 2002,"Ocean's Eleven is average movie. It looks good, but it has those too common jokes, that aren't funny. Like in typical american action-comedy, someone says something stupid and the man next to the joker makes face expression that should make people laugh. Ok, I don't like them very much and this almost 2 hour movie has them too much.Julia Roberts has bad role. She just seems to hang around in the movie and she tries to make everything out of her minimalistic and pointless role. She is very capable actress as you can see in Erin Brockovich.
Otherwise acting of the whole crew is good, too bad they don't have good roles. For example we don't really know much about them as the movie ends, they just know each other and that's it.  But Ocean's Eleven isn't all bad, it is quite entertaining, music works well and the cinematography works also well. There are much worser movies around. If you like these typical action-comedy jokes, you might like this movie much. It hasn't much violence. Also it's good to see Andy Garcia in bigger and better movie, than he has made in past 5-7 years. I hope this movie tops him to A-list or better movies. But he has bad role too.**½ out of ***** (5 from 10)",Ocean's Eleven
319,prudhoeboy,Too Cool For School,7,22 August 2021,"This movie was ok primarily because of the performance of the actors led by the smooth and charismatic George Clooney. As a heist movie the plot was a bit stock with the usual high tech security and lasers. Andy Garcia gave the movie some credibility given the plot was fairly preposterous. The movie was watchable and somewhat entertaining but overdone on star power to the point of glare. Basically you wonder if anyone not in the Hollywood incrowd had a shot at auditioning for the movie. Sometimes lesser known actors help fill in a movie. For example, the movie did not need James Caan's son and Casey Affleck is far too good an actor to be given the bit part he had. Damon was good in the movie but also not needed nor was Julia Roberts. So that's about it. Sometimes less is more.",Ocean's Eleven

321,kager-69310,erm why was it made,3,4 February 2020,"This movie left me severely confused. I was confused as to what I had just watched thinking I had missed something or that there was more to it but nope, this is a really badly made heist movie. problems:
1. this is all to gain back his lover and screw owner of casino(what?just because he can) seems like money is not important and it seems like an unbelievable motive to literally risk life and i dont see how doing something that the person left you for is supposed to get them back2.No chemistry between characters pretty much act as individuals
3. unrealistic
4. tbh it felt as if a fog was covering the whole movie because it just seemed hazy like i knew i was watching it but i felt super detached
Sure it was cool when they walked right out but the rest of the movie is just a complete muddle I would go as far as saying I don't really get the purpose for this movie. In my opinion there is no reason to watch it. Julia Robert is barely in it and her role i understand just seems a shame to give such a good actress such a lame role.",Ocean's Eleven
322,ProperCharlie,Start spreading the news...,8,15 February 2002,"***MINOR SPOILERS***Soderbergh goes Vegas!OK, so it's not the original Rat Pack, however, the cast list here is longer on names and perhaps stronger than the original.  The finished result is a stylish caper movie that is played for fun while never really engaging the brain.  George Clooney revisits his Out of Sight persona; he's been here before and know all the right moves which executes perfectly.  Particularly pleasing is the chemistry between George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who seems to be wearing the wardrobe from Fight Club.OK, the film is formulaic.  We've been here before and you might even be wondering if Steven Soderbergh is going to adding in the alternate 'SWAT van dangling off a mountain' ending to the director's cut of the DVD.  None of this matters though.  It's like being reunited with an old friend who's smartened up a lot since you last saw them.  All the familiar characters and plot twists are there and they're all where you expect them.  For the postmodernists among you there are lots of cheeky references not only to the original but to the genre in general.  Don Cheadle's accent is probably that bad on purpose; another knowing reference.  I can see Soderbergh making him watch Mary Poppins to get the cockney 'spot on guv'ner'File under 'fun'.",Ocean's Eleven
323,experten,"Good actors, bad and boring movie",3,12 April 2002,"The big problem with this movie is the story. It takes too long to get going, the preparations before the robbery are not very interesting, there are too many characters so none of them becomes interesting and the robbery turns out to be unrealistic and very little exciting.George Clooney does the same role as he always does, the cool guy, but he is not very cool or impressing here. Elliot Gold is more interesting and odd but gets very little screen time and the chinese guy amuses us a few moments. Brad Pitt has done many impressing roles (12 Monkeys, Kalifornia, Snatch, Fight Club and Seven just to mention some of his best movies)and the same can be said about Matt Damon but none of them get anything to work with in this movie. Andy Garcia is as good as he can be in his role as the bad guy, but why doesn't we get to see him actually do anything bad ? Julia Roberts character is only boring too see, she could have been replaced with any female actor and it would not have made any difference. But replaced with Halle Berry we would at least have had someone beautiful to look at.
Ocean's Eleven is a remake of the 1960 movie with the same name. You can see the oldfashioned overlaping of scenes and you can here it from the oldfashioned crappy music. I have not seen the original but the new version is a typical example of replacing good story with a bunch of star actors. No one would bother with this movie if the actors were not so famous.I recommend that you watch The Score instead, it has the three greatest actors in the world and here the actors really make a difference, especially Edward Norton but it is always a pleasure too see De Niro and Brando as well. The Score has a much superior story, a very exciting robbery and a superb ending.My rating of Ocean's Eleven is 4 / 10.",Ocean's Eleven
324,Jenny Ho,Tasty cast in very cool and slick movie,8,5 March 2002,"What a tasty prospect for a film: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and for the young at heart amongst us, Joshua Jackson of 'Dawson's Creek' fame in a cameo role -all directed by the Oscar winning Steven Soderbergh!George Clooney plays Danny Ocean who soon after being released from prison, puts together a team of eleven to undertake a robbery of the three biggest casinos in Las Vegas in an attempt to bring in a reward of $150 million. What soon becomes clear is that it's not the money which will give Danny the ultimate satisfaction, but the opportunity to get revenge on the owner of the three casinos he is robbing -Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be the new beau of Danny's ex, Tess (Julia Roberts).Some of the gang of eleven are more memorable than others -especially the Chinese acrobat, the explosives expert with a dodgy cockney accent and the medallion wearing Reuben -aka Monica Gellar's dad!  The cast are brilliant at acting cool -even if all Brad Pitt is doing is snacking on the screen (he does this a lot!), you are still transfixed by him because he looks so good on screen.What makes the story so intriguing is the fact that Danny's mission seems so impossible: security in the casinos is paramount and the route to the reward is littered with obstacles.  The number of close calls that the gang is faced with is great fun and one can't help but root for these crooks throughout the film.  It is also refreshing to watch a film which is dominated by male stars and is not filled with macho swearing.  Instead, we have a banter between the stars which is indicative of their camaraderie.'Ocean's Eleven' is a welcome option in the choice of movies available at the moment which is dominated by Oscar nominees that are not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  With this film, it's simply a case of sit back and enjoy the fun!",Ocean's Eleven
325,bobsteimle,More than a surprise ending,8,15 August 2005,"Most people are surprised by the ending of this movie. I was also surprised, and I usually am not. The mumbling presentation of the preparations for the heist leave out just enough so we don't quite understand what is going on. This can often be frustrating for an audience, but in this case there is enough humor and suspense to keep our interest. Matt Damon's role as an eager but not very experienced crook provides both the humor and the suspense. We want him to succeed because he is such a nice guy, but he is so green that we fear he will mess the whole thing up. I would have given him the Oscar for this movie. He distracts us beautifully from what is really going on.When our eleven thieves, the good guys in this movie, are on the verge of being caught by the wary casino owner (played by Garcia), we feel bad for what we think is their imminent demise. But the twist is that they have fooled us all. When the SWAT team comes in to arrest them, there is no one there. It's not until after the SWAT team leaves that we realize the whole thing was staged, and our friends, the crooks, were playing the SWAT team, and they took all the money.The big problem with this movie is that our protagonists are criminals. ""Root, root, root for the bad guys; if they get caught it's a shame!"" It's not exactly as American as baseball and apple pie. It is more entertaining than most crime dramas.",Ocean's Eleven

327,Dr. Nick*#3,Fizzy,9,20 June 2002,"Shows how easily intelligent direction, great cinematography, and bona-fide star power can redeem what could have been a stale heist genre exercise. The mechanics of the heist and the love story -between George Clooney and the snappy, dazzling Julia Roberts- are preposterous but Soderbergh is more interested in dialogue, cool(not hip, but genuine cool), and elevation/subversion of the mainstream aesthetic than airtight storytelling. Good choice, it turns out, as we get to witness Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia and others riff on familiar ""dirty dozen"" type setups and fashion memorable characters out of just a few minutes of screentime each.

It doesn't really have a 2001 feel to it, reminds me a lot of classical sixties movies, how quaint!"" As it turns out, my feeling that this could have come straight from the 1960s was right - now I know that it is in fact a remake of a 1960 movie. And there's nothing wrong with it. It is entertaining enough, very slick, with well-known actors who seem to have fun, but of course also rather shallow and predictable. Even most of the ""surprises"" are rather unsurprising to viewers who know the kind of calculated plot twists typical for such movies. Therefore I don't quite get the high praise received by ""Ocean's Eleven"" as some kind of outstanding and most original movie; these are not its qualities. So I think that the current user consensus with a 7,7 rating here is fitting and give it an 8/10 for what it is, a well-polished heist comedy without any particular depth to it.",Ocean's Eleven

There is a certain elegance about this film that I appreciated--no bullet holes, blood, or violence--yet it managed a real sense of suspense and climactic thrill without them.

Though it's not my usual M.O., I really enjoyed this movie. I've not seen the original 'Rat Pack' version of the movie (except bits and pieces), so a comparison between the two is not possible on my part. This version I found playful and relatively harmless, and the plot twists are undeniably clever.  The comradery between the actors is the most entertaining part of this film in my opinion. Elliot Gould's part had to be my favorite character if forced to pick, followed in close order by Clooney, Pitt & Damon.  Actually all of the actors did an excellent job with their roles.This movie won't change the world, or probably change your mind about anything significant, but the plot is fun, the cinematography is excellent, the actors all shine in their roles, and on occasion that is enough.",Ocean's Eleven
333,klheintz,"Better than the original, but plot holes and lack of direction in some characters keep it from greatness",6,9 October 2017,"Ocean's Eleven follows the story of Danny Ocean putting together the biggest heist Vegas has ever seen. He enlists the help of a few close friends to help him put together an impossible team for an impossible job, and it's fun the whole way through. If you don't pay attention to some glaring plot holes.I enjoy this film, I really do. Even with the blatant plot holes, unbelievable means by which they pull of the heist, and the back-and- forth character motivations it is by no means a perfect film. But is a fun ride the whole way through and I am glad that I watched it. Ocean's Eleven wastes no time getting right into the heist, and the sequence of scenes depicting the gang being brought together is fun to watch and does a decent job of setting up some of their individual backstory. But these backstories, while serving the purpose of the film, do not give audiences much that seems very exciting except for maybe Tarr's bank heist. Steven Soderbergh utilizes more than just quick and witty dialogue to advance the plot but also takes advantage of silent storytelling with some scenes containing no dialogue whatsoever. He does this throughout not only this sequence, but various other scenes in the film as well. It's a nice upbeat way to advance the plot and break up major parts of the film.I have yet to talk about cast and this is one of my favorite aspects of this film. I have always been a fan of both Clooney and Pitt, so seeing them on screen interacting with each other is very cool. Sure, Brad Pitt's character, Rusty, kind of feels like a mat for Ocean's dialogue to bounce of, but it was enjoyable throughout. Most of the other characters don't have scenes that really stick out as fun dialogue or even good interaction except Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict.Something the film does terribly is the motivation and choices some of these characters make. Oh and the plot holes with the hooker ads somehow getting into the vault out of nowhere. Like what is that!? But back to these motivations/decisions. In what world does it make sense for Tess, who left Ocean because he was a liar, to go back to Ocean? That makes absolutely no sense to me. The better option, the option that should have happened, was for her to realize she's nothing but a trophy to them and leave. Ridiculous like the hooker ads somehow showing up inside the vault. Overall, I believe this is a solid heist film. Yes, it has a few plot holes but, the character decisions will make you confused, and it has some weird accents but I think it is an enjoyable ride throughout and definitely one I would recommend to someone for some light viewing.",Ocean's Eleven
334,9thgraders,The best film about a heist,10,11 February 2019,"Ocean's eleven is the best film about a heist I have ever seen. It's released on the 6 February 2002, directed by Steven Soderbergh.Ocean's eleven has many famous actors: George Clooney ( Danny ), Brad Pitt ( Rusty) , Julia Robert ( Tess ), Matt demon ( Linus ), Andy Garcia ( M.Benedict ).The story is about a heist, a big heist, there are 11 thieves, they make a team to rob three casinos in Las Vegas,The film's characters are all different but I have a preference for Rusty, Linus and Yen. I love the scene when a member of the team cuts the power in all Las Vegas with a bomb. My favorite moment is when Rusty is calling Mister Benedict and he says : ""The person who is pointing your casino"" , it so funny.Ocean's Eleven has a lot of of soundtracks but they are a good choice for this film genre. The best character to me is Linus Because he is stressed all the time and he doesn't listen to Danny and Rusty.The film is a very good comedy and the actors play very well !

George Clooney shines as Danny Ocean making everything he does cool. His character is definitely like James Bond but more cheeky comments. Brad Pittt does an outstanding job playing the goofy right hand man. I didn't have much hope for him but he proved me wrong. Matt Damon plays the nerdy little Linus Caldwell to perfection. Andy Garcia as the villain is surprisingly well done and Julia Roberts plays the ""EX"" well. The plot was very cool which involved many twists and turns. They took the simple plot of robbing a casino and they added this HUGE twist at the end to leave you on the edge of your seat. The music here adds a nice tone with the sensational jazz tunes from David Holmes. Shows like Thief or Heist don't have enough....... originality or plot to entertain you. Ocean's Eleven is the original heist movie that is done to perfection. You cant beat the original. Definitely go rent this movie as you should be satisfied. If you rent the DVD be sure to check out the hilarious commentary from Pitt, Damon, and Garcia. Overall great heist movie that will leave you gripped and moved 'til the ending credits.",Ocean's Eleven

No, I havenot seen the original, but I have seen movies before. If you havenever seen a movie before, or have forgotten all those you havealready seen, you may find this one entertaining. If your idea of a""good and complex"" storyline is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, then youwill probably like this. If, however, you have liked all of Soderbergh's previous films, I willbe surprised if you don't find this disappointing.

338,exterminator_99,Making the most of an average concept,6,10 January 2002,"Movie goers around the world undoubtably drooled at the prospect of a movie carrying four heavyweight, A-list actors and the hottest director of the moment.  ""Ocean's Eleven"", a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack caper, contains these expensive commodities.  Directed by Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh and starring (deep breath here...) George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, this movie was sure to make Roadshow Entertainment a bucketload of money on the premise alone.  It has done so, and while it may not be the world's most original and inspiring movie, it is a solid piece of entertainment, pleasing critics and audiences alike.Clooney is the title character, Daniel Ocean, a compulsive thief who has just been released from prison.  Upon leaving lock-up he has already devised a plan to knock off three of Las Vegas' biggest casino's, all in one night! Realsing he needs the best criminals in the business to pull off this massive heist he sets out on a sort of ""Dirty Dozen"" (minus one) round up of robbery genuises.This ensemble of characters hits and misses.  Clooney is excellent as Ocean. He is classicly stylish, very smooth and ultra-cool.  Pitt plays Dusty Ryan, a card shark and general villan with a heart of gold.  Since ""Fight Club"", Pitt has chosen solid and varied roles.  His portrayl of Dusty is spot on, you instantly like the character and admire is style and charisma. Don Cheadle is great as Basher Tarr, pulling off a decent English accent as the explosives expert.  Scott Caan and Casey Afleck play Turk and Virgil Molloy and provide the comic relief of the film.  Matt Damon has an understated role as Linus Cauldwell, the pickpocket of the group.  Perhaps most memorable of all, despite his limited screentime is Elliot Gould as Reuben Tishkoff, an outrageously over the top former casino owner. Swathed in gold and diamonds and sporting some hideously cool sunglasses, he hams his role perfectly as the jewish millionaire.Other characters are not as memorable or effective, but fulfill their roles enough to compensate for their lack of charisma.  Andy Garcia is effective as casino owner Terry Benedict.  It's great to see him back in an A-list move for the first time in a while.  Julia Roberts' role is small and more supporting that lead billing, but she plays Clooney's ex-wife to a tee.Soderbergh has a firm grip on proceedings and the film only lapses in a few instances.  The quality of camerawork and the tightness of editing is commendable and as an audience we are thankful that it is Soderbergh in control and not some MTV-style, music video director.  His contribution ensures that the film delivers on both an entertainment and artistic level.The film contains equal amounts of romance, laughs, action and dramatic tension and is enjoyable right the way along.  It may not be the best work of any of its key contributors but any film that can charm picky critics and audiences with a very small attention span is bound to be a hit.  Let's hope for more movies that can pull this difficult task off in the future.",Ocean's Eleven
339,jeffrey-utley,One of my Favorite Heist Movies,9,3 July 2013,"I really liked this movie. I've figured out that I love heist movies recently, so my expectations for this were really high. As you know the outcome was me really liking it. It had good characters, a good story line rapped around the heist of the casino, and awesome, intense parts of the movie. It was very enjoyable, but I was starting to doubt it at the beginning...For almost an hour the movie, was very slow, and I didn't like that. It actually bored me for a while. I understood that it was a buildup to the big casino-robbing scene, but I still thing they could have done it better. Part of the first hour was the main characters getting some people to help them rob the casino. That was of it was a little entertaining, but still kind of boring. At the beginning of the movie, it kind of illustrated why Ocean wanted to rob the casinos, and that was interesting. I'm glad that they did that. But, all in all, the first half of the movie was pretty boring, so the second half really had to make up for that. And... It did.The second half was pretty much just awesome. Almost all of it was the casino-robbing scene and the scenes where they practiced for it. Even the scenes where they practiced for it were pretty cool and interesting. You figure out why Ocean decides to use those people. And they really do practice for it in those scenes. They make sure they'll get it right. Now for the casino-robbing part. The first about 10 minutes of it were interesting, but I think could have been a little better. At that point I had no idea what the rest of the movie would be like. It could have started to be really bad, but it could have gone to be awesome. It went to be awesome. I loved the casino-robbing scene after the first 10 minutes. Even though the first 10 minutes had some cool tricks that Ocean and his people used to get past things, the rest of it was completely awesome. I loved what they did at the end to finish robbing the casino, but before that...There were several clever tricks they used, even more clever than the first few tricks, and even some things went wrong. I don't want to talk about the ending too much, but at the end there's one of the coolest and most intense twist at the end that takes brain power to understand.

To be fair, the second half of the film picks up some steam and Soderbergh has some great moments towards the end of the film (and Thank God he didn't carry on the actual end of the film beyond its natural conclusion - too much, as has been the case lately in Hollywood).

Frank Sinatra's film seems really naive compared with this one, which also looks naive if we don't suspend our disbelief, but I think each viewer is able to do that and enjoy the movie or at least enjoy the actors on it. There is one interesting point: the films of the 50s and 60s which tell the story of thieves usually are spoilers (I don't know if this is the right word to use here) because they make us like the thieves and then they are caught in the end (for example: ""The Day they Robbed the Bank of England""). So, one thing good about movies about thefts nowadays is that we can be fairly sure that our favorite characters are going to get away with it, like for example ""The Entrapment"" with Sean Connery, or  ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" with Pierce Brosnan. ""Ocean's Eleven"" seems to me to be better than these movies. Don't miss it if you understand what I have been talking about.",Ocean's Eleven
345,Justin Harris,A good movie to sit down and watch...,8,10 December 2001,"When I first saw the trailer for Ocean's Eleven, I wanted to see it. It had a different tone than other movies usually do. I have been a fan of Steven Soderbergh's work since seeing OUT OF SIGHT. Then upon seeing THE LIMEY, TRAFFIC, and ERIN BROCKOVICH, he's become one of my favorite directors with just marvelous films, and this one is no exception.I don't like to spoil films, but I'll say what's great about the movie. It has an simple, but interesting plot: George Clooney (Danny Ocean) is released from prison and meets up with Bernie Mac who works at a casino. Then he conspires with Brad Pitt to pull off a job to rob three casinos. They then get eight other guys to pull off the job.Other than the plot, the movie is well directed. The acting from all people in the film is superb. The movie is very funny which is a plus because audiences should laugh.Ocean's Eleven is just one of those movies with a classic film atmosphere that's just a good movie to sit down and watch.SCORE: 8 out of 10",Ocean's Eleven

Some people in the theater even clapped at the end.What I really like about it is that you are basically rooting for the bad guys and being okay with it.  In reality we should be with the casino owner not with the 11 stars who are robbing it, but everyone was rooting for the bad guys.  Very well done movie and I'm sure that's the purpose of the director.",Ocean's Eleven

351,Tkbn3812,Simply brilliant,9,6 January 2018,"Ocean's Eleven sets out to be an engaging, thrilling yet fun heist movie, and it manages to accomplish just that. It's stunning, it's simple, it's brilliant. Everything about the movie, from the pacing to the acting and dialogue, is done with so much thought and so well.Ocean's Eleven has quite the typical heist film plot. A criminal, Danny Ocean (played by George Clooney) plans to pull off possibly the biggest heist in the history of the United States, planning to rob $160 million from three casinos in one night. It's no easy task, and he seeks out a team of people (eleven, to be exact), of which include great actors such as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner.I think it's easily the acting that makes this heist film such a standout from other similar films. Matt Damon is so innocent and yet so powerful, and Carl Reiner plays Saul very well, but for me the two best actors had to be George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Together their characters Danny and Rusty lead the team in real style, right from the get-go. Clooney plays his character stunningly, honestly yet with plenty of fun injected into it. Brad Pitt shines in his role, just so...amazing. The highlight of his character for me was easily when he casually got Basher out of an arrest. The dialogue in this movie couples itself perfectly with the acting. It's just such witty, fun dialogue. It's the type of dialogue many may cringe at, but if you're watching this movie you've got to remember that it's just trying to have fun. Everything from the content, the timing, the delivery of the lines, is done so well.Personally, and rather obviously, the highlight of the film had to be the heist. The movie doesn't waste time getting to the heist like other heist films (I'm looking at you Fast Five...which actually copied an awful lot from this movie), and once it gets to the heist it doesn't muck around. It just rolls with it, and it has plenty of witty fun along the way. The heist itself is clever, it's smart, it's brilliantly thought out by the characters and more importantly the writers of the movie.My two only gripes are rather minor; the ending and Basher's accent. I'm not even British but the cockney accent that Don Cheadele puts on can't possibly fool anyone; it's just so unnecessary and whoever suggested he use one should be fired. Also, I don't want to spoil the ending but I feel it could have gone just a little further. It's still great, it's just that it could have been perhaps more satisfying. Still, that's why there are sequels.Ocean's Eleven is just such a clever and yet heist film. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a thriller or is just looking for a quick way to kill two hours. You won't regret it.",Ocean's Eleven

356,Daniel Ocean,FUN! FUN! FUN! most entertaining movie of 2001!,10,8 January 2002,"Ocean's Eleven is a very entertaining movie, one that I have been looking forward to seeing for awhile, the movie has gone up and beyond my expectations, It is probaly the best of 2001 so far.. First of all the acting was just great in this film, George Cloony (Danny Ocean) gives us problay one of the best performanes of his career, Brad Pitt (Rusty) does a great job with his charecter as does Matt Damon, you can tell that both of them put in alot of time trying to perfect there perfomances... Oceans Eleven tells the story of Daniel Ocean just released from prison, who set's up a casino hiest, 3 casino's in one night, impossible? maybe but with the help of his Right-Hand man (Brad Pitt) he figures out every detail of every casino and sets up a team of 11 men to try to pull it off. The story is great, no visible plot holes, no scenes that could of been left out, and no cliches involved. The movie is probaly the best hiest film ever made. Steve Soderbergh has out done himself here, giving us the most entertaining movie of the year. He does a fantastic job capturing the beauty behind Las Vegas, and the overhead shots of the city or some of the best I have ever seen. The only thing that really got to me though is Don Cheadle's irish/british acsent it gets annoying real fast, but that is one thing I can easily forgive and forget, and overall Ocean's Eleven is the most entertaining movie in years. I truly recommend this film to anybody that love's film making at it's best, and acting at it's best.... This is by far the BEST movie of the year (Next to Lord Of The Rings) it's so much fun to watch, It's not an easy task for movie to receive a 10 from because I am very STRICT with my rating system, but this and LOTR were the one's that captured me the most therefore they both receive a 10/10.",Ocean's Eleven

When I first saw it, I was amazed at how many big budget stars was in the movie, it really helped, but the story was great to. The plot was sorta out there, meaning that most of this film you could sum it up by saying ""Yeah right like that would ever happen"" but thats whats nice about it, it isnt a serious movie its just one for fun. I havent seen a film yet with so many quick one liners but they worked. The story actually had some twists that made you think. George Clooney was great as the head of the crew, hes suited for this kind of role, I actually like him better in comedy than action. Brad Pitt seems to play the same kind of calm, cool, collective guy almost every movie but it works for him. The crew seems to be made up of a bunch of unique lonnies, especially the brothers(the drivers,played the waiters etc). This movie will make you laugh almost all the way through it.

359,sweetnlowdown2,Ocean's Eleven Doesn't Score!,5,9 December 2001,"Like me start off by saying I'm a fan of Steven Soderbergh. I think both ""Erin Brockovich"" & ""Traffic"" were two of the best films of 2000! But, ""Ocean's Eleven"", just didn't work for me. I didn't want to go see this film in the first place, but, a friend of mine dragged me to go see it. I admit, I did like it more than I expected, but, it's not something I would recommend that people I know should go see. ""Ocean's Eleven"" tries to keep the spirit of the original. It tries to stay loose and free-spirited. Witty, and intelligent. But, somewhere along the line, we're just not buying what it's selling. It tries to be serious and aloof whenever it feels like it. That's a mistake. There's an old saying that goes, you can't have your cake and eat it too! Make up your mind! Which way do you want this film to go? I don't mind if they wanted the film to be a fun, silly homage to the original, but don't try to get all serious on me! Like how the ending tries. The screenplay by Ted Griffin at times is sharp and funny. The character are not dumbed down. They know what they are doing, and they do it well. The acting between everyone however seems, sorta stiff. I didn't feel a connection between everyone on screen. I mean, I'm sure they had fun while making the movie, but that doesn't completely show on-screen. I didn't feel a lost romance between Clooney and Roberts at all. And it's like that for all the characters. Another problem I had with the film is, there are too, too many character, so many infact that no one has anything to work with! Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, Garcia, Damon, Cheadle, Gould, Reiner, Affleck, Mac, & Caan are all struggling for screen time. The so called ""supporting"" cast actually has just as much time as the supposed ""stars"" of the film. Carl Reiner, who is probably billed as the 20th person, actually has more screen time and a greater importance to the story then Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia,& Elliot Gould! Infact it's Reiner's, Gould's and Roberts' show all the way! That's right! Forget Clooney and Pitt. I had more fun watching Carl Reiner, then any of them. I would love to see him nominated for a ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar, and believe it or not, but, that buzz is flying around. Elliot Gould is someone I enjoyed watching as well. These guys (Reiner and Gould) are such pros that, they don't need to seem over-pushy to steal scenes. They do it by remaining subtle. They may seem like they are doing very little, but, when the film is over, you'll probably remember them more then the other characters. As for Julia Roberts, well, I like for the obvious reasons. Plus she's the only female in the cast. But other wise, there's nothing here for her. For someone who's just won an Oscar, she's been playing very bland roles lately. This and ""America's Sweethearts"". The directing by Soderbergh admittedly does have it's moments. But, this film is just a walk in the park for everyone. This seems to be the reason why everyone likes this movie. To me, this is trying to turn a negative into a positive. I've seen much worst films this year, but, for all the hype to one got, I would of thought this would of turned out better. ** 1\2 out of ****",Ocean's Eleven
360,RockyHorrorFan,Extremely entertaining!,10,10 December 2001,"I enjoyed this film very much. It was really well-written and kept my interest throughout the 2 hour running time. The editing and direction were very sharp and the pacing of the story was right on the money. The playfully eerie musical score was pitch-perfect, and added a lot to the fun.
As for the cast, there is only one word for: FLAWLESS! This is an ensemble if I've ever seen one! Each actor brings something special to the movie. Everyone did a great job!I loved how the whole scheme came into play. It was very interesting to see what lengths the characters had to go through. It was the kind of set-up where if any the 'eleven' messed up in their particular assignments, the whole con would be ruined. Although, it is highly unlikely that anyone could think of a strategy that complex.In short, if you're looking for a snappy and fun crime comedy, then you'll love OCEAN's ELEVEN. It was an old-fashioned great time at the movies!My Grade: A-Cast: George Clooney (Daniel Ocean), Brad Pitt (Rusty Ryan), Andy Garcia (Terrence Benedict), Matt Damon (Linus Caldwell), Carl Reiner (Saul Bloom), Elliott Gould (Ruben Tischkoff), Don Cheadle (Bashir Tarr), Scott Caan (Turk Malloy), Casey Affleck (Virgil Malloy), and Julia Roberts (as Tess Ocean).

Anyway, I liked the theme and setting of the movie and how it was taken place throught Las Vegas. Then when they pull their carefully planned heist, there are a lot of things done that actually seem like could have pulled off in a casino, where as the movie claims is the most impossible place to rob.

369,Dehlia_,The Heist of All Heists,8,31 July 2002,"This is a very fun movie that could have been excellent without Julia Roberts dragging it down. Now, normally I am a fan of Ms. Roberts, but here she is miscast and her part is poorly written. Unfortunately, said poorly written part is meant to be the linchpin that holds the entire motivation and structure together. Her character is treated as a stunning beauty, but we all know that Roberts's appeal is not beauty but prettiness -- she is a nice girl, not a knockout, and that's why her beauty -- when it does shine forth -- is so startling. Roberts looks like a pretty girl who, when she smiles at you, shocks you with her sudden radiance. But her character is the kind of woman who Makes an Entrance, and it just doesn't work. Without either the looks or the dialogue, she creates a mushy center to a movie that needs to be sharp straight through.Still, the rest of the movie is diamond-edge sharp, the heist is entertaining, and the cast mainly sparkles. 8/10",Ocean's Eleven
370,tsheridan94,The king of the dialog comedy,7,7 February 2010,"Steven Soderbergh is the unchallenged lord of comedic dialog (not including Inigo Montoya, but that character has only been in one movie.) Soderbergh has proved this countless times, with everything from this to the Informant!Generally, his movies contain very little ""immature"" comedy, which comprises physical comedy, primarily people being hit in the groin or the head. His comedies rely much more heavily on wit and comedic interplay. They are all the better for this fact.Ocean's Eleven, definitely the smartest and best of the Ocean's movies, may be the best of the Soderbergh collection in general. These actors have the art of banter down to a science, literally. I think some of them may have majored in it in college. The Oceans crew pull off the effect of making this gang of thieves seem like a family, albeit a dysfunctional one. And therein lies the charm. We are so used to wanting to see the criminals locked up in these movies that it's a refreshing change to see the people on the right side of the law, at least on paper, be the fools and bad guys.These robbers are in it partially for the money, but partially for the thrill of the heist. But these guys aren't necessarily adrenaline junkies or sociopathic criminals. Rather, it's almost like a sport. The thing that makes these criminals of the Vegas underworld so charming, however, is that they aren't out to hurt people, at least in the physical sense. I don't think any of the crew ever carried a gun at any point in the film. Not only was I empathizing with these criminals, I was laughing, occasionally to the point of tears, along their exploits. Not at their exploits, these guys are the best in the biz, and for good reason. No, I was laughing at the quick one-liners that were so adeptly thrown in there that not a single laugh feels forced, as well as at the general and increasingly imbecilic and barbaric actions if casino owner Terry Benedict.This has also got to include one of the best casts ever assembled, as well. George Clooney is marvelous. Almost all of his movies are comedies, but he is able to act so serious, dead-pan, throughout, that he is often forgotten to be a comedian, or at least a funny actor, first and foremost. Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are equally fantastic, and Bernie Mac was the funniest he'd been in years. And let's not forgot Don Cheadle. He plays the comedian's role quite nicely. I'd recommend he stick to it, if he wasn't so good in movies like Traitor. And how about that Amazing Yen? Everyone here is so funny in their own unique way that they are incomparable. But that's what makes so good...the cast is so unique, but also grafted together so seamlessly, that is easy to feel that if not all were there, the movie wouldn't be what is. Each piece is of the same importance.In the end, this may be one of the funniest movies you'll ever see.",Ocean's Eleven
371,ryklinker,"A veteran con artist, newly released from prison, gets a team of eleven heist members together to rob three casinos",9,18 December 2014,"It's his last day in an orange jumpsuit. The buzzer sounds, and the cell door opens. He is Daniel Ocean (Clooney), an esteemed con artist and heist veteran. It doesn't take long for him to get back to his favorite city, Las Vegas. He meets with his accomplice, Rusty Ryan (Pitt), and lays his plan out on the table. There is a vault that holds the money for three casinos, the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand, and he wants to take all of it. Both Ocean and Ryan agree that they'll need not only a well-executed plan, but also a heist crew that is as crazy as they are. After putting together a group of 11 men, they get set for the biggest heist on a Las Vegas vault in history, and the craziness, suspense, and humor ensues.In this reincarnation of the Rat Pack classic of the same name, the stars shine brighter than the lights of the city that the story takes place in. With an unprecedented ensemble cast featuring some of the hottest actors of the early 21st century (see above), Ocean's Eleven has had money rolling in based on its poster alone. However, while the casting alone boosts the box office, this film does have great characters, and it's a fun movie to watch. What I loved the most about this movie was the smart, witty humor that occurs throughout, especially within the dialog between Rusty and others. While this film doesn't exactly fit into any Oscar category, and there really is no major life lesson or theme, this movie brings classiness, wit, and style to the big screen with the big stars I felt like the script included some scenes or lines that really weren't needed, and they didn't add anything positive to the story.

373,#1 Gracie,"Fun, Laughter-Inducing Film",10,9 December 2001,"Steven Soderbergh is really beginning to impress me. Being a relatively new fan of his, he caught my eye by punching out two Oscar-nominated films in the year 2000 alone. And showing his versatility, he takes a break from those films and creates a popcorn movie for us, ""Ocean's Eleven"". But he pulls off something with ""Ocean's Eleven"" that can rarely be achieved: making a popcorn movie that's excellent and well-crafted.""Ocean's Eleven"" begins in New Jersey, where Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is being questioned to see whether he should be allowed parole. He of course is given the parole (how would this movie have even had a story if he hadn't been granted it?) and immediately after he leaves the slammer, he begins his next heist: robbing three casinos in Las Vegas, which are all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who is currently keeping Danny's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) company.He talks to an old acquaintance named Frank (Bernie Mac) about the whereabouts of his old pal Rusty (Brad Pitt), and is directed to Hollywood, where he finds Rusty getting a paycheck by teaching various young Hollywood actors (led by a very funny Topher Grace and including Holly Marie Combs, Joshua Jackson, Shane West and Barry Watson) how to play poker. He talks to Rusty about his heist plans, and they both decide they need to assemble a crew. They acquire the aid of eleven criminals, and as a team, plan the biggest heist yet that Danny has put together.This movie was great from the first cell of celluloid to the last. The story was good and the script made the story even better. The lines were believable and never failed to have me rolling in my seat.The movie was paced well; I didn't feel like I was watching a 117 minute movie. The plot rolls smoothly and takes it's time, making Danny's planning as well as the actual heist move at a good and believable pace. We don't have five minutes of planning and two hours of the heist, or vice versa. Each section of the movie has enough time to breath.The acting was great as well, which is what you can expect with a cast like this. George Clooney put in a great performance as Danny Ocean; he represented the character really well and let you understand his motives and backgrounds. Brad Pitt also did an excellent job as Rusty; he was often stealing scenes from George Clooney and the rest of the eleven. Everyone that was in George Clooney's assembled team did an excellent job as well, especially Elliot Gould as the millionaire, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as the drivers and masters of disguises, and Don Cheadle as a British bomber. And Julia Roberts did a good job as Danny's bitter ex-wife--you could almost feel the ice when she would bicker with Danny and retort at his remarks.It's rare that a movie meant to not be an artistic one can have great cinematography, but ""Ocean's Eleven"" has accomplished that feat. There are some great shots taken during a scene where the guys are trying to escape from a building but also trying to save Linus (Matt Damon) as well--lots of ""underneath of the runner"" shots. And the angling used during some of the scenes throughout the heist looked very pretty.""Ocean's Eleven"" was a great movie to watch. Not a masterpiece or anything, but it wasn't supposed to be a masterpiece. It was supposed to be a fun movie. And that's what I got: a fun movie.

For the majority of viewers, this movie will pose no threat. It is actually quite clever. But for families with young children or high moral standards, it may not be worth the exposure to f words, casino strippers and the on screen gluttony of a certain blond star...",Ocean's Eleven

How do they pull that off? Well, that's the fun in watching this movie, at least for me. Watching the elaborate plot come to fruition can be very entertaining. Even though I guessed certain points of their plan before they were revealed, I enjoyed seeing the ""flawless"" execution of said plan.I don't believe there is any award-winning material here, but it was a nice update of the good old-fashioned ""heist"" flick.",Ocean's Eleven

377,Don Stephens,"When it turned into a remake of ""Entrapment,"" I tensed up.",6,5 December 2001,"Steven Soderbergh is one of America's best directors, which is why it shocked me that he would willingly direct such easy entertainment.  His success with ""Traffic"" at the box office proves that his usual analytical art can make a hell of a lot of money.  ""Ocean's Eleven"" is an all-star remake of the 1960's Rat Pack classic about a daring casino heist.  Not exactly ""sex, lies, and videotape II,"" now, is it?The first ninety minutes of the film is very entertaining as Soderbergh returns to the verve that he had with ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey,"" with very good performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and a shocker from Bernie Mac.  The first half of the film is stylish and surprisingly believable, but then descends into what can be referred to irrationally as a remake of ""Entrapment"", complete with sporty silver suits, and laser beam sensors.  Soderbergh should have known better.An even bigger bright note though:  Julia Roberts is in the film and she doesn't smile once.  There is a God.*** out of 4",Ocean's Eleven

379,Gabriel_Kuntze,Get ready for an unpopular opinion,3,25 March 2021,"I enjoy scam movies a lot. I decided to give this one a chance, even when it's filled with actors hated by me, since it's quite famous and generally regarded as a great movie, and by many as the ultimate con movie. Boy I was disappointed.First of all, my biggest gripe with this film: I don't care about any of the characters. I don't even know the names of most of them, the only one who has a little bit of development is Ocean himself but since he's played by George Clooney it doesn't matter because that man can't act - he's literally smiling in every single scene. The only character for whom I cared a little was Saul, but after thinking about it I realized that his job is completely unnecesary: why go through all the effort of bringing the explosives into the vault when they had a man inside? Why not just give them to the chinese fella and avoid the whole suitcase drama?The whole movie is filled with plot holes like this one that only serve to pad the film, like the romantic interest that it's 100% useless, and full of ""what if"" situations. What if the EMP didn't worked? What if the tech guy got caught while lost? What if the entered the room where Ocean was getting beaten? The amount of chance this plan was based on is so ridiculous that borders in the realm of magic. I like my scam movies to be rooted in reality, that's why they're fun, because they can easily happen around us.And what's up with the uplifting music after they commited a robbery like this? Am I supposed to feel good about these criminals? They're thiefs! I actually cheered the whole movie for Benedict. I waited for a nice twist at the end that salvaged this whole mess but it never came. Instead, it was filled with cliches: girlfriend goes with the bad guy but at the end she stays with the ""good"" guy, bad guy is bad because he has money and therefore he must be evil and do evil stuff, no one ever caughts them even when the government itself may be after them, they're all so incredibly good at what they do that not even the entire staff at the casino can even stop them, etc.I felt like this movie was the GOODFELLAS of scam films: flashy and cocky, but with crappy plot and even crappier characters. And like GOODFELLAS, it's held like some sort of sacred piece of art. Sorry, but to me, it's more like a piece of crap.",Ocean's Eleven
380,albertsmith-32785,Great crime caper movie.,7,10 July 2018,"Ocean's 11 is a sleek update on the original rat pack film of the 60s. Steven Soderberg is an auteur of sorts, especially in the way he lights his films and this is a gorgeous looking highly atmospheric crime caper set in the casinos and heat of Las Vegas. The film looks cool and the lighting needs to be singled out for that. Of course just lights don't make great films and the script is good. On close inspection it may fall apart but no one really cares about such details with regards to a film like Ocean's 11. The casting is what is stupendous and all the actors are too cool a bunch. Andy Garcia forms a good antagonist to our heroes. Go watch Ocean's 11 for a whale of a time.",Ocean's Eleven
381,johnprestonevans,11 Reason to See Ocean's 11,7,27 December 2001,"1. Its Funny.  The banter between the characters is sometimes labored at being clever and cool - a fallout from Pulp Fiction.  Some of the discusion is funny and the quirks and talents of its players will bring a smile to your face from time to time.2. Brad Pitt.  The ever-eating, sharply dressed brain of the outfit is played well by Pitt, who serves up a couple of laughs and cool handed tricks to make ladies eyes dilate.3. Clever twists.  The typical moviegoer will applaud the antics and mastery of these elite thieves, and just when we think we have everything figured out, there is one more trick to make us applaud again.4. George Clooney.  His dry and cool maner is great in his role as the lead idea man.  His suave moves and slick lines are enough to win back a reluctant ex-love-interest, and fool the tough alter-ego alpha male.5. Cameos.  There are more than a few cameos of A and B list movie stars who appear in small supporting scenes in the film.  Most of them however, are probably just happy to say that they were in a movie with Pitt, Clooney and Roberts.6. Matt Damon.  A chameleon of an actor who joins Ocean's crew as a young inexperienced, yet talented con artist and spy.  Damon brings a nice prescence of awkward overconfidence to the all-cool cast of experienced thieves.7. The Music.  The bright lights of Vegas would be nothing without the big sounds and shows of lounge singers and classic vocalists.  The soundtrack mixes these old school showstoping numbers, with exciting, tense classical music for the more intense robbery scenes.8. The clothes.  Almost every player in this movie is a picture out of GQ or Cosmopolitan magazine.  Its a wonder if designers lined up at Steven Sodderberg's door begging him to let his glorious cast wear their latest chinos and hipcat suits.9. The gadgets.  New technology gives way to more ingenious and exciting ways to illustrate a hiest.  In the way that James Bond and Mission Impossible uped the anti with cool gadgets, Oceans 11 finds ways to move the plot along by introducing cutting edge technology.10. Andy Garcia.  Where has he been all this time?  Well, he's here now and does a fine job being the film's lead antagonist.  A greedy casino boss with a nose for scams and a few dollars for his main squeeze, Garcia is great as the headstrong guy you love to hate.11. Steven Sodderberg.  Coming off is last film - the masterpiece Traffic - Sodderberg summoned Hollywood's best and most popular actors to recreate the Rat Pack from the 1960's.  He keeps the story moving along, twisting it to a predictable outcome.  Gee, what did you think was going to happen?You know what you are going to get, but it's an enjoyable meal none-the-less.  Julia Roberts is in the film also.  She is good, but had too small a role to be a reason to see it. Final Rating = 6.5/10",Ocean's Eleven
382,wndlz,"Stylish and funny, Ocean's 11 is a very satisfying film",8,19 December 2001,"The original was entertaining, because Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr. kept things light. This time around, even without the guys who were Vegas legends, Ocean's 11 is a well crafted and enormously entertaining film. All year, I have been trying to convince my fellow movie buffs, that this version was going to be a totally different movie. I have to confess, I had some doubts as to the eventual outcome, of this movie, but I am very pleased. From creating the heist team, planning it, and finally the caper; witty, outragious entertainment was sustained. Brad Pitt and George Clooney created the coolness, that was necessary to make the movie work. Great chemistry! Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner were wonderful, and added immensely to the feel of the movie. Julia Roberts, was barely competent as Tess, but her bland performance did not hinder the movie that much, and there were moments with George Clooney, that created some sparks. Hollywood should do this type of movie more often.

384,bruno-51,The audience as dupes (SPOILERS!),6,10 December 2001,"Brilliantly shot, edited, paced.  The actors functioned well as an ensemble, though Clooney is clearly in a class by himself.Two beefs.  The first minor one, Julia Roberts did not carry the weight necessary for her role.  She's supposed to be the great unattainable prize, and she's just too folksy and plain jane for this role.  Many consider her glamorous, I consider her equine.My main problem with this film is the complete lack of obstacles our protagonists face.  Sure, they are foiled by the power grid scenario, but within TEN SECONDS Don Cheadle's character has the solution.  Yes, Matt Damon almost gets stuck at the University lab, but the two guards give lame pursuit, and nobody cares to call the cops when the multimillion dollar piece of gear is carted off.  Perhaps you could consider it an obstacle that the gymnast gets his hand stuck, but realize that he could have blown up with the door and it wouldn't have screwed up the plan any.  Or when Saul is nearly recognized...but nothing ever comes of it.  Very lame.No, our eleven heroes waltz in, are in control the ENTIRE time, and even when it seems they are foiled, they had the double-dupe planned all along. I was miffed that the only conflict in this film is not with the characters and their circumstances, but with the audience and a lack of information. There is the weak illusion of a challenge only because we weren't told what all of the eleven knew regarding the plan.  It really would have been great to see Andy Garcia's character throw them a serious curve, but Soderbergh just lets him play right into their hands.  That is really cheap.As an aside, I saw this in digital projection and nearly wet my pants at how good it was.  Great color, no pixellation, no dirt, and sharp, sharp, sharp!",Ocean's Eleven

The script/dialog was great. The cast was sharp, funny, beautiful, and impeccably dressed. And, impressively, the story kept me interested to the very end. The soundtrack was excellent too, very well-crafted order and choice of music. Overall, quite an entertaining film.",Ocean's Eleven
386,ianwarrender,I think it's the fact of the cast and the humour in it that makes this film very good,8,11 February 2002,"When thinking about the movie to write this review I had to pinch myself to come up with why I really like this movie because it shouldn't be as good as it was. The main problem is the plot or lack of, Danny Ocean comes up with a plan for stealing cash, and they do it, and no it never really gets any more complicated. Okay I'll admit that there's are a few twists, but after the woman turns up then it very easy to see where the plot is going. However even with the lack of plot, director Steven Soderbergh manages to produces another great movie. One reason is the one liners, they're nearly all funny and there's something for everyone's taste, at times when thinking about the movie, it would do well as a stand up comedy act. Then there's the cast, WOW how much money went on the pay roll is my question (I could list them but there's no point). Everyone plays their part very well, there are no weak performances, although I have to point out Matt Damon for the best performance. Yes I think it's the fact of the cast and the humour in it that makes this film very good. This is another go and see movie, especially if you want a good night out with some fun.",Ocean's Eleven
387,tyguy-2,"Clever crime caper, but not quite among the best of the genre",6,1 November 2002,"I love crime caper flicks and this one is pretty good and made better by the all-star cast.  I haven't seen the original Oceans 11 starring the Rat Pack, so a comparison can't be made, and probably isn't fair, really.   As with any good caper movie, you have a man fresh out of the clink (Clooney) who plans the one big job that will set him for life and allow him to take the straight and narrow when its done.  We follow the recruitment of the old gang, the planning, and assorted hi-jinx along the way.  The characters are interesting enough, with a mixed bag of old-time Vega$ types as well as some young nerdlings and assorted hipsters thrown in the mix, makes for an entertaining bunch.  The plot is to rob three casinos at once and actually is quite elaborate.  One thing I dug about it was that they slowly revealed how the robbery would take place, so your are kept in the dark for much of the movie.  To complicate matters, Clooney targets one of the casinos because his ex is seeing the owner.  Normally, this would seem like a contrivance to bring in the 'chick flick' audience (Doesn't having Clooney in a movie already bring in the chicks??), but it tosses a kink into their plans, so I'll let is slide.  The movie is entertaining enough to recommend, but doesn't quite stand up against the best caper flicks.",Ocean's Eleven

389,abhishek-1,Eleven guys on a joyride!!!,6,6 February 2002,"'Ocean's Eleven', a film that was originally made in 1960 with: Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack; and without: success, took someone of a calibre and grit that only Steven Soderbergh possesses; to be remade. But this time around, the film turns out to be an interesting ride, thanks mainly to an amazingly cool and hip cast and an improved script. Using James Bond-like gadgetry and an unreal approach to the proceedings, the film makes for interesting and arrested viewing.The story of 'Ocean's Eleven' revolves around Danny Ocean(George Clooney), a thief just out of prison and ready for his next heist: robbing three Las Vegas casinos in one night. As much impossible as this sounds, it is but obvious that he needs to assemble probably the world's best men on this project. Here begins the search for the best of the best. It is this phase of the movie and the subsequent preparation for the big night that is probably the most entertaining. This assimilation of various people, excellent at what they do, includes Rusty(Brad Pitt), Linus Caldwell(Matt Damon), Basher Tarr(Don Cheadle), Tishkoff(Elliot Gould), Frankie(Bernie Mac), the Malloy brothers(Scott Caan, Casey Affleck), a Chinese acrobat(Shaobo Qin), a computer wizard(Edward Jemison), and an old-timer Bloom(Carl Reiner). As each one of them prepares for their respective roles in this ""biggest heist ever"", Rusty begins to suspect Ocean's real motives: acquisition of the money or the retrieval of his lost love Tess(Julia Roberts), now with the owner of these three casinos; Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia). How the story moves from here till the ultimate robbery is brilliantly held together by a tight script and an awesome climax with a twist, if you may call it so!The high point of this movie, apart from the studded star cast, is the performance put in by each actor. Everyone performs their role with effortless ease. Also, none of the cast appears to be affected by the presence of the other. This works wonderfully for the movie, as not only does the cast have a lot of fun but every single member of the audience feels comfortable. The other thing that works in this movie's favour is that it doesn't stick only to the heist but dwelves into other seemingly less-important but highly effective areas like the moments of interaction between Clooney and Roberts, with the latter trying to resist the charms of the former. The dialogues are void of profanity, which makes these characters innocent and hence, likable. Almost midway through the movie, you begin to view the ""11"" not as crooks but as your friends trying to make through an examination that you very much feel a part of yourself. At times, one does wonder at the ease at which these guys go through their work. But, then considering that most of the film proceeds like a fantasy, you might as well let it be a fable.Steven Soderbergh clearly showcases his variety of talent by making a movie as commercial and racy as this, especially after movies like 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic'. This is one person who has every right to swagger. He does let his trademark penchant for quirky visuals creep in, in those frequent flashes and the scene with the entire 'Eleven"" at the end. Mr. Soderbergh, take a bow!From the cast, it is Pitt who excels as he suavely walks through his portrayal of Rusty. George Clooney does his part with all earnest. This is one man who can make audiences(read ""women"") swoon just by giving a tilt to his head. Julia Roberts and Matt Damon are wasted in roles that were underwritten, but this doesn't stop them from bringing themselves to the notice of everyone. Andy Garcia does good enough to be liked in the role of the only unlikeable character in the movie. The others perform their roles honestly, but the surprise package comes from Carl Reiner as the old and worn-out Bloom. His screen-presence makes you feel as warm as the cookies prepared by your Grandma. Just for this cast, that will almost definitely never be reassembled, this movie's worth a watch.Rating- **** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent",Ocean's Eleven

391,TBoldOne,So Bad That You Root For The Casino To Win!,1,14 November 2009,"Why do modern movies not have original ideas? This movie is horrid. Everyone knows that this is a remake of the classic 1960 of the same name. There are so many things that are bad about this movie that I can only focus on the most egregious problems.First - NO CHEMISTRY. That character development is so bad that you end up rooting for the casino! They try to portray the casino owner, who's supposed to be Steve Wynn, as some kind of jerk. I found him to be a sympathetic character. In a heist picture, you are supposed to have sympathy for the crooks. Otherwise, they are just jerks who decide to steal because they are too lazy to make an honest living. Well the movie makes the bad guys look like jerks, and the casino out to be the hero. One wag once said, ""Rooting for the Yankee's is like cheering for the house to win in Blackjack."" I found myself cheering for the house.Second JULIA ROBERTS. She can't act, and is not beautiful. She is the source of the dramatic tension in the movie. I just don't get it.Third TOTALLY PREDICTABLE ENDING. You just knew that the cops coming into the building were fake, and would walk out with the loot. There are so many plot holes, that it strained credulity. The originals plot was more believable, and it was not supposed to be realistic.Fourth ACTORS LOOKED BORED. Clooney, Damon, and Roberts looked bored to tears. To me it was obvious that they were there to pick up a paycheck.Overall, horrid, bad, terrible, disjointed. The only rip-off in this movie is to the people who paid to see it in the theater, or worse bought the DVD. I can't believe they made two sequels to this turd.",Ocean's Eleven
392,Ivan-28,A movie that's beneath Sodenberg's talents,5,14 May 2002,"I didn't know what to expect since I never saw the original and avoidedwatching the trailers as much as possible. It was hip. It was cool. But that's about it. I get the impression that's all they tried for. The acting was fine. The actors were all obviously having a good time making it. They're all criminals, but we end up liking them.
WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! Julia Roberts was put into the film for obvious reasons. First, she's bankable. With all these popular actors in it, some eye candy was wanted. After all, this takes place in glitzy Las Vegas. Polls have shown she's the most popularactress around. Plus her character serves a purpose where the Andy Garciacharacter can get burned even more than if their romantic subplot didn't exist. Personally, I agree she didn't need to be in it. The subplot of her and Garcia felt calculated to me. It was just there to make me feel better that Garcia lost twice to Clooney. It made no sense to me whatsoever for Julia Roberts to go back to Clooney. I thought she was tired of his days of theft and lying. If she didn't care about those things, she would have stayed with Garcia.
I'm often criticized for my lack of ability to suspend my disbelief and that I think too much about things that seem minor to others. But why are these guys evenbeing made to look cool and heroic anyway? They just ripped off 3 casinos ofmany, MANY millions. Doesn't a lot of this money go to pay wages of lots ofworkers who need the money more? Doesn't a lot of it pay taxes in the statethat serve the citizens of Nevada? Who's going to make up the loss? If thecasinos get reimbursed by insurance, won't that mean higher premiums forthose who can afford it the least? Another thing that bugged me is how can they even get away with it? I assumethat the casinos aren't really run by only Andy Garcia. Wouldn't the mob have a strong hold in it as well? I doubt they would appreciate the loss and would use all their power and influence to find the thieves. How did these guys build an exact replica of the vault? Why did Andy Garciaallow Matt Damon to go the room alone? Why did he release George Clooney tothe police? If he really suspected Clooney and was as heartless as we'resupposed to think he is, why wasn't the truth tortured out of Clooney?
The answer to all these questions is that the movie is just there to pander to the audience and make them think they're cool. We're made to like them fromthe start because they're good-looking, friendly, use hip language, dress well, drink and eat the best liquor and food, hang around with celebrities, and know how to gamble against boring kids. I like Sodenberg's movies otherwise. I'm a fan of SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE;OUT OF SIGHT; ERIN BRONKOVICH; and especially TRAFFIC. And I really have toget around to check out KING OF THE HILL and KAFKA. But this movie wasbeneath him.

393,Paolo_UK,Nice cover of the same old story,7,25 January 2002,"Ocean's Eleven is a cover of a story we've all seen a billion times. A bunch of gentle, smart, mostly good looking thieves robs the world's safest safe in the world's brightest city. A stars parade like few other, with an intricate and highly unrealistic plot, with far too many details and characters. I think director Steve Soderbergh and the cast can't fully control so much, and everything turns out as entertaining and light, but dull and easily forgotten. This is perfect if you want to spend a couple of hours in a pleasant, relaxing way.

The two fit like the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle. Everyone else plays their part to the T. Soderbergh has himself another gem. You cannot say enough about the cast though as they make the film. Andy Garcia could be the best performer in the movie, as he plays a stone cold businessman who only cares about his hotels.  A must see for a fan of movies.",Ocean's Eleven

I didn't do that with Oceans Eleven, but it's so good it makes me wish I could turn back time and change my course.  Starting off with George Clooney in a goatee discussing his reasons for being paroled, the movie grabs you by the lapels and never lets go.  Clooney and Pitt steal and own the show, most notably Pitt, who is easily becoming the all around coolest actor in all of Hollywood.  Everything he touches turns to gold these days.  From frame 1 to the joke credit for Julia Roberts, the movie is one great ride.

397,Virginia_Farmboy,A superior remake,10,5 February 2007,"The original Ocean's Eleven was a misfire: it was slow, unfunny, and devoid of any sort of entertainment. Surprisingly, Hollywood was able to produce a remake far superior to the original--an extreme rarity. This film owes little to the 1960 film, and that is not a bad thing.Ocean's Eleven is an example of a stylish, flashy, and cool movie done right. Too often big stars come together to collaborate on an ambitious project only to produce a pile of trash. While that may describe this film's sequel, Ocean's Eleven is anything but of a pile of trash. It's full of wit and humor and style, and for me it is never boring ,even when I know what's going to happen. Think of the possibilities if Hollywood could churn out original ideas with scripts as good as Ocean's Eleven.",Ocean's Eleven
398,FoxGarrison,How to knock over a Casino...,7,24 June 2002,"Imagine if you will an all-star cast.  Now imagine that same cast doing what they do best--act.  Ocean's 11 is not like that.Don't get me wrong now, I didn't say they didn't know how to act--I said Ocean's 11 is different if you didn't want the hassle of figuring out what the actors were trying to get across to the audience.Having said that...Ocean's 11 is a nifty little robbery flick that is fun to watch and great for a lazy Saturday night.  In fact, the whole atmosphere has that Saturday Night draw, so it would be difficult thinking otherwise.
George Clooney stars as a con just out of prison getting ready to pull another score.  Brad Pitt stars as his buddy getting the whole thing set up. It's really great watching these two guys playing against one another. They have instant chemistry on the screen and are complimented by all the other slowly introduced actors in the story--Matt Damon, Andy Garci, Julia Roberts, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould...etc.  They are all fantastic.
One thing though:  If you ever wondered what ever happened to Vincent Mancini in Godfather III--look no more--he dumped Imobolare to work in Las Vegas.  Of course I'm talking about Andy Garcia as the bad guy.  I don't think I've seen Garcia since G3 so it was a surprise to see that he was playing the same type of character which led me to believe that his career was nothing but a big type-casting event.  It wasn't until recently that I realized he did other things other than Vincent Mancini roles.  I guess that's a tidbit that's neither here or there.The sets on Ocean 11 were very well conceived.  The color, lighting and audio was the usual Hollywood splendor.  There's really nothing bad to say about this movie.  I would give it a 7/10",Ocean's Eleven

It's aged tremendously well. Fun, and kinetic like this is rare today.There's very few green screen, CGI or special effects shots. This is all about good writing, characters, plot, pacing, camera work, score, and set designs. Apart from one characters laughable English accent (and I'm English, people!) there's virtually not a line or scene out of place.Hollywood today could learn a lot from noting the heartbeats of this film, and the great, great underrated screenplay that drives it. Its perhaps not a surprise that the sequels struggled to live up to it - this is mastery on the first take.",Ocean's Eleven
400,ghonzo,A great caper flick with fun performances,8,26 January 2004,"This was the second time to see this movie, and it's just as cool as I remembered.  ""Cool"" and ""style"" are really the two words that spring to mind when trying to describe this movie.  A great caper flick with fun (though maybe a little too self-aware) performances by Pitt and Clooney and the rest of the cast.",Ocean's Eleven
401,KeyC0de,"The Smartest, Slickest Heist movie ever.",9,9 January 2018,"I had a blast with this movie when I first saw it with my parents when I was very young, even though I couldn't comprehend as much.It's a movie about a slick Las Vegas casino heist, that is seemingly impossible to pull through. Therefore Ocean (Clooney) tries to assemble a team of ""experts"" to make it possible. The planning has an attention to detail that you don't normally witness in movies like these. I have analyzed the heist after a couple of viewings, to check for any plot holes, but I can't really find any (other than the ""pinch"" which is kind of fictional). There's a large cast of main characters, each with a different personality and even if you thought it's hard to present them all well and good, then you will be pleasantly surprised that by the end of the film you will be able to name all of them.
The only aspect of the plot I feel was totally unnecessary is the inclusion of Julia Roberts, her role is generally on the surface; she's the love interest, nothing more - except for that one event which implicates her directly .. (but it could definitely be handled in some other way); which I won't spoil.The acting is impeccable. Character development is excellent. Dialogue is handled gracefully. Visuals are stunning and memorable, direction is top-notch. The director allows you to see exactly what is needed in each scene. It leaves you to do some thinking of your own (not too much) which I personally enjoy. The ending is the best part. It is Unbelievable perfectly executed. With only one viewing you definitely won't understand what happened, how everything was executed with such finesse and professionalism and you may have to wrap your head around it all to figure it out.
There's a positive vibe throughout and this movie can be enjoyed alone, with a partner or with the entire family. There's not much violence or other adult elements; the movie doesn't need them.Are there negative aspects?
Yeah, there are 2 things that bother me.Even though the selling point of this movie is the heist, after lots of thinking I realize that Ocean's primary incentive to hit these 3 casinos was to get back Tess. As I said, I disliked Tess, she's superficial, her performance is lacking and It saddens me a little that Daniel would go to all this trouble to get her back and avenge Garcia for stealing her away from it. Even though it is not actually stealing, he didn't force her, yet she gave way.
This is where the whole thrilling experience leaves me with a slightly bitter taste. They could have made such payoff from a much less complex task; but Ocean decided to hit THOSE places just to win Tess back, all the while he hid his true motives from his partners until Rusty figured him out. It is hard to empathize with him and his whole romance affair when we don't have enough background on it.
Also how come Tess knew Rusty? These fellows certainly have history, which is completely glossed over. An intro or even a flashback lasting no more than 5 minutes should have existed to give the audience some insight.Another minor thing is we see that they stash all the cash inside an armored SWAT truck inside a getaway building. Therefore the money is live cash, not deposited in banks. This makes the whole escape thing dangerous. I would like to see more of how they handle it after this, how they distribute it to each member etc. My guess is they can't simply deposit it out of the blue unless they have a way to justify such a gross surge of money; especially Danny who was on his parole and he has a record.These two prevent me from awarding the perfect title of masterpiece.Rating: 9/10 - Great",Ocean's Eleven
402,Gavin59,Ocean's Eleven,8,1 October 2008,"One's attention is immediately drawn to this movie for its many famous stars such as George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. It is a bit odd storyline from the beginning that Daniel Ocean, played by George Clooney, risked robbing the casino for love and revenge. However, I liked how they planned the whole thing out carefully and how the movie proceeded speedy. I liked the part when Rusty, played by Brad Pitt, calls Terry Benedict, played by Andy Garcia, and tells him that they are robbing his casino. And yet, Benedict wasn't able to get anything, neither the money nor his woman. Also, I liked how it let Tess, played by Julia Roberts, know Benedict preferred money to her. I thought it would have been better if the casino heist weren't so perfectly planned and that there were some critical moments or tensions. Though I now know there is a sequel of this movie, ""Ocean's Twelve"", when I first watched this movie I predicted that there would be another one. Because at the end two of Benedict's staffs follow where Ocean and Rusty were going. All-in-all this was a hilarious and well-acted movie overall.",Ocean's Eleven

404,cjdouglas,Go Clooney and pals! or should I say new rat pack?,8,22 December 2001,"Yes, I enjoyed this movie. It was good entertainment! Initially when the movie started, I felt myself thinking - I hope this gets better and picks up the pace. Thankfully it did. The introduction of Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould in the movie added a new and better dimension to the story. Good call on putting in some good old actors in there to make it more interesting!The acting all around was pretty good. My only beef is with Clooney and Soderbergh casting Julia as Tess. She had zero chemistry with everybody that she came in contact with. the chemistry with her and Andy Garcia was flat and close to non-existent. Julia was supposed to be George's ex - there should be some sort of chemistry there, but again, I felt none. Actually, she was more like a window dressing, she didn't need to be in the movie at all.I would have to say the best chemistry that was tangible was that between George and Brad. They were a great pair - George and Soderbergh did a bang up job of getting everybody else in this movie!the story moved along quite nicely after the first few minutes, introducing the characters, new spins, and twists to the plot. It kept me laughing and watching with anticipation (even though you can figure out the ending). And the special effects when it came to the actually heist, I thought were pretty cool.Although I've never seen the original, I'm sure that this was far better. This group of actors have coolness almost up there with the rat pack! Pair that group of actors with a good upbeat script and you can't go wrong!I would suggest this movie to anyone. To thumbs up.",Ocean's Eleven

But the one major disappointment was the extra scene at the end. The scene before that where they are standing in front of the hotel with Claire de Lune playing should have been the end, and Ocean's Eleven would have been the perfect movie. The extra ending completely ruined the mood of the movie. Anyway, I would recommend this movie.>",Ocean's Eleven

407,TheGreenSaga,An entertaining homage to crime capers.,8,7 December 2001,"I was lucky enough to view this film in a sneak preview the night before it's opening.  I have never seen the original, but I must say that this movie was great entertainment that had me laughing, and on the edge of my seat.The characters in the film could have been developed some more, but their chemistry together was particularly both amusing and cooperative.The director of this film, after his huge success with Traffic, has definitely shown himself again as a somewhat experimental filmmaker.  His various uses of Extreme Close Ups and rapid montage are excellent and thought provoking, and his hypnotic way of using just the right volume of music at the right time puts you in perspective with the characters.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this film is that I, myself, felt like Andy Garcia's character.  This is because the main cast of thieves kept on surprising the audience little by little, leaving the detective work to us.  I truly could not figure anything out of any one scene until the scene was over.  This was experimental, because some viewers don't like to try and figure things out, but I believe that it worked.There are a few problems with the film.  One of the problems is that the very talented Matt Damon seemed to have been placed on a low key throughout the film, and the hysterical Bernie Mac seemed to have been given a low profile in the editing room.However, I still enjoyed this movie tremendously, routed for the bad guys like I was supposed to, and I would recommend this movie to anybody with a free Saturday night.I rate this film : ********  (Eight out of Ten)",Ocean's Eleven

The all-star cast is well and fine, but the story line just sat there. I had totally no interest in the characters, or the scam. The only redeeming factor was when George Clooney left the money for 'the girl'. He was man enough to admit it, and walk away from the loot.  Otherwise, it stunk.",Ocean's Eleven
410,Aditya_Dutta,"A very cool, slick movie with a lot of class",9,27 July 2020,"Ocean's Eleven. It's become the benchmark for heist movies. It's been inspired by several classics and has also been an inspiration for so many others.The funny thing about Ocean's Eleven is there's nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly.The cast oozes class. From Andy García being immaculately dressed in a perfectly fit suit to the sheer rawness of the rag-tag squad, it all blends in beautifully.
The sheer audacity of the objective of the movie is absolutely bonkers and the way they go about it is nothing short of mind blowing.Impeccable planning right to the very second as well as quick improvisation should there be a surprise encounter, this movie is of a gold standard.
So much so that, it's always going to be a fun rewatch irrespective of the number of times its been watched before.",Ocean's Eleven

The actors are all having fun: in a big picture with a dozen other stars and a super-hot director, wearing incredible clothes and (in Brad Pitt's case) eating whatever you want.  Good photography, extremely decent acting, snappy dialogue.  It's a really stylish movie.And that's it.  There's nothing mind-boggling or thought provoking about it: it's a ride.  A really nice ride.  If you're up for that, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

412,venkat_rs,Entertaining,6,17 February 2002,"The casting coup, though not quite matching up to K3G, would still draw big crowds. Hopping onto the bandwagon is Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich), the flavour of the year 2000.
The movie is a re-make of a 1960s one with same name, starring the 'Ratpack' led by Frank Sinatra. In short, the story deals with eleven men joining hands to loot three casinos in Las Vegas (where else?). The plot and cast arousing a good deal of interest, Soderbergh wouldn't need to worry about marketing. After an initial good pace, the movie slightly slows down and then picks up steam in the second half. The planning and execution of the robbery are impressive, with some surprises and subtle humour packed in. Some glaring loop-holes and cliches in the screenplay become forgivable. Clooney strides his part like a king, while Pitt is stylish. The rest are adequate in their small roles. Soderbergh maintains his trademark slick and realistic narration, aided by intelligent editing.
Overall, an enjoyable movie, enhanced by the presence of big stars.",Ocean's Eleven

A rather superficial story set in the colourful and well illuminated Las Vegas. The actors play well but not all are convincing. The robbery is ingenious and is the core of the movie. But towards the end there was this feeling of unfinished business. As if a piece was missing. Or maybe a too superficial movie. The trailer was more attractive than the movie itself. Nevertheless, it is still enjoyable to watch.",Ocean's Eleven

That having been said.  I really didnt have any expectations, but any I had were exceeded. The plot was imaginative & the planning of the robbery & the way it was carried out was unique.  I never thought things would work out the way they did.  If you like movies like Usual Suspects, Fight Club, & 6th Sense, check out Ocean's Eleven.  I also like how realistic it was.  Thou it pushed the fold at times, it never ventured into the realm of the ridiculous, like some movies i could mention (i.e. Mission Impossible 2)  All in all, a very entertaining couple of hours spent.  4 out of 5",Ocean's Eleven

It's not deep nor meant to rock your world, but in its own way it's very intelligent and well-written. All the actors have great little characteristics that are just fun to watch. This is the movie that I put on when I just want to escape and not think (along with the 2 others from the series). I know it all and still I enjoy the details of it every time and I notice new things every time. I'm never tired of it. The dialogue is fun and witty and again, the acting is really good. You can tell everybody on the set is having fun and enjoying working together. This is why they all accepted a reduced salary in order to be able to do this, and the 2 sequels - otherwise the movie would have cost an insane amount of money. I never saw the first version, and frankly, I like this one so much, I don't think I want to see the other one, because I'm afraid it'll ruin it for me :-)",Ocean's Eleven
419,Bigbert,Boring movie with no ending to speak off,4,11 November 2003,"I was expecting quite a lot from this movie and boy was I disappointed. This is a boring story with very bleak performances by actors who don't really seem to be willing to do anything but just read their lines. The 'action' is sleep invoking and you don't even care that anything could go wrong. You can't help comparing it with the original and although that was not the best of movies it stands with head and shoulders above this remake. The Rat Pack version did have the different casino's they robbed, but here it was all compiled into one 'megavault' that seems to be able to be cracked by a granny in between her nap and afternoon tea. There's nothing original about this movie and as said the actors are much underused. The ending is even more boring than the rest of the movie. The cast (sans Clooney and Roberts) just stand there in a line looking at nothing for about ten minutes and then look at each other as if to say 'are we supposed to have any lines in this scene'. Looking at the line-up I even wondered who half of them were as I probably just blinked when their brief appearance was up.Again the original has a wonderful ending, actually together with the original Italian Job's ending my top favourite ending for a caper movie. Give this one a miss and watch the original; at least there you have the chemistry between Sinatra and co (ánd a proper ending).",Ocean's Eleven

It made Keanu Reeves attempt in Dracula look positively spiffing!!!",Ocean's Eleven
421,Kurzbein,Well done fluff,7,27 December 2001,"This remake of the Rat Pack original is about what you'd expect out of the material and director.  It possesses a good pace, isn't too indulgent and has a certain style to it.  That it's almost completely predictable is beside the point.With Pitt, Clooney and Garcia in this film, my wife couldn't have been happier.  The one with whom she's most enamored, Clooney, smirks a lot, can't act and isn't believable.  Luckily Carl Reiner, Elliott Gould and Brad Pitt CAN act, and along with Andy Garcia they put on quite a show.  Reiner, in particular, hits just the right note, and given that he was hired to replace Alan Arkin just days before they started shooting (Arkin had become unavailable due to illness), it's all the more impressive.  Gould, fitted with the perfect wardrobe, was born to play this role.  Years ago Pitt met the fork in his career path and chose ""actor"" over ""movie star"", and that choice is evident here.More could have been done with the screenplay, particularly the dialogue. It doesn't percolate the way you'd expect it to in a film like this.  Even so, the story telling is tight, and the editing paces the film just right. Soderbergh directs with a sense of style, particularly the post-caper seen in front of the waterfall which is a clever, if incongruous, way to let the actors take a bow.

George Clooney, Brad Pitt have delivered outstanding performances. Clooney in the role of a wife separated lover, who tries to re unite with her and perform a heist at the same time, is marvelous. Pitt as a loyal friend is also good. Julia Roberts as the wife, who loves her husband but is not ready to forgive him, is also stupendous. The twists in the movie are lovely and the whole plot and movie is very dynamic and static. Not a second will make you feel bored. Watch it.",Ocean's Eleven
425,robybaggio18,One of my guilty pleasures,8,14 August 2012,"It is not a masterpiece in general since it is not even close to being a serious movie. Still, it knows what it wants to be and it is wonderfully fine tuned to almost perfection. The plot is fairly simple and entertaining, it is nicely timed (not being a minute too short or too long) and it has a finale that stretches almost half an hour without a moment of boredom. All this makes a solid backbone for the strongest part of this movie - small details and dialogs.Except for some Tarantino movies, you will hardly find anything modern in Hollywood done which such slick dialogs and chemistry between characters. There are dozens of small and funny attachments which put the icing on the cake and make you a fan or in my case an addict:1. Rusty and Ocean together on screen 2. Rusty eating in almost every scene. There is (obviously) no need for that, but it is there. And you feel like it is natural that it should be there. 3. Amazing Yen and his conversations with others. 4. The whole joke about Linus (Matt Damon) being a rookie and trying to achieve reputation of Ocean and Rusty (and in real life Clooney and Pitt as a movie star). 5. Small, almost unnoticed comments like when Topher says ""actually, they're both named Bernie"" or ""I'll never forgive you for the thing with the guy in the place"". There are about a hundred of lines like that which people who watch the movie for the first time will not understand, but after several viewings they easily become insider jokes. 6. It's a heist movie and yet there are no dead people and no weapons used. Not to mention no CGI, no massive explosions and no sex on screen. It can be done and it was done. 7. Fictional Lewis vs. Klicko match as a background event, brilliant. At the time they agreed only for this fictional match for the movie, the real fight was arranged months after that. 8.

The best thing about this movie is the banter between the actors, just like in the original.  There are a lot of really funny lines (some of them aren't delivered well though).  That and some nice cinematography is basically the only thing I really liked about this movie. The plot is very slick, too slick if you ask me.  After explaining how impossible it will be to get into a mega-vault in order to steal $160 million from three Las Vegas casinos, the 11 guys proceed to do it almost without breaking a sweat.  There are only a few brief sequences where they fear that something may actually go wrong, and even in those scenes the tension doesn't seem as intense as it should be.  Maybe that's because the lead guy, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) can do  prison time with no trouble at all.  When the movie starts, Ocean has just been released after 4 years in prison but there is only a slight mention of how hard prison life was for him.  He even has some banter with the parole board as he's being released. As for the characters, all the actors do suitable jobs but there is no character development.  They try to create some by giving some of the characters a quirky habit (one guy sweats a lot, Brad Pitt is constantly eating, etc).  Plus, these guys must be the cleanest criminals the world has ever known.  They're clean cut, well dressed, and they don't even swear a lot.  Even the stripper in one scene is fully dressed.

432,mysteri,"A Soderbergh Sundae, with the cherry...",8,14 May 2002,"***Possible Spoilers (though very slight)***This is a fun, ""bubble-gum for the brain"" type movie.  It is a little suspenseful, but for the most part, easy to follow.  I've not seen the 1960's version of this movie, so I base my opinions on the 2001 version alone.  I thought the casting was great.  And I liked seeing Brad Pitt and Matt Damon in a working relationship.  They have complimentary acting skills.  Of all the (modern) actors out there, I think that Brad Pitt has the widest array of characters, with Matt Damon easily in the top five.  Even though they both play their most tried and true personalities in this movie, I was glad to see them together.  I don't easily buy into the craze, and for a while, I didn't like Brad Pitt or his movies, but after seeing his diversity, he is impossible to ignore!  I am finding the same pattern in Matt Damon.  George Clooney is yet another actor who I thought was riding on his looks, but as it turns out, he is a consistent actor.  I've not seen him in many varying roles, but he does play this character well.  As always, Julia Roberts is cast as the leading lady, struggling with her plight for control over her destiny, or rather, her autonomy.  Granted, she is the highest paid actress, and one of the three highest paid actors OR actresses in Hollywood, she does her character well.  (Which is probably why she is so high paid).  In Ocean's Eleven, she once again plays her character to a tee.  I felt that the Chemistry between she had Clooney was admirable, though perhaps a little practiced.  And then we have Andy Garcia...a flawless performance, once again.  He consistently plays a wonderful villain-type character, and Terry Benedict is no exception.  I did feel that this film perhaps insulted his intelligence, it was necessary for the progression of the plot.

435,ladyjane99,Was it worth it?,2,27 January 2002,"You expect a lot with a cast like the one in this movie, which probably is one reason you may end up disappointed. Somehow all these good actors just didn't work. Can't remember the original, though I saw it years ago, and can say the same about this one. Remakes very seldom work, but apparently lack of good original scripts makes the studios shoot out all these remakes. The funny notion was that Julia Roberts walked on the high heels like a farm girl. She could've have had heavy boots on just the same. Otherwise a fantastic actress, but if she isn't used to heels like that, why make her wear them. For me this was a waste of time and money.",Ocean's Eleven

437,bobwestal-2,Nifty!,10,17 December 2001,"Judging from some of the remarks on this board, it seems that it's been so long since there's been classy, deliberately lightweight entertainment that people don't know how to react!This is a rare opportunity to see a filmmaker at the top of his form goofing and having a great time -- and giving us a relaxing, great time. Too much suspence could actually ruin a cinamatic souffle of this type. (That's why comparisons to ""Rififi"" don't really make a lot of sense here.) This is easily the best looking film I've seen in some time and the immediacy of the performances, which has to have something to do with SS being his own DP, really brings something a little bit new to the blackjack table.'I enjoyed it from start to finish (though I admit the ending played a slightly off). I always judge movies based on what how well they achieved their goals -- not how well they acheive the goals I think they ought to have. Just like ""Iron Monkey"", which aspired to be nothing more than an super-fun, funny and good natured martial arts film and nothing else --- and achieved it perfectly, Ocean's 11 aims at a goal most people think is ""lower"" than on a movie like ""Traffic"" (perhaps wrongly, but that's a whole essay for some other time), but achieves it in top form, with plenty of flourishes and grace notes.I'll say it again. ""Nifty""!!!!",Ocean's Eleven
438,BryMan-4,Flashy but safe vanity piece,5,4 December 2001,"Barely watchable, the first Ocean's Eleven was a vanity piece.  It was an excuse for some hepcats to get together, drink a few martinis, do a few numbers and film a caper movie in their favorite city, Las Vegas. Forty-one years later comes Steven Soderbergh's highly anticipated remake, which amounts to another vanity piece for Clooney and Company, albeit a more watchable one.  George Clooney and Brad Pitt swagger through the movie like a modern day Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.  It's hard to say they add or subtract anything from the movie since it is all surface fluff and retro eye candy.  The biggest disappointment is Julia Roberts.  Her relationship with Clooney and Andy Garcia is never really fleshed out, so she seems little more than runway model for some slinky dresses.  It's a shame this talented actress is reduced to the worthless `love interest'.  It would have been more interesting to inject some estrogen into the film by making her one of the master thieves.  Soderbergh shows a deft hand in style.  This is one of the more colorful films he has directed.  It has a sort of 60's wacca-wacca feel.  Unfortunately he has a heavier hand with his actors.  Elliot Gould is allowed to go slightly over the top, but Carl Reiner is restrained like a prisoner on death row.  We know this veteran comic genius is capable of so much more.  I kept waiting for him to cut loose, but it never happened. The screenplay plays it too safe.  At no point do we sense that our heroes are in any danger or the job is in jeopardy.  We know they will succeed, so all the tension that drives the movie is gone.  What's left is the cleverness of the heist, and it is plenty clever.  There are a few laughs peppered here and there, but for the most part it's played too straight.",Ocean's Eleven

Given the talent on show, both behind and in front of the camera, this film could have been a classic.  Instead it's a lightweight crime caper that trades solely on our affection for the (many) headline stars on show.The saddest indictment of the film is that my abiding memory of it will be Don Cheadle's hopeless cockneyish English accent - why not just get an Englishman to play the role and at least try to do it properly?Failings aside, there are some plus points.  Clooney and Pitt are both excellent, the swift pace means there's no time to dwell on how the lack of depth to both the plot and the characters and the script is adequate. Always a pleasure to watch Andy Garcia, although he is employed here merely as a stereotype 'boss' character.Disappointing, given what might have been (6/10).",Ocean's Eleven
442,peanutthegreat,Awful,1,18 May 2002,"This is a really bad film. First of all, there is the acting. Most of it was rather dull, with the exceptions of Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and  Andy Garcia. Even Matt Damon--one of my favorite modern actors--gave a dull performance. Clooney was the worst, as the arrogant thief who sets out to prove that it's okay to steal $160 million dollars, as long as its because some respectable businessman who works for his money dates your ex-wife while you are in jail. That is pretty much the theme to this film. Then there is the dialogue. It's just plain terrible (with a few good one-liners here and there, I must admit). Probably the worst dialogue comes at the very end (in Rusty's car). By far the worst scene was near the end, when the robbers are standing near the fountain, it was bad stuff. This film does not even compare to the original. Frank Sinatra is much, much more of an actor than Clooney is, and he's not conceited. The original was better, and the premise was better. I liked a group of army buddies with nothing to lose better than some guy trying to 'screw the guy thats screwing his wife' with a bunch of people he had never before met. The original had the far superior ending too.",Ocean's Eleven

This is one hell of a ride. Eleven criminal associates plot to rob a string of casinos in Las Vegas. Yes, this is a remake of the Rat Packs 1960' flick `Ocean's Eleven'. I have not seen the first one, but I plan to do so very soon. I hear it isn't as good as the 2001 replica, but everyone has their own opinion on that. Back to the movie. No, I try not to breakdown the whole plot, or spoil the movie for anyone in my reviews. Because one, if you've seen the movie, you already know what it's about, and two - if you haven't, I'm sure you don't wanna be spoiled, so lets just move on. The film has a nice crime fill mixed with some comedy. Some, nice .. witty comedy. It is pretty high on my all time list, along with other fantastic George Clooney movies.
I highly suggest this film, as my rating stands at: 9/10. You can also look forward to Oceans Eleven 2 (not the real title), which has been confirmed for the near future.",Ocean's Eleven

And the plot wasn't that exciting the first time round- why on earth we needed to remake this film, let alone make a sequel is beyond me.Julia Roberts leaves me cold on a normal day, but surrounded by such a haplessly dull cast made her performance seem even less impressive- it's no great loss to the film industry that I didn't like this film as every single other person on earth loved it- but then again, Brad Pitt's a relative God to a lot of people for no good reason anyway...",Ocean's Eleven
446,mrnickheath,The Perfect Caper Movie,10,13 February 2021,"I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I came to it via the soundtrack first, which is a stellar album put together by Belfast's finest, David Holmes.
The film is simply a brilliant caper movie, where no one dies, no one gets hurt (except the odd squeezed or crushed hand). And the good guys win and the bad guys loses a lot of money but probably makes it back again the following weekend.
The cast is fabulous, no one over acts, Brad Pitt eats a lot, and even Julia Roberts is pretty good. Bernie Mac steals the show as always, closely followed by Elliott Gould as Reuben, the crews bank roll. I think Don Cheadle does really well with his British accent, take a listen to dozens of others and you'll wonder why he got so much stick for it. Matt Damon deserves a special mention too, the first time I liked him in a film. The brothers are hilarious too, played by Casey Affleck and Scott Caan.

449,ndlejester,Quirky goodness,8,12 July 2006,"Ocean's Eleven brings nothing but smiles to my face every time I see it. The aspect I enjoy most in this flick is the overall light atmosphere given to a very serious act (robbing a casino in Vegas). Clooney and Pitt make an awesome tag team of dry humor and brilliant masterminds of this movie. And the fact that Pitt is shoving something in his mouth almost every scene he's in just adds to his sarcastic character. Other than the two head honchos, the rest of the eleven do their job and do it well. Terry Benedict was played a bit dry for my tastes, but it was consistent throughout the film so at least it's a dislike I can appreciate. On a side note, the soundtrack fits absolutely perfectly for this quirky joyride of a movie. I would give this movie somewhere near a 7.5 on the whole.",Ocean's Eleven

All affable criminals, and all excellent.  On the other hand, look at that travesty of a Batman movie, and see how George Clooney can really only play one role.Fortunately, this movie has him in that role once more.  And it's smashing.The amount of male eye candy in this movie is astounding.  At least three of the leads are extremely attractive.  Men are less fortunate.  Julia Roberts's upper lip is larger than her lower lip, which I've never noticed before; I can't help wondering about possible collagen implants.  She plays a snotty little wench in this movie, without much character development, but then this movie isn't about the characters.It's about The Heist, like all heist movies are.  The mechanics of this one put some other movies of this type to shame, but it's all very slick.  You never really worry about whether they'll pull it off, but seeing exactly how they do it is just as fun anyway.Don't miss this one; it's extremely well-crafted, like all Soderbergh's pictures are.",Ocean's Eleven

Geogrge Cloony and Brat Pit are astounding as the leaders of the group and every other character, my favorite being Don Cheadle's character ""Basher"", all have there own piece of the puzzle that brings this movie to life with all sorts of personalities and points of view.I highly recommend this movie if you've ever watched a robbery in a film and thought ""I wanna do that"", because that's what you'll be thinking after watching this.ENJOY!",Ocean's Eleven

Why on earth bother, and why did they not employ a real Londoner (cockneys very hard to find now) who would at least be credible? I know this film is over 10 years old and maybe things have improved, but just needed to vent my spleen. The movie is however very watchable and apart from the aforementioned, there are good performances by allNeed another few lines, so only reason watching now this is that we just came back from Las Vegas and spent a happy evening at the Bellagio.

However, common sense and past experience should have told me that there was no way sufficient time could be given to the development of the several characters without shifting emphasis from the plot; it seems that when a film bills this many well known, talented actors, the best for which one can hope is either a well developed plot or a well developed cast of characters--in this case we get neither.

I suppose upcoming info could be considered *gasp* spoilers so be warned. The best part of the movie was the genius of the characters and how they pulled it off.

But I really find it hard to contain my emotions after what I've just seen. It is particularly difficult given the magnitude of accolades this movie has received. The only question I would like to ask of all those who seem to be in raptures over this pathetic flick is: Are you out of your mind? if you have any, of course. You can call me opinionated or whatever but I don't - just do not remember the last time I was so truly and sincerely bored while watching what is supposed to be a blockbuster of sorts!!!! Boredom, boredom, nothing more but boredom. It so amazingly slow-paced, developments are so uniquely incoherent, and most importantly - you just DO NOT BELIEVE for a split second that anything like this - I mean the plot - is feasible, possible, doable, achievable - add your own synonym. The viewer is obviously taken for a complete, unadulterated fool to give even a particle of credence to this pileup of superbly sophisticated moves coming from an uncatchable and inhumanely ""intelligent"" bunch of pathetic morons. The makers of this movie must have thought that the ""divine"" privilege of seeing Pitt, Cloney, Roberts, Garcia, etc - all in one flick is enough to justify the absolute boredom and unbelievability it conveys. By and large - it is a very poor job which has unfairly earned its high grades - through the presence of the above hotshots - nothing more nothing less. For those of you who would like to enjoy themselves throughout a comical heist movie I would heartily recommend a polish flick: Vabank (1981)(among many others of course). You can trust me - for I'm a Russian and for a Russian to say something good about whatever polish - believe me - it must be reallllll good. And it is indeed. So have a good time watching!

I rate the film highly because of its great dialogue, performances, directing and photography but the fact that absolutely nothing hinders them,drags it down a little in my estimation. There is no point where you are on the edge of your seat going ""oh god how are they going to get out of this little fix"", because no little fixes are presented whatsoever (except for the bit where the Chinese guy gets stuck in the door which he gets out of because they forgot to put batteries in the controller.

It's played out perfectly and it's everything you'd want in a heist movie.The movie moves at a fast pace, keeping you constantly at the edge of your seat as you watch Danny and the crew steal from three casinos belonging to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) for the prize of over $150 million. There's tons of twists, surprising you as the heist is carried out and nothing is as you'd expect it to be. Overall, it is an awesome movie.The Vegas setting is vibrant and cool, and it is filmed in a way to make you feel like you're in the heist with the actors. The casting is great. George Clooney was perfect for the role of Danny Ocean and plays the mastermind in a beautifully confident manner. Brad Pitt is sexy as always and super cool as Rusty Ryan in the flick. Matt Damon is the sneaky pickpocket Linus Caldwell, mixing the perfect amount of innocence to the world of high-stakes theft yet with a maturity as well. Julia Roberts is stunning as always as Tess Ocean and Andy Garcia makes the perfect villain in his role of the billionaire casino owner Terry Benedict. Bernie Mac is extremely charismatic as Frank Catton (the inside man), Carl Reiner is the old timer-Saul Bloom, and Don Cheadle is hilarious as Basher, the explosives genius. Other stars, including Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as wheelmen Virgil and Turk Malloy, Eddie Jemison as Livingston Dell the computer genius, and Shaobo Qin as greaseman Yen are wonderful in their roles. And last but most certainly not least, Elliot Gould as Reuben Tishkoff, the man funding the heist and the lovely, charismatic casino owner is perfect. Gould steals every single scene he's in. So as you can tell, this movie is a must see and a perfect ten. This is one you don't want to miss.PS- The sequels, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen, are amazing as well. I highly recommend you see all three.",Ocean's Eleven

Tis is really one of my top ten favorites movies of all times! When i first saw this movie in a shop i didn't think it would be that great.

In other words, if you are looking for fresh air from a movie, this is not your ticket.If you are looking for some nice, sleek entertainment boxed in the now typical two hour formula, then Ocean's 11 might be for you.  Clooney is, well, the same Clooney as he always is, but does a nice job with it.  He and Brad Pitt do a decent job of playing ""The Buddies Setting Up The Heist"" routine and the other cast members range from good to adequate.  It's just a story, that's all it is.  It is not a classic, but it is something that you can sit a watch and not feel like you wasted your time at the end - As long as you do not go in looking for trend setter.If you are really hankering for an ensemble cast crime drama, try any of THE GODFATHER('s), BEAT THE DEVIL, TOUCH OF EVIL, THE USUAL SUSPECTS.7/10 - Just entertainment.",Ocean's Eleven

He's clearly ""out"" as Danny Ocean would have said last night.  This movie was awesome....it hit on all points.  I have been waiting to see this movie since I first saw the cast listing last year.  It didn't fail to live up to everything I expected.  Clooney and Pitt were perfect together and Andy Garcia was good enough as a villian to get people hating him (or at least intensly disliking him).  The rest of the cast was dead-on as well and quite funny.  The other thing, and probably my favorite thing, was that no one in the cast got short changed.  Everyone got their bit of screen time and their ""moment to shine"" so to speak.  The other cool thing was that all the ""major players"" in the movie got to interact with each other together on screen. Gracia-Clooney, Damon-Pitt, Clooney-Roberts.  It seemed like everyone was on the same page and that they all actually seemed like they wanted to be there.Other then that, the plot was silly and wack but creative and funny.  The players were so smooth in pulling of this heist and the twists and turns keeps you guessing the entire time.  Just for the record, this crime would never happen in a million years in real life, but this is not real life. So, if you are looking for an escape, something to totally relax to....Ocean's Eleven is that movie!!!  If nothing else, watch it for the cast alone.

Soderbergh as usual is absolutely amazing in his direction of the actors and his camera work and editing.  The A-list cast proves how good of a director he is here in a fun movie that never takes itself too seriously.  The dialog is quick and witty and George Clooney and Brad Pitt prove yet again (but for the first time together) that they are the two coolest men on the planet.  The story here is not the best, but it is a heist movie and a remake of a movie that had it not been for the rat pack's present would have been delegated to B-movie status.  This movie is a huge improvement upon the original, and all of the principal actors in this piece (that would be 13 if you're counting) have their moment to shine.

The movie relys heavily on using a plot twist.  This creates fresh perspective for such a film style but it has traditionally been hard to raise such a film style away from the 'predictable plot twist' created by its wide spread use.

Well, at the end of it, I must say it's quite entertaining and certainly exceeded my expectations by quite a lot. Never mind that Julia Roberts isn't used that much in the movie and her role is kind of replaceable. The performances from Clooney, Pitt and Garcia are well worth the price of the ticket. Added to that is the exciting/funny/smart heist that the 11 of them executed in the movie.Go watch it if you haven't! Though I must say once is enough...",Ocean's Eleven

The scenes with him and his brother fighting are really funny, and the ""balloon boy"" thing was cool. Sorry if I'm throwing you off track if you haven't seen the movie. Well any ways, it's about a group of guys who elaborately plan on robbing three casinos, all owned by the same guy. You see, they have to get past the state of the art security system.

I've never been a huge Julia Roberts fan, but she plays the part well and the rest of the cast is perfect. The plot is great, the casting is great, and the music is great.

Gone in 60 Seconds was awesome, The Score was pretty cool, and Ocean's Eleven is no exception.People might comment on how  many of the characters don't distinguish themselves from one and other, but really, this isn't completely true, and with such a great ensemble cast, I think it's possible to look past that minor flaw.The story's fantastic, it doesn't drag for one single moment during the 112 minute running time, it's got some really great dialogue, it's capped off with a really clever ending...and it wreaks of style and class from beginning to end.To be honest, I can't find much wrong with this flick at all.

One of the first scenes with a bunch of young adults playing poker with the veteran con men is quite funny to watch.  ""Look at these boys... all red!"" one of the young kids says as he puts down an eclectic poker hand of hearts and diamonds.  Brad Pitt's character is the veteran teaching them and describes it as one of the longest hours of his life.

The music harks backs to the old days of 'caper' movies, but with a modern touch.  It's a lot of fun, yet also has some edge-of-the-seat moments.  Just one thing jarred - the dreadful 'mockney' from Don Cheadle (Basher).  It wasn't just the accent, it was the dialogue.  If they want a Cockney, we have plenty over here.  They could even give advise on making the rhyming slang sound natural.  9/10",Ocean's Eleven
483,EmpressR,Trouble staying awake,5,28 January 2002,"Having been listening to all the good reviews I was so looking forward to seeing this film, with its cast of handsome men and all, but was quite disappointed.  I have not seen the original so I guess I went in expecting a much better story -- expectations set by the more recent and much better heist movies like The Score.I was also expecting it to be funny.  It wasn't.  There may have been a couple of amusing lines but none that I can remember. And it took forever to gather up those 11 characters -- and none of those meetings were in any way memorable.Julia Roberts looked awful (almost as bad as she looked when she played Tinkerbell in Hook) and there was NO chemistry between her and Clooney, or between her and Garcia for that matter.  As for the handsome men -- Clooney was so much more interesting as the erudite convict in O Brother, and Pitt has had more appeal in just about every other movie I can think of that he's played in.  Also, in most movies of this ilk, one is supposed to find oneself rooting for the lovable crooks because they are doing it to someone really evil or they are at least morally superior.  But I didn't find Terry Benedict (Garcia)to be that bad of a guy -- he was just an aggressive businessman minding his business, or these guys to be that lovable.  So, there was no big satisfaction in seeing him getting ripped off big time.It wasn't awful, but was a lot less satisfying than I expected, and I did have trouble staying awake.  5/10",Ocean's Eleven

Instead of taking a great film and remaking it into a mediocre update, which has been done hundreds of times, he takes a mediocre film and makes it easily one of the most entertaining films in quite a few years. Take a bunch of really exceptional actors (George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, etc.) and put them together and let them enjoy making a really fun movie with Ted Griffin's sparkling dialogue, Soderbergh's expert direction, and not to forget David Holmes' terrific score and you've got a great movie.

Being a huge Sinatra fan, I am probably one of the few people who really enjoyed the original, and not simply for camp.And to be blunt... I just can't stand Julia Roberts.  In my humble opinion she is just about as overrated as an actor can be.But, this film was just plain great.  Entertaining all around... funny, but not overly so... this film seemed very tight to me in it's weaving the story in a way that gives the big ensemble cast their own chances to develop their characters on screen without hurting the plot advancement.  There are a bunch of ""techno-heist"" films out now... and I'll put Ocean's against any of them.  While not entirely unpredictable, I was having such a good time throughout the whole film that I just didn't care.  Terrific use of music to propel you through the story and provide a sense of pacing... just one of the many things I noticed about the movie.My girlfriend even liked it, which brings the number of films we agree upon to 4... (should I be surprised that 3 of these films star Brad Pitt, I wonder?)As for Julia... mercifully her role limited her to be the eye candy and not the Erin Brokovich, which I think she does much more convincingly.I know it will never reap any real critical recognition, but for sure it has a spot on my dvd rack where it will see repeated use.In my humble opinion.... probably the best remake ever.  I really love well crafted movies... it takes so much work to make a feature length film, and to see one that is so well made all around is such a breath of fresh air.",Ocean's Eleven

The appearance of these suave and debonair guys just makes you want to knock over a casino. Danny Ocean, Rusty, Linus, and the gang all have that certain panache. I can't help but feel the energy in this movie, the excitement and the humor.The main cast is great to begin with: everyone from Andy Garcia (who gives one of the best frowns in movies) to Matt Damon (who can still pull off wide-eyed innocence while stealing from a California science lab). But the minor cast members also do a great job. Elliot Gould gives the sarcastic Reuben a life of his own with his dealings with young Linus and his conversations with Danny and Rusty. Don Cheadle brings the Aussie to the indomitable Basher. And Bernie Mac makes racist misunderstandings a joy to see.Ocean's Eleven not only captures you with a great American story, but it also creates subtle nuances for you to watch and rewatch in order to really appreciate the intricacies of the plot. And cameos from other notable stars help to make the film a basket of Easter Eggs. From Topher Grace's poker game with the stars to Wayne Newton sitting at the ringside of the ""big fight,"" the film is magic.

It's a good all round entertainment film, with interest, excitement and plot. Stars abound, they all do their bit and make the whole experience more enjoyable.*** Spoilers ***I have only two criticisms. The little love story within takes us away from the rest of the story. Perhaps it adds a touch of ""Got ya!"" to the bad guy, but is he a bad guy? Not really. A businessman with a focused personality perhaps.The other one is that burning question...How do they get the money out of Vegas? This isn't explored, but left to the imagination. I have a feeling they script writers couldn't think up a way of doing it without falling over their highly technological script. More than once the issue is raised about being stuck in the middle of the desert, and no solution is forthcoming. Perhaps Ocean's Eleven II is yet to come out with ""Did Danny's followers at the end of the film do anything?"" or ""Here's how they got the cash out of Vegas"".
All that said, it's one of the first films I've watched in a long time which had very little violence, swearing, nudity, sex or the abuse of drugs or alcohol. Not that I care one way another if the film is good, but it's extremely refreshing to think that Hollywood can produce a hit with the above qualities.Even Julia Roberts doesn't quite get a chance to cry!All in all a great film.

However, while I still much prefer the ending in the original Ocean's 11, and the Nelson Riddle soundtrack is a classic, I have to admit that this remake is a wonderful bit of entertainment. It has an AMAZING cast (Reiner and Gould are outstanding), and is also clever and witty, while strutting a bit of the swaggering cool of the Rat Pack.Steven Soderbergh really hits a home run with his direction, and the cast really seems to be having a good time.

497,hall1138,One of the most Entertaining films ever!,8,26 July 2004,"Ocean's Eleven is a very easy-going and purely fun movie to watch. The film is loaded with celebrities such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon. Ocean's Eleven is very ""loosely"" based on the original Ocean's Eleven starring Frank Sinatra. Steven Soderbergh did a fabulous job directing this movie and having all the characters to connect to Danny Oceans group of 11. The plan is to steal 160$ million dollars from three Las Vegas Casino's. Sounds wacky? The planning time took up most of the movie, and you almost believe that it could be done after you see this. Andy Garcia did a fabulous job playing Terry Benedict, the owner of the Casino's where Ocean (Clooney) plans to rob. Brad Pitt plays and interesting role as Danny Ocean's sidekick. The plot flows quickly and some parts leave you laughing on the floor. Each one of the eleven characters had its own story behind them and it is seen when Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and Danny Ocean (Clooney) first go to recruit them to plan this heist. I have to say Julia Roberts didn't have a flexible character but nonetheless her presence in this film as Tess, Danny Ocean's ex-wife, is apparent. Ocean's 12 is due out in December with the same old cast and it promises to be a hit. This movie is one of my favorites because the premise is great and the actors are great.**** out of *****",Ocean's Eleven
498,bnymph,caper flick with great characters,9,22 December 2006,"I don't _think_ this contains a spoiler, but am playing it safe.An engrossing, funny caper movie. I saw it in theaters when it came out, and liked it just as much seeing it on cable tonight. The casting is very good, across the board, and it's fairly clear that everyone involved is having a lot of fun (Carl Reiner and Don Cheadle especially). I find that something essential to a caper, or gambit, movie, is that violence is restrained, and con artistry is involved. Also essential is an ensemble cast that works well together. This remake succeeds on both counts. One thing that I find interesting is that many people who comment on this film don't seem to be able to count: Ocean's 11 is Ocean plus the 11 others in his platoon, not 10. Possible spoiler: if you do the math, the booty divided by 11 does not equal the proposed cut. It equals the booty divided by (Ocean+11) ie. 12. Soderbergh plays a LOT of games with the viewer, and you practically have to see it a second time to figure it out -- his tribute to Kubrick. Every member of Ocean's platoon is crucial to the gambit, but they flicker in and out of visibility -- another aspect of great gambit flicks. Some of the 11 do a lot, and others do only small but critical things. Working this out is a big part of the fun of the movie. Trivia: the first Ocean's Eleven was an inspiration for a great reggae classic.",Ocean's Eleven

And that's not very often, that the remake is actually better than the old one. I remember when i was about to see the premiere, i was thinking to myself: ""Perhaps i can still get a refund"", cause I had very little faith in the movie.

But I have a feeling you'll enjoy it.The plot, admittedly, is pretty predictable, at least until the actual heist attempt starts.  There is some interesting sleight of hand here that forces you to do a mental rewind, not unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" and its surprise ending (at least for those who didn't wrack their brains for half the film to figure it out early).  The plan of the heist itself is pretty far-fetched, which does help to heighten your anticipation as to whether they can actually pull it off.  Entertaining?  Yes.  It's still the weakest part of the film, but it's still fairly good.Not that the plot matters, really.  The assemblage of actors here more than makes up for it.  There is nothing flashy about the performances here -- they're simply played well, very straight-faced, very every-manish (or dare I say, ""Bruce-Willis-esque"").  The gang as a whole is an interesting and entertaining mix, and it is these caricatures here that make this film enjoyable.This film is not really a heist film, per se -- it's not about being suspenseful, but rather, much like the Rat Pack it hails from, it's about being smooth and suave.  This cast does so in near-perfect fashion.  There is a certain timing and tone in every bit of dialogue, and he who takes the time to analyze it sees just how well done this film really is.Further reinforcing that this is not a heist film, it ends not with guns blazing but with...well, I'll let you see that for yourself.  I've mentioned already that there is a lot of trickery involved with the heist, much of it hidden from the viewer as well until the end.  I laughed out loud in the theater when the final trick was revealed, and then my rating of this film went up a couple points.Those seeking Academy Award material may opt to wait for the DVD.

Again the acting was all great; the casting I definitely couldn't complain about.

The plot is not unique. Only the charm and class are.

Forget all that Mission Impossible split second precision. Forget the high tech hullaballo of the James Bond films. This film nods graciously in those directions ...and takes on a direction entirely of its own. I'd love to say the pace is ""gentlemanly"" ...but that may point the way of ...yuk ...Evelyn Waugh novels and scones with clotted cream. George Clooney is slick ..yet not super slick. The odd wart manages to come up above the surface. Brad Pitt finally manages to look vaguely his 37 years ...which may not be such a bad thing. Clearly, casino lighting is to be avoided after 35. The music is brilliant. Predominantly kitsch lounge music. Good enough for me to go out and buy the CD. The inspiration is clearly the brat pack ...plenty of Frank, Sammy and Dino ..and ..err whoever else was there at the time. But slickly packaged. The Low Tech era is here . Maybe MI3 can learn a few lessons here.",Ocean's Eleven

I thought that because they were all big stars their egos would get carried away and that would transfer into the movie. The only problem that I have is that there were not as many special features on the dvd. That dissapointed me becuase I am always looking for deleted scences and other things. Otherwise this film was great. I thought it was fascinating how they robbed the casino and how it was all planned out.,Ocean's Eleven

In fact, i would nearly go as far as to say that its Clooney's best role of his entire career. The look of the movie is fantastic and the great soundtrack also adds a great dimension.

Filmed on location, any Vegas fan will fall in love with the ""action"" that's happening off the blackjack and craps tables. Danny Ocean (Clooney) is a criminal (and a liar, ha ha) who's just been released from jail. He dreams up a convoluted scheme to take down 3 of Vegas' largest casinos, all, incidentally, owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). Danny needs money to fund the operation and a crew. Danny goes to Reuben Tishkoff, who'd love to see Terry go down. Next, Danny brings together the eclectic crew of criminals, from actors to bomb makers to a tiny Chinese gymnast. The plot is fairly solid with a traditional twist at the end reminiscent of many suspense murders / robberies but it's the chemistry of the cast that really makes the film sparkle.The subplot is Danny's romance of Tess, his ex, who is now with Terry.Will Danny's pursuit of Tess endanger the pursuit of cold hard cash?",Ocean's Eleven

""'Suicidal?', 'Only in the mornings.'""; ""Don't turn up in Newport Beach trying to by a 100,000 dollar car."" And one other time, but I can't remember when that was.  The Newport Beach line is classic, a sly reference to the kidnapping a few years ago of the former Bellagio owner's daughter, wherein they paid the ransom, but the kidnappers got caught in So. Cal., trying to buy a Ferrari for cash.  This line flew way over the heads of the audience in the showing I saw.  And damn we were in Reno, Nevada where the kidnapping made pretty big news.  But then the audience was laughing and having a good ole time thoughout the rest of this movie.  Both these facts lead me to believe that the audience was lobotomized.It's amazing in a movie with so many actors having tremendous on-screen chemistry, that none of it shows here.  The chemistry of this movie is nil, assign a number from 1-10 to whichever actor in this film, epitomizes charisma and chemistry for you, then divide that number by 11.  That should give you an idea of how bland this film and it's acting performances. If you like this movie, it's my guess that you are incapable of long division and something as complex as dividing by eleven.

523,nathaniel-04908,Decent heist film with an excellent cast.,8,11 August 2020,"A remake of 1960's Ocean's 11, Ocean's Eleven is a 2001 heist film directed by Steven Soderbergh. It follows Danny Ocean (George Clooney) as he assembles a crew of 10 others likeminded crooks and hatches a plan to steal upwards of 150 million dollars from three Las Vegas casinos.
Ocean's Eleven is a film that works almost exclusively due to its excellent cast. It is filled with Hollywood A-listers, and it pays off. With a cast boasting a combined four Academy Award wins for acting and 13 nominations, the film is always fun to watch. For as great of an ensemble as the movie presents, the characters are unfortunately weak, nonetheless. The cast makes it a fun time, but any real emotional impact is lost by a lack of any justification other than greed for the heist. As the film reaches its end, I find myself wondering if I really want our crew to succeed, and the film's script does nothing to support or expand on such moral questions in any way. Ultimately this leaves us with a group of characters that are just barely likeable, but only due to the charisma of the talented cast, not the quality of the script.
Setting aside the questionable morality of the characters, Ocean's Eleven is still endlessly entertaining. It is paced quite well, and the setup/planning portion of the film is interesting enough that it never feels like it is dragging on as you wait for the heist to begin. As for the heist itself, the planning and execution are brilliant, and although it does often feel too convoluted to be believable, there are too many real examples of heists done in the same vein as this one for me to criticize the believability too much.
There is a lot to like in Ocean's Eleven, and if you're looking for a good time you can't go wrong. The whole movie comes together quite nicely, and you'll certainly never be bored. That having been said, the story that it tells is quite a shallow one, and never resonates in any deeper way. If all you're looking for is a little bit of escapism, you can't go wrong with Ocean's Eleven",Ocean's Eleven
524,Ian-135,Lived up to the hype,10,22 February 2002,"I had been waiting 7 months to see Oceans 11 ever since it was promoted in Total Film and Empire. My anticipation grew. During this period I saw the masterpiece Fellowship of The Ring, and that the best cinema movie I had seen all year.Now there are three ways a hyped movie can go. It can be crap like What Lies Beneath, it can be great but not live up to your expectations like Star Wars Episode 1, or it can succeed your expectations and be a superb and shockingly cool movie like Oceans 11.I'm sure people are sick of the A-List Cast by now. I have to say that every single performance in the movie is crafted to perfection and even Don Cheadle manages to use his somewhat dodgy cockney accent well by doing it for laughs.Brad Pitt is Cool, Clooney is Charismatic, Julia Roberts is radiant, Andy Garcia is evil, Matt Damon is great and Affleck/Caan are great comic relief.I give this 10 out of 10 and it's worth seeing for the superb cinematography by Steven Soderbergh",Ocean's Eleven

Earlier in the week I saw a trailer for Ocean's Eleven:  my first impression was, ""..just another stealing from the bad rich guy story"" in lusty ole Vegas. But hey, how could I resist seeing Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Elliot Gould all in the same show without bombs ripping apart boats and WWII fighter planes screaming about? So I laid my five bucks down, grabbed a couple of dogs, a pop, and followed a few like minded souls into the place where dreams are made; ""Theatre number two, all the way down, first theatre on your left,"" said my sharply dressed usher. As I awkwardly squeezed the ticket stubb between my fingers trying not to drop my lunch I strolled on in, stadium seating baby! Great, I found a center seat and the movie began, and two hours later the movie ended. I should have trusted my basic instinct,""... big names, flashy trailer with hip music, the obligatory explosions,..Vegas...hmmmm, somebody needs to pay off a new house or something."" The movie was fun, though predictable. Can anyone say, ""The Mexican?"" Kind of a hybrid action packed chick flick.  The acting, excellent as usual. Would I see this movie again?

530,abrarabeer82,One of the best and smoothest heist movies of all time,9,30 November 2016,"If you are a fan of heist movies then you have seen or at least heard of this movie. Cause there is literally nothing less then extraordinary in this movie. Steven Soderbergh who has given us a few very interesting titles along the years. It seems that he does not really have one big category. He just works well with any good script. This is no different.Ocean's Eleven came into the spotlight with their cast. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy García, Carl Reiner, Matt Damon and the list goes on. It seems that with that list of huge stars you just get a lot of conflict. But if there was any little amount of conflict it didn't effect the movie at all.Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) basically played one single man as they were so effortlessly finishing each others sentences. The communication between the characters was so funny, but sarcastic. Like you will not belly laugh but you will laugh at the situation they are in. Most of all you feel a connection to the characters. Every problems makes you tensed as if they were your own.Matt Damon played the young new comer Linus Caldwell, who is the son of a famous thief and con man. He is trying to make a name for himself and joined this group in their near impossible heist. Matt Damon played this role with great awkwardness. His interactions with Danny and Rusty added a lot more awkward fun into it. I mean I can write about every single character separately. But that is not what you want. You just want to get a briefing of the movie and if you have read this far then you don't need any more review then this. Just watch the movie and enjoy.",Ocean's Eleven
531,rclements3-2,Pretty boring,8,9 August 2005,"Add me to the list of people who think that Hollywood is running out of original ideas. This film tries too hard to be cool. Somehow, you get the impression that the big stars of this movie (Clooney, Pitt, Roberts, etc.) are just laughing at all of us, saying ""Don't you wish you were beautiful like us and could appear in movies and make lots of money like we do?"" I'll admit I've never been a fan of George Clooney. In this movie and others, he apparently wants to be the next Steve McQueen (who turned down Sinatra back in 1960 when when asked to appear in the original movie). The only problem is, Clooney's not McQueen. McQueen didn't have to act cool, he was cool. As was the real Rat Pack.Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are somewhat better. Both at least show some talent, although this film gives them little opportunity to use it.The rest of the cast is decent, but again, they haven't got much to work with. The best work is turned in by old pros Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould. Andy Garcia is convincing in his role as well.Probably the best thing about this film was the soundtrack - there was some decent music in several sections throughout.I haven't bothered to see ""Ocean's Twelve"", as the real ""heist"" of these films is being played on the moviegoers who've paid to see them.",Ocean's Eleven

There are things in this film that don't occur in low budget films with a crap cast, direction and writers.First of all an EMP (""The Pinch"") would not just wipe the city out of power it would cut out pretty much every different electronical device. I mean cellphones, computers slot machines. etc. etc. The only way it could be saved is if it was switched off! Most importantly the robbery couldn't be viewed from inside Benedicts office! How do the flyer's end up in the vault? I mean the little Chinese guy can't have snuck them in in his pants could he? I admit that I'm not the only person to have noticed this because on the DVD Steven Soderbergh states that he has no idea how they got there.Furthermore, the casino manager is supposed to be with Sol taking his briefcase into the vault and escorting Frank out of the building at the same time!

Edward Norton, Robert Deniro and Marlon Brando teamed up for The Score . Even that Kevin Costner piece of crap 3000 Miles to Graceland involved a casino heist. Steven Soderburgh also threw his hat into the heist genre ring with a little movie called Oceans 11.Oceans 11 is a 'remake' the 1960 'classic'. I put remake in quotes because the movies are quite different and I put classic in quotes because the original was drek. George Clooney had they easy job of replacing Frank Sinatra as Daniel Ocean, the brains behind the scene. Frank Sinatra was in one good movie (Manchurian Candidate) that I have seen and he is the reason I find it hard to watch that movie again. He was never a good actor and I am not sure he was even that good of a singer. That being said, George Clooney did a great job taking over his gig. As for the movie, I found it interesting.

The interaction between Clooney and Pitt was great, they really feed off each other well.The movie has a lot of funny moments in it and the dialogue was well written. Technically speaking the film isn't anything special, there isn't anything new with how it was shot or lit, but that's ok because this type of film doesn't require fancy shots or the like.This film is good braindead entertainment, doesn't really require you to think too much while watching it but at the same time it doesn't spoon feed anything to you and insult your intelligence.

The huge ensemble cast, the great cinematography and editing, wonderful sound...nothing saves this film. I haven't seen the original film, so someone else will have to comment on its significance to this movie.If you've seen one heist film, you've seen everything that this film will try to offer. These are stock characters going through a stock exercise in crime. Pitt and Clooney try to be charming, but they seem to be cannibalizing their own careers, dredging up pale imitations of characters they played in previous films (Out of Sight, for Clooney). Even some of the music, instrumentals by David Holmes, is taken from older albums. There are no surprises in this movie and very little chemistry between the characters. The central conceit is that you are supposed to want these guys to pull off the crime, but with a veritable sea of generic criminals, there really isn't a way to get the audience to focus enough to care about them. Clooney and Julia Roberts have almost zero chemistry (although the film's dialogue improves 90% when the two of them interact).The attempts at humor in Ocean's Eleven are embarrassingly flaccid; particularly when you take into account that Soderbergh and Clooney worked together in Out of Sight, a film that surpasses Ocean's Eleven on every possible front, but particularly in its comedic delivery and pacing.There's no doubt in my mind that Ocean's Eleven will be successful. Others in the screening were touching their throats and praising the film shamelessly. The ensemble cast and the dearth of adult movies will position Ocean's Eleven favorably. But discriminating movie-goers will want to avoid this dull and unamusing exercise in genre.",Ocean's Eleven

Andy Garcia gives a chillingly believable nice/nasty portrayal of the coldly professional gaming boss. George Clooney and Brad Pitt spark off each other wonderfully to show two old mates who are out to work a spectacular, intelligent and meticulously planned robbery.Recruitment of the team is amusingly handled and you soon grow to love this diverse parcel of rogues. Refreshingly, the concentration of so much testosterone didn't unleash the usual torrent of swearing, which helped make it such a hit with my young teenagers, for me.Even with Don Cheadle's tongue-in-cheek cockney as Basher, this was a hugely enjoyable, rollocking ride of criminal precision and a study in predicted behaviour of the victim.Julia Roberts was nicely understated in what turns out to be a pivotal character in the story. But I just couldn't quite believe the final choice she made.This is a good movie. Go see it.

At this point I still don't know who he is or what he's doing, and I don't care. After apparently meeting an old friend who's dealing there, he makes a late night call to his parole officer. That thread goes nowhere. Next he's in Hollywood for some unknown reason. At this point I started counting the twinkly lights in the ceiling.The ""banter"" some critics have swooned over is trite at best.

George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon made it easy for me to keep my eyes on the screen (I would love any movie that had those three in it, no matter what the plot was).  One thing I didn't notice until the second time I watched it was that Brad Pitt is always eating something in every scene!  Casey Affleck and Scott Caan were hilarious in their roles as the brothers from Utah - they reminded me of my brothers.  I was also impressed by both Elliott Gould's and Carl Reiner's performances in their roles.  It was a nice change to see Elliott Gould in a more intelligent role than the one he has on Friends.  Even though I hate to see Andy Garcia as a villain, I think he did an excellent job - his character was easy to hate.  I always enjoy Julia Roberts, however I was a bit disappointed by her awkward performance in this movie.  It seemed like she was just there to deliver lines - I don't think she really got into the role.  Another thing - someone needs to teach her to walk like a lady!

This movie's heist and suspense made it a gem of 2001.  The humor was at an appropriate level for this film and was done with skill and success.  The great acting by Cloony, Pitt, and Garcia is a thing to remember.  But this movie did have its flaws, the major one being Julia Roberts.  I give a lot of credit to Julia Roberts for ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Pretty Woman"", but she is a hit-and-miss actress, and she scored a big miss in ""Ocean's.""  Her presence in every scene was a unwanted one, not because the character was bad, but that she wasn't at her ""Erin"" best.  The relationship between George and Julia also added to the problem.  The one thing I could not see between them is the spark.  That is what makes a great onscreen relationship, i.e. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle"".  Cloony and Roberts do not belong together and this was not their mistake, but their director's.  I have given credit to Steven Soderbergh on his past two movies ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" for the great casting and the superb acting.  But his remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" lacked those tow elements in Roberts and her performance with Cloony.

I usually like Brad Pitt, but his performance, along with that of Matt Damon's, was less than noteworthy.  Julia Roberts was entirely inappropriate for the supposedly-dazzling ""ex-wife"" role, as she was most definitely not dazzling.  The whole technical aspects of robbing the casinos were interesting, but not enough to support the entire film as much of it was contrived and unplausible.

548,Jhereg,Effective timewaster,7,28 December 2001,"Oceans 11 is not a great movie.  It is good, the acting varies from very good to excellent.  The plot itself is very mundane.  Overall it was a waste of a superb cast.  Both Matt Damon and Carl Reiner were exceptional.  The weakest member was Julia Roberts, but she wasn't terrible, just OK (of course she didn't have a lot to work with).  Personally I'm amazed it's doing so well at the box office.  For what it is, it is not too bad.  It's been done better, but there are far worse movies out there.",Ocean's Eleven
549,taratingers,Does it live up to it`s expectation?,6,30 December 2001,"The hype for the re-make of the early 60`s film ""Oceans 11"" starring Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. had some ""hype"" for it but did it live up to it`s expectations?I think the movie was fair it had a slight amount of interest that you can enjoy it but it seemed that it was slightly just not there.I was an OK movie that you can enjoy and the 2 hours of the movie go bye very fast.Some of the rolls had either not enough of that character or too much.I enjoyed this movie but it just was not what the media said it would be.I muct say George Clooney,Matt Damon,Bernie Mac,Carl Reiner,and Don Cheadle give good performances,but Julia Roberts just did not click and there was too much of Andy Garica.This movie is something you can wait to come out on video.But as a suggestion I would say if you want a slightly more serious movie see ""The Score"" starring Robert De Niro,Edward Norton,Angela Bassett,and Marlon Brando,that movie has interest in it and a smart sassy cast that sizzles.But Ocean`s 11 is  an OK movie and you should wait to see it and see something a little more worth while.",Ocean's Eleven
550,juancestero,"Ocean's Eleven, Rating's Eleven",10,10 March 2002,"WOW. I just watched Ocean's 11 yesterday and I think it is one of the best movies of 2002. A wonderful cast, it's kind of obvious being it includes George Clooney (ER), Brad Pitt (Legends Of The Fall), Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) & Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman). Every cast member has a spark that unites them all. No character (even though the script obviously says otherwise) has a bigger role that the other. Ocean's... unites Hollywood's hottest star in one film. Though film could of been better written, works for any fan. Film's smartness will dazzle you at the end. Even though Julia's role is small it is smart and sexy. Clooney's role will leave you breathless, with his abbility to confuse you, even though according to script. Pitt's part is a secondary role but is played splendly. Damon's role is of a dumb thief, he still played it perfectly. Director's directing is better than any other Steven Sodebergh film. BOTTOM LINE: 11 (out of 10) for Ocean's 11",Ocean's Eleven
551,smitty-12,Great story marred by horrible sound track . . .,5,11 May 2002,"Ocean's 11 is the story of 11 con artists/thieves getting together to rip off a wealthy casino magnate in Las Vegas.  After we get to know everybody a theme of Robin Hood against the Sheriff of Nottingham comes to mind.  Then the heist--although their methods can be explained as impossible to pull off by any stretch of the imagination one doesn't care because we are lifted away to a place where rooting for the bad guy is mandatory--kind of like in the Sting only about a tenth as convincing or enjoyable.  Conversely, it's not fair to compare this film to the Sting because the Sting has a sound track that compliments the thoughts and actions of the characters, the era, scenes and locations.  In O-11, The entire look and feel of the movie is back ground to, or is over shadowed by, a loud thumping repetitive bass and drum track which evokes nothing to the imagination but perhaps annoying car or jeans TV commercials. Las Vegas overflows with a rainbow of diverse music--none of which resemble the sounds in the O-11.  Only twice, and very briefly, does the sound track support the locations, scenes and characters: the entrance of Sahl (played by Carl Reiner), and the very end of the movie.  Gen-X folks will most likely be the only folks who can relate to this sound track.  This movie, unlike the Sting, will never be a classic because of the irritating, emotionally devoid, dated, loud, frustratingly repetitive sound track (which one can not call music).  In addition, because the history or magnitude of the relationship between Roberts and Clooney is never apparent, we never really care about the Julia Robert character--it is unimportant to the movie and her performance is week and boring not to mention there is no chemistry at all between her and Clooney.  In fact, all the characters (with the exception of Reiner, Damon, and Garcia) seem to be acting or pretending and thus are not convincing.  On the bright side, the script is clever and humorous.  And there are some fun twists that surprise you.  If you enjoy repetitive, loud, bass and drums, you will like this movie. If you like a good mystery/adventure/heist movie--try watching with the captions on and the sound off--it's much better that way.    C+",Ocean's Eleven

The film was boring, and the story or the ""perfect crime"" has been done to death. At least with the original it was entertaining. The original Oceans 11 all had criminals and con artists, that depended on each other to pull off this heist. The new Oceans 11 was a simple cakewalk on how to rob the MGM Grand vault. In my opinion the previews were better than the movie, at least they left some mystery and intrigue about this group. However, the story that was told was boring, and it was no more than a bunch of actors developing their characters very poorly. I was especially surprised by Julia Roberts performance, her character was especially poorly developed. Her performance was shallow, and there was a lack of history and future with her character. The one big problem I have with this film is that the ending is very vague, they leave it wide open for a sequel, which really disturbs me, if the first one was so badly done.In closing I would like to let you all know that I would rather be nibbled to death by rabid ducks than watch this movie ever again.",Ocean's Eleven

You guessed it... a little more humor... introducing Bernie Mac, lol. I must admit though that it's not a second-time kind of movie.  You watch it the first time... you don't know how they're gonna actually get into the casino in the first place, you love the humor... it's great.

Good night of entertainment for your money especially when you live in an area where your choice is a movie or the pathetic Celtics and Bruins. Julia Roberts is a little ""long in the tooth"" for this type of role where she is suppose to knock your socks off but casting otherwise was great. Bonus coverage on DVD has every actor praising (until you throw up) the Director Soderburgh who must need chap stik on his kiester after all the arse smooching.

All fit their roles perfectly and did a wonderful job and seemed to have really got into their role, something I don't see very many actors do.I love how that this movie, it makes you root for the criminals.

566,katiecaswell,Ocean's Eleven Review,10,28 March 2018,"Steven Soderbergh's remake of 'Ocean's Eleven' is an action filled heist film about a criminal, Danny Ocean (George Clooney), who was just released from jail and close friend, Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), who gather nine other men and plan to rob 150 million dollars from three different Las Vegas casinos. It is a fast-paced, clever film that is so entertaining, it has you rooting for the thieves. It is full of a great cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and many more. There are a lot of key characters but each ones important qualities to the job allow them all to come together nicely. It was shot very well with many of the scenes in low lit, dark rooms to show the privacy among the group and the conversations of the heist. In contrast, the casino is full of bright neon lights and gold decor to show it's extravagance and wealth. There is a constant theme of conflict and suspense that can be seen from small mistakes made throughout the heist, the relationship between Danny and Terry (casino owner), and Danny trying to win back his ex-wife. Overall, It is a good mix of comedy and suspense that always has you watching till the end.",Ocean's Eleven

It's a long, slow set-up, but worth the wait.Not much chemistry, nor continuity in the beginning, with some rather odd camera work on the big-name stars: In one long scene, Julia Robert's upper lip grows as large as the screen, while another shot highlights an unflattering crease beneath Brad Pitt's eye, and again, a prolonged shot of George Clooney's very flat face in profile. I have no idea what was trying to be expressed by this, but it was all very curious. It reminded me of Brad Pitt wearing brown contact lenses in the 12 Monkeys so he wouldn't, what? -- look so durn cute.A fun ride -- worth the wait.",Ocean's Eleven

It was a delightful surprise! The perfect blend of tongue-in-cheek humor, awesome (and easy to look at) actors, and slight plot twists make for a really fun movie. No, it won't win Oscars. Yes, it was predictable at times. But Steven Soderbergh wanted to create a fun movie and create it he did. Is there anything this man can't do? All I can say is, make us another one!

570,vidman12,The epitome of a cool heist flick,10,8 December 2001,"From the start, this film boasts the big names that put it together (Soderbergh, Clooney, Pitt, Damon, ect.) and the audience is left praying that these folks will not dissapoint them.  When the film has ended, the audience is left aghast at what a cool film they had all just seen.  This film oozes cool.  It has cool bursting out of the seems.  The performers are great and the direction is amazing.The story follows Clooney's character, just out of jail, recruiting 11 men to pull off the biggest heist ever.  This may sound formulaic, but Soderbergh knows what he's doing and builds the film up perfectly.  The audience is left waiting and anticipating the climactic heist sequence, and when it begins, the excitement is electrifying. The supporting cast is fantastic, including Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Carl Reiner.  Everyone know's his or her part and takes it to it's extent.  The laugh's are packed into this film as well.  The script is perfect and it knows how to space the comedy.

571,afuller,Ocean's 11 have forgotten more about being cool...,10,11 December 2001,"...than I or 99% of the population will ever know. Steven Soderbergh's remake of the Ratpack's prior outing is a weightless exercise in cool for the new millennium. The entire cast are nearly flawless contributors to this effort, but Clooney, Pitt, Damon, and Reiner really outdo themselves. Wardrobes, locations, and the soundtrack all complement the actors and plot superbly. In the future I can only hope to dress half as well as Pitt and Clooney do in this film. The soundtrack is an outstandingly modern and refreshing blend of jazz and electronica that is used to great effect throughout the film's varied scenes.I also admired the dialog and its delivery throughout the film. November's 'Heist' delivered excellent dialog, but at many points the delivery was forced and it became hard to believe so many people delivering so many one-liners one after the other. In 'Ocean's 11' the humor in the dialog is superbly employed to break the tension developed in certain scenes. I would imagine a great deal of this difference is the product of Mamet and Soderbergh's differing styles of writing and directing.Those reading this may believe I am excessively exuberant about this film and they would be correct in that belief. I cannot recall a single film that put such a huge smile on my face for nearly two hours.I do have one nitpick with the film, but it is extremely minor and probably due to my slight fatigue as I viewed the film. As others have mentioned the film can be a bit slow in spots. Modern audiences may have this feeling after being exposed to years of crowd-pleasing explosions and effects wizardry. When seeing this film it is important to remember Ocean's is a HEIST film rather than an ACTION film. In the end, I found it very satisfying to watch the well-planned and executed heist develop with a minimum of violence and no deaths!Others may gripe regarding the 'Pinch' device, but militaries around the world have been researching these units since the '80s and are working to bring them into active service as I write. However, the packaging of the device in the movie was certainly more fanciful than the olive drab that would be used by a defense arm.In summary, Clooney and Co. explode the mystique of the Ratpack, redefine 'cool' for the third millennium, and manage to put a huge smile on my face while doing so. Easily 11/10",Ocean's Eleven
572,auntie_rev,This movie is fun!,7,8 December 2001,"While it's true that this film is not likely to be nominated for an Oscar, who cares. Not only is the premise--knocking off three Las Vegas casinos--a great escapist story line; but more importantly, the story telling is interesting. The pace does slow a bit after all the characters are introduced, but it picks up again rather quickly, and the second half of the movie--planning and executing the heist--is just plain fun. Julia Roberts fans are likely to be disappointed--first, because there wasn't more of her, and second, because she had only one good line in the whole film. On the other hand, ""mature"" movie-goers will probably get a kick seeing some faces they haven't seen for awhile (Elliott Gould and Carl Reiner).

There is Danny played by Clooney who after leaving jail goes to find right hand man, Rusty (Pitt) with a master plan. Rusty has perhaps the funniest lines of the film. Matt Damon plays the pickpocket. Elliot Gould the financier; Carl Reiner the veteran; Don Cheadle the man who does the explosives; Julia Roberts is the hidden agenda and then there is the rest of the supporting cast that makes this movie a true success.

The cast is superlative, plain and simple. This movie is meant to be an entertaining, escapist meringue and it delivers.
This movie expects you to pay attention and I respect that. The dialog can move at a quick and brisk pace, much like ""The West Wing"" and ""SportsNight"", which is something I admire. Too many movies these days fall into two categories; those which move at such a slow pace as to make sure even the dullest person can follow along, or those movies that move so fast you can leave for five minutes and not miss anything (ex. Mission Impossible 2).
While watching this movie you come to realize two things: one, the actors had fun doing this movie (and you can see it) and, two, you have fun watching this movie. As heist films go, it is probably one of the best that I've seen.

He enlists the help of fellow con man Rusty (excellently played by Pitt) and together they recruit a team of the most flamboyant and down right weird criminals to pull off the job.What sets Ocean's Eleven apart from other 'heist' movies is a well written script, full of little in-jokes and 'off the cuff' remarks that the cast get spot on.

I love the suspense seeing the plan and showing the gadgets then when they finally do it as you see how thinks work out and are given some speedbumps to change the story a little. Ocean's 11 does this perfectly. Therer is an amazing plan to rob an amazing amount of money, and as the plan goes through, I found myself thinking ""maybe it's not gonna work"" and ""ok it will definitely work"" interchangably throughout the film. I won't give away the ending, but let's just say this movie does a great job of making things you may have thought to be something be something different.

582,Drucifer,Turn the 'hip' knob to 11,7,23 December 2001,"Director Steven Soderbergh (who won an Oscar for 2000's Traffic) achieved what most film-makers probably couldn't do:  knock Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone out of the #1 box office spot after only 3 weeks on top. Soderbergh's film, Ocean's Eleven grossed $38.1 million on it's opening weekend, devastating Potter's $14.7 million.  How exactly did he perform this feat?  Well, being able to put names like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon on the bill couldn't have hurt.The television commercials for Ocean's Eleven manage to introduce 4 or 5 of the main characters, but that doesn't totally do the cast justice.  George Clooney (who previously worked with Soderbergh on 1998's Out of Sight) stars as recently released prisoner, Danny Ocean.  Ocean and partner, Dusty Ryan (played by Brad Pitt), assemble an all-star group of differently-skilled criminals to aid in their robbery of 3 major Las Vegas casinos.  Ocean's Eleven consists of Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle and 5 more names you'll probably recognize.  That 70's Show's Topher Grace (who appeared in Traffic) and Dawson's Creek's Joshua Jackson briefly appear as themselves in a poker game in one of the opening scenes.  Andy Garcia also shines as the owner of the 3 target casinos.  The cast is truly massive, and many of the stars go underused, most notably Julia Roberts who plays Danny's ex-wife Tess, who happens to be dating Andy Garcias character.  Roberts is, for reasons unbeknownst to me, listed proceeding an `and introducing' in the closing credits. Now, if you've seen the commercials, you probably noticed that they're quite unorthodox.  The first time I saw one, I didn't know what to make of it.  The plot was totally unclear, and it was so hip and stylish it would make Quentin Tarintino green with envy.  Well, that hip style is not only represented in the casting but also (more so, even) in the editing. There's a few chic-looking cuts on image/shape, several split screens, and more fancy cuts than you can shake a stick at.  The soundtrack is mostly cool-sounding jazz, which is a reasonable update from the Rat Pack-era that the original film was made in.   The costumes are practically taken straight from the pages of GQ.  The budget on sunglasses alone in this movie would probably rival that of the entire filming of The Blair Witch Project.As for the plot, it's divided into three main sections:  the opening (character introductions, plot development, etc.), the middle (planning of the heist and training of the crew) and the ending (the execution of the robbery).  The movie as a whole is quite fast paced.  I didn't stop to look at my watch once during its approximately 100 minute duration.  Each of the three parts of the movie are consistently stylish, funny, action-packed and just plain entertaining.  The dialogue has it's moments of cliché, but those don't take away from the overall likability of the movie.  Screenplay writer Ted Griffin more than successfully updated the 1960 version of this movie for a suave, modern audience. Overall, Ocean's Eleven is the kind of movie you can just sit back and enjoy.  The pacing is quick, and the dialogue is funny, the action is, well, also funny, and it's so packed with stars that Carl Sagan may come back from the dead just to study it.  7.5 out of a possible 10.",Ocean's Eleven

I loved it!  The dialogue was sharp and the script was great.  All those involved (all the cast, which features many uncredited surprises)was great in their roles.  While there was no 1 ""star"" of the movie, they all managed to shine.  It was thoroughly entertaining.  I give this movie an A. Go see it!",Ocean's Eleven
584,dalenberg,All-star ensemble cast caper movies don't work!!,6,24 December 2001,"Ocean's 11 is another ensemble all-star-cast caper movie.  As such, it is one of the best of that lot, but overall that lot is a sorry lot.  Ocean's 11 reminded most recently of a similar ensemble caper flick of a few year's back, ""Sneakers"" (1992)with Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier.  The reason ensemble cast caper films don't work is that there are too many characters for any of them to get developed in the course of a 2 hour movie.  Both of these films (Ocean's 11 and Sneakers) therefore come off as shallow, undeveloped, and slight.  One of the big attractions of Ocean's 11, that gets us into the theater in the first place, is Julia Roberts, but her character is so poorly developed here that she is little more than window dressing and we never understand her motivations (in fact, she doesn't actually do anything in this movie, when you come right down to it.)  The saving grace of Ocean's 11 is the stylish, sophisticated filmic style brought to it by Steven Soderbergh.  Is is so, so refreshing to see a crime picture without a lot of gunfire.  Still, my wife complained as we left the theater that the film didn't have a climax.  You be the judge--the whole film is a mixed bag that way.",Ocean's Eleven

I wouldn't reccomend anyone to  go see the movie. The casting was awful, along with the screenplay. I was talked into watching this movie, and I feel like shooting this person.

588,Zomboid,Boring crap,3,10 July 2002,"Starts off extremely boring and lame, trying to be cool all the while. Eventually it becomes entertainment but that's less than half the movie. It's basically just ""star power"", trying to be cool, and a waste of 2 hours.",Ocean's Eleven
589,NKMacGuffin,Big stars having big fun,8,1 August 2002,"It's all too rare that a film packed with big stars is any fun. When major studios put A-List, $20 million talent onscreen together, they don't want to take any chances on the movie- there's so much money at stake, the final product is boring, but safe. The good news about Ocean's Eleven is that a studio did not put these stars onscreen together- Steven Soderbergh did. Since making a big splash with his debut Sex, Lies, and Videotape in 1989, Soderbergh has earned the respect of actors with smart, classy, and sophisticated projects like Out Of Sight and The Limey. With the one-two punch of Erin Brockovich and Traffic in 2000, major studios are now willing to trust him with big budgets. However, the studio's bankroll didn't get all these names on the marquee- Soderbergh did, and he did it at a bargain.Soderbergh set out to make a fun, popcorn flick involving a casino heist, in the spirit of the Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack movie of 1960. The new Ocean's Eleven stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. Clooney, with Pitt, scheme to steal $160 million from Andy Garcia's casino. They enlist ten con men and hustlers to make it happen. The Eleven of the title pull off the heist, Mission: Impossible style- no guns, no violence. Hardly anyone even gets their hair mussed. There are plenty of kinks in the plan as we go along- but are they kinks or a part of the plan we're unaware of?The great casting continues below the title, with Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould as old-school Vegas cronies looking for one last hand; Don Cheadle as the bomb expert, Bernie Mac as the inside man at the casino; plus Casey Affleck and Scott Caan as the bratty, feuding footsoldiers of the gang.Everyone took pay cuts to join in the fun, and it shows; the set must have felt like a class reunion as it seems everyone has worked together before. Soderbergh has directed Clooney, Roberts, and Cheadle before; Clooney worked with Cheadle in Out Of Sight; Affleck and Damon were in Good Will Hunting, and Gould is on Friends with Mrs. Brad Pitt.You'd think with a big cast and a fast-moving story, that there wouldn't be enough screen time for all the principals. With such a long list of stars, you might expect some bruised egos as some of the cast could get short shrift. However, Soderbergh does a nice job of giving everyone at least one scene to shine. For example, Cheadle (Traffic, Boogie Nights), in some ways, is barely in the movie. But he gets a few brief moments to be noticed which count for a lot.A few of the great moments: Pitt's first and last scenes begin with his character eating junk food. We just watch him eating nachos for 5-10 seconds. How he can look so cool and yet funny while eating nachos is beyond me. Clooney has a scene where he plays with his wedding band. His character is not aware he's doing it, but he fiddles with his ring finger while talking to his ex-wife, and it says more about his feelings that any dialogue can.I had some problems with the Roberts/Clooney relationship. Clooney played a similar role as a thief in Out Of Sight and squeezed out sexy sparks opposite Jennifer Lopez, including a pivotal scene at a secluded table in a dark restaurant. In Ocean's Eleven, Clooney and Roberts' big scenes take place in a similar setting, and suffer by comparison.Without giving too much away, suffice it to say her character is supposed to harbor a grudge against Clooney. She does unleash some sharp jabs in their snappy dialogue. However, we need more romantic magnetism underneath to develop her character arc.It's rare when all the pieces come together for a fun and exciting film these days. Hollywood seems to have forgotten that movies can be thrilling without gunplay, explosions, and car chases. We can only hope that the rest of Hollywood follows Soderbergh's example. This film is not genius, it's just first-class entertainment. On the whole, Ocean's Eleven will be the most fun you'll have at the movies this year.Rated PG-13 for language, and one brief scene with a strip show in the background (no nudity). Hardly any violence (a few punches are thrown); no gun violence. Hardly any smoking. Hardly sounds like a Vegas movie, does it?",Ocean's Eleven
590,tonidizer,Shallow and boring,1,22 May 2003,"I was terribly disappointed by this movie. Actually, I was trying hard to stay awake. There were some good jokes, but no suspense really and the plot was very easy to guess.*** possible spoilers ahead ***Right at the beginning of the movie I was sure this was going to be another Hollywood production with a happy end. I had no doubts whatsoever whether they will succeed or not. They had to succeed in robbing the casinos.Also, would you imagine people who are professional thieves to be so gullible? Two situations: first when Ocean says that all that were invited to take part in the hit can give up. What professional thief would take the risk that the ones who give up this task will keep their mouths shut? Similar situation - when Ocean is excluded from the hit because of his emotional engagements with his ex-wife - they just let him go around the casino - what guarantee do they have that he won't do something stupid and screw up the whole hit? They have too much to lose to be so gullible. There are many more such situations...The play was far from exceptional, perhaps except of the few moments when characters pretended to be someone else. I also have no idea what people see in Julia Roberts. A typical movie with an overgrown budget and a famous cast which is supposed to draw you to see it. Not worth it in my opinion.",Ocean's Eleven

Matt's character is a pit-pocket. Anyone who likes heist film is sure to enjoy this one, and in my own opinion, this one is much better than the original. at some point the movie can get boring, but the rest is fun and is sure to give you some excitement to see Ocean's 12, I know I am.8/10",Ocean's Eleven
593,sarah-joseph,"Sleek, sophisticated fun!",9,23 March 2012,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is packed with a classy ensemble cast, sharp dialog, romance, and robbery. Leading the pack is George Clooney as Danny Ocean who as the movie begins is just released from prison. Being the reformed man that he is, Ocean quickly devises a scheme to rob the 3 biggest casinos in Las Vegas-- the Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and the Mirage.All of them are owned by Terry Benedict played with icy ruthlessness by Andy Garcia. Also Terry is now with Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife. Danny seeks out his point man, gambler, Rusty Ryan (Brad Piit). Rusty and Danny get a financier and begin assembling Ocean's 11. It soon becomes evident to Rusty (Pitt): Is this about the $160 million or Tess? If it were only about the money, ""Ocean's Eleven"" would be an exercise. It is not.George Clooney is a movie star. His Danny Ocean is slick, smart, and a charmer with an underlying substance-- he's a romantic. Brad Pitt is also at his best as Rusty. Pitt exudes the charisma and cool, and he is also very funny. There is hilarious running gag where Pitt is eating something in almost every scene. Clooney and Pitt together nail the crisp and very lean dialog. Julia Roberts is particularly sullen here which is called for in the role, surprisingly out of character for her. The great supporting cast includes Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner, who all have their moments to shine. Soderbergh orchestrates the movie cohesively with great style. I saw a Barbara Walters interview with the cast of ""Oceans Eleven"" where Clooney said that Steven was not making a statement movie with ""Ocean's"". He is correct. What Soderbergh made is a fun and entertaining movie with a very talented cast.",Ocean's Eleven

597,AlexZander45,"great cast, outstanding direction",10,13 July 2007,"I did not see the original. But this version of Ocean's Eleven is one of my favorite movies off all time. I enjoyed Steven Soderbergh's direction and camera work. I particularly like the way each of the 'eleven' characters is introduced, leaves the viewer with an idea of what their role will be. I also prefer movies that do not get carried away with useless and over-the-top special effects. Too many modern movies are depending on CGI. This movie reminds me of movies from the past. I enjoyed watching this movie as much as I enjoyed 'The Sting' from 1973. Now I will admit the idea of knocking over three casinos is fairly unrealistic. But the story, characters, and director make me believe it is possible. I absolutely love the idea of the extremely wealthy Las Vegas casinos getting rooked. They can spare some cash. And it does not hurt Daniel Ocean also makes off with an excellent bonus prize at the end.I highly recommend this movie, very entertaining!!",Ocean's Eleven
598,dgeiser13,Almost As Boring As Billy Ocean,5,10 December 2001,"Let me start by saying that the idea of remaking a Rat Pack movie is brilliant and I couldn't think of a better director, Steven Soderbergh, or lead actor, George Clooney, to handle the job. Or so I thought...It's hard to pinpoint specifically why Ocean's Eleven didn't work as good as it should have for me. The performances were uniformly good and each of the characters got their chance to shine. Great portions of the dialogue were snappy, witty and snide and quite funny. The cinematography was great, the movie looked awesome, and the direction was spot on solid.But in general the movie was boring. That's the only way I can describe it. This was just a regular movie with a regular plot and all of the awesome talent arrayed around it couldn't make it shine like it should've.Here are two examples, I'm sure I could come up with more, of things that put the kibosh on this film working for me:One was the motivation of the characters. Hardly any of the characters besides Clooney, Garcia and Roberts' character seemed to be doing, behaving and saying what they should've given the circumstance. All of the supporting characters in the ""love story"" plot thread (Damon and Pitt) even after finding out Danny's real reason for going to Vegas seemed too accepting. I guess the money and the ""brilliant"" plan along with the thrill of its execution we're supposed to be their motivators but if that was it then it wasn't conveyed very well.The second is a logistical thing. I still cannot see, for the life of me, how they got the bags (the ones with the Big White X's on the end) and their contents (the sex flyers) into the vault. The chinese acrobat definitely didn't have them. Clooney and Damon didn't appear to have them. Yet they had everything bagged and waiting for the casino employees to carry out to the first white van. If you can explain it to me I would appreciate it.As I said these are just two examples. I think a critical film forum could easily come up with many more.Bottom Line: Do not be enticed by the pedigree of this film. It is not very good.",Ocean's Eleven

There scenes together are good, especially their first encounter to the audience.  The story-line between the two, however, does not develop at all, and when it ends you are sitting there wondering what happened.  Other than that, good heist movie even if it has been done before.

Then, yes, the actual robbery was cleverly worked out and quite cool. But what is it with this Hollywood need to include some love interest and happy romantic endings? This is a film that had great potential, but ended up being no more than ""good guys outwit bad guy"" plus ""good guy gets the girl"".On the plus side, Andy Garcia was great, the only character you could really side with, as was Elliot Gould who stole the show every second he was on screen.

612,atalanta00,"Could Be Better, Could Be Worse",6,27 April 2005,"After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I've come to realize that the original unfavorable reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That's not to say that the film is terribleit's notor that you shouldn't watch ityou shouldbut rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like ""It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,"" or ""It has Julia Roberts in it,"" or ""Stephen Soderbergh directed it."" Ocean's Eleven is a ""People Magazine"" reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character, or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimately...but we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherin some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She speaks words like she's chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire (if she had it) of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive to the genre of the movie and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; they shouldn't be too serious.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts (or any of the other Big Names) as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts ""Tess"" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and where I live I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsunfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was in Spain, dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over againthat kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, the actors' skill, the screenwriter's craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like birthday cake, it's not ultimately what satisfies your hunger.",Ocean's Eleven

The original may have been a better film, if only because the people who starred in the film were known to us as a group so we knew there was already chemistry.  Putting a bunch of stars in a movie does not guarantee that there will be chemistry.  No matter how big the people are, without chemistry the film drags -- and this film drags a lot.",Ocean's Eleven
619,JustinCredible,Tears Rolled Down My Eyes....,10,8 December 2001,"...as the credits rolled.Why, you ask? Because ever since I saw the original kings of cool, The Rat Pack, I've been hooked by their style. Their songs, their clothes, their attitude and their movies defined coolness. So when I heard that my favorite Rat Pack Movie, Ocean's 11, was being remade I had one thought in my mind? Will they mess it up?Its a proven fact that remakes end up being crappy, as seen with Psycho, Planet Of The Apes, and A Kid In King Arthur's Court/Black Knight. My fears were put to rest when Steven Soderbergh was given the helm, as he directed great films like Out Of Sight and The Limey (but stumbled with his last two Erin Brockavich and Traffic). Then he assembled a great cast with Clooney, Damon, Pitt, Mac, Gould, Casey Affleck, Garcia, Cann and Cheadle. I was weary with the addition of Julia Roberts (since she has been known to mess with a movie's chemistry), but she was able to pull off her role.
Everyone did their part from music from David Holmes, to cameos from TV teen stars. Great pacing, great storytelling, a heist movie that doesn't seem far-fetched. No singing though....

Before going though, i had read the book first and so it helped having  little background of the movie. George Clooney is the leading man but i think Brad Pitt's performance was so much better. Very witty and believable. Danny Ocean (clooney) and his team of eleven including (pitt, damon) havethe one goal to knock over three casino's in one night. They're tactitcs are very clever and hard to imagine. Plus there is the 'wild card' julia roberts who plays Danny's ex-wife who is now dating clooney's target, (garcia)./ THe twists and turns make this movie enjoyable and is so funny i laughed so much my friend told me she could hear across the seats! if ur going to see a movie this year, this is the one to watch!",Ocean's Eleven

The only thing this film has is a linear, predictable and uninteresting script and a bunch of big stars playing characters none of whom are least bit interesting or unique.

Not only if you read the story. But when you just see the cast alone you would give money to see this film...Danny Ocean (George Clooney), an ex-detained thief just released from prison has had enough time in jail to think of a new refreshing plan: robbing 3 casinos. Therefore he needs some reinforcements. Therefore he goes to Russ Ryan (Brad Pitt), a handsome-looking young man, whom is clever in putting plans into effect. Ryan has much contacts in the criminal milieu. They all get an invitation to Las Vegas.The whole plan gets explained in detail. To look if the plan is attainable, they build the whole safe and try if it works.Meanwhile, Rusty discovers that Danny's ex-wife, Tess, is the lover of the owner of these 3 casinos. Rusty thinks that the motives for this robbery is out of revenge.The robbery itself doesn't go that easy as planned. First there are some difficulties with electricity, then one of the 11 men gets hurt on the hand, and if that isn't enough, Danny Ocean is constantly watched by 2 security-men.At the end Danny has to choose between Tess or the money, what will it be?

Clooney, Pitt, Garcia, Damon, Roberts - they could have made 5 top seling hits instead of one.  But top names can do nothing if the story is poor and here the story is poor, or at least very average. They wanted to make a kind of Guy Ritchie movie, but failed to succeed. The love story is flat and so naive! No chemistry at all between Clooney and Roberts. The ending is the worst part, spoiling the movie, which so far had been not a bad action flick. I cannot simply believe that money-loving Julia at one moment turned to georgious George! Even is so, they showed everything literally (do they think the viewer is so dumb???) ending with the compulsory kiss. The action part of the movie is better, but there's been lots of such robbery films and this one does not outstand. The robbery itself is filmed quite well and is surely the best part. Acting? Pitt, Clooney, Damon and Roberts are disappointing. Garcia not bad. To sum it up, I hoped Soderbergh wouldn't join the American mainstream (bad guy, good guy, some better or worse story, nice girl, at the end the good guy gets the nice girl).

But you gotta admit the sheer star power of the first movie is intimidating. But this new version can stand along side(and will) the original in the classic hall of fame. I bought both movies(It had been so long since I had seen the first) and played the new one first(I hadn't seen it yet). I was absolutely bowled over. The updates fit right in and just seemed natural. There was still a surprise at the end and not the one I expected. I thought well I don't believe it but watching  the old one is going to be a letdown. Well was I wrong!

This is not the 1960's version and should not be put on the same level as it. The change in technology has changed so much since the original 1960's Rat Pack movie that the 2001 version acts as a totally new film. The original was a great movie no denying that. The heist in the 1960's version was way ahead of its time. But a lot has changed in 41 years; in this age of computers it would have been impossible for the original heist to work without a Vegas camera watching you. Though the original had a certain style of class that this one didn't. Both versions were extremely fun to watch.I rate this 9/10 and the original an 8/10.TRIVIA: Angie Dickinson had a bit part in this movie playing herself. She was the Beatrice Ocean in the original Oceans 11 in 1960.In the original 1960 version of Ocean's 11, Sammy Davis Jr. played a demolition man. In this version of Oceans 11, the 2001 version, Don Cheadle plays Sammy's role as the demolition man.

The updated version gives one the sense of a bunch of fine craftsmen just playing around, wasting time and having fun. And maybe they did have fun, but I certainly didn't.  These are supposed to be the best creative talents working in Hollywood today.  Shouldn't we expect something a little bit more substantial from them?

The plot is fairly standard for the heist genre, just a bunch of gentleman thieves robbing a bad guy. Nothing spectacular. But the real strength in this movie lies in its characters. The chemistry between them is brilliantly executed; the highlight being the George Clooney-Brad Pitt interaction (I actually believe that this is one of their best performances). Although the plot itself isn't all that interesting, it's enjoyable thanks to the fact that we have no idea how George Clooney and his ten rascals will pull it of, and when you figure out what they had in mind, you'll love it. Without spoiling anything, it'll leave you satisfied. To sum it up, this is a step forward for the genre, and a fresh take on how characters can interact with each other. A must see.",Ocean's Eleven

Not that I have seen the original, but more that I don't like remakes as a whole.After watching it a couple of times on DVD, I admit I was wrong. Yes, there's a lot of cheese and predictability to this movie. Whatever is wrong with it from that perspective, there is much that is right. Start off with Clooney whose deadpan delivery of some very funny lines remains a highlight; to the underappreciated (and funny!) role that Bernie Mac plays; to Brad Pitt's outstanding acting (watch the coffee cup when they're kicking the idea around); to the excellent performance turned in by Elliott Gould.
Yes, there are a lot of celebs. Yes, it's a star-studded cast in Vegas, but it's worth it. The score is outstanding with that cool jazz style matching perfectly to the dialog and scene setup that goes on. The camera work and scene set up is amazing. Rent it on DVD or pick it up cheap and let the story be told to you. Don't look for depth - it's not there - but look for the good story, acting, direction and cinematography.",Ocean's Eleven

He also finds that his wife Tess has filed for divorce and is with casino tycoon Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).Ocean rounds up ten others including Frank Catton (Bernie Mac) Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan) Malloy, Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner), and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) to steal $150 million from Benedict's three casinos on the night of a prize boxing fight.Along the way, there are several obstacles to go through, not the least of which is acrobatic ally ""The Amazing"" Yen (Shaobo Qin) breaking his hand on a van door thanks to Linus. Soderbergh keeps these huge names in check and not surprisingly, this film is a real winner.I must also say that this is the film that showed, to me at least, Brad Pitt is a great actor.

The music by David Holmes really brings this movie together linking each scene perfectly. The amount of instruments used is incredible and they each play a distinct part for the film. The music sounds sly and perfect to thieve too.The cast of actors is amazing: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Juila Roberts, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner and many more. These actors know what they are doing and make this movie such a pleasure to watch. The location is perfect for a hiest movie. Now granted, it is a remake of the 1960 film Oceans 11 which was set in Vegas, but the way they depicted it in this remake was amazing.I love this movie and its my favourite of all time with 2nd and 3rd going to Oceans 12 and Oceans 13.I would recommend this movie and the sequels to anyone who likes hiest movies and wants an enjoyable night on the couch.",Ocean's Eleven
647,martin-rice,The original was better,7,28 March 2012,"For me Oceans eleven (there is some spoiler info below) epitomizes my reaction to many modern movies with good directing, good acting, but sub par writing. Either the original was inherently difficult to adapt or it was simply poorly done, because the dialogue is sparse and cliché'd at points. At times they sound like a Dr. Evil parody astounded by the possibility for '1 million' dollars. Pitt is good, as is clooney (although he still hasn't achieved his potential with a really good movie), but Andy Garcia is way too one dimensional and it's not believable that julila roberts would date him, even it just for the money & lifestyle. And even the dimension Garcia has ( the nobody's fool anal tough guy) turns out not to be true, as he lets clooney off easy after it should be clear he is implicated in the heist. And speaking of overdone, don't get me started on the chief financer character. Ocean's eleven attempts to ooze coolness like pulp fiction, but the script just doesn't back it up.",Ocean's Eleven

My favourite character was Rusty (played by Brad Pitt, i loved the fact he was always eating it look hilarious for a man of his sliming stature. I also liked Basher played awesomely by Don Cheadle (WHO WAS SADLY UNCREDITED, which was wrong because he's terrific). I enjoyed the jokes that are spoken in it some very sardonic others just plain side-splitting. But the number one factor of Ocean's Eleven is the plot. Extremely clever and so clever that it takes at least 3 times to finally get the story in your head. My favourite film of all time, though not such a terrific sequel.

Also, this film had a perfect blend between action and comedy, which is very surprising considering one would think that since 11 men are robbing 3 casinos how could that not be a heavily action based film, but the director incorporated many comical parts throughout the movie, something i thoroughly enjoyed. I have watched this movie many times and have enjoyed it every time I watch it, and I usually don't enjoy re-watching movies. I definitely recommend watching this movie at least once.

Great film.The greatest thing about this film is that it is so cleverly written. It never bores you and allows you to live the fantasy of pulling the biggest steal in history. To think that they are actually going to do what they do in the movie is just outrageous, but they make you believe it is so possible. Brad Pitt and George Clooney make that happen.

652,SeanVMusic,Simple fun,7,11 April 2017,"Ocean's Eleven features an all star cast pulling off a classic Las Vegas heist with a modern twist. The plot makes sense and the pacing moves the story along with ease, if not for the only flaw : a Hollywood attempt at integrating romance in a movie where none is needed. The Great actors bring their characters to life with energy and passion even though each protagonist is more cliché than the last. If not for the ridiculously Sci-Fi looking ""blackout machine"" the film manages to pull off a classy vibe in a very money and stripper themed decor. The music compliments each scene and correctly translates the emotion of the moment though it never really transcends to into anything greater.Time. Time was, and will be, this films greatest enemy. Some scenes drag out too long in the moment and as years pass new viewers will most likely not quite capture the importance of the originality of the twist.

George Clooney plays himself, much the same as his character in Out Of Sight. Brad Pitt puts in a very mediocre performance by Brad Pitt standards (but this could never be as good as his 'Fight Club' or 'Twelve Monkeys' or even his 'Se7en'). Julia Roberts is just there for eye-candy (enough said). Matt Damon just looked like he was strolling though this, not a patch on his performances in Good Will Hunting or Dogma (then again both had better screenplays). Andy Garcia is probably the best of the top-billed actors, but playing a character with a reputation for being evil I wished he could have shown more of an evil side. The supporting actors were better. Scott Caan and Casey Affleck were probably the best and funniest characters and Elliott Gould put in a memorable and amusing performance. Worst of the supporting actors was Don Cheadle (but not for his acting abilities), for some unknown reason they took an American and decided to put a Cockney accent on him! Why ? What was the point ? No wonder he decided to appear 'uncredited'.Saying all that the film kept going at the same pace throughout and never died at all. When I saw this at least 75% of the audience were women (no shocks there!)and I'm sure they loved the film.I just expected more from 'the cast to die for'.

Well it's no different with Ocean's Eleven. Clooney and Pitt had absolutely no chemistry. The film lacked suspense, timing and the only characters worth watching were those played by Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould. After seeing OE I am forced to once again ask myself who funds these yawners? With all the great talent out there waiting to work and all the terrific scripts floating around why would production companies waster their time on garbage?

661,mikekreein,"An American Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels...",7,10 December 2001,"Ocean's 11 reminded me a lot of Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, both by Guy Ritchie.  Ocean's 11 had the unique and humorous characters like the Ritchie movies, but unlike Ritchie's movies, I felt that Soderbergh did not use each character to their full potential.  For example, the two young getaway drivers in Ocean's 11 were hired (in the film) not so much for their skills, but for their antics.  I do not ever recall a car chase in the movie in which they were showing off their driving skills.I also did not like the romance part of the story in Ocean's 11.  The movie was up and down between the humor and action of the heist and the relationship between Tess and Danny.  These parts between them slow the movie down heavily.  Also, the ending of Ocean's 11 could have really been improved upon.Regardless, Ocean's 11 was a breath of fresh air for the movie industry. I really enjoyed it, but I would recommend Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels over it.",Ocean's Eleven
662,jtvjr,Good but...,7,7 December 2001,"George Clooney, in his suave, low-keyed voice, is the persona of cool in Ocean's Eleven.  The funny scene with Matt Damon and Bernie Mac (along with Andy Garcia) is very good, but Clooney along with Brad Pitt make Ocean's Eleven an enjoyable ride, albeit slightly slower than expected.  Don Cheadle's cockney accent is very good, and Carl Reiner shows why his form of comedy will be around for a long time.Wasted in this movie is Julia Roberts, as the ex-wife/girlfriend/pawn. Although her interaction with Clooney via lines and lines of snappy repartee is done well, she doesn't have much else to do but look good and make Garcia and Clooney jealous of each other.",Ocean's Eleven
663,madmax_ut,Soderberg's Big Score,10,7 December 2001,"Having read other user comments, namely bams, I have to disagree on many fronts.  I feel as if this is the movie we have all been waiting for this year.  Soderberg did something with this piece that I was certain would not happen.  He actually brought several big name Hollywood stars from many different backgrounds and actually made an ensemble.  Without the chemistry, the movie very well could have died.The script could easily been chopped and dropped with the wrong timing, character relation, or direction.  But by not only introducing the audience to many different character developments, and not just limiting each character to try to relate to one another with useless banter, the movie had me wanting to know what was going to happen next.Of course, the script did tease me into believing that it was going to be a fresh idea, the audience realizes by the end that it wasn't necessarily something they had not seen before, but it was seen in a new manner.  The best part of the film was the timing.  The one liners didn't break the flow up, like they very well can and do in most films.  Soderberg scored a winner with this one, and glory be to this movie as I have been thoroughly disappointed in the film industry this year.",Ocean's Eleven
664,sandman77,Boring and predictable,1,4 February 2002,"I didn't expect much, but guess what... The plot is predictable, the ""funny"" and ""cool"" sequences aren't.

665,lestat0327,"Snazzy, slick, witty, and cool",10,12 December 2001,"Whoever called this entertaining  movie a ""lifeless disappointment"" 1) obviously does not represent the majority of reviewers here who loved it and 2) needs to stop watching ""reality"" TV shows and see what a real story with interesting characters looks like. This modern version of ""Ocean's 11"" is vast improvement over the original boring version with the original crassy players known as the Rat Pack. Why they were considered ""cool"" must've been a baby boomer thing but I'll tell you this: Frank Sinatra never wore a suit with such elan as Brad Pitt does. Thank god for George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh who were smart enough to throw out everything that was wrong with the first one and got it right with the second one. All of the actors obviously had a blast making this movie and it shows. They are also perfectly casted, except for Julia Roberts, who is too plain-looking to be a casino owner's girlfriend (she also needs to learn how to walk in high heels). As an interesting aside: Clooney has more screen chemistry with Pitt than he does with Roberts. Every scene that either Clooney or Pitt is in is thoroughly entertaining. I hope that the scene-stealing older actors, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner, were giving out free actling lessons to the young'uns: Affleck, Damon, and Caan. With this movie, it is easy to see why Clooney and Pitt are movie stars and easier still to see that Steven Soderbergh is the new ""Steven"" any smart actor in Hollywood should be knocking down the door to work with. An excellent job. Highly recommended.",Ocean's Eleven

The characters are all likable, the dialogue is snappy and clever, and it just oozes ""cool"".  The only weak point in the movie to me was Julia Roberts' character, where she has weak chemistry with George Clooney (who is as cool as he's ever been), and there's no real reason given to why George's Danny Ocean character would be so devoted to her.

671,RolandtheThird,The New Classic Heist Movie!,8,10 December 2001,"This exciting movie was easiliy  far better that the orignal, Indeed better than any of the heist films released this year (2001).Only the most basic plot elements remain from the original movie, main characters name, etc. I think that was the right route to go as no one really wanted to see a second rate re-hash of the rat pack. George Clooney leads the all star cast, much to its credit the stars aren't as important as the movie, that is another great argumant for an ensemble Oscar becuase as good as they are no single actor carries the entire film.The film opens with geoge clooneys danny ocean getting his five minutes before a parole board, in probably the most sedate scene in the entire film. the rest of the film picks up the pace quite a bit and only slows down again for clooneys confrontation with his with his ex-wife, played of course by Julia, who is also of course very much still in love with her ex even if she doesn't know it yet, it's very formulaic and probably the weakest part of the movie. The Movies is at it's best when it focuses it's energy on the heist and it's perpetrators the titualar 11. Also making a strong performance is Andy Garcia as the ice cold Terry Benedict, or the machine as he is fondly called in the film. I've deliberately avoided speaking about the details becuase the film is in the details and should be experienced to be believed. in conclusion another strong effort by new hollywood wunderkind Steven Soderburgh, who has a profound talent for caoxing the best out of his actors. that combined with his strong visual style makes Oceans 11 one of the best of this year. Though people who enjoyed the orignal probably won't be as entertained as those who didn't.",Ocean's Eleven

The movie is neither exciting, fun, entertaining, and the action is virtually non-existent. I hope everyone can look beyond the hype of this pile of garbage, and realize that there much better movies around the topic of heist and robbery out there.For instance, I can recommend underrated movies such as 3000 miles to Graceland and Reindeer Games, which are two fun the fast-paced rides, and also two slower, but not less entertaining movies such as Entrapment and The Score.

681,alnelson2,Ocean's Eleven...the reaction,10,8 December 2001,"This movie...kicks ass. It doesn't make you think deeply, it doesn't move you emotionally, it just kicks ass. Period. I'd have to say it's absurdly entertaining, stylistically amazing, and simply a joy to sit through. The acting is fabulous and the plot is witty, intricate and and best of all ridiculously unbelievable but for the sole purpose of being ridiculously unbelievable. It's a charming little piece of filmmaking that isn't expressive of the director's desire to make a statement about life, but rather a collaboration of fine actors with a superb knack for style, a script with the perfect dosage of whimsical dialogue and clever plot twists, and a director capable of Oscar-caliber schematics giving his audience a break from social commentary by replacing it with unrealistic yet straight-forward amusement. Steven Soderbergh, after masterminding Traffic and Erin Brockovich, doesn't disappoint simply because his film entertains rather than moves, and although some film critics may question his motives in choosing such a project, I'm impressed with his consistent ability to appease movie-goers whatever the subject matter. So there you have it. After finally seeing Ocean's 11 ending months of anticipation, I can honestly say my expectations were exceeded, and I couldn't be more excited to have discovered another film to be added to my collection in the very near future. Needless to say, everyone should see this movie. I assure you, it will not disappoint.",Ocean's Eleven

The younger crowd, with their video-game, smash-and-bash, the-louder-the-better mentality might not appreciate this film, but if you are looking for a solid 2 hours of intelligent entertainment, this movie is worth the money. First of all, you have to appreciate and respect a movie that doesn't substitute direct violence; gratuitous nudity, sex or swearing; or drug use for plot. As a parent, I'd feel comfortable bringing my kids to this movie -- if I thought they would ""get it."" Don't leave your brain at the door; you're going to need it. Now, I haven't seen the original ""Ocean's 11"" in its entirety, but I'm willing to bet that this one is much more engrossing.The basic plot is simple -- George Clooney's a career con man planning a major heist of 3 Las Vegas casinos; Brad Pitt helps him round up the usual gang of suspects to help them pull it off. It's the execution of their plan, and the twists and turns the gang encounters on the way, that will make the two hours fly by. Pay attention to everything you see and hear. With such a large cast, you don't learn much about the characters, but the movie is such a lark you don't need to ""care"" about them. Watching the talented actors put their own little spins on stock roles is a lot of fun. Granted, Clooney and Pitt can do charming in their sleep, but there's nothing wrong with watching a pro strut his stuff. Matt Damon doesn't get much to do but chew gum for quite awhile, but when it's time for him to break out of his slacker rookie role, he's slyly funny, especially when he gets his big job as part of the heist.  A special shout-out to Scott Caan and Casey Affleck, who lend some great touches of humor as the two ""go-to"" guys of the gang, and to Elliott Gould, who shows the pretty boys who's boss whenever he's on screen. (He should win a special Oscar for bravery, based on his wardrobe alone.) Steven Soderbergh does a great job of keeping the action moving, epitomizing the never-a-dull-moment ambience of Las Vegas, except for the mercifully brief scenes between Clooney and Roberts. Thankfully, Soderbergh and the writers kept the ""romantic"" subplot on the back burner, where it belonged. The music is fun and funky, and the whole movie is such a lark, you'll leave the theater greatly amused and almost wishing for a life on the lam; Soderbergh, Clooney and the boys make it look so fun.",Ocean's Eleven

One thing that really struck me was the whole 60's vibe present in the film.  While it takes place in modern day Vegas, the look, feel and sound of hay-day of the Vegas strip is somehow present.  Great supporting roles by everyone from Casey Afleck to Carl Reiner, and a quick but appreciated cameo by original Rat Pack Gal, Angie Dickenson makes this a great ride.Are you in or out?

Seems to me that many people are stomping on it for all the wrong reasons, and are quite simply missing the point.  This movie is not about breaking new ground or providing us with insight about how to be a better person.  It's made to entertain, and it does so quite cleverly.  There's a reason that Clooney and Pitt seem to be the same character that they always are;  They're making fun of it! There's a reason that the stakes keep getting higher, and the heist more and more improbable:  They're making fun of these types of movies!  And it's done sharply and stylishly. If you're disappointed that the movie didn't give you more, you completely missed the point.  Yet, the movie was directed right at you.Some people need to realize that movies shouldn't always be pretentious and with a sense of moral urgency.  Sometimes it's fun just to watch guys being cool; cool for no reason.  Add on top of that the fact that we (should) know that Clooney and Pitt are self-referentially making fun of the whole bit, it only makes it that much better.  Why do you think Pitt is always trying to 'teach' people to be cool, or Clooney pokes holes into Pitt's facade?  Just to have fun with it.Complaining about this movie's lack ingenuity or believability is like complaining about animals in the Lion King talking.  Suspend some disbelief, and enjoy the experience of watching a movie that puts down the mantle of self-rightiousness, and dares to ask the question: ""How do you get a large group of Oscar caliber actors to share the same movie?""  (which seems to be harder than the heist pulled off in the movie) The answer, of course, is let them have fun.For any of you needing a deeper intellectual fabric, you need to start taking some lessons from Pitt.",Ocean's Eleven

I haven't seen the original so am glad to say I didn't suffer the problem of comparisons through this film and enjoyed it for what it was. The only criticism I have is that the plot does get a tad tangled in the climax and I would imagine that you might need a second viewing to pick up on everything...having said that - I'd be happy to watch this film a few times anyway.

The key to Danny and Linus (Matt Damon) getting into the vault was a device that Basher (Don Cheadle) stole, a bomb powerful enough to wipe out the power of Las Vegas. Not many people would find a movie about stealing money entertaining, but the way that this one was made certainly can catch people's eye. I really think that it is one of the best of the new decade.",Ocean's Eleven
699,pmcrouch,The best comments,10,14 February 2002,This is an excellent movie! Perfectly acted by George Clooney and Andy Garcia. But also the other actors are also great. Better than the Oceans Eleven 1961 movie. Probably the years best movie. And many years yet to come.,Ocean's Eleven
700,WhY_Am_I,liked it liked it liked it!!!!,9,6 June 2003,I didnt really wanted to watch this movie coz brad pitt is in it and i hate brad pitt!

I've been trying to find the original but hey it is an oldie and extremley to find hard here. Anyway just watch the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ocean's Eleven
701,Glappis,A glossy finish without content,3,9 February 2002,"First of all i have to agree with a critic saying ""Entertaining but not engaging""Steven Soderbergh probably thought that the content is second as long as you have a handfull of beatifull stars. Ok, George Clooney delivers one-liners in his standard ironic way with a touch of arrogance and Pitt/Damon is as goodlooking as ever but it all feels a bit to polished and empty. Arrogance by the way distinguish the 3 allready mentioned self-assured ""hunks"" efforts in this film. And the love story between Julia Roberts and George Clooney's characters is totally unnecessary and a waist of Roberts talent. It doesnt really add anything but rather leave a sense of what?/why?.Sure enough, you can expect a few laughs but there a bit too cheap and holds the standard of a Late Show-cast reject.The original version is no masterpiece either but i really did expect more from Soderbergh and this uninspired cast.",Ocean's Eleven

Comes Steven somerborough finest work yet. With a great cast of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julie Roberts and Matt Damon brings a very talented line-up with a heck of a lot of experience, looking at these actors i could name a few classic movies from each of them.Oceans Eleven is based on the 1960's version, which i have not had the chance to see yet, its about an ex-confict named Danny Ocean (george clooney) who is released from prison, to seek revenge on the man that stole his sweetheart (julie Roberts), this man happens to be Trevor Benidict the owner of three large casinos in Las vegas.Ocean sets out to build up a crew of his freinds in the game, along with brad pitt, and matt damon.  The crew has a unique image combining diffent races, age, size, culture in to one huge laugth.The crew plans to take over the safe that connects all three casinos on the night that Lennox lewis, playing himself, fights for the title.With jaw dropping twists to make you not want to leave your seat right to the end, this movie, is a must see.

I wasn't too keen on seeing it, cos I didn't think it was really my type of film, (I was only going to see it for Brad Pitt), but I was so wrong! First off, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Joshua Jackson making an appearance in it, that was very good!

It was quite good in fact. There was enough action going on to keep me interested throughout. I haven't seen the TV series or the older version of Ocean's 11 so I don't have anything to compare to. I thought that, when they talked about, the 3 most previous successful casino robberies were hilarious. Brad Pitt was beautiful as usual. Matt Damon did a good job of playing the 'new kid' but Julia Roberts' presence was just plain 'blah.'All in all a good movie to watch.",Ocean's Eleven
706,jelenab,George Clooney is the reason why,8,22 March 2002,"George Clooney is the reason why you should see this movie, besides the great direction. This movie offers you a time good spent. No bizarre story, no big thoughts, nothing that will keep you pondering on, just an easy evening out. The movie is not worth an Award, but it's worth your money. The fact that there is not much of a violence is refreshing, just a good story.I was surprised how there was no equal to George Clooney, the rest of the cast was in his shadow.",Ocean's Eleven

I have not seen the original, even this version did not insist on watching until paid no attention to my team a good actor. The essence of the film - planned robbery, which no one has identified as impossible. However, all things are possible, only to be meticulously choreographed plan. The action begins soon - as soon as the familiarization with the actors who will work throughout the plan, and their not so little. Plenty to no time, the focus is detained from the first to the last minute - wondering how to continue to behave as good. Quality construction, colorful characters, maybe as much as stereotypes occurred, but not the fact that it is. Love the line could be missing, the first number it and decommission of all this (despite the fact that the robbery for the same love and scheduled). Actors team does not lack big names, so it is not surprising that do not interfere with performance. It is a little short. If you are also fans of thrillers, and somehow you will be missed in this movie, I recommend joining.

For me,the actors skills aren't really tested.Brad Pitt & Julia Roberts Especially seem to act in this movie with more wood than a timber yard.However,fans of the actors involved will love it,undoubtedly.The effects are quite good,& The story is laughable,so for me it's a no-brainer,a defenite popcorn flick. But i wouldnt bother buying the DVD.I Have to say though,Don Cheadle's London Cockney Accent is one of THE Legendary Worst accents ever seen on screen!

716,adkoszulinski,soderburgh at his best,8,4 July 2009,"Ocean's Eleven brings a new look to the gentleman thief genre. Instead of one individual seeking fortune for themselves, it is a sophisticated clique of masterminds trying to pull off a million to one heist with a huge payoff. The film features an all star cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Each thief in ""Ocean's 11"" plays a major role in the heist and puts forth their particular area of expertise. It keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and just when you think you have a bead on what's going to happen next, the film throws a curve ball twist right past you. My favorite aspect of this film is how calm and cool everyone of the 11 seems in the face of the consequence of being caught. If you're a fan of con-artist films such as The Sting, I highly recommend Ocean's 11.",Ocean's Eleven
717,cbsports04,Ocean's Eleven,9,29 August 2010,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies for many different reasons. To start off, I believe that this movie was cast very well. The actors that are in it know what they are doing and make this movie great because of the way they all interact with one another. This movie also flows really well, while keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. One of my favorite parts about the movie is how they chose to bring in each character in their own unique way. Even though there are no particular scenes that really blow you away, the end result is exceptionally great. This movie gets better every time i watch it.There are not many things about this movie that i did not like. I guess one thing that their could have been more of is action. This movie has it's moments, but overall is not action filled. And even though the actors performances are really good I think that the relationship between some of the main characters could have been a little more defined. At first I am not really sure why, but this movie makes me think of the movie by the name of ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"". Both these movies have very good actors and are scripted in a way audiences enjoy. I really like the way both movies bring in each character and explains that character's role in the overall scheme of things. ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" did a better job at defining the character's relationships with each other, and also involved a little more action but that's to be expected from a movie that involves stealing cars not bankrupting a casino. Ocean's Eleven,overall, is a great film and I would highly advise anyone who has not seen it to go watch it right now.",Ocean's Eleven

This movie stands on its own, and in my opinion, far above the slap-sticky original.The dynamics between the cast of this movie are absolutely electric. They are having a good time, and it shows up in every single scene.The story itself is adequate, but what really makes this film is the dynamic between the actors and the dialogue.  You can watch this film multiple times and pick up small details here and there in almost every scene.I feel kind of silly raving about a Brad Pitt/George Clooney film, but I genuinely enjoy this film every time I see it.

There's nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly.Personally, I have a theory that any movie that absolutely blows you away the first time you see it, will lose its entertainment value very quickly. Not necessarily because the movie was not good, but because it just seems to get old too fast. This is NOT one of those movies.This is the kind of movie that will be enjoyed countless times. The dialogue is slick, and always to the point. There are few (if any) overdone scenes and/or lines that tend to become annoying over time.This movie flows exceptionally well. Personally, I couldn't quite figure out why until I watched the ""behind the scenes"" footage on the DVD. I didn't really notice all of the work they put into using as few shots as possible. The extra features on the DVD really explain it all. Almost every scene uses considerably less shots than you would think it takes to convey all of the activity going on. The music punctuates the flow of the movie and the shots extremely well.The cast is almost all big names. It's great to see actors like Pitt and Clooney and Damon come together in a movie and interact so well, without having to be the pretty boys or bad-ass heroes of the movie.",Ocean's Eleven
722,pinkglitterbabe86,You can't take your eyes off the screen,10,14 February 2005,"Directed by Steven Soderbergh, this brilliant movie rates 10 out of 10 on the celeb-o-meter. With the gorgeous George Clooney (Danny Ocean)joined by the equally handsome Brad Pitt (Rusty Ryan) it appears this film can do no wrong. The central plot of the movie revolves around Danny's impossible plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos, conveniently owned by Terry Benedict, his ex-wife's (Julia Roberts) new man. The script is full of witty and slick dialogue, providing plenty of comedy moments, notably between Pitt and Clooney. However, the enjoyment of the film is let down by Don Cheadle's dodgy cockney accent as Basher. You cannot take your eyes off the screen for a moment- not only because of the males but the plot is very complex and you may leave the cinema wondering what just happened in the last two hours. The soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks I have heard and full credit should be given to composer David Holmes. All in all, a thoroughly entertaining movie, highly recommended.",Ocean's Eleven
723,0357518201,This movie is Soderberghs failure,4,26 December 2004,"This movies fault is 11. All too many people and each persons episodes aren't very much,so we cant identify as who is who. At most five people can be grasped.And Julia Roberts is unattractive in this movie. So I couldn't understand why Ocean and Benedict scrambled for her.And at any cost, Ocean looks just a poor confidence man who miss Tess and Benedict looks just a honest elite businessman. Maybe this is a scenarios fault. Benedict didn't show his way for villain,at any cost, we cant feel refreshed .So,this movie is criticized severely in Japan. Of cause I also do.",Ocean's Eleven

The ladies will probably enjoy this movie just from the actors in it such as Brad Pitt but the reality is the movie its self is a waste of time. I would like to share with you the best part of the movie; the best part is the credit's at the end of the movie. From the beginning until the credits, not much was happening as they organized a team to complete a mission (real exciting right?) wrong, a few old guys get together to do the impossible - no character was particular special or interesting, there just wasn't any substance to this movie.",Ocean's Eleven
728,taemliving-07405,Ocean's Eleven Evaluation,10,15 April 2015,"Ocean's Eleven (2001) is a comedic film, based on the 1960 film Ocean's 11, about a group of thieves, led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his accomplice Rusty (Brad Pitt) who rob The Bellagio casino in Las Vegas along with two other casinos that feed into its vault. The casinos are all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) whom Danny has a personal dispute with. They are all very smart people who know how to play outside the law and win. The plot is cunning and The gang of thieves stress and collaborate together to pull off the perfect crime in this clever film. I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it, I still admire it. Ocean's Eleven is a witty and funny film that keeps you thinking up until the end of the movie. Every detail is perfectly placed in the movie and I still catch new important clues relating to the plot every time I watch it. It really plays with small details and the relationships that the characters have with each other. There is a perfect balance of fun and seriousness in their job and you can really tell that based on their conversations and interactions with each other. It's a brilliant film that I can watch again and again without boring myself.This film is unique in the way it was filmed and edited. As Rusty and Danny explain exactly what they will be doing according to the plan, this film flashes to them enacting their plot as Rusty and Danny talk about it making it very neatly edited. It tricks you when it comes to time and location, making you really think about what is going on. I also love the cinematography of this film. It takes place in Las Vegas and you really get that when you're watching it. The dim lighting, and glamorous wardrobe selection really conveys what the film is trying to get across, as well as the characters as they are playing different roles. It's really the kind of film that makes you want to rob a Las Vegas casino. And who better than Brad Pitt and George Clooney to rob it with you? The cast is absolutely magnificent. It is picked perfectly with star studded actors. Each actor and actress plays their role exquisitely. The main character are introduced into the film showing exactly who they are and their distinct personality right off the bat, and you love each of the characters instantly. They are all quirky and have their own little comedic mannerisms and actions that just add to the hilarity of the film.I've seen other con-like robbery movies but this movie really is my favorite. There are even two sequels to Ocean's Eleven and I still keep this one close to heart. This movie reminds me of another robbery film, Inside Man (2006) with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Now this movie is more intense than Ocean's Eleven and is not a comedy like it, but it does share some of the same features. Both of these movies deceive you in the plot just as the characters have deceived their robbery victims. In Inside man, Clive Owen pulls off the perfect bank robbery just as Clooney, Pitt, and their crew did in Ocean's Eleven. I love both movies but I really enjoyed the comedic appeal that the Ocean's Eleven added to something serious like robbing a place. It really makes it more entertaining for the audience and makes you love the quirky characters even more.This movie is simply a delight to watch. I could watch marathons of these movies and still wish I had more to watch. Clooney and Pitt steal the show in this film and lead us through this funny and smart plot effortlessly. The whole idea of this movie is simply gold and the whole cast shows us that throughout every scene. I really think highly of this film and encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to take the time to watch it. I would also suggest watching its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007), as they are written just as perfectly as the first one.",Ocean's Eleven

730,danny_craven,2 major issues away from a 10,8,17 March 2020,"The film had almost everything . A great plot , witty dialogue , an energetic soundtrack and an unbelievable cast (yes despite Ross' dad). All contributing to an edge of your seat experience .However (spoilers alert) the ending was a major sticking point and contributed to 1.5 of my reduction ,the other 0.5 reduction coming from Don Cheadles terrible Cockney accent. The planning of Ocean and Rusty was so meticulous and intelligent , it makes it very hard to believe that they would take the risk to have Rusty ,who was on the phone to Benedict inside the same robbed Casino, also bumping into Oceana ex-wife (on CCTV) , then go and pick up Ocean from prison with no other than , yes you guessed it , Ocean's ex-wife Tess. And believe it or not they are followed, huge shock.Perhaps this was all one big ploy for a nailed on plot of the second film but I was left thinking it was a great shame , this could have been one of my all time favourites if it hadn't been for a lazy (deliberate or not) ending .However all in all I was left thoroughly entertained , and not many films leave me wanting to write a review .Heck ! maybe that was all one big con to get more people talking about the ending .
Controversy sells after all .",Ocean's Eleven

I really was expecting to enjoy the movie.However, I found it mind-crushingly dull. The film really drags, and I found the whole thing entirely prosaic. Whilst production was slick (as is to be expected) it felt formulaic and sanitised, as did the plot.It was so boring, the ingredients for a good film were there, but the plot just trudged along towards its inevitable conclusion, I never engaged with any of the characters, and ultimately Ocean's 11 seems like the kind of film a computer would make given a stack of statistical data on what joe average likes to see at the movies.I really like action films too, but as far as I am concerned this doesn't even count.",Ocean's Eleven

You'll then want to watch it again and again to the point where its on the TV while you're eating a meal or just relaxing. Its such a good film for people looking for a modern stylish crime capper and it cannot be topped! (Not even by the original). Lets not forget to mention the unbelievable cast that brings actor like Brad Pitt and George Clooney together and in my opinion is both their greatest casted roles in movies.

733,annie_greer103,This film is about a group of men who come up with the idea to rob three of the largest casinos in Las Vegas.,10,12 December 2005,"Cheating the System In Oceans Eleven, cool colors are used throughout the entirety of the film because it helps calm the audience from then building suspense when the colors the actors are wearing are relaxing and soothing and because when the surroundings are not vibrant and explosive the mood seems to change and contradict the plot. However, Julia Roberts character, Tess, her clothing color choices are warm, which reveals the importance of her character.My experience with this film has always been an enjoyable one. I have seen this film on various occasions, my first being at the local movie theater in town. I bought this movie when it first came out onto DVD for my sister. The cool colors that the actors wore, mostly blues and greens and browns, were very soothing to the viewer. The characters had to keep their ""cool"" throughout the film because they had to pull off the impossible feat which was attempting to purloin three huge casinos in Las Vegas. By wearing certain colors they were able to keep the audience under control and not cause any hyperventilation from the insane unending suspense. For example, throughout the planning and the first steps of the actual Bellagio robbery attempt, the characters were faced with a few major dilemmas. After they got the person inside the container and inside the vault, they noticed that the person had placed a briefcase on top of the container, and since his breathing time was running out the other characters were forced to figure out how to get him out of the box, without bumping off the briefcase and without setting off any of the alarms. With the cool color choices, the low key lighting, keeping the scenes darker, and the cool colors, the characters were able to pull it off, without being forced into frantic.The cold colors are not depressing at all due to the contradiction that they served. They were used throughout the film in not only the clothing choices but the scenery as well. All the furniture and props that were used all considered within the cool color range. They were all very relaxing and seemed very comfortable and soul soothing. For example, when they are in the room waiting for everything to follow through with the plan and waiting for the next person to do their part, the room has a ""cool"" feel.However, the cool colors, the blues, greens, and purples, weren't always used appropriately for say through out the film. As previously mentioned Tess's character threw off the serene feel that the other characters were attempting to produce. She was commonly found wearing red. She was drawing attention to herself in hopes to throw off her ex-husband and sidetrack him so that he wouldn't be able to finish his task even though she didn't know exactly what he was up to. She was a symbol of what was at stake for Danny, who was played by George Clooney. He could loose her again if this whole thing flops, conversely he doesn't have her back. Her vibrancy is an obstacle that is being forced upon Danny. The real challenge for Danny may possibly not be to rob the casinos, but to be able to do so without the interference of his ex.The movie Oceans Eleven has an overall uplifting theme that can make anyone smile.",Ocean's Eleven
734,gbfm,Jai ocean 11 summary,9,28 November 2005,"Steven Soderbergh out does himself with the 2001 release of the 1960s remake Ocean's 11. By assembling a dream team of today's hottest actors including George Clooney( reprising the role once played by Frank Sinatra), Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, and Andy Garcia, the movie has fantastic written all over it. Yet the real star of this movie is Las Vegas. The current day decadence of Las Vegas provides for the perfect backdrop and flows so effortlessly into the film it becomes the 12th member of the cast. Ocean's Eleven is a witty film about a casino heist where everything turns out just the way you want it too, even if you need to wait till the end to have everything explained to you. The team of cons are so flamboyant and funny that you forget their criminals. It also does not do any harm that these criminals are very very good looking. Brad Pitt is fabulous in his role as Rusty. Second in command to the plan and Danny, Pitt is fantastic and he played it just right, not overriding George Clooney. All are impeccably entertaining, with witty script, and an even more witty cleverness to their plan. The plot of the film is to pull off robbing three of Las Vegas's biggest casinos on fight night, but what gives the film depth is the charm of George Clooney playing Danny Ocean. This film is a classic heist film wrapped up in a love story. Ocean's 11 is the best way to spend two hours, you become lost in the film mostly due to the extraordinary camera work. Simply stated Oceans 11 is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",Ocean's Eleven
735,clarencebrown,9/10 Good movie,9,18 May 2017,"""Oceans Eleven"" displays multiple cinematic values by delivering an exciting story. Its artistic value comes from great cinematography, as for its literary value ""Oceans Eleven"" accurately and directly takes you through its plot. Throughout the film, Bra Pitt's character, Rusty Ryan, is seen eating something in almost every scene, but with a twist. Each time he's seen eating it's something different. Just something the creators did to throw off continuity. Although the film did pull it off quite well. Educationally the film taught you to not give up if you want something and be ready to work hard. ""Oceans Eleven"" was definitely entertaining. There film is timed well, and seems to flow at a good pace. 9/10 would watch again.",Ocean's Eleven
736,smartzeppelin,very good film,8,15 July 2017,The cast is almost all big names. It's great to see actors like Pitt and Clooney and Damon come together in a movie.The plot keeps you to the end. A lot of laugh.I highly suggest this film,Ocean's Eleven
737,trntoo,amazing movie,10,5 November 2005,"this movie is great. amazing script, great directing by Soderburgh, all star cast, flawless camera angles, and interesting finish to the movie is what makes this movie a 10. the cast in this movie contains household names such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Eddie Jemison, Matt Damon, and many others. ocean's eleven is a blueprint for any movie. the way that the director and everybody else wrapped up this movie is mind blowing. you sit there afterward thinking, ""I had no idea. How did they think of that."" Whenever critics say that a movie is a ""roller coaster ride"" I think the movie is far from that. But this movie really is a roller coaster ride. You never know what will happen next. Watching this movie once is not enough. To really appreciate it, you need to watch this movie at least two or three times. You pick up things that you wouldn't have noticed the first time around. although it was made four years ago, ocean's eleven will be remembered for years to come.",Ocean's Eleven
738,perry_mason_i,The Hitchhikers Guide to rob a Casino....or should i say CasinoS,8,17 March 2006,"This movie is simply awesome..now, i don't associate the word awesome with any movie i come across, but the story line of Ocean's 11 rocks. The star cast is quite impressive and the acting is kinda fresh..loads of comedy and a lot of moments where the movie makes you think..""How the F*** did they do that""!! Clooney's acting as Danny Ocean is quite impressive, but i think Brad Pitt was wasted as Rusty Ryan. Andy Garcia handled the role of Terry Benedict quite nicely. Now coming to the plot..Las Vegas is the gambling hot-spot of the world..and the sort of money that flows in and out of the casinos is in millions..the sort of money everyone dreams of. Eleven guys decide to rob three of the largest casinos in Las Vegas with the help of a 'Pinch', a High Flying Chinese boy and yes..lots of smart talk..I won't spoil your fun by telling you whether they succeed or not...this movie is definitely worth a watch. Highly recommended. 8.5/10",Ocean's Eleven
739,mirovoi,Why people like this trash? What is the supposed moral here?,1,6 February 2018,"It's been a long time since I was disguisted by a film so much. I sorely regret almost 2 hours of my time spent on watching this ****, and am writing this review only to warn curious people to stay away from this garbage.Put simply, this film has zero suspense, zero surprises and it gets zero sympathy from me. The characters are the worst - they are a bunch of arrogant, rich con-men who decide to steal a ton of money from the casino vault. That's it. Just because they want and they can. They design and execute an elaborate plan, and of course they win and, as the ending suggests, live happily ever after. No regret, no second thoughts, just happiness from stealing millions from casino employees - dealers, guards, cooks and all the rest who work there, because it's them who will get the cut to recoup the casino losses. Benedict (the casino owner) will restore his wealth, he's a rich guy anyway, but the majority who work at casinos won't be so lucky. Their lives will be ruined, just because some criminals decided to have fun and steal millions of their dollars, all sitting conveniently in a vault.The cast is really spectacular, but it can't save this film. It has absolutely atrocious moral message, it is boring and predictable and I honestly can't imagine who might like this, let alone recommend this ""masterpiece"" to others. Apparently, crime does pay - it has paid for ""heroes"" of this movie without any repercussions, and it has paid for the director, who swindled millions out of pockets of moviegoers with this turd.",Ocean's Eleven

742,jebabcock00,Tasty Treat That Leaves You Hungry,6,10 June 2006,"After having seen this movie more than eight times (not by choice), I've come to realize that the original lukewarm reviews I read were correct: this film is not much better than mediocre. That's not to say that the film is terribleit's notor that you shouldn't watch ityou shouldbut rather that it has many flaws, some of them glaring.Ask most people why they saw the movie, and they'll say something like ""It has George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it,"" or ""It has Julia Roberts in it,"" or ""Stephen Soderbergh directed it."" Ocean's Eleven is a ""People"" magazine reader's dream come true. So many celebrities in one movie: what bliss! The point is that Ocean's Eleven is not meant to be strong on character or plot; it's meant to be strong on Star Power. In fact, it's surprising that there is a plot, such as it is. It follows the new Blockbuster code: Hot Bad Guys who are actually Good Guys want to steal money from crooked, mean Big Businessman; they make elaborate plans, use fancy equipment, and ultimatelybut we all know the ending. Soderbergh may court the strange, the offbeat, the underbelly of society, but he also knows that when making an action movie one should not deviate too much from the tried-and-true. He gives us what we want, and more.George Clooney and Brad Pitt as Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan, respectively, are the most likable of the bunch. They have a rapport that either is natural, or was rehearsed so effectively and so well that it became natural. They're like Laurel and Hardy, only with stubble and expensive suits. They eat each other's lines, insult each other, show off in front of each otherin some ways they're a more compelling couple than Clooney and Roberts.Incidentally, Julia Roberts, apparently confusing Tess Ocean with Erin Brockovich, gives an intensity to her role of The Chick that is entirely inappropriate. This is an action movie, not a chance to win another Oscar. She delivers lines like she's chopping onions: short, quick, and full of force. Of course, her dramatic skill is unquestionable, but in this case a lighter touch would have been more fitting. I can understand her desire, if she had it, of wanting to give more weight to her role as Clooney's ex-wife and Andy Garcia's new girlfriend; it must be frustrating to be a piece of meat that men fight over. But she should have been more perceptive of the movie's genre and its requirements. In action movies, chicks should look hot and be tough; not much more is (usually) required.The fact is, we hardly ever think of Roberts, or any of the other Big Names, as anything but who they are off the set. Although Garcia calls Roberts ""Tess"" several times, somehow the name always rings false. The other cast members, being less famous, have the advantage of being able to play their characters more convincingly.This movie was a remake of another all-star movie made in 1960. (I've been unable to see more than snippets, and since I currently live out of the US I'm not able to rent it.) Most reviews refer to this previously made film, but the fact is that Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven is its own entity. We should judge it not based on its predecessor, but on its own meritsunfortunately too few.When I first saw this movie, it was dubbed in Spanish, and I thought it was well made, well acted, and generally better than most action movies. (Of course, I was on a date at the time, so I wasn't scrutinizing every detail.) Upon subsequent viewing, however, this movie's imperfections only become more glaring. It's too bad. Although you won't think you've wasted two hours if you watch it for the first time, this movie is not one that you'll return to over and over againthat kind of film where each time you see it you discover more of the director's ingenuity, or the actors' skill, or the screenwriter's craft. This movie is good for a quick laugh and a thrill, but, like cake, it's not ultimately what will satisfy your hunger.",Ocean's Eleven
743,perusbaltero-1,Ocean's eleven is the coolest movie on earth!,8,7 March 2006,"Ocean's eleven is very entertaining and easy to watch. Even on the 2nd or 3rd time you watch it, it will be as funny and clever as on your first time. Still it won't rise up to be one of movie history classics because of it's lack of character personalities. The viewer must use his/her own imagination to create a character profile for each role in the movie. This could also be a good thing but in this particular film, it makes the atmosphere a bit cold and far-fetched. Enjoyable film though!And Ocean's twelve then...? I won't even go there, they should have ended it on one film",Ocean's Eleven
744,milostomko,Can't stop re-watching this movie!,8,23 February 2019,"This movie is definitely my favourite movie of all time. The actors chosen for the roles of Danny Ocean, Rusty Ryan and all the other members were so perfectly chosen, i can't imagine any other actors for their roles.This movie will never get too old for me too watch.My reason this movie stuck out to me is the actors did a great job acting as someone that was actually pulling a job, usually these movies are unrealistic about the crews confidence when in real life they would be sweating bullets. The music also gave it a very nice touch.I'm actually going to go watch the movie now.",Ocean's Eleven
