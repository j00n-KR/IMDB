0,Leofwine_draca,Overrated Hollywood horror - take away the superficiality and it's bare beneath,4,27 July 2016,"OCULUS is a Hollywood blockbuster about a haunted mirror that drives the owner to homicidal urges - a topic previously explored in the likes of the Ealing classic DEAD OF NIGHT and the Amicus chiller FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. Unfortunately, this version is saddled with a clever-clever script that focuses far too much on telling the story through a mix of present-day scenes and flashback footage, constantly cutting between the two to make a thoroughly confusing - not to mention convoluted - tale.The problem with OCULUS is that if you take away all the flashback stuff and clever editing then you're left with a straightforward and rather uneventful type of horror film. This is a movie that relies too much on familiar jump scenes and shocks instead of trying to genuinely frighten the viewer. I found it to be overrated and stylistically lacking. It also doesn't help that the two protagonists have the dullest, most self-centred characters, particularly the annoying brother. As for former DR WHO assistant Karen Gillan, she's certainly pretty but her 'acting' consists of reciting dialogue in an American accent with all of the inflection and feeling of an assembly-line automaton. She's very poor, topping off a disappointing film overall.",Oculus
1,SnoopyStyle,nice moody horror,7,27 June 2016,"Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) gets released from a mental hospital. Eleven years earlier, his parents (Katee Sackhoff, Rory Cochrane) get a mysterious mirror. His father supposedly tortured and killed his mother. In the present, his sister Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) rediscovers the mirror. Tim has only fragmentary memories of the incident. Kaylie aims to prove the murderous supernatural nature of the mirror. Michael Dumont (James Lafferty) is Kaylie's boss at the auction house and her boyfriend.This movie has great moodiness. Much of it is due to the cold look and the vibrating sound design. Gillan is great. There is real tension about memories and reality when Tim disagrees with Kaylie. It's an old fashion horror like a ghost story told by the camp fire. It is expertly revealed. Everybody including the kids are great. The last act does get a little muddled as it tries to ramp up the excitement while trying to wind down the plot. It would have been great to have Gillan continue as the lead as the franchise inevitably continues.",Oculus
2,Prismark10,All seeing eye,6,6 June 2015,"Oculus involves the horror staple of a haunted even a demonic thing. In this case a mirror. It could be a hotel (The Shining) or a room (1408).Kaylie and Tim Russell are brother and sister with a traumatic past. Tim has just been released from a mental institution for killing his father. The father went crazy, tortured and killed his mother. Kaylie believes that the antique mirror in their home somehow possessed their parents to make them do evil things. She has looked into the history of the mirror and found out that previous owners all met strange endings.Kaylie has tracked down the mirror and brought it to the family home and rigged the house with all sorts of cameras, lights and other scientific instruments. She plans with her brother to destroy the malevolent mirror but Tim who has had years of therapy now remembers the past differently and is sceptical of Kaylie's story of the haunted mirror.However we see in flashbacks what happened to the Russells and the mirror is playing its tricks both in the past and present.The film is not original but mixes its ingredient well. Good acting from both the older and younger Russell siblings, lots of eeriness and some chills here and there.Why Kaylie after all these years starts messing around with the possessed mirror is a question in itself. Surely she cannot expect to win?",Oculus
3,claudio_carvalho,Madness and Possession,6,4 July 2014,"The twenty-one year-old Timothy ""Tim"" Allen Russell (Brenton Thwaites) is discharged from a mental institution by his psychiatric Dr. Shawn Graham (Miguel Sandoval) completely healed from a childhood trauma. His sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan) welcomes him in the parking area and brings him home. Then she tells that they need to destroy an ancient mirror that she has just bought in an auction. The reluctant Tim follows his sister and has fragmented recollections from his childhood, when his mother Marie (Katee Sackhoff) buys a mirror for the home office of his father Alan (Rory Cochrane). Kaylie (Annalise Basso) and Tim (Garrett Ryan) see a woman with their father in his office and the behaviors of Alan and Marie change, ending in a family tragedy. Kaylie blames the mirror and now she wants to destroy it with Tim. Will they succeed?""Oculus"" is a horror movie with a story of madness and possession that deserved to be better written. The plot in the past with the Allen Russell family is interesting, but the story in the present days should have been better written. Kaylie knows how dangerous the indestructible mirror is and her explanations of the reason for destroying the mirror with Tim does not convince. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Espelho"" (""The Mirror"")",Oculus

Tim was the trigger man who killed his dad, although the kids have a memory of a haunted mirror that controlled their family.Tim has had therapy and wants to move on and ""protect his recovery"" as he can now finally remember he pulled the trigger. Kaylie is compulsive obsessive and insists the mirror is to blame. She goes to great lengths to set up a controlled experiment to prove the mirror is the culprit. Tim is not eager. They have slightly different memories as to what happened.Their past is presented as a subplot. An hour into the film, you realize that there were things that went on in the household that might be misinterpret by children, yet at the same time there are things going on in the present that don't add up. Is it imagination? Insanity? Supplanted memory? Or is the mirror really haunted?The film combines several old themes to give us something that seems refreshingly new. Well done all the way around. Good horror build up.Parental Guide: Some muttered F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",Oculus
5,kosmasp,Another Ghost story?,9,2 November 2014,"No it's not really. There is a very neat hint early in the film involving hair, that if you catch it (well you will after reading this), you will look differently on the movie. At least you could, if you wanted to. And I'm pretty certain, that was more than intentional! Nice little detail from the director! I'm not gonna spoil anything more, but the movie works with looks and appearances. It also jumps time-line wise to show us what happened in the past ... and then twists that whole thing.It has moments of horror and while there is a cliché thrown in here and there, it really is the story and the way it is told that will take you on a suspenseful ride. Image is important, also what we see or think we see ... plus what is the one thing that a mirror does? And the movie builds on that and some of our expectations ... well done!",Oculus
6,jboothmillard,Oculus,6,5 November 2014,"I remember hearing the title for the film, I didn't really know anything about its story or plot, but I heard about the leading actress and that it had some positive feedback by critics, so I was hoping I would like it too. Basically the film has two stories taking place at the same time, in the past eleven years earlier, and in the present day, the two plot lines are told parallel with each other through flashbacks. In 2002, software engineer Alan Russell (Rory Cochrane) moves with his wife Marie (Katee Sackhoff), ten year old son Tim (Garrett Ryan) and twelve year old Kaylie (Annalise Basso) move into a new house, and Alan purchases an antique mirror for his office decoration, this mirror is supernatural and malevolent, creating hallucinations, with Marie seeing her body decay and Alan seduced by ghostly woman Marisol Chavez (Kate Siegel). Over time the parents become psychotic, Alan isolating himself in his office and Marie withdrawing and paranoid, also plants die and the family dog disappears, hearing of Alan's seduction with Marisol is when Marie goes insane and attempts to kill the children, she is restrained in chains to the wall. Then over a period of time food runs out, the neighbours who the children ask for help do not believe their stories, calls to doctors and authorities do not either, as the same man answers all of them, then one night Marie is unchained, both parents attempt to attack the children, Marie comes to her sense for a moment, before Alan kills her with a gun, he then tells Tim to shoot him dead, following this Tim is taken into custody, he and Kaylie promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror. In the present day, Tim (Maleficent's Brenton Thwaites) is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, believing no supernatural forces caused the death of the parents, Kaylie (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan) meanwhile has been studying most of the time the history of the mirror, including lives and deaths of all who owned it, and working at an auction house she finds it. The mirror is taken to the family home where Kaylie places surveillance camera and an anchor weighted to the ceiling set on a time to drop and smash the mirror, before destroying the mirror she wants to document its powers to prove the supernatural forces and clear the family name. Tim joins her sister at the house, but tries to convince her that she is trying to rationalise that the death of the parents was caused by an external force, they argue during an evening, but he becomes convinced and accepts the mirror is powerful when it moves the placed cameras and rearranges things in the room, they do try to escape, but the mirror's power continues to stop them. They try to call the police, but the voice they recognise as being the same for all calls is the one who answers, Kaylie accidentally kills her fiancé when she thinks she sees her mother's ghost, she and Tim also see apparitions of all the previous owners of the mirror who have been killed. In the end Kaylie is drawn to the dead mother beckoning her, and in the same moment Tim activates the ""kill switch"", dropping the anchor however it also impales his sister, the police arrive and arrest him, he insists ""the mirror did it"", as he is taken away he sees the ghosts of his parents and Kaylie watching from the house. Also starring James Lafferty as Michael Dumont and Miguel Sandoval as Dr. Shawn Graham. Gillan does a really good American accent, and Thwaites is pretty good also, you have to pay attention to the intertwining story lines going on, you get the gist of the evil mirror, I was hoping for a bit more gore, but the dark psychological tension and creepy ghoulish images and possessions are interesting, a worthwhile horror. Good!",Oculus
7,BA_Harrison,Need a mirror? Buy a NEW one.,5,8 July 2014,"As any seasoned horror movie fan will attest, it is never a great idea to buy an antique mirror, the reflective surface being the ideal home for an ancient evil. It makes even less sense to purchase such an item when you know for sure that something nasty is lurking behind the glass, eager to cause misery and pain—which is one of the main reasons why Oculus, from director Mike Flanagan (Absentia), doesn't quite succeed.Pretty redhead Kaylie Russell (ex-Dr. Who assistant Karen Gillan) purchases an ornate mirror, despite being fully aware of the centuries old evil within, in a misconceived effort to try and prove that her parents died by supernatural causes. In the company of her brother Tim (Brenton Thwaites), who has just been released from a mental institution, she spends an evening with the mirror, hoping to record some evidence of the malevolent force. Needless to say, it all goes horribly wrong.Now if it had been me, I would have just let some other sucker buy the mirror, and possibly inform the new owner of its horrible history. Buying the mirror myself would be extremely low on my agenda (on a par with moving into the Amityville house and laying my hands on a Lament Configuration). It's extremely hard to feel sorry for someone as stupid as Kaylie, who deliberately puts both herself and her brother in mortal danger.Kaylie's extremely poor decision-making makes matters hard to swallow, but the film also suffers from a few other impossible-to-ignore weaknesses that also serve to make it an unsatisfying watch overall. Based on an earlier short film by Flanagan, Oculus is drawn out to a whopping 104 minutes and really drags in places. There's a diabolical central performance from Gillan, whose dreadful American accent and silly hair-do makes her extremely irritating (and this is coming from someone who ranks Gillan as the tastiest of all Dr. Who's many assistants). The film is also short on decent scares, lacking in gore, and completely devoid of nudity (let's face it, this film gives male Gillan fans very little to get excited about).The non-linear structure of the film, which sees the narrative flipping back and forth between the past to the present, is well-handled, and the brooding minimalistic electronic score adds atmosphere to proceedings, but as an exercise in pure terror, Oculus is a disappointing addition to the haunted mirror horror sub-genre.",Oculus
8,paul_haakonsen,Predictable and not one bit scary...,4,25 July 2014,"""Oculus"" is a fairly slow paced horror movie that comfortably settles into that slow pace right from the beginning and then never really accelerates. That being said, then it is not actually a bad thing, because that slow pace does add an element of oddity to the movie.What didn't really go well with me in this movie was its predictability. You saw things coming a mile away, and that left out some rather great moments that could have become scare moments or moments to throw the storyline way off the predictable course it was heading down.The acting in the movie was one of the brighter points throughout the movie, because for a horror movie then ""Oculus"" was horribly devoid of scary moments and things that will make you check twice under the bed or curl up when something sounds in the hallway.The storyline did have some adequate moments. And I did like the thing about the entire 'haunting' or whatever it was, taking place around an object; in this case the old mirror.And the camera-work throughout the movie was quite good as well, sort of had that feeling like the audience was right there in the house with the brother and sister. And the intermingling and switching between the present and past was also a great touch to the movie.Just a shame that the movie was so predictable and anything less than scary. As such, ""Oculus"" scores a mere 4 out of 10 stars from me. It really did have potential, but director Mike Flanagan really didn't fully extract all that this movie could have been.I am sure that it is scary for a younger audience, but for someone as hardened and seasoned to horror movies as me, then this was a mere dipping of the toes into the sea of horror.",Oculus
9,Quinoa1984,"messes with your head, until it doesn't, but a good movie",7,28 April 2016,"You know what makes Oculus stand out? That scene about 20 minutes in, maybe more or less, when we're seeing a particular flashback with the father (played by a stone-cold Rory Cochrane, kind of underrated in general and does well here), where he has a rather irritating finger problem. He bites his nails, but this one seems a little more... unwieldy. He takes a pair of pliers to take off a band-aid around his finger that he put there due to the finger bleeding too much. He finally pulls off the band-aid and it hurts like a SOB. And it turns out he actually pulled off his own fingernail (or most of it), and it necessitates another band-aid. Will he need more? Very likely if he stays in that room he's set up as his study with that damn mirror.The premise and how much of Oculus unfolds has a different edge to it than a lot of other haunted house movies, which over the past several years have seem to flood movie theaters and mostly to lesser results (so many carbon copies of things, to the point of Haunting in Connecticut 2 Ghosts of Georgia, but I digress). This is closer to something that maybe Edgar Allan Poe might try to write if he were a screenwriter trying to hack a living in the industry; what makes the mind go absolutely ape-s***, what you really can't trust with your own mind, is what makes for the most terrifying imagery. And while the filmmakers can't help but put a few ghosts of the dead that this demonic mirror has wrought, they're used judiciously.It's also commendable that this could've possibly been at least half of a found footage movie and it's not; in the present timeline we're following a brother and sister (Gillan, who talks often with a clipped, fast tone as Kaylie and Thwaites as Tim), the former having just been released from a mental institution where he's been since the deaths of their parents. But now that he's out it's time for Kaylie to put a plan into motion: bring back the mirror to the place it was before, set up two cameras plus go-pros on the ceiling to record everything happening, and make sure objects are in place to prove that this thing is doing evil madness and murder. Oh, and there's a fail-safe: if all else doesn't work, a giant scythe comes down to smash the mirror (as long as it doesn't control their minds TOO much, which is a possibility).I think I just really admired the way that the filmmakers, for the first two thirds at least, showed us how these characters - the mother (the great Katee Sackhoff in red hair!), father, sister and brother - in the past and the present could be so easily affected by the mirror (why the kids aren't quite as affected as the grown-ups is hard to say, script convenience that I can let by mostly). A good deal of the trickery is really akin to watching people have a bad acid trip - biting into apples that aren't apples, though they are - and it even brought to mind the scariest parts of The Shining, which is all about mind-f***ery on a high level. The direction is controlled and tight, and for a while the inter-cutting between the childhood and adult versions of the brother and sister work as a clever device both for advancing the stories and playing tricks in the present form from the past one.There does come a point where, unfortunately, it stopped working for me as well as it was doing. This form of inter-cutting can be inventive, but by a certain point it felt less organic to the storytelling and more of a stylistic tic, and the ending is unfulfilling not because it's (sort of) expected, but because it never stops trying to make the parallels and it becomes too much. Nevertheless, there's a lot of especially good horror filmmaking here that builds more on the mounting tension and morbidity of the characters' downfalls (the parents mostly in the past, which becomes more interesting as it goes along), and for at least 75 of the 105 minutes of this film it's among the better works of recent memory. It could work as a good 2nd movie on a double bill with The Conjuring.",Oculus
10,Coventry,Evil Mirror on the Wall haven't we already seen it all?,5,4 August 2017,"I guess I should commence by stating that supernatural ghost/evil entity tales aren't really my favorite type of horror. I do respect the classics (""The Haunting"", ""The Innocents"", ""The Others"") and to a certain degree appreciated a couple of more recent titles (""The Conjuring"", ""The Orphanage"") but I won't pro-actively seek out every new and critically acclaimed genre entry. Around the time of its release, I heard and read many good things about ""Oculus"" - even from people whose tastes and opinions I usually agree with – but still I didn't feel rushed to watch it. Mike Flanagan's film is a respectable and reasonably intelligent effort, but you can't deny it suffers from the three major clichés that practically all ghost movies suffer from. Number one: the film relies too much on a handful of very effective but nevertheless isolated and predictable jump-scares, like sudden appearances of ghastly creatures with evil eyes. Number two: almost from the beginning already, you just know that the story will end with one poor and innocent character getting blamed for everything that has happened, simply because all the supernatural stuff can't be proved. Number three: barely two or three days after you finished watching ""Oculus"", you'll already have difficulties remembering what the story was about. That doesn't mean the film is inferior, it simply means that it can't distinguish itself enough from the vast overload of similarly themed stories. There are definitely a few bright and inventive ideas in Flanagan's script. Karen Gillan's character, for example, is extremely well- developed. She's the devoted sister of a young man wrongly sent to a mental institution for the horrid crimes that were actually committed by an evil entity that homes in an antique mirror. 12 years later the girl, Kaylie Russell, purchases that same mirror via an auction and makes obsessive preparations to evoke the evil entity and thus prove her brother's innocence. Karen Gillan's performance is truly remarkable and her meticulously developed plans to play cat-and-mouse with supernatural forces are more disturbing than the evil mirror itself.",Oculus
11,michaelRokeefe,A calculating and clever mind game.,6,4 August 2016,"Mike Flanagan's OCULUS gives our thoughts something familiar to focus on and then the small details turn things a bit askew. This movie is slow burning and moody. A couple of young adults, Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites)and his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan) are still mystified by their patents death. It has been a decade and Kaylie is more of a hands-on thinker, while her brother is the typical skeptic. She is strong in her belief that an antique mirror is to blame some how for her parent's demise. She is determined to prove it. A haunted mirror; this is enough to have you brace yourself and let your skin tingle.Other members of the cast: Katee Sackoff, Rory Cochrane, Garrett Ryan, Miguel Sandavol and Kate Siegel.",Oculus
12,utgard14,Disappointing,5,20 July 2014,"I'm kind of bummed about this one. I looked forward to this movie for awhile. We haven't had a really good horror movie in what seems like forever. Plus I liked the cast, especially Karen Gillan and Katee Sackhoff. Unfortunately it was a pretty uneventful movie with a familiar plot, clichéd characters, and not a single scare to be had. Interesting at times but way too slow. It will turn off those with little patience. It's predictable, too, so after all the slowness you feel a little cheated that the payoff isn't better. It's perfectly watchable but sadly not much more than that. Amy Pond and Starbuck fans will still want to see it.",Oculus
13,zardoz-13,Spooky Saga!!!,8,14 April 2014,"Although it's more fresh than original, ""Oculus"" qualifies as a subtle but spooky supernatural saga. This creepy, complicated, psychological horror chiller casts an ordinary, everyday piece of household furniture as the source of all Evil. You may have one in your home, office, and/or car. Horror thrillers have appropriated virtually everything inanimate and transformed them—houses, cars, beds, bulldozers, condoms, toys, etc.--into murderous machines. The addition of mirrors should surprise nobody. This notorious object has been killing people as well as their pets for centuries with nobody the wiser about it. Actually, this isn't the first time Hollywood has employed mirrors other than to offer the latest updates as in Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" The Karen Black nail-biter ""Mirror Mirror"" (1990) represented an early example of evil mirror melodramas. A high school teenage girl summoned ghostly energy from a mirror to deal with obnoxious girls bullying her. Later, the Kiefer Sutherland thriller ""Mirrors"" (2008) appropriated mirrors with ghostly powers. Basically, there are three kinds of evil mirror movies. First, the owner of the mirror calls the shots. Second, the mirror from Hell takes everything back to Hell. Third, the mirror adopts other corporeal characteristics. In other words, the mirror shape-shifts into man or beast and leaves the wall where it is hanging on to create terror. Mind you, the malevolent mirror in ""Oculus"" doesn't kill its victims by shape-shifting into something larger. Here, we have an evil as impassive as it is impersonal. In fact, the mirror does nothing but hang on the wall. Gaze into this wicked mirror, and you're not going to be the same! The mirror exerts an eerie effect on individuals. Everything turns into something else. After you peer into this mirror, you find it difficult to distinguish between reality and fantasy. ""Absentia"" director Mike Flanagan generates more than enough dread despite this preposterous but audacious premise. ""Oculus"" contains scenes that will make the hair on the nape of your neck and forearms levitate. Unmistakably, the setting and the storyline give away the film's modest $5 million budget. Flanagan confines the mayhem primarily to the confines of a house with some exterior jaunts to various, peripheral locations. More importantly, Flanagan forges sympathetic characters in the crucible of this mesmerizing melodrama who maintain our interest throughout its 105 minute running time. The leads are attractive, and we want them to succeed in their cosmic battle between Good and Evil. Compared with mega-budgeted horror pictures, ""Oculus"" appears minor in many respects. Nothing in the form of either savage beasts or exotic creatures emerges from the mirror to eviscerate our hero and heroine. Indeed, some abhorrent things occur, but nothing that will afflict you with nightmares. You'll be able to sleep with your lights off after dark. This unsettling, R-rated saga doesn't wallow in blood and gore. Flanagan creates terror in your mind without crossing the line with gutsy, gross-out, gore moments. Make no mistake, people are slashed and bled, but ""Oculus"" is neither ""Alien"" nor ""Predator."" Ultimately, despite its small-budget, low-wattage cast, and nominal gore effects, ""Oculus"" makes the grade because we care about the protagonists—two siblings--who have set out to expose that infamous mirror as a mass murderer!""Oculus"" combines characteristics of haunted house movies (think ""The Shining"" and ""The Amityville Horror"") with found footage flicks, such as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. Most of the action occurs in a single house where two siblings, Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites of ""Blue Lagoon: The Awakening"") and Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan of the BBC's ""Doctor Who""), grew up together and witnessed the deaths of their mother and father. Flanagan complicates this chronicle by presenting not only a contemporary story line about the siblings as adults, but also as adolescents in an alternate flashback, so we experience what they saw in their youth. Essentially, Tim saw his father kill his mother, Marie (Katee Sackhoff of ""Riddick"") so he shot his father Alan (Rory Cochrane of ""Dazed and Confused"") and killed him. Since the incident, Tim has spent ten years in a mental hospital recuperating from the nightmare. Since he has just turned age twenty-one, Tim is released because the doctors don't believe he constitutes a threat. Meanwhile, Tim's obsessive sister, Kaylie, who is two years older, has been working at an art auction house. She picks Tim up after he is discharged, but he refuses to stay with Kaylie and her fiancé, Michael Dumont (James Lafferty of ""S. Darko""), who works with her at the auction house. Instead, he prefers to chill out in a motel. Later, Tim learns is that Kaylie has obtained the opulent 400-year old mirror that once hung in their father's office. Furthermore, she has taken it back to the house where their parents died and placed it in the room that served as their father's study. If this weren't enough, Kaylie has assembled a sophisticated array of gadgetry, including video cameras, sound detection equipment, and temperature monitors. She behaves like one of the ""Ghostbusters"" but with a straight face. She is determined to prove that Evil lurks in the mirror and brought about tragic consequences not only for her family but others, too. In this respect, ""Oculus"" resembles a found footage flick. She believes that she can expose Evil and destroy it with one striking blow. Unfortunately, the chief problem with ""Oculus"" is that we never learn what prompted the antique mirror to embark on its reign of evil and what lies behind it.The performances are good. Karen Gillan is especially forthright in her naivety that she can defeat Evil. Brenton Thwaites is almost as good as her cautionary little brother. Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff make a believable couple. The pacing is even, but you may jump occasionally at some sudden visual revelation. As it turns out, Flanagan expanded ""Oculus"" from his half-hour short film Oculus Chapter 3: The Man with the Plan."" ""Oculus"" qualifies as an above-average reflection about mortality.",Oculus
14,oscaralbert,Lesson #1: Don't change light bulbs . . .,8,13 April 2014,". . . while munching on an apple. Is OCULUS some sort of subtle cerebral exercise in horror, such as novelist Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW? Heck no! These movie makers apparently don't even know that an ""oculus"" is a rain circle in the roof of an ancient building, such as the Pantheon in Rome--NOT a mirror! But while the movie OCULUS is not a Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE-like slasher flick, fright newbies will be forced to avert their eyes from the big screen more than once while viewing all its oral mayhem. (Helpful tip: do NOT see this show the night before a dental check-up.) This is the rare scare fest that's actually somewhat different from the run-of-the-mill Fright Nighter. The casting and the musical score both fit this story very well. All good horror flicks have a moral, and in this one the shoplifting employee gets her just desserts. Therefore, the bosses of minimum wage earners should schedule morale-boosting group outings to see OCULUS (since their workers might not be able to afford going on their own dime). Though there's a lot to be said for a proper fear of God, the all-seeing omnipotent mirror on your wall (equated here with today's closed-circuit TV employer ""spy cam"" culture) has something going for it as well.",Oculus

16,view_and_review,Oculus is Ordinary,6,1 November 2014,"Every once in a while there is a movie with a one word title that interests me. The movie doesn't necessarily interest me but the title does due to its strangeness or rarity, such as Maleficent and Elysium. Oculus was one such title. I found that it means an eye or a circular opening, especially one at the apex of a dome. I'm sure there are plenty of others out there who already knew the meaning; I admit my ignorance.As for the movie, it was somewhat interesting as well. A mirror, or the oculus in this case, contained a spirit, ghost or entity. Two adult siblings who were afflicted by this thing as kids have now reunited to uncover its truths and destroy it.This was a scary movie of the paranormal kind with the paranormal entity causing its prey to see, hear and believe what it wanted. In other words, there was no way to know what was real or an illusion as the spirit played its game. The movie provided some scares and tense moments, but this type of scary movie is not my cup of tea. If the afflicted can't discern what's real or fake then I, as the viewer, can't discern what's real or fake and that bothers me. Eventually you get to a point in which you are questioning what really happened. Now, some movies can pull that off well but I was in no mood for the mind games in this one.Oculus was like any other scary movie featuring a haunted item or device. At first it starts off subtle then ramps up its attack full board to an all out assault. Why do they do that anyway? I mean, if your goal is to kill, possess, or otherwise, why not just do that from the start? Why waste time with noises, misplaced items, faulty electricity, etc.? Oh right! Then we wouldn't have a movie. Well, if you watch this, prepare for routine in scary movies of the paranormal genre.Oculus did do one thing a bit differently. The movie featured parallel stories; one story was of the two siblings as adults and the other was of them as kids. It was incredibly confusing at the beginning then it became clearer. The goal was to show their encounter with the mirror as kids which laid the groundwork for their actions as adults. Yes, it added a somewhat unique wrinkle but not enough to propel it into the horror movie hall of fame.",Oculus
17,neil-476,A solid entry,8,19 June 2014,"Kaylie welcomes her brother back into her life when he is released from a mental facility after shooting their father when they were children. Kaylie believes that this tragic incident occurred because of the malign supernatural influence of an antique mirror, and she is all prepared for Tim to take part in the elaborate preparations she has made to fight the mirror on its own terms. Tim, on the other hand, has had 11 years of therapy to convince him that the supernatural aspects didn't really exist.This psychological horror story contains no huge surprises, but is well done, with an interesting crossplay between past and present. It has a creepy atmosphere, mostly steers clear of loud noises to make you jump (although it does have its share of bass rumbles indicating impending bad stuff), but this doesn't mean you won't jump at all. It features a small cast in good performances: Annalise Basso and Garret Ryan as the young Kaylie and Tim are both excellent, and Karen Gillan, in her first film as headliner, shows that she has every chance of going far beyond Doctor Who.For a small cast and a limited location, this film was structured well and was very effective.

18,morrison-dylan-fan,Mirror Mirror on the wall.,10,17 June 2014,"After having a really terrible week which led to me not watching anything at all,I decided to try and kick-start things by paying a visit to the local cinema.With being pretty keen in getting shaken up with some good shocks,I was happy to see a Horror movie which I've heard quite a bit about has just reached the big screen,which led to me taking a look in the oculus mirror.The plot:Revealing to his councillor that his recurring dream has altered so that he is the one who shot his dad,the councillor decides that after 11 years,Tim Russell is now of sound mind,and can now return to society.Being desperate for Russell to gradually enter society again,the councillor arranges for Tim's sister Kaylie to look after him.Just before she heads off to meet Tim,Kaylie witnesses an auction taking place in her workplace for a large,old mirror (which contains a dent in the corner.) Meeting Tim,Kaylie reveals that 'everything is in place' and that they will at last destroy the thing which ripped their family apart.Taking Tim back to the family home, (which no one else has stepped in,let alone buy,over the last 11 years!)Kaylie announces that she has gotten hold of the old family mirror,(thanks to stretching the truth with her work mates) and that she is going to get all of the proof needed that the mirror is haunted,and that its contents led to their parents going insane.Initially dismissing his sister's plan as nothing but a desperate make believe,Tim soon discovers that the reflection in the mirror is not of his own.View on the film:Staying away from over exaggerating the title's most blood-drenched moments,co-writer/ (along with Jeff Seidman) director Mike Flanagan takes an brittle (mostly) realistic approach with the terror in the film,with Flanagan placing the audience uncomfortably close to the Russell's moments of pain,so that the viewer feels with unflinching force the violence (which includes a number of unrelenting man-on- woman violence) inflicted on the Russell family.Putting the mirror at the centre of the title,Flanagan and cinematographer Michael Fimognari brew a mysterious horror atmosphere by giving the movie a reflected appearance,with an early tracking shot reflecting later events in a subtle manner,being matched by Fimognari and Flanagan showing that not every reflection is actually real.Covering an 11 year period,Jeff seidman and Mike Flanagan smartly run the past and present plots in parallel lines,so that the character's question on reality is matched by the audience.Gradually releasing the full contents of the mirror,the writers contrast the film's more supernatural moments with a disturbing domestic horror that the young Tim and Kaylie face.Despite both plot lines individually featuring some noticeable flaws, (just break the dam thing!,and on the domestic front,the dad 'changes' so fast that the audience is unable to get any warmth from the character) combined,they create a superbly sharp Supernatural Domestic Horror.Bravely showing that she's unafraid with looking rancid (thanks to expertly done make up effects) Katee Sackhoff gives an excellent performance Marie Russell,with Sackhoff showing Marie's smile fade away,as she starts to see the full extent of the horror that her husband has allowed into the house.Playing brother & sister instead of the traditional 'lovers' route,Karen Gillan (who also does a pretty good fake US accent) and Brenton Thwaites both give great performances,with Gillan showing Kaylie's mind to gradually crack as she gets closer to her revenge,whilst an uneasy Thwaites brilliantly shows Tim facing a psychological horror,as he looks into the mirror to find out who is the fairest one of all.",Oculus
19,anaconda-40658,Seven Years Bad Luck.,7,24 September 2015,"Oculus (2013): Dir: Mike Flanagan / Cast: Karen Gillan. Brenton Thwaites, Rory Cochrane, Katee Sackhoff, James Lafferty: Horror film about reality and fantasy. This one regards some sort of possessed mirror that is responsible for the death of the parents of siblings. It stars Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites as the siblings. He is just getting out of the crazy house. He apparently shot his possessed father in self defence after his possessed father slapped a dog collar on his mother and chained her up in the bedroom. Yes, the mother is possessed too and it's all the fault of this mirror. Why this mirror is possessed is never explained but a background is given when the sister gives a video discussion with regards to its horrid history. Gillan meets up with Thwaites in hopes that the two can destroy this mirror. She apparently tracked it down at an auction and now she is hell bent on video taping the ordeal. Outside the siblings and flashbacks of their parents, there is Gillan's boyfriend, who may or may not have stopped by, and Thwaites therapist. Director Mike Flanagan manages to effectively weave together two stories. First we have Gillan and Thwaites struggling to maintain sanity as reality and fantasy intermix. Then we have their younger selves dealing with the self destruction of their parents. What is troubling is an ending where the mirror wins. This seems to be the pathetic norm of modern horror films. The actors play off their roles with appeal and the special effects are at the ghostly best but why not a concept where good conquers evil? It worked for The Conjuring. It's unfortunate that this isn't a mirror image. Score: 7 / 10",Oculus
20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Really troubling and occasionally interesting supernatural effort,4,24 September 2016,"Tracking down an antique mirror, two siblings plan to destroy it in order to correct a devastating family travesty it afflicted upon them finds that it's intention of not letting itself be destroyed is playing haunting tricks on them and must try to stop it before it's too late.This here wasn't that great and was overall pretty disappointing. One of the main things working against it is the rather fragmented and disjointed timeline here that makes it utterly impossible to keep track of what's happening when. The film cuts to a flashback of the family from years earlier showing something happening to them before going back to the present only to find out the past flashback never accomplished anything other than a cheap diversion to get the cast at that period more screen-time since it doesn't do much to spell out the storyline at that point. They're just endlessly confusing trying to go back and forth through the different periods which doesn't really affect much of anything in the film which shows not only the present-day versions interacting within the younger timeline and even being shown to noticing them at one point which simply makes it all incredibly hard to pinpoint what's going on. It's really worse in the final half where the film gets crazier with it's action antics as there's plenty of times where it's actions make no sense with what's going on in real-time, and then even compounds matters by choosing to focus on the type of action that no one would really come out of sane in the same situation as the tormenting nature done on the kids is quite messed up and would leave them psychologically scarred way before being forced into action to defend themselves and is illogical to see it play out as it does. As well, there's also the fact that the film's so bland and drawn-out through all of this set-up and time-shifting that once it gets to focus on them in the present setting up for the experiment and waiting for it to start it's just uninteresting and dull seeing them just act to one another without anything creepy or supernatural happening, and it affects the film greatly. Alongside the atrocious CGI for the beings, these here are what hold this back. When this one does get going it has some solid points at times. One of the main positives for it is the fact that the opening half's atmosphere is quite chilling at times, as the single-minded determination to get the mirror away using her work credentials and the uneasy manner in which the film goes into detail about the supposed creepiness of the mirror's history which is where this one gets off a rather nice and dynamic feeling of dread. As well, there's a lot of rather fine scenes here detailing the mirror's potential threat which comes from a rather detailed series of scenes involving the different attributes it channels, from the ongoing series of dark thoughts it puts into people and their suddenly irrational behavior and how it tends to affect others around it really gives this one a strong and imposing sense of dread which allows for a pretty decent time when it gets to their being tormented by the mirror as an adult. Still, these here aren't really enough to offset the many major problems elsewhere here. Though the action does pick up in the finale where they go for a strong series of action scenes trying to showcase their plight, it's not nearly enough to fix the rest of the film.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language and strong themes of children- in-jeopardy.",Oculus

A haunted mirror possess people to destroy themselves and loved ones. The terror of the young kids is quite effectively shown.

Don't get. me wrong. The idea was okay and the way it was shot was also sublime but the story just couldn't get my attention.Maybe it was the CGI used for the whitening of the eyes that made it laughable or all the possessed ones towards the end that made it a bit ridiculous that made me almost stop watching it.

The acting has energy, which makes the characters believable. The director uses cold coloring, and odd camera angles to create a cold and disjointed experience. Oculus story is about a cursed mirror which causes death. Oculus' story goes back and forth between past and present. The blending of the past with the present is crafted to bring the story of the mirror's curse. Surprisingly the flash backs do not drag the movie's pace, but create an understanding of why the present characters want to destroy the mirror. Oculus' main story problem is why would the brother and sister believe they could defeat the un breakable mirror? A plot hole, which maybe could start a part 2. I give Oculus a seven out of ten.",Oculus
24,siderite,"Good story, kind of a bad ending",7,3 August 2014,"When the movie started, I was really glad to see a resemblance with other recent films that move away from the tired premise of people caught unaware by ""evil"" and who are completely defenseless and shocked by its manifestations and instead go further a step, by acknowledging and then fighting said evil. However, by the end of the story, everything was back to ""normal"" with chaotic flashbacks, hysterical behavior and camera tricks of the type ""it's behind you because the camera can't see it"".It was too bad, I thought, because Karen Gillan is really beautiful and intense and the same can be said about Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane (mom and dad), who acted very well. I don't know about Brenton Thwaites. I guess he played his role well, which is that of a brainwashed kid who breaks apart when something smashes apart his fragile reality, but I truly found him annoying to no end. Maybe it's just me. I thought he was OK in The Signal, which is definitely more creepy and a better movie.Recognizing evil and fighting it is the way to go, as is buying whatever furniture you want. The error of the characters was, I believe, that they thought letting people know that they were not crazy and that the mirror is evil was more important than fighting and gutting it directly. In a way it is a sign of our times, when every ""good citizen"" obeys and relinquishes responsibility to authorities.However that is too philosophical for the type of the movie, which is creepy possession ghost horror. Creepy it was, but at the same time the resolution of the tension was based on a concept that pretty much made the ending obvious. Because of that, watching tortured characters suffering through the entire last part became tedious.Bottom line: not great, but certainly not bad.",Oculus

27,sddavis63,It Raised Question From The Start,8,16 March 2018,"I appreciate a movie that isn't entirely straightforward, and that has me questioning what's happening almost from the beginning. ""Oculus"" managed to do that. Was any of this real, or was it a figment of someone's (presumably Kaylie's) imagination? Was there anything supernatural about what happened, or was it just a family tragedy? Did the whole family go insane, or was it only one or two of them? I wondered about all of those questions as the movie went on, and in the end there didn't seem to be any specific answer given to those questions.The movie begins with Tim (Brenton Thwaites) being released from a mental institution. He's met by his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan). The two share a bond that goes beyond just being brother and sister. They both experienced something horrific. It's made clear pretty early that dad killed mom, and then Tim killed dad. But why? What happened that turned a normal and apparently loving family so bloody? Kaylie can't accept the possibility that it's just a case of straighforward killing. Instead, she's convinced that it's because of an antique mirror that had been in the family home. She's traced its history - there have been other similar incidents. She believes there's an evil, supernatural presence in the mirror and she wants Tim to help her kill it once he's out. Tim on the other hand is convinced after his years in therapy that there was nothing supernatural about what happened. Dad killed mom and he killed dad. It was that simple. And then we watch as Kaylie's carefully planned experiment sets out to prove that the mirror is haunted - or something.Thwaites and Gillan were good in this, as were Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff as their parents. The movie switches back and forth from the present to the past - and while such a format can sometimes be difficult to follow, I thought it worked very well here. It allowed the story to unfold methodically. Everything that Kaylie was planning in the present seemed to have some relationship to the past, so letting the past out bit by bit was an effective way of moving the story forward. There are the kinds of shocking things you would expect in this kind of movie, but it's not an especially blood and gore kind of thriller. It is thoughtful and it does make you wonder - and it leaves you wondering. Was this mirror haunted or not, or was this just Kaylie not being able to accept the brutal reality of what actually happened? It's left to the viewer to decide. (8/10)",Oculus
28,Hellmant,Horror films are the best investment!,7,16 April 2014,"'OCULUS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another successful low-budget horror film; this one was directed and co-written (with Jeff Howard) by Mike Flanagan and based on his 2006 short film 'OCULUS: CHAPTER 3 - THE MAN WITH THE PLAN'. It tells the story of a brother and sister who witness supernatural occurrences in their home (as kids), which cause the death of their parents, and later try to prove it all wasn't just in their heads (as one was sent to a mental institute for the crimes). The film stars Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane. Like a lot of low-budget scary movies the flick is creative and packs a decent amount of 'gotcha' moments but it is rather slow paced, though.The film revolves around Kaylie (Gillan) and Tim Russell (Thwaites). As children, eleven years earlier, (played by Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan) they witnessed their father, Alan Russell (Cochrane), kill their mother, Marie Russell (Sackhoff), and Tim was forced to kill their dad in self defense. They believed their dad was under the influence of a demonically possessed antique mirror and they told authorities this. Tim was sent to a mental institute and grew up believing they had created the whole supernatural story in their heads. Then when he's released from the institute his sister Kaylie is determined to prove their story is true. The movie is pretty dark and disturbing; not a ton of actual violence or gore but it is gruesome when it does hit the screen. It's pretty frightening at times as well and for a $5 million production it's extremely impressive; the film made nearly it's entire filming budget back on the first day of it's theatrical release. That's why I always say horror films are the best investment. This movie definitely isn't one of the best low budget thrillers I've ever seen but it's decent and I think Flanagan has a lot of talent and a decent future ahead of him. The performances aren't all that great but the characters and story are intriguing. It's also slow paced (like I said) but it should deliver what most fans of the genre are expecting to see.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm4Vh8MBwoQ&feature=youtu.be",Oculus
29,Buddy-51,Mirror mirror on the wall,5,18 February 2015,"Mirrors, with their ability to both reflect and distort reality, have served as sources of inspiration for many a horror story writer.In ""Oculus,"" the object in question is an ornately framed 500-year-old mirror that's allegedly been causing all sorts of havoc in the lives of those who've owned it. The last owners were a family of four in Alabama whose father (Rory Cochrane) went crazy, murdering the mother (Katee Sackhoff) and nearly killing his son and daughter before the son blew him away in self-defense. Fast-forward to the present day: Tim (Brenton Thwaites), the traumatized boy, now 21, has just been released from a mental institution, while his older sister, Kaylie (Karen Gillan), has tracked down the mirror for the express purpose of proving to the skeptical world that it was indeed the nefarious mirror and not her father that was responsible for the tragedy. Like most horror films, ""Oculus"" is better in the setting-up stage than in the playing out. The mirror aspect of the story suggests that things might be different here from the typical haunted house tale, but eventually the clunky, nuts-and-bolts aspects of the story come to predominate and the result is under-whelming.

Bah! Sadly, most of them have been too similar and labeled as ""true stories"" – hahahahaha – so they're super hard to get through. Enough of the same!Luckily, a few have popped up that distinguished themselves from the main-stream-same-old story. Like 2016's The Conjuring 2 and 2013's Oculus. I appreciate the ones that stray from the ""family buying the house they can't afford in which a ghost progressively reveals itself until a priest sees they're in over their head and a leap of faith saves the day until the sequel"" cliché. This one was absolutely fantastic in regards to story, acting and originality.Brother and sisteryou in trouble, children. They start their young lives witnessing their parents falling apart in front of a wicked mirror and continue their existence to attempt to destroy said mirror. Oh, but there's so much more to this.And I'll leave it up to you to see. There are so many layers and interesting elements and because all actors involved are so damn good, you really get invested in everyone on screen. What's nice about this film is that even though it takes the familiar possession story to familiar grounds, but we get so wrapped up with putting the pieces together, it's a fun ride. Not that I was scared, however. I don't believe in ghosts, so these kinds of movies don't frighten me. But, you might be scared. Perhaps you have more of an open mind than I do. Good for you. Let your inner spirits heighten your goosebumps.Completely recommended. Well crafted, attempting to be original and they certainly hired some talent. Too bad they didn't get the recognition the other phonies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring 1 and Insidious got. This was the real deal without ever being labelled as ""real.""***Final thoughts: Day 3 Movie in the Can! I'm watching a NEW-2-ME horror movie every day of October 2016 and this one I started a year or so ago. I got a huge crush on actor Rory Cochrane and plopped this movie in despite it being a ghost story I didn't favor. I gave up 10 or less minutes in. Too bad I did. Though Cochrane was good, in fact, the rest of the movie far exceeded my hang-up on yet-another-haunted-house boycott. Yeah, I'm going to try and open this mind a bit more. Only will serve me in growingAdditionally, recently, I began listening to a horror movie podcast, Shock Waves, and episode 4, they had Director/Writer Mike Flanagan on and it was thoroughly interesting hearing him speak about his passion project here.

32,Robert_duder,The plot appears intriguing but delivery is sloppy,5,17 August 2014,"I didn't see a lot about Oculus before going into it but the concept seemed cool and I admit I was sucked in by the announcement that it was ""from the producers of The Conjuring and Insidious."" It is always good to remember that producers rarely mean much in the style and plot of the film. The idea behind the film is an interesting one though it has been sort of done before and as other reviewers have pointed out it definitely has a certain Stephen King flair to it and that's absolutely a good thing. However, the positives end there and the negatives start to pile up and its very unfortunate because it could have been done well. The casting is okay but the performances of some key players is very, very campy. The script makes it hard to deliver lines that actually are believable and any time this breaks the plot because you're laughing at something...ruins the film a little more. The actual setting of the movie is reasonably well done and some of the more gory and shocking moments in the movie are also done well. I can't help imagine if someone like James Wan had helmed the pictured how much better it could have been. However, Wan would have rebuilt it from the ground up because it needs a lot of tweaking.Karen Gillan of Dr. Who fame plays our scream queen Kaylie. At first she appears to be the ""together"" one and then you begin to discover her obsessive nature with her past and her parents and the deadly mirror. The problem is Gillan is awful. She delivers lines like she is a straight to video, Asylum produced B-movie. When she goes on rants its like watching a comedy. Gillan single handedly brings this movie quality down. Brenton Thwaites is better but then again he barely has any lines and his character is a little more complex and brooding but he is definitely less campy. Thwaites and Gillan have okay brother-sister chemistry which helps. Katee Sackhoff plays their mother in flashback sequences and she is okay but has her own moments of sheer campiness that hurts the film. She has an odd look to her but ultimately when the possession starts she does alright. Rory Cochrane is easily the best of the cast as the father. He doesn't really get enough of a character development to truly shine but he definitely gives an impressive, believable and often disturbing performance. Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan are also very good (better than their adult counterparts) as young Kaylie and young Tim.Director Mike Flanagan co-wrote the script and made the error of directing his own own. This is almost always a mistake. Flanagan hasn't done anything yet in his short career to prove he has substantial style. Absentia was okay at best and he seems to be stuck with low budget films thus far. Oculus gives him nothing to build style over and it fumbles its way through a story that needs so much more to it in order to be successful. When you look at something like The Conjuring or Insidious, those movies were terrifying because of great characters, solid story, and disturbingly shot scenes not because of gore or sheer shock value. This is a decently budgeted mainstream film in the guise of a low budget movie and it ends up irreparably hurting it. This wasn't worth much time in my books. 5/10",Oculus
33,bowmanblue,Competent little horror,6,5 January 2015,"'Oculus' is actually pretty entertaining as far as horror movies go... for the most part. But then if a modern horror movie can maintain its status as 'pretty entertaining' even for just half the film then it's probably a cut above most of today's horror offerings.The story centres on the same family, but bounces back and forth between two timelines – one when the central brother and sister characters were young and living with their parents and the 'modern day' period where they're now grown up and recounting what they remembered. Basically, when they were young, their family came into possession of a creepy old antique mirror. Once the artefact was in their house, their lives promptly fell apart. Now, the two kids have grown up, they are determined to rid the world of this mirror once and for all.So why don't they just smash it? I hear you say. Well, they can't. It's apparently beyond just taking a hammer to. However, the brother and sister spend much of their time debating whether the mirror was truly responsible for all the bad things in their life, or whether they just imagined it through childhood high spirits and an overactive imagination.And, while that's happening, everything is pretty good. It's not terrifying or bloodthirsty, but then it's not supposed to be. It's designed to make you wonder whether there is a rational explanation for everything that transpired all those years ago, rather than a supernatural one. And this is where the film's strength lies. It's pretty good at making you doubt the obvious explanation (whether your 'obvious' explanation is supernatural or natural – it gives both sides equal credence), plus the characters behave in ways you'd expect, i.e. setting up plenty of cameras to gather evidence of any supernatural doings/threats.However, it does fall down a bit in the last act, relying on cheap scares and obvious shocks, plus the constant swapping of timelines gets a little hard to follow at times. But that's not so bad – there's still enough here that's entertaining and there's some pretty creepy and unsettling imagery to turn your stomach.In a vast sea of forgettable horror movies, this one may stay with you a little longer than most.",Oculus

The horror movie genre to me has been in a free-fall in terms of quality and actual horror aspects. Horror these days is either ""found footage"" type or ""Saw"" how many people can we dismember. Neither of those to me are scary. This movie tried its best to return to a legitimate horror with a plot and suspense rather then gore but it never quite got there. The big problem with this is that the movie Mirrors that came out a while back had roughly the same idea and that was done 100 times better then this one. If you haven't seen that one you may like this OK, or if you are a teenager (who I think the movie was geared for) but for me the movie became to repetitive and flat to hold my attention or create any real suspense.

38,851222,Not bad,8,24 August 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Oculus"" (2013) is a nice spooky flick. Definitely not the best and or scariest out there, but it works. The story is kinda fresh and at the same time familiar. The movie's ending was a bit let down to me, not going in to the spoilers i will just say that in my mind i was expecting for some kinda twist at end, but it ended a bit straightforward. The acting although was good, and especially by Annalise Basso, who plays the young heroin - she was really great. The others did a solid job, but nothing very special. As i have mentioned, ""Oculus"" isn't really scary, but that's not a problem to me, as i think the best horror movies begins with captivating and realistic story - ""Oculus"" does have one, it worked for me while it was lasting, but you won't remember it for long after it will end.",Oculus
39,ironhorse_iv,"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall! Who Is the Scariest Mirror horror of Them All? Oculus. A great psychological thriller!",7,29 April 2014,"Looking through the looking glass. I'm genuinely intrigued by Oculus. Oculus comes from the old school horror movie that plays on people's psychology rather than using cheap scares like violence gorn (gore porn) to hook its audience. It's too bad, the movie is very confusing, and you can get lost in the film if looking for logic. The movie is edited in a way that makes you wonder what is real and what's not. It bend the rules of reality to create some unique scary moments when the past come back to haunt the present. Without spoiling too much, the movie takes on the dark memories of childhood, and mixed it with the aftermath of trying to explain the trauma, in the adulthood. Both characters, the brother & sister, deal with a childhood tragedy in different way. Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) believes the crime years ago was committed by a supernatural phenomenon from an antique mirror. Ever since childhood, she search for a way to destroy it. Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) believe that there were no supernatural events involved, tries to forget it. It wasn't until both, find themselves facing their reflection in the mirror, that the experiences of past, blend with the present. Forcing them to relive the horrific night of their parents' murders. Directed by Mike Flanagan, the film is based upon an earlier short film by Flanagan, Oculus: Chapter 3 - The Man with the Plan. The movie is pretty predictable, even with the suspense. You can see the downing ending coming with the set up to the film. I just glad, the movie wasn't a crappy found footage movie. The story was pretty well-made as in the first act, you don't know if the characters were truly insane at first, or was it done by a supernatural force. After the second act, you truly get to see the downfall of these characters. It seem it was very influence by Stephen King's The Shining. Alan Russell (Rory Cochrane) borderlines Jack Torrance in this movie and the mother, Marie (Katee Sackhoff) is just as scary. The acting is alright. The kid actors playing the younger Tim & Kaylie really did seem scared. I like how Karen acts so driven as if she was trying tempt and challenge the supernatural mirror. You see attempts to use her historical and scientific research to defeat her unknowable foe. I do have to say, late in the movie, the character Karen plays, should show more fear. It kinda hurts the film by this point, as it tries so hard to be scary, but her character acts like it was minor. It doesn't add up anyways, as she goes from scare to death to mildly annoy by the supernatural actions. Brenton Thwaites goes well at playing the denier, but after the first act, he can't show fear. Most of it, is him looking in shock of what's happening. The movie does an excellent job explaining the 'lasser glass' exposition in quick and an entertaining way. The mirror has a lot of hints of other mirror horror myths, like the whole Marisol sub-plot. Sounds like Bloody Mary superstition to me. The movie doesn't explain her, well. Another of this myth, insisting that mirrors should be covered at night and when people in the house are sleeping, to make sure that a dreamer's wandering soul doesn't get trapped in one. The mirror seem powerless when covered in the film. It seems like a good way to kill it. Way better than the 'Kill Switch' idea. The whole motivation plot of killing it, by Kaylie was very weak in this regard. The mood of the film is pretty dark, still there were some funny and entertaining moments. The editing is pretty rough as the movie has a lot of scene in the dark, where you don't know what's happening. The way, the past and present jump each other, was a bit confusing. The way, they explain it, can be challenging to understand. Everything from start to finish is literally ambiguous and can be interpretation in any way. The small amount of CGI, they used was pretty bad. The mirror eyes are good example of awful CGI. Honestly, they didn't need it. While, the film was low budget, it doesn't show. Not that scary. Disturbing, yes! But not scary! Not that many jump scares in the film, but the trailer does spoil most of the scary moments. The violence, gore, and language in the movie is pretty tame compare to other Rated R horror movies. It could better off, left with a PG-13 rating. The movie leaves the doors open for sequels, and I hope they capture more of this concept. Overall: I loved the psychological aspect of it. I would rather watch this movie, then play with an Oculus raft or watch 2008's Mirrors any day.",Oculus

41,eddie_baggins,Some nice ideas not fully realised,4,30 October 2014,"Overflowing with half-baked ideas, moments of pure unbridled terror and enough haunting mirror shots to put you off seeing your reflection for some time, Mike Flanagan's low budget and meandering horror Oculus is a movie too short on genuine quality filmmaking and due to some annoying central acting turns, a movie that never engages in the way in which its story could've allowed.Oculus is a lot different to many other recent horror films in that it wastes barely any time by jumping the audience straight into the thick of it concerning brother and sister duo Kaylie and Tim and there vendetta against one very nasty mirror. It's refreshing in a sense that Flanagan was willing to get virtually straight into business but it certainly takes the viewer a good 30 – 40 minutes to properly engage with what is transpiring in front of them as Kaylie and Tim aren't what you'd call fully formed characters we are on side with due to underwritten roles and some terrible acting from Karen Gillan as Kaylie in particular. It's in Oculus's present day scenes in which the movie gets bogged down the most and with Flanagan's tendency to mix in flashbacks with present day scenes, often in conjunction with one another the films impact to scare and thrill is lessoned despite the fact the film really comes to life when the flashback scenes are given time on their own.It's in these flashbacks to when Kaylie and Tim were children and their parents Marie and Alan played by Katee Sackoff and Rory Cochrane were experiencing some ""issues"" that Oculus really showcases just what could've been. Not only are these scenes a lot more interesting that what is happening in the present there often downright creepy, giving the film a unique horrific feel that mixes in real life horrors and that of the more supernatural kind to great effect. From these segments you get a feel for the overall tone Oculus was going for and Flanagan makes the most of the mirror's ability to fragment reality by producing some wince inducing moments often involving munching on something that isn't all that edible or a family member acting anything but normal. With these scenes being the films best, you really do wish that the film focused more on the past and far less on the present.Oculus has some very recommendable elements, from some fine musical cues, some neat unique ideas for scares and some truly frightening gross out moments, but overall the film fails to capitalise on the pieces of the puzzle that is laid down and come the films forgettable final act, you'd wish that all involved had seized the moment and produced something far more memorable as a whole, not just sparse moments of genuine horror goodness.2 extra crunchy light bulbs out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Oculus
42,filipemanuelneto,"A good movie, but it could be less confusing.",6,21 December 2016,"This film revolves around an old mirror and the death of Tim and Kaylie Russell's parents, who survived the killing of their family blaming supernatural forces attached to the object. The film has a dark and gloomy atmosphere that manages to introduce the audience and prepare it for the story and the scares. The atmosphere is cleverly constructed by the sound effects, by the naked settings of the house where the action takes place and by the cinematography, purposely constructed with cold colors.The script is not based on a totally original formula. There is a haunted object that kills people and there are people interested in destroying it. Within this formula, the film tells two distinct but intertwined stories: the death of the parents of the main characters and their attempt to destroy the mirror, years later. The film blends them through flashbacks, but I think this turned out to be a wrong choice because it undermined the good understanding of both, although it made the film more dense and intense in the end. The film frightens us more by what it suggests and promises than by what it actually exhibits, and works well if we think so. It is not a graphic film, but tremendously psychological. It deals with obsessions, traumas, needs and anguish. Karen Gillan, who gave life to Kaylie, is excellent and dominates the film, pushing Brenton Thwaites (who played Tim) to a relatively more discreet position. The ending turns out to be confusing but intense. It is worth watching this movie.",Oculus
43,TheMovieDiorama,Oculus is an illusory mind-bending horror that may leave some scratching their heads.,7,25 February 2018,"This is easily one of the most overlooked horror films of the decade, without a doubt. This extrasensory experience just leaves me looking on into the horizon with a perplexed look on my face. Two siblings are entrapped in a reality where illusions are created by an antique mirror with a supernatural aura. After a traumatic childhood event, the two decide to destroy the mirror for good, but it may not be as simple as that. Where to even begin!? There is far too much to digest (even after my fourth viewing). The narrative and conceptual idea are what makes this a fresh new horror. Its execution almost feels contemporary, and that's down to Mike Flanagan's directorial effort. The attention to detail is insanely meticulous, where every scene is interwoven into a complex narrative that feels like a complete story. The constant switching between past and present maintains the mystery and intrigue that a film like this requires. It showcases some terrific editing. Repeatedly flipping from present to past results in various intelligent transitions. Seemingly the two timelines feel more connected that one might anticipate. Flanagan also incorporates some mature, although infrequent, scares. Demonic figures with reflecting eyes, occasional loud noise jump scares...but that mirror! That mirror defines the word ghastly. Pure ominous antiquity. The usage of subtle gore was also a pleasant surprise. Pulling a fingernail off, eating a plate or a lightbulb and also the last scene which I shan't spoil. It's all very twisted, with plenty of turns in the plot. Unfortunately, the third act does lose its way substantially where the illusory effect has worn off. The combination of the two timelines and how they mesh becomes blurred and will leave many confused. Acting was good all round though, nothing outstanding but Karen Gillan held the whole film together which is no easy achievement. Overall, Oculus is a technically accomplished film that showcases some excellent editing.",Oculus

46,matthewssilverhammer,A Twisting Horror Insta-Classic,8,16 May 2014,"Oculus starts like any other generic mid-budget horror flick with humdrum performances and characters, and cheap and unengaging scares. But about 20 minutes in, the story takes a wild and brilliant turn into its actual terrifying rabbit-hole of a plot. The bland opening then starts to feel intentional, lulling us into thinking it's the same-old-thing before smacking us in the face with its brainy inventiveness. By the end, Oculus has profoundly disturbed, cleverly absorbed and horrifically entertained. It's a duel story that follows a brother and sister trying to come to terms with their childhood, all the while flashing back to what actually happened during their youth. Yet the flashbacks are far from typical. While the movie struggles a bit with spoon feeding us the characters motives through some clunky dialogue, the plot and mystery unravel methodically and intriguingly, each bump and creek more unnerving and unexpected than the last. The camera-work is top notch and editing is unflinching, the scares relying more on unease than cheap thrills and gore. What really makes Oculus soar is the smart and unique direction. Flanagan doesn't simply present a horror setup and then hit us with a gruesome punchline. What he gives us is a fascinating look at reason versus disorder, with Oculus doing something truly unique: questioning its own myths, leaving us wondering what's real and what isn't. Sure, it's a bit overly bleak, in need of some lightness for balance. However, it's ultimately a surprisingly smart and stylish supernatural thriller that will please surely horror fans but could even reach beyond its own genre.",Oculus
47,Vartiainen,Feel the shivers with this one,7,4 October 2016,"Two children are forever traumatized when their father buys a mirror into his new office, without knowing its malignant nature. The children, realizing what their parents cannot, swear to see the mirror destroyed, no matter how long it takes.Oculus tells its story in two separate time periods, showing us the two main characters as children fighting against the mirror's influence for the first time, and as young adults who have gotten their hands on the mirror once more and are now trying to see it destroyed for good. But what makes this more interesting is that both of these timelines intertwine as they both happen in the same house. We see young Kaylie (Annalise Basso) sobbing in a corner and immediately cut to older Kaylie (Karen Gillan) shivering the same corner. Or we see young Tim (Garrett Ryan) fleeing right past an adult Kaylie who turns to follow him as if chasing a memory only for the older Tim (Brenton Thwaites) to interrupt her from the other room. The film is beautifully shot like that, and it also knows how to build atmosphere and dread without relying overly much on gore and shock imagery. The scariest scenes in this movie are the ones you see coming but cannot avoid.The idea is also refreshingly simple. The mirror's origins are explored a bit, but in a way that fits the plot overall as well as Kaylie's character. But it's never explained too much, leaving a good amount as completely mystery, which makes it scarier. Almost the whole movie happens in one location, which allows the feeling of claustrophobia to really set in.If I had to name a flaw, I'd say that I'm not all that happy with the actors they have playing the parents. Especially the father (Rory Cochrane) seems more than a bit stiff in most of his scenes, which in a way fits what's happening to his character, but it's still a bit distracting, especially in the early scenes. Still, they're by no means awful performances, but they pale when compared to the main stars.Nevertheless, Oculus is one of the best horror movies I've seen a while and definitely worth a look for all those that believe that true horror is more than splatter effects.",Oculus
48,jtindahouse,A tense and terrifying ride,9,10 February 2017,"'Oculus' is an outstanding horror movie. It's taken me nearly four years since its release to finally get around to seeing it. The only reason I can think I overlooked it at the time is because of the two children who feature on the movie poster. Generally, horror films with children at the heart of them tend to be more family friendly, or at least they used to be. That stigma is changing a bit these days with films like 'Oculus' and 'Sinister'. Anyway, I finally got around to seeing it and I'm very pleased I did, because it is a hell of a film.It's very rare that horror films can make me feel uneasy these days. But when one does it is a sure sign that it is very well made. Writer/director Mike Flanagan has made a bit of a habit of making very good horror/thrillers since 'Oculus', with films like 'Hush' and 'Ouija: Origin of Evil' both turning out to be very well made indeed, proving 'Oculus' was no fluke. He brings a tremendous amount of intensity to the movies he makes. He creates tension almost like no one else can and it leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout.The only small problem I could pick up on with 'Oculus' was the motives with the older generation side of the story. Whether what they were doing was actually realistic or in any way made sense, I'm not entirely sure. It did work very nicely for the story though - conveniently. Other than that however, I really can't find a whole lot wrong with this film. If you overlooked this at the time of release like I did, I thoroughly recommend going back and giving it a try. You won't be disappointed.",Oculus
49,freemantle_uk,"Great potential, but muddled at the end",7,25 June 2014,"Writer/director Mike Flanagan adapted his own short film Oculus: Chapter 3 – The Man with the Plan as a psychological horror feature film and serves as Doctor Who star Karen Gillan's Hollywood debut.After spending 11 years in a mental hospital Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) is released on his 21st Birthday and is greeted by his older sister, Kaylie (Gillan). She gets Tim to fulfil a promise they made when they were children, to destroy a 400-year-old mirror known as the Lasser Glass, which she believes is haunted, and plans to document the events over the course of a night. Locked in their old house for a night, Kaylie and Tim reflect on their childhood when their parents were driven to insanity 11 years earlier.Oculus is a very well acted with the whole cast giving strong performances, including child actors Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan as the younger versions of Kaylie and Tim. British audiences are most likely to be interested because of the beautiful Karen Gillan and her fans will be pleased by her performance, giving plenty of emotion and a convincing American accent.Oculus has major conflict early on between the older versions of Kaylie and Tim, Tim acting as the voice of scepticism and coming up logical explanations about what happened in their past and the history of the mirror. One of the best sequences is Kaylie and Tim debating the mirror's history, with Gillan and Thwaites working well together. Oculus would have benefited from being more ambiguous about the supernatural elements and casting more doubt.Another theme is the persecution of reality the siblings suffer and arguing about their psychological states. They both have different interruptions of the events of their past, coming up with different examples and if done a little differently could have been a deeper study of the fallibility of the human memory. The mirror plays on the siblings minds and causing visions and casting doubt about what is real and what is not. Finally the characters are facing demons, both their personal and literal demons that the mirror causes.Flanagan shows himself to be a director with potential. With his cinematographer Michael Fomognari, the pair do create some excellent shots, having wonderful camera movements as it follows actions on screen and both are fond of using high camera angles and steady cam shots. There are some excellent visuals, from the camera to the design of the ghosts. One particular little moment is when Tim sees an image of Kaylie on a computer screen which is different to the cameras she had set up and resulting in thoughts about the Doctor Who episode ""The Time of Angels"".Flanagan also treats his characters to having some intelligence, Kaylie being very scientific and methodical approach to proving what the mirror does and her plan to destroy whiles Tim as stated comes up with sensible counter arguments. As the film progresses and plans more tricks on the mind it becomes tougher for the Russell's as they do not know what is real. Gore is kept to a minimum and is more impactful when it is shown. It is not a film for gore hounds.But as Flanagan tries to judge the two narratives he ends up struggling despite his best efforts and by the third act Oculus starts to implode with its two conclusions at the end, becoming more of a muddled mess.Film School Rejects put it best with their review saying ""well-acted, looks quite good and manages some moments of entertainment, but as the minutes tick by it grows weaker and weaker until its final cheat designed to allow for a shocker ending"". It is a statement I totally agree with.6.5/10 Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com",Oculus
50,dfranzen70,Cataracts,4,10 April 2014,"Oculus is a sloppy horror movie about a possessed mirror and the vengeance that a grown woman, whose family was destroyed by the mirror when she was a girl, attempts to wreak upon it. There are a couple of shock moments - not shocking, just shock - but for the most part the plot is weak, overly murky, and aimless.This is much more of a comedy than a scary movie, if the screening audience was any indication. Boy, you never heard such laughter. True, there was some gasps from time to time, but truth be told, those scenes were predicated on the audience's not knowing that something might happen when a camera pans slowly around a room or focuses tightly on our heroine's face. For the story, it seems that 11 years ago something dreadful happened in the Russell family. Our first encounter is with the grown Tim (Brenton Thwaites), who's being released from a mental hospital. Seems that Tim was blamed for whatever happened so long ago and has been institutionalized ever since. He's met outside the hospital by his older sister, Kaylie (Karen Gillan). Kaylie wants to help her brother adjust to life on the outside, but first she has a favor to ask, and it involves helping her (or them) overcome their demons once and for all.The movie jumps back and forth in time, sometimes a little too seamlessly. As things unfold, we're able to piece together what happen - or at least how Kaylie and Tim remember it. It all has to do with an old, old mirror that their father had purchased for their new home. In the present, Kaylie has gone to the trouble of finding a buyer for it at auction and then offers to fix a crack in the mirror (this makes sense in the movie). Instead, she hauls it to the old family house, where she plans to prove - to herself, to the world - that the mirror is evil and that it's to blame for the deaths of Tim and Kaylie's parents.Kaylie, to my mind, seems unhinged right from the start. She pays cursory attention to Tim's adjustment period, focusing on the mirror instead. She sets up an elaborate system involving the use of multiple cameras, the presentation of historical evidence of the mirror's effect on (some of) its previous owners, the monitoring of the temperature in the house, the health of the plants in the house, and so on. She also employs several egg timers to indicate when she needs to hydrate and eat, when she needs to change the videotapes, and when she needs to reset the kill switch. The kill switch here is a large descending weight that launches a swinging blade directly at the mirror. So Kaylie's put some thought into this, is what I'm getting at.But the movie spends far too much time trying to persuade the audience that Kaylie's right, rather than just presenting her evidence and then moving on. The movie's practically a third over by the time scary stuff really starts to happen. And because there's so much flitting between time frames (often in the same scene), with perception itself becoming more and more muddled, that it's at times tough to discern if what appears to be happening to the characters is actually happening. There were far too many times when I just wasn't sure if the whole mess was all in Kaylie's head, and that kind of uncertainty made the movie hard to enjoy on that level.I would have liked if the slow pace near the beginning moved quickly into creative, fast-paced horror action; instead, there was a lot of talking (mostly between Kaylie and a disbelieving Tim) punctuated by intermittent pieces of propelled plot. On the more positive note, both Gillan and Thwaites are good, as is Rory Cochrane as their father.The denouement kind of fizzles. It's the kind that's supposed to come out of nowhere and startle you something fierce, but all I felt was sweet relief that the end was nigh. The ending just feels like a cheat, or maybe a cheap toupee slapped over a shaved weasel with digestive problems. And although that may not be a particularly coherent analogy, it still seems quite appropriate for this movie.",Oculus
51,stevendbeard,Good Story But Not So Scary,6,11 April 2014,"I saw ""Oculus"", starring Karen Gillan-Doctor Who_t.v., The Kevin Bishop Show_t.v.; Brenton Thwaites-Home and Away_t.v., Slide_t.v.; Katee Sackhoff-Longmire_t.v., Battlestar Galactica_2004/2009_t.v. and Rory Cochrane-CSI: Miami_t.v., Dazed and Confused.This is a horror/thriller that is alright, but it's just not that scary. The story takes place in two time periods, 2002 and 2013. In 2013, Brenton is released from a mental hospital into his sister Karen's care. Back in 2002, their mother, Katee, went a little crazy and their father, Rory, shot and killed her. Rory was then killed by Brenton-that's why he was in the hospital in the first place. Back in 2013, Karen wants to prove that all their family's problems were caused by a mirror with supernatural powers so she acquires the evil mirror and sets out to prove her theory. At first, there are flashbacks like you normally expect, the type that fill in blanks of the story and are clearly divided as to when they start and end. But, slowly but surely, they become a little confusing by blending together with people and things from both time periods. But, part of that could be the mirror itself, because it has strange powers that can cause hallucinations and make you see whatever it wants you to see. Like I said, it's an interesting story but it's just not that scary. It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.

54,drownnnsoda,"Mirror, mirror, on the wall",7,14 April 2014,"For a relatively low-budget picture that appeared seemingly out of nowhere, ""Oculus"" surprises with plenty of tricks up its sleeve. The film focuses on two adult siblings, Kaylie and Tim; Tim has been incarcerated since childhood for murdering their father in a bizarre event, and is finally released by his doctors. What should be a quiet and slow assimilation back into society is anything but, however, as Kaylie has set up an elaborate plan hoping to capture evidence that an antique mirror which once hung in the family home possesses otherworldly powers, and was responsible for the tragedy that befell their family. I went into this film with an open mind and didn't know anything about it aside from the fact that it had to do with a mirror, and boy was I pleasantly surprised. It's rare for me to see a horror film in theaters often that is at least somewhat daring, or even a half-step in the right direction. The amount of derivation in the genre has doomed it to be uninteresting. That's not to say that ""Oculus"" doesn't borrow from a plethora of conventions or other ideas, but its framing of them around a bizarre childhood event (and the distorted narrative construction that present its) makes this film unlike any horror movie I've seen in a long while.The film has solid performances from Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites, and the child actors who play their counterparts are astoundingly believable. Finally, Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane round out the central roles as the children's dysfunctional parents under the mirror's dominion. Enlivened by the performances is the film's creative writing; while I'm sure there are some plot holes to be found if one digs far enough, it is actually rather solid, conceptually speaking, and the fragmented narrative that builds on itself through flashbacks and present-time not only generates a good deal of tension, but the intercutting between the two pits the narrative strands against one another as mirrored images. This culminates into a complete arena of chaos and terror in the final act, in which the reflections between the past and present become unclear and commingle, until the jarring and disturbing conclusion. The film leaves its viewer a sort of freedom in deciphering the events depicted, which have the double-edged-sword-effect of the unreliable narrator without falling into a cliché or being too obvious— no, it's not one of those ""it was all in their head films"". If anything, it's much more complicated and nuanced. There is virtually no way of telling what exactly happened, just as the mirror intended. 7/10.",Oculus
55,davispittman,Better than the average,7,3 August 2016,"Oculus is better than the average horror flick. Brenton Thwaites is alright in the role of Tim and the rest of the cast is good too, not great but alright. The movie's lighting and filming is good and well done by the filmmakers. I liked how the movie had flashbacks to the past when the stars were children and where it all started. Also I liked how this movie wasn't really gory or overall disturbing as other horror movies can be, now don't get me wrong it did have some Gore and a few disturbing images, but it wasn't like to the Saw level. What was in the mirror and exactly what evil force inhabited it never was really explained in the movie, and I thought that was a good thing because I thought it added to the mystery and the eeriness. Now the ending to oculus is not the greatest thing in the world, but it is a little clever. It's also not the happiest in the world, but you get that sometimes with these types of movies, judging from the ending, the filmmakers left it open to where possible sequels could come but it has yet to be confirmed. I do hope there is at least one sequel, but maybe not more than that because I'd hate to see it turned into a worn-out franchise that just cracks out sequel after sequel for money's sake.

56,jfgibson73,The Girl With The Plan,5,22 June 2014,"Oculus is about a haunted mirror. The movie is almost entirely about a brother and sister, Kaylie and Tim, who are spending the night in a room full of video cameras and alarm clocks as part of a plan to destroy the Lasser Glass. Tim was convicted of murder when they were kids because he shot his dad in self defense. Kaylie wants to prove the mirror made him do it and destroy it. However, the mirror can bend reality, so the brother and sister are never sure what is actually happening and what is a vision. They run around the house thinking they are seeing gruesome things, and the story flips back and forth between the present and their childhood. Then the two timelines start to blend together, and the movie devolves into a series of creepy images meant to confuse us as to what is actually happening, but doing nothing to further the story. Finally, Tim turns a dial that releases an anchor hanging from the ceiling meant to smash the mirror, but it impales Kailey. She dies and he goes back to jail. Before he made this movie, the director made a short film of the same premise: a man videos himself alone in a room with the mirror to prove it's haunted. This short was much more effective and used much less to accomplish the same goal. I am not sure this idea can sustain a full length feature, but I would recommend the short.",Oculus
57,aharmas,Parallel Terrors,9,26 April 2014,"I was bowled over by the amazing editing job done in this film because it suited it so perfectly, keeping me interested, setting up the disturbing nature of the story, and offering a fresh change of pace in a genre that is in danger of growing stale. For starters, it's great to see an actual plot again, not another ""pseudo documentary"" offering another dose of paranormal events. As a matter of fact, this is a very old-fashioned take on what suspense should be. It's been modernized, and there are a couple of nifty tricks in it. For the most part it works.A couple of siblings are back in the scene of the crime, trying to clear their parents' names, destroy the source of evil that destroyed their family a decade or so earlier. The only problem is that it might just be too much to handle. At the beginning we are introduced to a mysterious mirror, which would scare even Snow White's evil queen. Its design reeks of madness, evil, dark forces, and it's cool to see that it's modeled after ancient mirrors, surfaces that weren't clear. This might be symbolism for the muddled forces we're about to encounter.After a quick set up of the plan to bring down the forces of evil, we start playing a zig zag game that takes the action back and forth, slowly peeling the layers of the mysterious scene of the crime. There's a powerful force emanating from the mirror. It seduces and overpowers the will of those who are close to it; this includes any living organism such as plants and pets. Its effects are corrosive and dangerous, and in typical manner, we wonder why people just don't walk away.Soon the father has grown into a mean and withdrawn individual who begins to torture his family. The children are victims of psychological and physical abuse, and the wife bears the brunt of the attack. The situation grows more disturbing as the story reaches its climax. In the meantime, Tim and his sister begin to suffer some of the same effects, and we no longer know what's an illusion or what is reality. We only know if it continues, the end will be a complete mess.The jolts feel real, and the action never stops. Just as we think we've figured out what's happening, another twist happens, and the mystery grows thicker. By the end of the movie, we might just say that things have not become any clearer. I would hate to make the suggestion that we need to see a sequel to understand more of the back story, and there is a good chance it might just happen, if it's given to the same creative hands behind this entry.

58,peterp-450-298716,Horror for beginners. Not scary. Not bloody. Just a creepy mirror.,6,13 November 2016,"""Who was that lady in your office today? Yeah, Dad, who was that lady in your office today? What lady? I don't know. Just some lady."" Halloween night. All channels are stuffed with horrors to entertain you during this scary night. Unfortunately these are always the same recurring well-known movies (I'm sure the budget of the Film Department isn't that big). Best I choose one from the seemingly endless list of never watched horror movies. And I always wanted to watch ""Oculus"" (despite some negative comments I've read). And I must say, I was still pleasantly surprised. Not because of the horrifying or frightening content since that part was almost missing completely. But it was because of the ingeniously interwoven story lines from the past and the present that fascinated me. Although it caused a huge muddle in the end. At some point I was so confused, I didn't even know in which time cycle the story took place.The mirror is a very popular prop in horrors (a nice compilation of famous ""mirror scares"" can be found here). Personally, I really liked the way a mirror was used in the film ""Candyman. In ""Oculus"" apparently an old, antique mirror is the source of all sorts of situations that get out of hand. Only one could ask whether or not this mirror is causing people in this particular family to see delusions. Or is it just a genetic disorder? And because of that disorder the psyche of those persons start mixing illusions with reality. And that's the sophisticated part of this movie. The intertwining of reality and illusion. Are there indeed dark forces hiding in this mirror? And are these forces encouraging an individual to commit heinous acts? Or are those personal delusions playing a major part?Are Kaylie (Karen Gillan) and Tim Russell (Brenton ""Gods of Egypt"" Thwaites) both victim of the so-called ""fuzzy-trace theory""? After many years, it's Kaylie who comes up with a plan to prove that her father wasn't the one who tortured and murdered their mother, but that he was manipulated by the evil mirror. Her brother Tim just spent 10 years in a psychiatric institution to get all his facts straight and heal from the trauma he experienced after putting a bullet through his father's head. Apparently that doesn't seem to bother Kaylie. She drags him back to the family home where she installed the dreaded mirror surrounded by cameras, electronic gadgets and a security system with an iron pin. She's determined to film the psychic influence of the mirror and put a halt to the infinite series of mysterious deaths by destroying the evil mirror. Tim throws in all sorts of counter arguments. Kaylie thinks it's all crap what he's saying and blames it on the years of confinement and indoctrination by the treating psychiatrists. Or is Tim healed after years of therapy and he got rid of the notorious familial mental state?""Oculus"" isn't about creepy or bloody situations. It's virtually never scary. So, there won't be any nail biting moments. And except the apple incident and a tooth extraction, this film is almost bloodless. Yet I found it exciting in some way. Two story lines from two different periods perfectly alternated, so the whole story is revealed in a slow way. As already mentioned earlier, this is somewhat exaggerated at the end, which in turn can cause confusion. In terms of performances are the teenagers Kaylie (Annalise Basso) and Tim (Garrett Ryan) the most convincing. The way they evolve from carefree youngsters into scared teens, is played beautifully. The horror on their face looks tremendously realistic. The older alter egos were rather one-dimensional. Obviously there's the tension between them as a believer and nonbeliever. ""Oculus"" is not really groundbreaking and certainly won't cause a stir in the horror landscape. But for horror fans it's still an enjoyable movie that rises effortlessly above the average. I even dare say it's a horror for beginners. I'm convinced that they can enjoy a peaceful night afterwards! Even if they take a look in the bathroom mirror while refreshing themselves ....More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Oculus
59,aidanratesmovies,"It has its flaws, but there is no doubt that this is a good horror film",7,1 October 2020,"Oculus largely serves as a pathway of inspiration for Director Mike Flanigan's future take on The Haunting of Hill House. Unfortunately, although it isn't necessarily in any way horrible, it is far inferior. The film stars Karen Gillan (in her first American film role), and Brenton Thwaites, who both play their parts to incredible poignancy. Its supporting cast is also quite impressive, with Katee Sackhoff and Roy Cochrane providing its best performances, as well as decent performances from the kid actors involved. Oculus is, for the most part, very entertaining- although it can be a rather uneven and vague feeling film. The first 15-20 minutes of the film prove to be rather dull, which is a rather solemn start for such a later mesmerizing picture. Unfortunately, the last 15-20 minutes of the film, also makes many mistakes- although very different than the beginning of the film. The film feels rather unfinished, and it's ending proves to be rather anticlimactic and unsatisfying. It's end has its hand full of thrilling moments, but it felt as if the film was more focused on confusing the audience of what was happening, rather than trying to complete the story it set up in the first place. The score in the film is excellent, as well as the cinematography. Flannigan directs the film very well, but I feel he, and Jeff Howard, were not entirely sure how to translate their concepts on screen to the best of their ability. In the end however, Oculus does prove to be a mostly entertaining and rather thrilling little horror flick, that isn't without its flaws, but reflects potential in more ways than one.

60,masonsaul,Disturbing horror,9,23 July 2019,"Oculus is an incredible horror that's scary, disturbing and surprisingly self aware. Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites give great performances. Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan also give great performances as the younger versions of their characters. The concept is well explored and there are plenty of disturbing and scary scenes throughout. Mike Flanagan's direction is also really good and the music by the Newton Brothers is extremely effective. However, there is nearly too much exposition in the first act.",Oculus
61,robertemerald,Well above average chiller,8,19 May 2019,"This is a good horror movie with plenty of chills and frights, just the right amount of insane violence, some brilliant cruelty, and with superb actors and a genuine script. Buy it, see it, it's OK, it's definitely not a dud. So why only 8? OK, here's the kicker. It's way too long, and the early parts are both a little confusing, and too long. When I was trying (and failing) to study mathematics in my youth a lecturer once said that all tv was aimed at 11 year olds. My point is that good movies should aim at above average intelligence for an adult, and, trust me, the rest of us will catch up. To my mind that is a much better formula. (Feel free to disagree - maths adventure was 40 years ago). I should have docked Oculus 2 points for the length/confusion alone, but in fairness, for a decent night in to really get your spook up, this is a brilliant movie, so I'm only docking it a point for that. The other point I docked is for a predictable end. Hopefully (I saw it on Netflix) the dvd version has alternate endings. If not, then, please, if any filmmakers read this, perhaps you might consider it? Some would argue that that inevitability did nothing to spoil the horror. That's probably true. What is certainly true, however, is thanks to that aspect I now have to press the spoiler button on IMDb.",Oculus
62,pachara87,All that's missing is suspense.,4,16 April 2019,"It deserves credit for seamlessly blending timelines and perspectives, but its mind games just fail to deliver proper scares. Oculus aimed to be the next Insidious, but it is actually nothing more than a reflective mess.",Oculus
63,Seraphion,Almost a good scare,5,20 April 2014,"To be honest, I don't really like horrors. I seldom watch horror titles, collectively or by myself, because I don't think a scare is worth spending time for. But this time this movie caught my interest because the concept explained in the short description is quite good and also it has a good debut of third place of the Box Office,The story, alternating between the current time and the time when the main characters were kids, follows Kaylie and her brother Tim. Kaylie found her old and odd mirror, that was present when their parents died quite unnaturally. When she was alone, she found that the mirror still is a supernatural phenomenon of scary nature. After researching about it, she then conduct a test on it in a room with recording cameras, trying to prove the mirror's evil capability. All the while her brother, who has undergone psychological treatment, tries to convince her to forget the past with logical reasoning.When Kaylie finally proved to her brother about the mirror's phenomenon, the recording instead show that they were being hallucinated into rearranging the cameras. But then Tim begins to get scared and hallucinations keep occurring. The story goes back to their childhood. The mirror hypnotized their mother to almost killing them. Their father subdued her, but he was also immediately hypnotized to tell the kids to stay clear of the room their crazed mother was in. More and more their father got hypnotized and begins staring the mirror for long, not giving any care for the family. Back to today, lights are out in the house supposedly because of the mirror. Kaylie finds a way to distinguish the mirror's trick to their eyes using the cellphone camera, but this turns out futile also.They then go outside and Tim called 911. The lights turn back on and they are shown another hallucination. The call to 911, and another re- call, was futile. On the past Kylie and Tim failed to break the mirror, and their father lets loose their mother. In the present, the mirror separates the two, and the incidents on the past repeat again now in a new form. In the end, on the past the mirror hypnotized their father to kill their mother, and framed Tim of killing their father, and in the present the mirror hypnotized Tim into killing Kaylie.The movie starts slowly with the first scare is on after about 20 minutes in. But on the last 25 minutes the sequences are one scare to another. The story buildup of more than twenty minutes is not so good because it wastes time that, in my opinion, is enough to delve deeper into the characters of the father and the mother.The reacquainting of Kaylie and the mirror is good because it's essentially not a ghost or killer scare. This kinds of scares, especially those which can really scare people, are now relatively rare. Well I'm not saying that this one is scary enough, but it's good because it arouse our curiosity and that keeps us on the edge of our seat to watch more.The real second scare, and basically is a supposedly hallucination with Kaylie's father. It's scary because of the gruesome picture depicted, not because of the concept. All the other scares are mostly hallucinations that drive a person to move like he or she is sleepwalking.As any other horror, it does have a depiction of a ghostly face. For me it is a drawback because the face is shown only after the movie is built up well without it. Up to the horror sequences, the movie builds the thrill and suspense well with just the hallucination tricks and the conflict between Kaylie's persistence and Tim's drive to move on. But then the sudden appearance of the ghost face makes the thrill plunge right down to mediocrity and uniformity of the rest of other horror movies.Katee Stackhoff's acting of being possessed is great, her facial expressions delivers the situation well with the smiles and smirks. I think this is overly in contrast with Karen Gillian as the main role, which performs her facial expressions vaguely, not so distinguishable between her confused look and her daydreaming look.The mood build up is helped much by the music, though this makes the viewers to be more anticipative to the coming of the scare and somewhat diminish the surprise element. But then again, it helps to build the suspense because it reels the viewers into their curiosity.Overall for me the movie is a good scare. It would have been a great movie, and a rare kind of horror, if only the director succeeds in executing the scare without the use of the ghost face. From me it's a 5 out of 10 score. A recommendation? Well for me it's not so worthy of a cinema watch, it's better off to watch without sacrificing any money.",Oculus
64,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not even the queen from Disney's Snow White would want this mirror,8,17 October 2021,"Within the realm of horror, many things have been depicted as being haunted or possessed. From dolls, to houses, to even people, something wicked usually takes over and enters the living realm. Sometimes though, the more simplified the item, the more ominous it may seem. An example of this is HAL-9000 from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 - A Space Odyssey (1968). While not haunted in any way, the straightforward design of the character led to some unnerving scenes within the movie. The same could be said for this feature where the main focus is on a mirror, which doesn't even have an individual face to boot. While having lead other films prior to this one, director Mike Flanagan would make himself more known with this release. He would also later go on to direct Hush (2016).Despite the title not sounding like it's at all related, the story is about Tim and Kaylie Russell (Brenton Thwaites & Karen Gillan), a brother and sister who went through a traumatic experience together after the family acquired a strange mirror. Both of their parents (Katee Sackhoff & Rory Cochrane) lost their minds and in self-defense Tim shot his father. Several years later after being deemed sane, Tim reunites with Kaylie only to learn he made a promise to her that they would find the mirror and destroy it. Written by Mike Flanagan as well as Jeff Howard, a frequent co-writer of Flanagan's work, this supernatural horror film has plenty of things to contemplate over. One of the most intriguing aspects about this story is just learning about the history of the mirror and again, it's design.Even though no specific reason is given as to how the mirror became possessed, being explained the background of the mirror is enough captivation. Adding to that, when seeing how this object has affected Tim and Kaylie is all the more tragic. There's also the dynamic between the two siblings - one coming out of rehab, while the other plotting revenge. Two different perspectives on the events that occurred back in their childhood. What truly happened as to what one was told happened; reality vs logic. Meanwhile the mirror stands idly by, watching and waiting to claim its next victim. What doesn't work in the films favor is how the character threads overlap. As time progresses, events almost seem liked reflected images of the past, which makes sense with the whole mirror thing going on. However, this raises further questions when it comes to the mirror itself. Is it omniscient; because it's almost too precise.Acting is done proficiently within the running time. While the cast is small, viewers can easily recognize most of the actors from other films. Karen Gillan at the time was new, but would shortly star in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017). Brenton Thwaites started out similarly with this feature and would then get involved with Maleficent (2014) and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017). Katee Sackhoff is no stranger to horror films having been in Halloween: Resurrection (2002), White Noise 2: The Light (2007) and The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia (2013). Rory Cochrane is also well known in films like Dazed and Confused (1993), Argo (2012) and Black Mass (2015). As for the kids, Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan both are just starting out but show promise in their capabilities.For visuals, it's impressive how well the production was able to work around the fact that a mirror can expose tricks used in filmmaking. Michael Fimognari is credited as cinematographer and it looks good. The long standing shots of the dark mirror allows for much dread to be felt. The music was also a decent effort from The Newton Brothers. While synthesis and electronic pulses aren't normally the most engaging of score material, the composer duo managed to make such an album with said techniques that actually work to the film's credit. The thumping bass line is the motif for the mirror and there are rarely any stings with in the tracks provided. It still would be nice for them to create more themes for their new works in the future. The album itself does contain over an hour of material and an overall theme for the franchise. It's worth a listen.There is some vagueness in how the antagonist to the feature is able to manipulate things, alluding to the fact of it's true power. Besides this though, the performances really sell the idea along with the eerie music and a foreboding prop design.",Oculus
65,Matt_Layden,A surprising little gem of a horror flick.,7,5 November 2015,"Mike Flanagan has another film on this list. He did the underwhelming Absentia. Here he finally shows some promise with a creepy horror flick that involves mirrors. Told from to different perspectives in two different time lines. A brother and sister set out to destroy a mirror that holds supernatural abilities and is responsible for a horrible event from their past. I kept passing on this film because it's about a creepy mirror. We already got creepy mirrors in the horror flick, Mirror. That film was a big letdown because it was from Alexandre Aja, who knows how to stage a good horror film. So when I decided to sit down to watch another attempt at making mirrors creepy, from a less talented filmmaker, well...you get the idea.But boy was I wrong. This film is refreshingly creepy. Throughout the movie, you're never 100 percent sure what you are seeing. The mirror is able to manipulate people into thinking they are doing one thing, or seeing one thing, while they are somewhere else doing something completely different. This puts certain characters in grave danger because they don't even realize they are in a life or death situation. This film constantly questions reality and so does the viewer. This adds a level of suspense to the terror. Flanagan flips from past to present multiple times and despite already knowing the outcome of the story from the past, he still manages to build tension. Things take a turn for the even more supernatural when the past and present start to blend together. The brother and sister know that this mirror is the cause of their problems and they want to document that. By the end of it, they hope to destroy the thing, but that damn mirror has other plans. Just when you think you want to destroy it, it somehow manipulates you into doing something different. Thus saving its own reflection. A small and quick history lesson about the mirror opens up a world of possibilities and possible sequel / prequels. A thing that surprisingly, doesn't leave a bad taste in my mouth. I'm open to more stories with this thing. Very few horror films make inanimate objects scary, so congratulations Oculus, you did it!!!",Oculus
66,brando647,OCULUS is a Great Little Supernatural Thriller,8,17 January 2015,"You wouldn't believe a supernatural thriller about a haunted mirror would be as well done as OCULUS. At least, I wouldn't. Maybe that's because I saw bits and pieces of that horror movie from 2008, MIRRORS, and wasn't impressed. It's a simple idea that's easy to ruin with the usual horror movie clichés but writer/director Mike Flanagan has created something unique here. We get a suspenseful film that doesn't rely on gore to shock its audience and toys with the concept of time as it bounces between parallel stories in the past and present. The haunting atmosphere in OCULUS reminds me a lot of 1408 (the haunted hotel film starring John Cusack, based on a Stephen King short story). I really enjoy both films and believe both capable of creating some of the creepiest vibes I've seen on recent film. OCULUS is about one woman's obsession. As a child, her father murdered her mother and her brother was hauled off to a mental health facility for shooting their father in defense of his sister. But Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) knows the truth. The problems began when her parents purchased an antique mirror known as the Lasser glass, placing it in her father's office. Kaylie and her brother Tim watched as the mirror warped her parents into something else, until the fateful night culminating in their deaths. When Tim (Brenton Thwaites) is eventually released years later, Kaylie approaches him about keeping a promise: coming together to prove that their father was not in control of his actionsthat it was the mirror that murdered their parents.OCULUS has the bonus subtext of mental illness running through the film. It sets out from the start to confuse the audience a bit, making us wonder if the mirror is truly a work of evil or if Kaylie's memories are warped and she's attributing fantastical events to cope with the trauma of that night. Tim was placed in government care, where he's come to terms with the fact that his father had merely gone insane and he was forced to kill him to save his sister. But Kaylie, who's been free to obsess over the Lasser glass for years, refuses to believe it. She's certain the mirror is evil and she's won't rest until she sets the record straight and destroys it. You're meant to wonder whether it's truly supernatural or a case of one mental unstable woman pursuing a fantasy, but I felt it was made pretty clear early enough in the movie which was the case. It doesn't matter though. Even without the ""crazy or not"" thread, the movie still works perfectly. Flanagan gets creative with his storytelling, bouncing seamlessly between modern events and a decade prior as we watch the family slowly sink into madness. Both stories would be enough for a movie all their own, but they're woven together through flashbacks where we're doled out information a little at a time and piece together the events that ended in two dead parents and a little boy spending the next ten years in therapy.In addition to the superb storytelling and perfectly chilling atmosphere, the cast is phenomenal. This is especially noteworthy considering two of them are children. Child actors usually aggravate me to no end, but Garrett Ryan and especially Annalise Basso do really, really well. Their fear always feels genuine and there's a sincerity to their acting you don't see much from kids. Their older counterparts, Brenton Thwaites and Karen Gillan, are equally strong. Thwaites doesn't get as much to work with, as he spends most of the movie in a sort of emotionless daze with a few emotional breakdowns, but Gillan is great. She infuses Kaylie with a powerful sense of purpose. She's confidant in her plan and, as intelligent as she is, believes she's got the mirror under total control. Her hubris leads to an ending one would expect in a horror movie, where confidence is often the least positive trait a character can possess. The parents fare just as well, with Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff playing pretty major roles in the films considering their characters are dead from the beginning of the film. Sackhoff is given a chance to go feral while Cochrane pulls off creepy perfectly as he goes from loving husband to a sort of possessed zombie under the influence of the Glass. Really great work all around. OCULUS stands as one of the better supernatural thrillers I've seen and it gets an enthusiastic recommendation from me for anyone who found themselves enjoying 1408 or INSIDIOUS.",Oculus

The ideas are all there but it fails to effectively execute them on screen.

The dreams and hallucinations start early on. Kaylie has spent the years growing her experience and reputation in auctions and properties. She retrieves what she thinks will be needed to settle the issue. Kaylie thinks that she is sufficiently prepared. Tim is willing to help her record any weirdness that might occur.We flashback to the time when Tim and Kaylie lived as children with Marie and Alan, their dear parents. The flashbacks detail Kaylie and Tim dealing with their parents descending into madness and death.Delineation of conflicts: Much of the action centers about an old mirror (the Lasser Glass) that Kaylie retrieves in the present, and their parents owned in the past, notably near the time when they died. Kaylie traced its history back to 1754, and documents deaths associated with it over the centuries.The Lasser Glass does what it will, which is to kill its owners, often by dehydration or starvation. Kaylie intends to record its actions and figure out what really happened to Alan and Marie. Kaylie has that in mind.

73,meddlecore,Engrossing Psychological Horror.,7,23 October 2014,"This is a film about cognitive dissonance butting heads with supernatural forces, oriented around a plot that revolves around the traumatic experience, had by one family, after acquiring an antique mirror with a dark history.It all begins when two siblings- Kaylie and Tim- reconnect after an extended estrangement, during which Tim had been incarcerated. Tim is being released after having served almost a decade in prison for killing his father. While Kaylie has been working for an auction house...through which she is quietly plotting her revenge.Whereas prison has systematically conditioned Tim to question all of his memories, thoughts and actions, Kaylie has been anxiously awaiting his release, so that they can take on the dark spiritual force that broke up their family and destroyed their lives- together.A series of flashbacks (fragments of both their memories) are interwoven throughout the film, from which the backstory is revealed. Turns out that, shortly after purchasing a bunch of antique furniture and moving into a new house, their mother started to have a nervous breakdown. This put a strain on their parent's relationship, and culminated with their father murdering their mother...and, in turn, Tim murdering their father.However, the two siblings have very different memories concerning these events from their past. Kaylie is absolutely convinced that some dark unseen force- that resides in the mirror- is responsible for the violent history of events surrounding it's beleaguered past- particularly, the condition of their mother and actions taken by their father. On the other hand, however, Tim has been trained by prison psychologists to reject everything he thought he knew, in exchange for a more skeptical, critically psychological oriented approach.In honour of her brother's release, Kaylie has managed to re-acquire the mirror. She plans, not only to rigorously test her hypothesis in a scientific manner, but to battle and destroy the unseen entity which she believes is responsible for all this death and destruction, once and for all. And she needs her brother's help.Tim remains skeptical until his indoctrinated worldview gets blindsided by the fact that his sister's predictions start to come to fruition- seemingly corroborating her hypotheses. Now, both are perceiving things differently than how they actually happen...as if something has hijacked control of their psychological perception (something most of us take for granted).Things start to get crazy when both realize they can no longer trust their own perception (hence the need for all the recording devices). The nature in which this theme is developed, makes it a commentary on science''s requirement for evidence to be recorded technologically, in order for a perceptible natural phenomenon to be considered real. But it also acts as a sort of social criticism about how individuals in modern western society have become overly reliant upon such technologies in our day to day lives.Can these technologies be trusted? Or are they too subject to manipulation by these powerful unseen forces? With Oculus, Flanagan has fashioned an incredibly thought provoking psychological horror that will keep you on your toes, guessing... what happened in the past?... and how is everything really going down in the present? It's a perfect example of how the best of the best horror films (Vertigo, Le Territoire, Possession, The Innocents, for example) exploit the fact that the psychological and the spiritual (ie subject to the ""supernatural"") are but two different ways of observing the same natural phenomenon. The whole thing is constructed quite nicely to keep you in the dark until the very end; and the final twist is great too. Leaves it ambiguous- forcing you to ponder over it. Great film.",Oculus
74,khanbaliq2,A supernatural spellbinder that succeeds at disorienting the viewer with a cleverly structured screenplay.,6,6 June 2014,"It's a good thing that there's a theater like Cineplex Odeon International Village Cinemas in Vancouver because foreign and independent films are screened there. Oculus was made on a small budget of $5 million. It didn't receive a wide release, but it still earned $30 million at the box office. It features a few actors who appeared in other more popular films. Scottish actress Karen Gillan, playing Kaylie Russell, appeared in Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014). Australian actor Brenton Thwaites, playing Tim Russell, appeared in Maleficent (2014). American actress Katee Sackhoff, playing Marie Russell, appeared in Riddick (2013). Kaylie and Tim are the two main characters. They're brother and sister. Gillan and Thwaites provide good performances and so do the other actors. Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan play the children and they're also good. In fact, the acting is my favorite part of the film. Gillan clearly provides the best performance. The film itself is engaging psychological horror but it does have some problems. The biggest problem is that director Mike Flanagan attempted to turn his earlier short film (Oculus: Chapter 3 - The Man With The Plan) into a feature length film. This robbed the original story of most of its power and mystery. Oculus starts out slow as the characters are introduced. It gets a lot more interesting when the antique mirror is shown and its story is told. What follows seems uneven. The parents, played by Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane, are not well-written characters, so Oculus loses some interest whenever they're on screen. Oculus gets interesting again when Kaylie's and Tim's struggle with the mirror is shown. Flanagan and screenwriter Jeff Howard reveal their true talents when the plot deepens and the action frequently alternates between past and present. Unfortunately, to fill the time the filmmakers also included some gore, which sometimes seems out of place with the events concerning the mirror. The gore is chilling, but it's not frightening. The film overall isn't a frightening experience but it is unsettling. What sets it apart from generic horror films are its clever mind games, eerie memorable visuals, and its adeptness at merging past and present. Oculus left an impression on me and I definitely liked it. The good music score by The Newton Brothers fits the film well. I definitely recommend Oculus. Even if it contains some minor problems I still fondly remember watching it.",Oculus
75,natashabowiepinky,"On reflection, not very good.",4,29 May 2015,"The Inexplicable popularity of this dull, over-gimmicky horror could probably be explained by the inclusion of ex Doctor Who assistant Ms Karen Gillan to the cast. Not a fan of the show myself, I have no idea why she appears to have the following a lot of others who have left the role seem to lack... But what I can state is, a movie is NEVER as good as it's stars... And Oculus is an increasingly tiresome exercise in over-elaborate set-up with hardly any payoff.Starting 11 years in the past, it documents the relocation of your typical white-bread American family (Mother, Father, Two Kids, Golden Retriever. Not too sure about the picket fence) to a new house, complete with a spooky mirror. This object seems to have the power to suck life from everything around it, and causes people to suffer hallucinations to protect itself. Before long the dog is acting weirdly, Mom is driven so crazy she has to be leashed, and Dad spends all his time brooding in his room. To cut a long story short, everyone but the children end up dead... With the boy committed to a secure institution, and the girl left to pick up the pieces.Present day. The lad is now a man, and has finally been given clearance to leave the mental hospital. Guess what his sister has been doing while he's been on the inside... That's right. Tracking down the antique mirror, and buying it back. You see, she made a vow with her brother to 'purge it of it's evil' before he was send down... And now she expects him fulfill his promise. Rather unwisely, he agrees... And so begins a LONG process of filming the mirror from all angles, checking the temperature of the room it's in... Occasional breaks for snacks and water...Yes, it IS as tedious as it sounds. And no, I have no idea why anyone with any attention span could sit through this tripe without having something on stand-by to pass the time through the many empty moments (I had my iPad. ALWAYS be prepared). As for the flashbacks, they might be cliché and predictable, but at LEAST you have SOME level of excitement. When it skips forward to the here and now, I found myself uncontrollably yawning at the not-quite-stimulating goings on. And yes... I get plenty of sleep, thank you very much.And, you wanna know something else? I disliked Gillan in this role. She might be hot stuff in a cheesy Sci-fi serial, but here I found her shrill, manipulative and almost unbearable. During a certain 'shock' scene, when we were presumably meant to be saddened, I could only wish that what had just transpired had occurred earlier. Let's hope her annoying performance here is just a case of a bad script and direction, rather than a harbinger of things to come... 4/10",Oculus
76,gregsrants,Upon Reflection - Simply Brilliant,9,11 September 2013,"It was 2006 when director Mike Flanagan first caught our attention. We  obtained a copy of his short, Oculus: Chapter 3 and were one of the  first internet reviews of the short (a favourable review in case you  were wondering). We kept our eye on Flanagan through the years through  his follow up projects, Makebelieve (2000), Still Life (2001) and  Ghosts of Hamilton Street (2003). But it was Flanagan's 2011 film,  Absentia, that really put the budding director in the limelight.  Absentia was a small yet ambitious project that did its best on the  festival circuit before getting some attention on VOD and DVD and was  Killer Reviews' pick as the best horror film of 2011. Flanagan is back  behind the camera with Oculus, a picture that was picked as one of the  Elite 10 of the Toronto International Film Festival's Midnight Madness  Series.  Oculus tells the story of Tim and Kaylie Russell (Brenton Thwaites,  Karen Gillan). Tim has recently been released from a mental institution  where he spent most of his younger years after he and his sister  witnessed a deadly family tragedy that left Tim's psyche in a state of  fragility. Only hours removed from the hospital, Kaylie convinces Tim  that a mirror procured and displayed at the Russell household was the  cause of their violent childhood. Kaylie is convinced that the mirror  has a 300-year history of death and destruction and she solicits Tim's  help in an attempt to confront and destroy the evil that possesses the  antique mirror.  Kaylie and Tim's attempts to find answers and draw out the evil lead to  violent hallucinations and flashbacks that both siblings in danger and  challenge the sanity of the recuperating Tim. As their night alone with  the mirror draws long, Kaylie and Tim soon learn that the mirror is  still the dominant force and their attempts at closure soon become a  race for survival.  If Absentia was Flanagan's Star Wars, then Oculus is his Empire Strikes  Back. A better more polished film, Oculus was as eerie and involving as  it was particularly complex in its non-linear storytelling. Much like  Absentia, Oculus is intelligent in its unravelling and doesn't cater to  the microwave generation's want for a high body count while still  delivering the goods.  The acting was stellar with familiar faces Rory Cochrane (CSI: Miami)  and Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica) complementing the adult  Gillan and Thwaites). But is was the performance of the younger Kalie  (Annalise Basso) that steals the movie with a virtuoso performance that  demonstrates the young actor's range.  Horror fans that have longed for a good and clever thriller involving  ghosts and the paranormal will have their thirst quenched with the  smoothness of a 12-year-old Scotch. Oculus is everything we could have  hoped for from the no-longer-unknown Flanagan.  It is a superior thrill ride that will challenge audiences to keep up  with the fast moving plot developments while delivering upon an onion  layered type screenplay that will keep your guessing not only in what  happens next, but if what is happening is even real.",Oculus
77,ghostfiendghost,THIS IS A WWE FILM?,8,20 January 2019,"A surprise hit from Blumhouse that really keeps the viewer interested with its visual and story telling. It's interesting on how the film leaves the viewer wondering if the mirror is really haunted or was the family psychotic. One of the things that helps the transition from the past to the present is the control of the mirror and how walking to different parts of the house help transition in between the two events in time.

78,RonellSowes,Blind To Quality,2,9 May 2021,"I'm not sure where to start on this film's failures. Perhaps with how its marketed as a horror movie yet there isn't one second in this film that can be considered remotely scary. While I might place this criticism on just about every single horror flick, Oculus doesn't even try.The picture is also probably the worst use of nonlinear storytelling I have ever seen. Its confusing, disconnected and only exists because there isn't enough story in either half and so two half plots were thrown together in hope of making a complete one. Which they don't.I could discuss every moment of this film that doesn't make sense, but I would be practically writing you the script and certainly wasting my time. Oculus might mean eye in Latin, but this film is blind to quality.",Oculus
79,AhmedSpielberg99,Coulda Been Waaaaaaaaaaaaaay Better!,6,15 September 2018,"With its muddled narration, disorganized storytelling, choppy editing, distracting fast pace, and tons of ineffective cheap jump scares, I found the first act so messy and scrubby that I was about to stop watching the rest of the movie. Fortunately, almost everything got better after this unbearable 30 minutes, especially the editing which became one of the movie's merits notably when the movie shifts consistently between the past and the present. What didn't get better is the use of jump scares. Literally, there's no single jump scare that worked for me. That being said, Oculus is a quite scary movie due to its creepy atmosphere, brilliant visual structure, and seemingly nonsensical rules that would turn out to be very cogent. By that I mean due to Mike Flanagan's creative vision who directed and co-wrote the movie's screenplay. All the performance are fine, particularly the kids, but Annalise Basso's performance as Young Kaylie is what stands out for me. She is such a talented young actress.The characters of Kaylie and Tim have some reasonable depth, and the developments of the relationship between the two siblings raised a surprisingly interesting dilemma.The sound mixing and editing are top-notch, the thing that made some scary scenes so effective.Honestly, the ending isn't quite satisfying, and it made a sequel required, which we plainly won't get, but at least it didn't ruin the movie.(6.5/10)",Oculus

The plot never moves and when it does arrive its nowhere special. Mirror never seems sinister, the mirror's back story never materializes or connects to the central characters. The sum total is lackluster. To Occulus's credit it is not torture-porn, it's not a franchise horror movie, it's not a by-the-numbers teen scream. The evil the movie attempts to show is original. Original is great, its fantastic, but its only half of awesome. To get awesome, to get The Shining level of horror or The Exorcist level of horror, you have to combine original with well executed storytelling, make that plot dance it's ass off.",Oculus
81,ersinkdotcom,Unique in its own way,8,21 August 2014,"""Oculus"" is one of those rare supernatural horror films that take a little time to set in. If you don't give it some reflection (believe it or not, pun unintentional) after your initial viewing, you might walk away disappointed or shrugging it off. It's the type of film that demands you watch it multiple times to take it all in and fully enjoy all its chills and excitements.As a child, Tim (Brenton Thwaites) was convicted of the murders of his parents (Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff). Upon his release from a mental institution, his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan) takes them to their childhood home to put an end to what she believes destroyed their childhoods and family. Kaylie is bent on finding a way to destroy the Lasser Glass, which is an antique mirror with a horrific history of death and violence.Although we do get some jump scares, ""Oculus"" doesn't just rely on those types of cheap thrills. There are plenty of slow-burning moments that will have you tensing up and retracting in nervous anticipation. As a longtime lover of horror films, I found myself embarrassed at how frightened I was of certain scenes.All the actors in ""Oculus"" give their best with convincing performances. Katee Sackhoff goes against typecast playing a damaged and sensitive wife and mother versus the rough-and-tumble roles she became famous for. Karen Gillan sheds her English accent to confront the demons of her past and put an end to the curse that has followed her throughout her life.""Oculus"" is rated R for terror, violence, some disturbing images, and brief language. Overall, there's a good mix of visual gore for those looking for that sort of thing. At the same time, what you don't see is just as frightening. I did enjoy the fact that the filmmakers didn't feel it necessary to bombard audiences with needless nudity or sex scenes. It's just good old fashioned horror fun.With ""Paranormal Activity"" producer Jason Blum involved, you can only imagine he somehow fits in at least one ""found footage""-type gimmick into the movie. It wouldn't be a Blumhouse Production if he didn't. One of the characters uses their cell phone to see spirits they can't with their naked eye.The DVD version of ""Oculus"" comes with only one special feature. A featurette entitled ""Inside the Mirror: Creating 'Oculus'"" takes viewers behind the scenes of the movie.Although it isn't the only mirror-related film ever created, ""Oculus"" does feel unique in its own way. It fits nicely into a sub-genre that includes ""Mirrors,"" ""Amityville: A New Generation,"" ""Poltergeist III,"" ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary,"" and the likes. However, it more than holds its own and rises above with a somewhat original take on the subject.",Oculus
82,MattyGibbs,A rarity. A very good supernatural film.,8,2 June 2015,Supernatural films are probably my least favourite horror genre so I didn't approach this with much enthusiasm despite it's decent rating. For once however I wasn't let down. Oculus has a wonderfully creepy atmosphere throughout with genuine tension. I found it by far the creepiest horror film I've seen for some time. It doesn't rely on lame CGI or copious amounts of gore although it's far from gore or violence free. Instead it builds up tension and delivers some old fashioned chills instead. I loved the way it effortlessly switched from the back story to the current day without confusing the viewer.The acting is good from all the cast but I was really impressed with Karen Gillan who carries the movie well. The ending of most supernatural films normally lets them down but I loved the ending to this one. Oculus is a dark and some will say depressing film but for me it's a welcome change from most of it's genre bedfellows. Highly recommended for those jaded by many recent horror offerings.,Oculus

Pay attention, and enjoy the ride.",9,24 May 2014,"First just a solid at a'boy to the entire team on this one, and great work all around pulling this off. I have been looking forward to finding out what the hype was all about with this one, and now that it's done I can safely say I Enjoyed that ride. Two time lines intersecting, and the power of the mirror to tear your brain to bits as it eats something from within you that it will never give back. Excellent work crossing back and forth between the 2 time lines, and the way they would almost influence each other was really tightly delivered. Then as you have just become comfortable you will scream ""Why!"" and you will already know. Very predictable ending, but you have to leave things this way or it's too hard to start writing the sequel. The scares are decent, and the gore is not excessive, but still feels mostly real. The opening feels slow, and that could be to make up for the abrupt ending, or I could just be thinking too much. Totally recommended to suspense/horror style movies, this is so much smarter than the Paranormal Activity style movies. Perfect for a late night with good friends, as this will leave you talking.",Oculus
84,SameirAli,Unnoticed Masterpiece.,8,27 October 2017,"Horror films are plenty. There are great films that involve mirror too. But, this is different. Most of the horror films are just for jump scares, that do not impress me much. Oculus is an amazing movie that plays with your mind as it does with its characters. 21 year old Tim is just released from the mental institution, after the dramatic events that took place in his life. His sister Kaylie reminds him of the promise they made 10 years ago. The past and present are narrated in a mixed up way, yet beautiful. Appreciate the director Mike Flanagan, he has done a great job. Cinematography was also amazing. Terrific performance from the cast, including the Kids. Kudos to the sound design and BGM, it really helped in freaking out the mind.Highly recommended for Horror film fans. Watch it alone, with the lights switched off. Experience it.

85,dfa120374,A Very Decent & Creepy Supernatural Thriller,7,19 January 2015,"Tim Russell has been discharged from a mental institution after being completely recovering from a childhood trauma. Upon being released, Kaylie, Tim's sister, informs him that she's located & bought the ancient mirror they had when they were children believing it to be responsible for the death of their mother. Kaylie's plan is to film evidence that the mirror has some sort of strange power and to then destroy it, so she starts by listing the deaths of the previous owners and the strange circumstances in which they died. Tim reluctantly goes along with Kaylie's plan but when they both start to recall memories surrounding the events from their childhood and witness strange goings on, destroying the mirror may be harder than they think.OK, you may read something about this film and think ""A haunted mirror? Really?!"", but it's not as cheesy as it may sound. Oculus is an enjoyable supernatural thriller that's well filmed, well acted, and has a nice creepy atmosphere with a few good twists & turns. The story is one you have to pay attention to as well because the way it's been put together is that it goes back & forth between the present and past, so if you don't pay attention you can easily get lost.It is quite a slowish movie for the first 45 minutes or so but it didn't feel slow (at least not for me), and one reason it doesn't feel slow is because it does a good job of keeping your interest, especially when even YOU don't know what's real and what's not in the film. I especially liked the way the past & present started to crossover with each other, i.e. a grown Kaylie goes up the stairs as a young Tim comes down. These scenes were done really well and done a good job of showing the past & the present so you could follow both stories at the same time.Also, instead of relying on typical ""jump scares"" to scare you, Oculus relies on a really good eerie atmosphere to unnerve you...and it works nicely as some of the scenes are pretty creepy.Definitely recommended.",Oculus
86,SquigglyCrunch,A Great Movie and a Fantastic Horror,8,17 November 2015,"Going into this movie I'd heard that it was one of the better recent horror movies, and boy was that right. I was extremely surprised to see the low ratings, and still am. Oculus has a really interesting plot. The setting is fantastic, and it makes the movie feel smaller and more personal, which is great. Smaller scale, personal movies are almost always the best (in my opinion). Not only that, but the plot was very well done overall. Even without the horror aspect, it set itself up to be very interesting and delivered on every level of that. The characters are quite well developed as well, which is to be expected considering they're pretty much the only two people in the entire movie. It's very interesting to see them interact, both in adulthood and during the flashbacks during childhood. Which brings me to my next point...The switching between when the two siblings were kids and when they're adults is a very cool way to present the movie, especially towards the end.Overall Oculus is fantastic. With a great plot, great characters, and a very cool presentation, the movie is very well done. It's not your average cheap jump-scare horror. It's genuinely creepy, yet it still manages to function without having to constantly rely on the horror aspect of it. It's really too bad that this movie got such low ratings, because it really is great. In the end I would definitely recommend Oculus, that is, if your willing to poop yourself just a little.",Oculus
87,Rickting,Killer mirror horror has more edge than expected,7,28 November 2014,"Remember the mirror from Snow White? Make it evil. Now multiply. Now you have Oculus, a horror film about a killer mirror and 2 siblings trying to prove on film the mirror is evil. The film is shown with 2 timelines: One in the present, the other from when the mirror drove their parents insane. 2014 seems to have been near completely devoid of good horror films, aside from this and The Babadook (Which I haven't seen) but this ditches gore, cheap jump scares and clichés to create a nasty, chilling and restrained horror movie. In a far more graceful TV to film transition than poor Aaron Paul had with Need For Speed, Karen Gillan is very good as the young woman trying to prove the mirror's diabolical powers. Brenton Thwaites is also very good and the child actors playing their younger selves are surprisingly bearable. Oculus is nothing original and feels a little slight due to its unoriginality and worn formula. It's one of those films which leaves you somewhat cold due to relatively blank characters.While not a massively memorable film, it is one which deserves to be respected. It has its silly moments but for the most part Oculus is full of frightening and bleak psychological horror and the ghosts are actually frightening. The jump scares are thankfully few and it also keeps you guessing. The haunting ending where the sister dies in pretty disturbing, although sadly the door is left wide open for a sequel. This shows the director, Mike Flanagan, knows what horror is and what it should be. He could definitely have a good career and revive the horror genre. It's got a decent script and the decisions the characters make don't feel illogical. The paranormal recording equipment explanation is far more interesting than it is in most horror films. A good, solid if unoriginal horror film which favours dread and terror over gore and jumpiness. It's not the best, but definitely watch this over Ouija or Leprechaun: Origins.7/10",Oculus
88,RevRonster,There was potential but it just ended up a waste of my time and money...,4,16 April 2014,"I know I shouldn't have been surprised since the film was about a haunted mirror and was partially brought into being thanks to the WWE but the trailer actually sold me on this film...but the resulting final product disappointed me greatly.Despite the lame premise about a haunted mirror (seriously, someone actually took that seriously when writing this film), the movie had potential to be decent thanks to themes of past trauma. The movie even felt like it was going to be a horror film where the supernatural element would be ambiguous and make the viewer question whether or not something was really happening or if PTSD reared it's ugly head on the main charactersbut, nope, the movie wants you to make sure that there IS something supernatural going on and decides the only ambiguity it wants is what the mirror is wanting or not wanting the characters to see. This ended up making a film I thought was going for multiple levels of thinking prove to be a one-track plot that, almost accidentally, made itself way too predictable.There was no element of shock or surprise in ""Oculus."" The film takes a slow, methodical approach to its story and while that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it did make all the scares unfold at a snail's pace. The scares came so slowly in the story that, by the time they arrived, my brain has already fully process the supposed frightening element and all sense of creepy that was suppose to arrive with it was now expected and, hence, no longer unsettling or capable of delivering the smallest of chill down my spine.At its core, most horror films are predictable and follow many unspoken rules and formulas but this is often overlooked if tone and atmosphere can be established and we still get scared at the cat jumping out of a closet right before the killer attacks even though we KNOW there's going to be a cat jumping out of the closet right before the killer attacks because it's a horror film staple and people keep their cats in closets in horror films but, thanks to music, lighting and atmosphere, it still delivers it's shock because it's visceral and just leaps out at us. ""Oculus"" didn't have this due to its slower approach but the film also failed at creating atmosphere and seemed to rely way too heavily on low, vibrating tones instead of actual substance and feel. So, when you combine this along with scares that are seen coming 10 minutes before they arrive, the story felt more grinding than scary.The one good element I enjoyed about the film was the acting department. While it was kinda annoying that Karen Gillan was still playing Amy Pond from ""Doctor Who,"" she was still excellent in the part and played well with Brenton Thwaites. However, the person who stole the movie for me was Katee Sackhoff. Her portrayal of the broken women who is succumbing to sadness and the evil power of the mirror and enters into complete hysterics was captivating and became the greatest part of the movie. She was so good, the grossly predictable ending could almost be forgivenalmost.Overall, I think there was some potential to ""Oculus"" but, sadly, it was wasted on lazy storytelling and a plot that couldn't figure out how to best develop itself. In the end, the film just felt lazy and was just a waste of money and time.Hello!

89,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Reflections on Oculus,6,16 April 2014,"Horror film starlets, often known as scream queens, are naïve, shrill victims until, after enough punishment, they get a second wind and turn the tables on their aggressors But Karen Gillan's Kaylie Russell is, from the beginning, assertive and actively intent on stopping her adversary At least in the present time.To say Kaylie and her brother Tim grew up in a dysfunctional family is an understatement... Since we're given all the information up front, it's not a spoiler exactly: dad killed mom after mom had gone toothless and berserk... Sporadic flashbacks of the younger siblings eventually coincide with the main story, where Kaylie, who still owns the house where really bad things occurred, is dead set on facing and exposing her foe, which, in this particular case, is a mirror: all to prove her parents weren't so crazy after all.Billed as a horror flick, OCULUS is really a paranormal mystery/suspense The mystery involving an investigative Kaylie and her reluctant brother figuring out just how much power that antique mirror – able to hypnotize and then slowly kill humans, animals and plants – still has inside the house And the suspense is always palpable, making the audience ready for the next sudden chill: ranging from glimpses of an ominous wraith to screaming hallway chases...But it's not all terrifying: There are bits of dark humor, mostly centered on Kaylie's determination: she's so stubborn, strong-willed and even cruel you can't help but to laugh. And, countered by her passive brother played by Brenton Thwaites, whose somewhat limp performance pales to sis, this is really her show... Through thick and thin, she alone keeps us entertained Too bad the frightful moments are few and far between. And when the demonic presence is finally revealed, appearing outside the mirror image, it has a few friends along, taking away from what could have been a much more contained, and thus way scarier, mindtrip roller-coaster ride.",Oculus

91,ArchonCinemaReviews,Intricate thriller that's slow to start but peaks masterfully at the end,7,23 September 2014,"An antique mirror of malice possessed by the paranormal deceives its owners to fatal effect in the 2014 horror film Oculus.Tim (Brenton Thwaites) is released from a psychiatric institution and deemed no longer a harm to himself or others on his twenty-first birthday. He is thrust into unfinished childhood history when he is discharged into the care of his auction house associate sister Kaylie (Karen Gillian). Told in both past and present, we learn of Tim and Kaylie's troubled past and relationship with a recently sold artifact, a mirror dating back to the 1700's associated with the deaths and misfortune to all families unlucky enough to own it.What unfolds is less horror and more a supernatural thriller invested in constantly bated-breath tension rather than shock and gore. As Oculus's tagline aptly states ""You can't believe what you see because you see what it wants you to see."" The audience journeys down the rabbit hole, unable to trust what they witness with their eyes as the mirror twists and manipulates perception while the plot transpires. Mike Flanagan's concept within Oculus, a film he writes and directs, is tightly woven suspense driven narrative that is an interestingly intricate addition that piggybacks off its successful and popular predecessors – The Conjuring, Insidious and Sinister.Before viewers can get to the delightfully climactic frights they must wade past the arduous and boring and generically standard set up necessary for the effective scares. Karen Gillian obviously acts her way through long winded dialogue tortuously. Brenton Thwaites is a wet blanket. Gillian and Thwaites do not read as siblings and lack any natural and inherent gravitation caused by a mutually experienced checkered history. They are vastly overshadowed by their youthful counterparts during the flashback scenes: Annalise Basso shines as younger Kaylie and Garrett Ryan holds his own against Basso's emotionally powerful performance.Oculus is a winding thriller that grabs audiences in ways they are unaccustomed though parts of the movie will read as classic and expected horror movie formula.More recent releases get reviewed in FULL at our website.",Oculus

93,nitzanhavoc,A fearsome delight!,8,11 January 2015,"It doesn't take being a devout Horror fan to know the role mirrors plays in mankind's inner darker fears. Be it the folklore legends or the psychological difficulty to grasp a reflection as a mere physical phenomenon easily explained by the inherent qualities of that kind of glass, mirrors have ever been the source of phobias and unexplained discomfort.Some of the films which have capitalized on that include Mirrors 1 & 2, and The Broken - the two latter being somewhat underrated in my opinion. However, I believe in terms of mirror horror - Oculus takes the grand prize.The plot story is compelling, fascinating and not without certain twists, leaving the viewer on edge and constantly guessing (although some of the outcomes are predictable to any experienced horror fan). The acting by main actors Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites is almost flawless, Gillan as Kaylie Russel obsessed with proving the existence of a malevolent supernatural force residing in a mirror and Thwaites as her younger 21 year old brother Tim who has spent the last 11 years in a mental hospital for believing just that. However, the spotlight should absolutely be given to younger actors Annalise Basso and Garret Ryan for their impeccable and absolutely dominating performance as young Kaylie and Tim. Their way of showing concern, tears and horror as children in the given situation made want to applaud at the screen.Another great feature of this film is the constant moves between past and presence, some as flashbacks experienced by the main characters and some as half flashbacks half hallucinations. It creates a certain amount of confusion which cannot be ignored, and there may have been a better and more clear way to portrait the past-presence conflicts, but the confusion is laid to rest around the end.As for the name of the film - I had to to search online in order to learn that ""Oculus, plural oculi, from Latin oculus: eye, denotes a circular opening in the centre of a dome or in a wall"". Thank you Wikipedia.All in all - an excellent film which has everything a horror film needs: compelling story, twists, excellent acting, some jump-scares though not too cheap, and very little gore and unnecessarily disgusting shots. Highly recommended!",Oculus

Jump scares are prominent throughout but there is a sort of creepy atmosphere that is underlying at times. Also, when it's your own family that is your greatest threat to your survival, it does add a truly terrifying realization to what the main characters (Kaylie and Time) are facing. The film is carried by the talented and beautiful actress, Karen Gillan as she shines over the supporting cast. To sum up Oculus would to give some credit that its an intense horror film that shows no mercy whatsoever but lacks on measures of originality and plot stability.",Oculus

It is not directly bad, but it is not good enough to be great. (hm, weird way to put it, huh)I don't have that much to say about the movie in general, but it did have one or two (maybe even three) scenes that were very effective, and pretty cringe-worthy. Also I could sort of relate to what happened (in those scenes), and that made it that much more effective, and creepy. It's like, it could actually happen to you. To anyone. That is the strength of this movie.

The acting is fabulous from Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites and the kids. The special effects are fantastic. I was especially blown away by the climax.

The film is just dull and the characters are very wooden and terribly acted. The past and present flipping back and forth is very annoying.

There's dual story lines that parallel each other about a brother and sister documenting the mirror that destroyed their family when they were children and flashbacks when they were children. Both anemic story lines have the feel of a TV episode, but the material with the children fares a lot better. Both actors playing the older characters are weak and this silly premise just works better with young characters. Oculus has no atmosphere, never feels like big screen material and is put together with little flair or style. It's a generic jump scare entry that rarely generates suspense or a scare and why critics gave this one respectable marks over the hundreds of films of its ilk, is beyond me.",Oculus
102,fil-nik09,Not bad,6,23 March 2016,"This is not a bad movie, but it is not great either. It is somewhere in the middle, but I go and give it a rating of six.The movie begins kinda very intriguing as the boy ( who happens to be very cute) leaves the mental institution after 10 years! Of course, you wonder what could he have done to be there locked for ten years?! And it is good that you do not know what actually happened / what he has done to end locked up under the watchful eye of doctors and how is his sister involved in all this... The premise of an evil mirror is good. I liked ( and maybe this is the best part of the movie for me ) when sister started to mention all the victims of the mirror, including the victims in their family. However from there, the movie starts to be hit and miss. I must confess that I could not clearly understand what was a memory, what is present/reality, what is mirror's evil doing and what is imagination ... I also did not understand how the sister ended up in the window with their dead parents when she is alive? Or everything that was going on was his sister's evil doing?I mean, sometimes it is good to keep guessing, but in this case, I'd prefer clear view of things.",Oculus
103,jackmeat,A welcome addition to the horror genre,6,5 September 2014,"It's nice to sit back and watch a movie that intends to scare and make you think without trying to give a gorefest. As you all know, I love me some brutal violence, but it isn't always necessary. This movies focus is on a mirror that basically encompasses and possesses those that gaze into it. When a family is entranced by the mirror, and the parents are killed (i'll leave it at that to not spoil to much) the kids who witness the deaths are now the focal point of discovering what really happened. The daughter, who is now 23, purchases the mirror to finally find out the truth, back in the house that they grew up in. Karen Gillian does an admirable job acting as a completely obsessed young adult(at parts she was just as creepy as the supernatural parts). Kaylie (Gillian) picks up her younger brother(played by Brenton Thwaites) who recently was released from a mental institution (you will see why) to unravel the mystery. Through various tests, and evidence collections, the two embark on proving the mirror holds the evil/spirit that caused the deaths of their parents among countless others before. The movie uses flashbacks to when they were children to explain how they survived the first encounter. The seamless transitions of these do well to further the story and keep you captivated with the plot. The slight amounts of blood are used in a way that more makes you cringe then be grossed out. I have to give the editors props for keeping these transitions coherent (slightly unbelievable at times, but it is a movie) and help keep things moving until the end. All and all, a very welcome addition to the genre. Worth the watch.6,4/10",Oculus
104,troyputland,Horrifying mainly for its family troubles.,8,19 May 2015,"Oculus beats most conventional horrors with an extraordinary sibling pairing and a juggling with the past and the present. Kaylie (Gillan) sets out to prove to the world that a celestial presence within a mirror killed her parents, not her brother. She's hard as nuts, which goes against every femme-fatale/horror genre adage there is. Her brother Tim (Thwaites) faired less well, having treatment to see him through troubled times. These siblings occupy diametric motives; Tim believes it be a facade, conjured up in their youthful minds, whereas Kaylie's determination drives her as well as our own curiosity. Oculus is frightening, playing on many fears; of the dark, family troubles and a unwarranted presence. This film differs from most horrors, blending two time spans following the young and present day relatives. The lead up to the disaster and the subsequent teasing of the 'monster' in the mirror are stylistically overlapped with amazing cuts and visuals. Support from Cochrane and Sackhoff as the siblings' parents are foreboding as a couple on the brink of collapsing. The worst fear of them all? Seeing their parents' relationship slowly deteriorate. Oculus is a cut above the horrors smothering Hollywood these days.",Oculus

His sister kaylie tells him that she found a mirror that wax the source of a traumatic experience that caused them to lose their patents as kids which resulted in Tim being sent to a mental hospital, one of the aspects that I loved about the film was how the events of the present also parallel with the events that happened in the past,",Oculus
106,loomis78-815-989034,a Stand out cerebral Horror film that truly Scares,10,14 May 2014,"Tim Russell (Thwaites) is released from an institution that has held him since he was 10 years old. He was accused of killing his Father (Rory Cochrane) who had killed his mother (Katee Sackhoff) in the family home. His older sister Kaylie (Gillan) meets him upon his release and plans to hold him to his promise he made the night he was put away. Kaylie and Tim believe the ancient mirror their father bought and brought into their home has an evil entity in it and is the real cause of everything that happened. Kaylie owns the parents' house now and has tracked down the mirror and put it in the exact same spot. She is clever if not a little off her rocker when she has the entire place set up to prove that what they saw as kids is real. Shaken Tim just wants to be better, years of therapy has washed away much of it, but he follows his sister in her quest into the supernatural. Told partially through flashbacks when they were younger, the treacherous mirror isn't the blame it's the entity inside. Kaylie watches it kill animals, plants, mess with temperature, jam cell phone signals and set an ominous presence in the house. Up and coming Horror filmmaker Mike Flanagan fresh off his low budget but excellent ""Absentia"", makes this film scary from start to finish. Even an early scene with figures at a museum under sheets is unnerving even though it is a bit telegraphed. Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan as the young Kaylie and Tim are just as good as the two leads and this helps a bunch. Flanagan layers his story (Co-written with Jeff Howard) with scary bits but never makes the mistake of overplaying his hand. The mirror's entity is able to mess with people's minds and make them see what may not be there. The goal of the entity is to capture the spirits which it kills and hold them in the mirror. This makes for some unsettling moments with Mother and the kids. The flashback scenes are truly frightening as the entity slowly possesses the family's Father who eventually chains up the Mother in the room. Flanagan's pacing is perfect, and the end reveal is shocking and chilling beyond belief. The movie really captures the horror of the mind with the entity playing mind games up to the very end. Is this all real or not? The ending which leaves it open for another, is clever and never answers if it is all in their heads or all real. A classy, supernatural horror film that never forgets it is still a horror film and delivers scare after scare with some blood as well.",Oculus

108,TheRedDeath30,Mediocre Movie Passing Itself Off as Surrealism for Dummies,6,31 August 2014,"I really enjoyed Flanagan's ABSENTIA. I thought that he did some really impressive things in that movie with a very low budget and showed the promise to be a rising horror director to keep an eye on, so I was really looking forward to OCULUS.I was somewhat disappointed, then, in this movie as I thought that ABSENTIA was actually a better film. Here, we get a young director who, for lack of a better way of saying it, is doing some really great things with second-hand tools. By that I mean that there is enough here to say that the director is still capable of doing some impressive work. The editing and shot selections show someone who really knows how to craft a film, but the final product just left me wondering what all the good reviews were watching.The main problem here is that the movie never really goes any further than the introduction. You could, essentially, watch the first 15 minutes of this film and you know all that you need to know about the movie. There is no journey here, there is no knowledge earned, there is no great denouement.The movie spends a whole lot of its' run time in a dizzying maze of time play. To quote FUNNY FARM ""there were flash backs, flash forwards and I think I even saw a flash sideways"". The story plays with space and time in ways that loop them in upon each other and leave the viewer struggling to catch up on where we now stand. These flashbacks are all inter-spliced with fuzzy reality, as well. The characters, and as a result the viewer, is never sure if what we're seeing is really happening, happened in the past, or never happened at all. There is nothing wrong with this method of film, in and of itself. In the works of Roman Polanski, or a movie like DONNIE DARKO, this is done to great effect. To make this worth the viewer's investment, though, we need to be brought on a journey where we are learning something about the characters or the past. Instead, we are learning nothing. We know, right off the bat, that Mom goes crazy, Dad shots her dead and Son shoot Dad before being sent to the loony bin. This is established in the first few minutes. The flashbacks showing the events don't add anything new, at all. There is no twist, there is no extra knowledge to be gleaned. We are simply watching events play out that we already have established will happen.So, are the flashbacks, then, used to bring us to a point where we are ready for some great reveal in the present tense? No, that isn't coming either. The Sister goes to great lengths to set up surveillance equipment and monitoring to record the events, knowing all the time that the spirit in the mirror is capable of altering these things anyways, eliminating their very purpose. The entire plot plays out with the ending clearly in sight from the beginning. If you didn't foresee the Wily Coyote moment where the Sister is killed by her own elaborate trap and that the loony brother would be blamed for everything, you are not very clever. So, we spend almost two hours watching past events we already knew happened to set up a finale that we already saw coming. The only thing that would make that worth it is a truly memorable journey along the way, but that's not there either. This is just a random sampling of spooky imagery that any horror fan has seen over and over again. Even some of the shock moments like the lightbulb eating are really telegraphed. Who didn't see that coming? It wasn't a shock, just an excuse to inject a little gore. Add in some pale ghosts who look like rejects from THE RING and you have a movie that probably really impressed a lot of horror novices, but didn't do a lot for me.I'm probably being too harsh here. On the other hand, in a real world, 80% of movies are ""average"" right? That's the definition of average. That defines that few that are really good and the few that suck bad. If we start slapping 10s on every movie, ratings lose their value. Average can be entertaining, it's just not special.",Oculus

Unfortunately I've seen tons of these. It really is a formula: you have an evil mirror (this film)/doll/entity/teapot/ whatever that wants people (mostly families with 2 children) in a large isolated house to die so it can harvest their souls, but not before it scares them witless. The evildoers accomplish this by using visions or illusions to trick family members into killing each other or themselves. That being said this really is one of the better ones but don't expect to see anything you haven't seen before. So 0 points for originality and 9 points for execution.",Oculus

111,Catharina_Sweden,Not very impressive,4,15 June 2014,"I was not impressed by this. First of all: there was no real story. It began interesting, with the ancient mirror - but then there was no real explanation to the mystery. Which was such a pity, as so much more could have been made with it - and also with the wonderful old mansion house, which has quite right for a ghost-story. It was mostly a lot of confused scenes, the time between 11 years ago and the present getting more and more mixed-up, and a lot of gore and unpleasantness. Also very predictable.I suppose many people have already pointed out, that it borrowed a lot from ""The Shining""..? The actors were quite good though, also the child-actors (which is unusual), and there were also some good scares - of the type when you suddenly get to see something scary. Nothing subtle. Good enough to watch alone on your computer if you find a free download, but not to pay a cinema ticket for.",Oculus
112,mistoppi,"Well made film, and an intriguing story",7,6 December 2015,"One of the strong points of Oculus is that what happened to them as children isn't clearly stated right at the beginning. Their childhood is revealed slowly along the film, with series of flashbacks. Flashbacks are a very effective choice. This is what makes the story more intriguing, and the viewer wants to know everything. Not revealing everything about the mirror in their first conversation creates also an aura of mystery around the mirror, and it's much more realistic than Kaylie and Tim having a conversation where they state every little detail. It's better to show than to tell.The horror in Oculus plays with your mind. When the characters do something, only to realise they didn't do it... When they think something is real, but it isn't... It's better, scarier and much more effective than any ghost the mirror might cast.The flashbacks also create an effective way to play with the characters' (and the audience's) minds. The mirror doesn't need to make the flashbacks, they are in their head already. The film very skilfully mixes past and present. It definitely is effective, but it might get slightly confusing. It's hard to tell sometimes what in the flashbacks during the last third of Oculus really happened, and what was changed by the present.Oculus is also very well shot. Some of the angles used are mesmerizing, capturing the enchantment of a character or an object - or capturing how a character is enchanted by the object. The cinematography shows important details and makes the movie look simply beautiful when needed, and horribly gruesome when needed. Oculus is worth a watch, but if you are experienced in the horror genre, you might find it predictable and typical. is a good enough horror film. It isn't boring, even if the beginning is slow. But towards the end more and more things happen and more and more is revealed. That keeps the viewers on their seats.",Oculus
113,nesfilmreviews,"Some impressive qualities, but ultimately falls short.",6,12 April 2014,"Director Mike Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard expand on their original 30-minute short film about a lethal piece of furniture ""Oculus: Chapter 3"" to a feature-length film. While it's a cut above the usual paranormal thriller, its 105 minute runtime doesn't dramatically improve on its mysterious element and it falls short on dread and tension. While ""Oculus"" slowly develops an unsettling story that cleverly undermines an age-old horror-film cliché, it's never quite as scary or as memorable as one might have hoped. After shooting his father and spending years in psychiatric care, Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites), reunites with his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan), who claims that an antique mirror in their father's study was what destroyed their family, as well as the families of many owners before them. Tim reluctantly agrees to help Kaylie document the mirror's effects, but all goes awry when it begins to play with their perceptions- intermingling past and present, memory and reality, and forcing them to witness again their parents' violent relationship, with devastating results. What's unique about ""Oculus"" is its structure, which cuts back and forth between Tim and Kaylie in 2012 and their experiences 10 years earlier. Flanagan daringly cross cuts between flashbacks and the present, and even sometimes unities the two story lines in the same shot. Flanagan uses the back story to inform the audience of the details of how this started, while at the same time using it to terrorize Tim and Kaylie, who aren't quite sure if what they are seeing -- and doing -- is real or not. Flanagan creates a number of eerie visual parallels between the past and present, but eventually the slow-burn suspense sequences and sudden shocks become increasingly repetitive. Throughout the film's slow build-up, Flanagan effectively incorporates some creepy images and the film convincingly earns its frights the old- fashioned way. However, the third act offers an escalation in action accompanied with a scene of shock that doesn't intensify or enhance its predictable, lackluster finale. To his credit, Flanagan takes a dubious premise further than most could. That being said, next time just smash the damn mirror.",Oculus
114,FairlyAnonymous,The first horror movie in years that I consider to be good,7,27 September 2014,"First things first, I never saw the trailer to this movie. I had no idea what it was about or anything. From now on I think I might do this, because it really changed the experience of this movie for me.What makes Oculus good is that it understands for a good horror movie you need a good premise and good psychology. The movie isn't ghosts or anything like, it is simply ""supernatural"". The closest thing this reminded to was the SCP concept where a supernatural item has powers beyond understanding. The was a relief because I was afraid that the movie would pull the old ghost routine on us and just leave it at that. However, the movie actually decides to leave the ""mirror"" a mystery. By the end of the movie, we don't know anything more about it other than its capabilities.The plot follows Kaylie Russel who has been obsessed with finding a very specific mirror for years, because she is positive that the mirror is responsible for the death of her mother, father, and many people throughout history. She tries to convince her brother (who was just released from a mental institution) that the mirror is very powerful, and while he doesn't believe her at first, strange things do start to happen. The interesting aspect about the film is that the mirror's only power is to give people insanity. This means that the brother and the sister both very well could be insane (Genetics). After awhile that stops becoming a possibility, but the movie uses a lot of disorienting and interesting shots and transitions from scene to scene to make the movie very engaging. A good thing about this movie is that the actors are all likable. The worst thing a horror movie can do is have characters that you don't care about, however, in this film the characters are the ones you are rooting for. They have motivation, they trust each other, they want revenge on this mirror, and they are working together to stop it.The one thing that separates Oculus from the recent horror movie trend is the lack of ""jump scares"". I will admit I wish the movie had at least one jump scare for old times sake, but this movie literally has no jump scares. This means that all of this movie's scares come from psychology and atmosphere.All in all, Oculus is worth a watch. Don't put research into it, because it has some twists up its sleeve.",Oculus

The mirror starts to exert an evil influence on the father and mother resulting in the mother going mad and being chained up. Eventually the parents attempt to kill the children. The father in a brief moment of sanity after the mother is killed gets the boy to shoot him.The boy is placed in am asylum and eventually things that there was no evil force at work and is released, waiting for him is his sister who has through her job at an auctioneers managed to transfer the mirror to their old house and wants to kill the mirror.The sister has spent a lot of time researching the mirror which has a history of gory deaths linked to it, at the house she has constructed an anchor on a timer to smash the mirror and several cameras to show that it was exerting an evil influence. I will leave the ending for people to watch.Overall a decent watch, more of a mild horror reflected in it's 15 rating. Some posters giving low ratings accuse the protagonists of acting illogically. Well logically you would get as far away from the mirror as possible but then you would not have a movie. To make a film people will go into an empty house alone.",Oculus
116,robsta23,"Well-done, but Not the Most Entertaining (Frightening) Movie",7,13 July 2015,"This ""horror"" film did not scare me too much; it was pretty formulaic, mainly trying to get screams from startling or jolting moments. However, thinking about certain aspects of this film it was actually fairly smart for a generic horror film - I'd call it more of a psychological thriller.The haunting object of the movie is the mirror, but more focus is placed on the characters than the mirror itself, and for that I say bravo. For the protagonists we have Kaylie and Tim, and we are introduced to Tim by having him explain a dream of an event of his childhood which he now seems to take responsibility for, and it is for this reason that he is now able to leave the mental hospital in which he has been staying for a long period of time.We get the truth behind this story of how Time and Kaylie's family was affected by the mirror as the story of the present unfolds, and the present story revolves around proving the mirror is haunted and trying to destroy it. Flashbacks blend in perfectly with the present as the same camera angles are used to see two different events many times within the film.Another smart aspect of this film is that Tim actually tries to be rational since he has been in a mental institution for some time, and he relates the story back to more realistic situations rather than the horror story he and his sister experienced as kids. For example, he convinces himself that his father was having an affair when they saw a ""strange lady"" in his office, and he convinces himself that his family had to put their dog down instead of him disappearing according to Kaylie.One major flaw in this movie: they have a device to smash into the mirror with great force, yet they put it on a timer, and it is confusing why they put the timer on for so long and when they want to strike the mirror. Why don't they just flip the switch when they are both at a safe distance from the mirror and the mirror-killing- machine? I mean really, why did nobody consider this?The ending of the film really got me, but I will not spoil it for you. It made me think more not because it clearly left room for a sequel, but because the ending was very similar/parallel to the start of the film.

I loved how real time and flashbacks alternated and came together at many points showing me as watcher slowly what really happened without needing to go for constant jump scares or random supernatural happenings. The ending while it did make sense, I didn't really like it. With a better ending I would have rated it even more. Very good acting from the cast especially from the girl who played the child version of the sister.",Oculus
120,foxtografo,Incoherent random stuff,3,30 September 2014,"To begin with, I didn't like the casting. Not because of the actors themselves, but if you're going to watch a whole movie about two characters (out of 5 in the whole movie) at two different ages, at least you want them to look a bit alike. This bugged me a lot from the beginning, the two siblings didn't look at all like their kid versions. After letting this aspect go, it was interesting the scene when the girl sets all the traps for the mirror, and makes you doubt if everything was in her mind or it really happened. Good set up, I wanted to see what would happen. Nothing happened. It was all for nothing! All the plans went to hell in a blink and from there, long minutes of random, incoherent stuff until you get to the dull end. So, if you spend so much time showing the character is so prepared, why ignore all that and carry on with a typical cliché story? The director/writer made no sense at all. The acting wasn't bad, but the story was just random and didn't leave any chance to the viewer to figure out anything or make sense of anything. The creepy characters from the mirror looked good, but that's all the 3 point's I give to the movie. Really bad. Fair acting and photography, fair story, bad script. I would avoid it, there's nothing on this movie you'll feel it worth watching.",Oculus
121,DustinRahksi,4102 allizdog,5,12 April 2014,"I haven't written one of these in a while, expect some BS.First I'd like to address the trailers, Hmm... I only remember the one, I guess I wasn't the only one in this boat. The audience gave some positive hype to it, the Youngin's are into it, I smell new life blood for Godzilla. For me personally, I wanted to cry because it was best thing I've experienced in a while, can't wait.So now the film, it's Meh. It wasn't a total waste of money, but also wasn't money well spent. I'm only 18, it didn't effect me, but it effected the grown adult audience, that's not good. The two characters had only one set of emotions each. The sister was obsessed, the brother was snivelling. The beginning was boring, the middle got my attention, the 3rd act lost me completely. The two time lines running parallel was just awe-full, just show us what happens and stop trying to seem cool and brilliant, it sucks. There was no suspense or scares, or intelligent scares. Instead it used painful violence to try to put you at unease. And the whole unhappy ending, protagonist losing bit just doesn't work anymore. Same goes for the happy ending/fake out ending. The only way to get a solid reaction is to go out hard-core like.Ghosts/scares: Sub par generic I guess, I mean I forget them already. The only part that came close to being disturbing was the mom being mutilated and chained up like a dog, but literally half a second later, and we see she is just possessed by a demon and has the intelligence of a house fly. Way to ruin that scare, I thought that was going to be some hard core stuff right there.So that's Oculus... I think, I don't know I already forget it. It's a bad year for horror and this is the best so far, but the Godzilla trailer was awesome, go pay ten dollars to see that trailer on the big screen.",Oculus
122,FKDZ,Well directed but overly confusing and without clear intent.,5,19 September 2021,"This is pretty slow burn in general. It's not your traditional horror movie in which there are a lot of scares. The first half of the movie is incredibly slow. It picks up once they get the cameras going.I was really interested going into this movie, the whole mirror concept sounded smart. But it's not that smart, it's kept entirely too vague and has no personality or intend except ''kill''. This and the two timeline stories + hallucinations made for a real confusing mess of a movie. And I know, that was intended, but it actually just became an annoyance towards the end.The horror, there is some bodily horror done very well, I'm not a fan of that personally. The actual ''monster'' are mundane and the make-up is poorly done. It looks fake and feels fake. The glowing eyes don't help. It's not gonna get scarier than the intro of the movie where you can see a ''monster'' for a tiny second.The acting is pretty good overall. But nothing really stood out. The characters though, still lots of questions. Especially the dad and why he could not snap out of it like the other characters could, why was he weak...etc too vague.The music was good, lots of bass and strong undertones. The sound design had some flaw, gunshots sounded cheap and there were two instances of a door being shut and having a really noticeably cheap ''swoosh'' sound effect that just made me laugh.Directing was great. Looks good.The ending is a huge letdown for me personally. Not so much that I wanted a happy ending, but that it just kind of ''happend'' and was the most easy way out of the story for a horror. Also the lack of any backstory on the mirror and it's possession or curse was annoying.",Oculus
123,WubsTheFadger,Oculus,7,7 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, after watching some really good horror films like The Babadook, The Witch, The Conjuring 1 and 2, and a few other, I went into this film with high hopes. The film didn't let me down. The story is told in short flashbacks that connect to the future storyline. The plot is at time very dark and disturbing. The film carefully tells us about the children's experiences with the mirror and how it relates to them now. The atmosphere the film has is haunting and mysterious. The ending is shocking and stunning. The acting is very good. Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Katee Sackhoff, Rory Cochrane, and Garrett Ryan all perform very well. Annalise Basso, who plays young Kaylie, performs the best in all of her scenes.The pacing is a little slow in the beginning but picks up as the film progresses. The runtime is short which is good.One bad thing about this film is that it is not very scary. I really was never frightened.Pros: Dark and disturbing story, great atmosphere, good ending, good acting, a great performance by Annalise Basso, and a short runtimeCons: Slow pacing in the beginning of the film and the film was not very scaryOverall Rating: 7.1",Oculus
124,spencergrande6,Atmosphere and Rhythms,8,15 May 2014,"Oculus is a movie full of atmosphere and rhythms. As directed by Mike Flanagan, there's a steady building undercurrent of dread at its core, something that works so gradually you forget how silly the initial premise is. Kaylie (a fun Karen Gillan) takes killing the eponymous mirror seriously, but she's full of wit and joy so it doesn't hang as needless portentousness on the audience. Tim (Brendon Thwaites), her brother, is the voice of reason that actually manages to goose the movie with some moments of genuine curiosity (is it the mirror that's crazy or them? It's actually an impressive feat that Flanagan makes you buy that these characters could indeed be crazy, and not just being used as unnecessary plot padding).Edited flawlessly (also by Mike Flanagan), cutting between past and present on scenes that feel natural, all while building to a surreal and sustained climax of unease and terror. Even if it is a bit of letdown (the filmmaking makes you think you are watching something just a tad more exciting than it really is. It hits very familiar beats on its way to a predictable ending).What's ultimately most impressive is that this movie full of unease and steady movements, and plot and character development (the movie casually asks questions about perception and reality, especially within the context of marriage; a point which Katee Sackhoff in particular helps drive home), and not based on any existing property, while also having an R rating (and not a very hard one at that; which is a compliment, evoking more like last year's ""The Conjuring"") got a nationwide release. It's too bad it didn't do better at the box office, but the mere fact this exists as a theatrical movie is a good thing.The Newton Brothers did the score, and while it's not a very diverse or far reaching score, it is one that operates on the same level as the movie's pacing. The repeated use of snyth-y sounding ""wuhb wuhbs"" was genuinely hypnotizing and worked extremely well within the context of the movie.",Oculus
125,hoytyhoyty,Delightfully twisted,7,12 July 2014,"Actual vote: 8/10. It needed boosting.1 point off - I only give 10/10 to films that I would buy and keep on the shelf. Not just hire and give back. There are not many of these.1 point off - I personally had gripes about the plot, but that's just me and my tastes. If it had been me, I would have done a couple of things differently. But hey, it wasn't me.Very good film.For Doctor Who fans - you have the impossibly pretty Karen Gillan (slightly less charming than usual due to having an American rather than her native scots accent). She is a little monochromatic, as always. But she plays with force, as always.For BSG fans - you have the wonderful Katee Sackhoff. This is one of the better performances of her career. Very pithy and convincing.And beyond that... Can't say a *single* thing about the details without ticking the Spoiler box.So here we go with keywords.Gripping. Creepy. Unorthodox.

126,rprince-832-6294,Cliché but original? I guess so!,7,11 January 2015,"-Oculus is a suspense/thriller/horror that follows two young adults trying to figure out how to rid of a mirror that has caused 45 deaths. The film shows both their struggle and their previous encounter with the mirror when they were younger.-Oculus is another film this year that took a cliché concept and ran with it. I was impressed.-The story is somewhat predictable, but the editing and the ending still keep it very interesting.-The pace is really good because of its stellar editing.-The acting is good, but has a few iffy moments.-The characters are really interesting, but as interesting as any character in a horror film.-The music is creepy, but almost too predictable.-One of the things that impressed me was how creepy the film was. Like The Babadook, it took opportunities to use scares that were not just jumpscares. There were some jumpscares and they were super predictable, but they are followed by something else either creepy or scary or normal, that was not expected.-Oculus is rated R, but was not a very strong R. It had a PG-13 amount of language, no nudity, and not a lot of violence. So it probably could have gotten away with a heavy PG-13 if it were not partially about terrorized kids. Speaking of which, it was not as unnerving as The Babadook in an uncomfortable way, but it also could not go for things like scares in daylight because of it.-Oculus felt original and was hard to predict because of its spin on eerie scenes. It had a cliché premise but offered much in the way of editing and finale. I enjoyed Oculus more than Exodus, so I would actually have to give Oculus a 7.5. I will say The Babadook was better overall, but less enjoyable. I would definitely get Oculus in a $5 bin. (It is on Netflix, so I don't have to though)",Oculus

This is just another in a long line of modern horror movies from the past decade or so, where it is full of jump scares and bad CGI ghosts. Ugh. Dumb, boring, and about as non-scary as they come. The best part is the first third or so, with some actual suspense developed, but it never follows through and turns into a generic ghost horror movie from there. The actors all play standard parts, nothing surprising, but the little boy character was mildly amusing, as he always seemed to be scared out of his wits, no matter what was going on in the scene. They could be having a calm normal morning breakfast, and he was scared as heck! I didn't pay a cent to see this, saw it at a free screening, and I think I got what I paid for.",Oculus

The filter cutoff is at about 50%, this creates tension, but it's a subdued tension. The whole first half of the movie revolves around an inanimate object and it works. Great buildup to the climax. There is lots of tense moments and you are basically on the edge of your seat the whole movie. The way it keeps moving back and forth in time is clever and it is done in a way that is not confusing. The downfall of this technique has been that it gives away too much of the story, but it works perfectly in this movie. There is also just a slight touch of dry humour that permeates the tension every so often.",Oculus

I mean let's be real this is basically like a student film version of Hill House.Lucky us he had his story telling perfected by the time we got to Hill House because here it has plot holes and wobbly endings.Oculus has a Flanagan worthy original story and great acting (especially for a horror movie) the premise is great and it's executed well but it kind of falls of the rails on the final act. We get to the end, the predictable happens, there are a ton of pot holes and ultimately no real pay off for everything we endured for the last hour+ to make it worth the price of admission.That's okay thought you can't get them all right and it's worth having the sloppy ending here for the beautiful ending he later crafted for Hill House.So it is still worth a watch just to basically see an earlier draft of the Haunting of Hill House.",Oculus

Jump scares are kept at a minimum. I was actually surprised at the less number of jump scares. For a new movie, this is pretty weird I thought. Some distracting elements - the lead actress is too much eye candy and I think maybe she was not appropriate for the role. She is a good actress but she is too good looking. They could have selected a less distracting actress. The guy is OK. Both of them look straight out of Beverly hills 90210 and that is not exactly a good thing. Maybe a more normal looking pair? Since mirrors have always freaked me out, the premise is interesting for me. The child actors are pretty good, I was impressed with them. Their acting elevates the movie from being just an average horror movie. I can't put my finger on it but somehow I didn't LOVE it. I can't really pinpoint one reason why. It is a well made movie which delivers. So my rating is based on my personal feelings. 7/10",Oculus

Sometimes it's just gory to be gory and I'm not a huge fan of movies like that. I like the movies that make you think or the ones that could possibly or have already happened. This is one that I had no idea what the ending was going to bring.Throughout the movie there are things that happen and you're not sure what's reality and what is just imagination. The mirror seems to have a mind of its own and uses your fear against you.Not until the very end did I sense what was about to happen.

133,MovieProductions,Please name me one mirror movie that doesn't leave you perplexed,6,14 April 2014,"**1/2 out of ****Upon reading the reviews, a lot of them entailed that while ""Oculus"" is told in a non-linear fashion, that it makes sense in the end, and that everything is wrapped up in a nice little package. I think we saw a different movie. ""Oculus"" revolves around brother and sister trying to figure out if the mirror is responsible for a tragic death that occurred, which landed brother into the loony bin. Now what I liked about ""Oculus"" is what a lot of critics did as well: Mixing the past with the present, sometimes with events that are a figment of one of the character's imaginations, or seen from a character's different perspective. This leaves what could have been a typical ""something went bump in the night!"" story, behind. But why this doesn't work: It feels like there's no plot. Rather than having your exposition, your rising action, climax, etc., it's like there's no climax, there's no ""ah! that's why this makes sense"" moment. It's like watching fragments of a movie, with no complete picture.One thing I must say is that the acting wasn't all-around spectacular like many lead me to believe. The sister was at times a bit much, and her ""theories"" got to get a little out of hand. It reminded me of those overt-religious movies that get too preachy. But other than a few times she got out of hand, she was solid. The brother was serviceable but nothing amazing. The father was a really good actor, but the mother was a little wooden. The little kid actors though stole the show. I might even start to believe the child actors were better than the grown-ups!Now what's shocking about ""Oculus"" is how light it is on scares, and surprisingly, how much it relied on jump scares and cheap thrills. While every reviewer out there will try to hinder this fact, I'm going to tell you while the way it's presented is a little different, it's essentially the same scare-vehicle. You have people coming in and out of scenes, the whole ""gotcha!"" moments, etc. It was like ""Insidious"". But I have to hand it to the filmmakers, there was a few times I was watching ""Oculus"" where I was flabbergasted. What a few reviewers picked up on was how pitch-perfect the editing was, and I agree. Studying editing myself, and cutting together some amateur videos, there was not one shot I would change, editing-wise. Everything ran at the length it should have, I liked transitions, etc. But as far as direction goes, the beginning and end leave a lot to be desired. I didn't have as much as an issue with the beginning as most people had, but some of the stuff just did not work. The dialog got to be cheesy, character motifs were pretty questionable, it felt at times like a rough draft. And that ending? I might not have taken a Psychology course, but even I don't think everything fit like a perfect package.What stays the same in all these mirror movies are the complex structures, and I don't know why. ""Mirrors"" which came out maybe half a decade ago was completely nonsensical and rather dry. ""Oculus"" was more interesting you could argue, but still kind of perplexing and nonsensical in its structure. I think the biggest problem with ""Oculus"" is not that it wasn't what I expected, in a matter of fact, that's what might get a lot of non-horror fans and general moviegoers to see this one. It's the fact that it is way too silly to take seriously at times. We already had to suspend our belief with the mirror already, but there's some instances that took me out of the film.While it sounds like I found this movie highly problematic, I will say that it didn't disappoint me to the point where I regret seeing it. Not exactly praise, or a reason to get you to see this movie, but it's definitely different. I just wouldn't go in expecting something among the greats such as ""The Conjuring"". If you expect more like this year's ""Insidious"" or maybe even ""Sinister"", you'll walk away a little more fulfilled. I'm going to give ""Oculus"" a mild recommendation and advise a matinée.",Oculus
134,kclipper,A subtle and psychological tale of the supernatural,8,25 August 2014,"Here's an excellent example of storytelling that is mind-boggling, suspenseful and terrifying all at the same time with Director, Mike Flanagen at the helm bringing his ghostly conceptual short stories into a full-length tale of twisted madness. The screenplay is perfectly executed as mental patient, Tim Russell (Scott Graham) is released from the mental ward upon accepting the fact that his crimes were the result of paranoid delusions instead of the malicious supernatural influence of the antique mirror in his father's study during his tragic childhood. Sister, Kaylie (Karen Gillan) is out to prove years later that the mirror is responsible for the tragedies rather than the acts of confused and psychologically brainwashed younger brother Tim.This exercise in hallucinatory mind puzzles and flashback plot devices is handled quite well by a talented cast and inspired director that blends past and present together into a solid horror story. Although the action seems convoluted and incoherent at times, the final result of this ambitious little terror tale targets a more focused and intelligent audience that will without a doubt be invested in the story through and through to the end. Its a subtle ghost story played out for psychological thrill effect rather than the run-of-the-mills blood and gore torture porn that most horror flicks seem to display today. This brings us back to the ""cursed antiques"" genre of 1980's, and its ability to confuse and hypnotize makes it stand out from the rest of the lot for 2013. This echoes the Stephen King story, ""The Reaper's Image"", 90's horror film, ""Mirror Mirror"" and ""Friday the 13th The Series"" not to mention many other genre films and short stories. Some audiences will find this to be tedious and silly, nevertheless, I found it challenging and pulsating. I also recommend ""The Conjuring"" for fans of old school ""cursed objects"" supernatural ghost stories. Relax and forgive it for its imperfections, and you'll find it engaging. More shallow-headed audiences will not appreciate its style and challenging structure.",Oculus
135,gerry_barnaby,Highly disturbing Psychological horror film,9,16 May 2014,"The genius of Oculus isn't the concept (haunted mirror) but the screenplay of disjointed story telling and flashbacks mixing into a coherent and perhaps a complex story. Think of it like a toned down Inception. It's effective because you eventually feel and question what is reality and not. Now your think this is just going to be a main steam or mediocre horror which this is far from it, this is a highly disturbing Psychologically charge film really step in the paranormal world of reflections & beyond. From the begin it set the tone as you see Tim played by Brenton Thwaites discharged from a psychiatric hospital, having come to believe that there were no supernatural events involved in his parents' deaths. while his sister Kaylie played by the beautiful Karen Gillan, meanwhile, has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of this creepy but strange mirror, obsessively documenting the lives and deaths of everyone who's ever owned it. This is where this film start to get extremely creepy & disturb as you start seeing flash back of what happen before the event of there family but i found some of the future event disturbing more than some of the past event although the ghostly figures you see are very Psychologically disturb & put a chill down your spine. Your probable find yourself trying to compare this film to mirror but this is original in its own right, the very creepy tone the thing that happen its like the mirror knows what they are doing, it manipulated them to protect itself & making them see thing which gives this film its edge & feeling of a much darker tone than the film mirrors i thought. Unlike the conjuring this isn't as fast pace as that film but still a great horror film to watch, despite most of the bad review this film has got this is a very clever film to get under your skin with some seriously intense Psychological moment when you see something the tension starts mountain like most Psychological film do, this is why Psychological horror are the best horror film for me because they can be truly frightening. I've got say Katee Sackhoff has the face for horror film not in a bad way, she has this presence of looking menacing in this film which make her brilliant for this type of supernatural role.if you looking for a extremely creepy film with a great twist this is one film not to be missed, with this concept of the mirror's creepy wife's tale: See the mirror hanging there Face of silver, Frame of black Oculus of glass, i Starr.... I can feel you starring back I hear your voice, i believe your lies, a window, a portal, a darkened door Should you claim my starring eye, my soul your hold, forever more inside. After watch this film your never look at a mirror in the same way again because your be wondering when you Starr into a mirror, is the reflection starring back at you really you or is it a much darker soul starring back at you.That is the way this film's concept make you feel in a dark Psychological way.",Oculus
136,MattBirk,Scary? No...... Engrossing? Absolutely!,8,16 April 2014,"I just want to say, I'm a huge Horror movie fan and I tend to grade them the hardest or most critical. However, Oculus turned out to be a pleasant surprise! Although the movie itself was not the least bit scary, it was unique and psychologically rich!I will definitely be watching this movie again when it comes out on VOD. The movie does a fantastic job pushing through the history of the mirror without boring the viewer or coming on too strong. Oculus does a great job creating a sense of ""power"" behind the mirror or a potential of power that the mirror possesses. The slow shots turning to the mirror really create a sense of wonder about the strength of the mirror. Also using current technology in the film gives it a nice touch of reality. This is something a lot of horror movies are doing these days, introducing technology to disprove or counter a dark force.The movie really is a hallucinogen type trip! Its almost hypnotic and you cant help but be pulled into the story! Whats real and what isn't? That is the main theme the movie bestows upon you. Th music was amazing to say the least! I think music is a huge part for horror movies and this movie did a great job. Its not actual songs, but it uses single notes or keys on repeat that add to the anticipation. This was one of the best aspects of the movie and I cant stress that enough! Its something you will most definitely pick up on and enjoy.A few quibbles would have to be that the sister comes off a little strong (yes that probably is the point, but still a bit heavy). Also the movie focuses heavily on flashbacks and that becomes slightly tiresome. I would have preferred to see more of the present day timeline than the flashbacks. Nearly 1/3 of the movie is flashback scenes and I felt that was a bit too much. But then again, it was an integral part to the story line.Again this movie was hardly scary, but being a horror movie does not necessarily mean it has to scary you. This gets you thinking and sucks you into the story. And you know its a good movie when you actually get engrossed in a movie about a haunted mirror! Unfortunately the ending leaves room for a potential sequel or 3, this is something I really hope does not happen. Because given the current trend in horror movies, it can only go one way....gore. The sequels will most likely pull a ""SAW"" type move and focus solely on becoming gory than a great story or strong atmosphere.

137,vistheindian,stay away from creepy old mirrors and this movie,6,20 April 2014,"Quickie Review:Oculus is a movie about a mirror that may or may not be evil. A brother and a sister, set out to prove that there is something supernatural about the mirror that tormented their family during their childhood. This film does try some creative ways of storytelling by weaving in and out of the present and past time-lines. It also tackles the psychology of the characters, which is rare for the horror genre. While these new ideas are refreshing, ultimately the build up to the story is slow and the ending is predictable. You will most likely leave the cinema unsatisfied.Full Review:Years after a tragedy in their family, Kaylie (Karen Gillan) reunites with her brother Tim (Brenton Thwaites). Kaylie is convinced that a supernatural force within a mirror is what plagued their childhood, while Tim believes that they both created false memories. Kaylie then sets up an elaborate plan to prove herself and thereby prove that something evil lurks in this mirror. In this process we consistently flash between events of their past and present. In the meantime they are also constantly battling the notion that what they perceive to be supernatural phenomenon may in fact be figments of their imagination.When I first heard the premise, I was intrigued. It seemed like Oculus may be something unique, and in some aspects it is. I liked how the story shows the psychological state of the characters, leaving it up to the audience to decide if they really are crazy or not. What I enjoyed the most about the movie was the direction of two time-lines. Director Mike Flanagan, seamlessly blends the two stories so well that for a split second even the audience has to think when and where they actually are. So for that instant you feel some of the same confusion the characters are feeling. This plays out very well in the climax of the movie.As for the scariness of the movie, yes, there are some of the typical jump scares, but it does not rely on it. For the most part it is the atmosphere and the tone that plays into the tension. The domestic situation of the family in the past time-line and some of the imagery used is disturbing at times and adds to that overall tension. While that is interesting, I never felt the need to grab on to someone or hide under my blanket (it's a very powerful blanket). I instantly fell asleep like a baby the following night, if that's any indication.Now as to why despite some of the positives, I'm giving this movie a mediocre rating. During the first 30 minutes, it felt like the writers knew that they didn't have much to pull off a whole movie. So the beginning of the movie feels overstretched with unnecessary suspense dialog for things that majority of the audience already figured out. The movie falters again in the last moments, because it is so abrupt and unsatisfying. I knew exactly how it was going to unfold, and it did just that. What is another detriment to the movie is that there was no purpose to the story, no motive. As a result you don't really care about what's happening on screen, it ends up being just a collection of mildly creepy scenes.Oculus has a refreshing take on the horror genre by blending it with aspects of a psychological thriller. I especially appreciate the effort put into the storytelling techniques employed. In the end, as a whole package, Oculus is underwhelming and falls into the horror trap of predictable endings. Therefore I would not recommend paying to go see this in the cinema.",Oculus
138,CowherPowerForever,What is Real?,4,12 April 2014,"Oculus is your typical below average horror film, but surprisingly doesn't rely on heavy jump scares throughout the film to build up hype. While I didn't enjoy the film overall, there are some good elements of the film, however there is no real reason to go out and spend money on this film.Oculus has key problems with its plot, and its development. This mirror has been around for centuries, yet there is very little back story given on the mirror besides the fact that it has killed its owners over the years. The movie follows Tim and Kaylie Russel(played by Brenton Thwaites and Karen Gillan) as Tim is recently released from a mental hospital. Once he is released his sister picks him up and announces she has finally got a hold the mirror that ruined their childhood, and that she wants to kill it. While the idea is not bad at all the development is poor along with its execution. The film jumps back and forth from present day to when they were children, 11 years ago. The editing here is fantastic, one of the better elements of the film, however the failed development of the back story of the mirror leaves you wondering why I even care. The mirror kills people, and collects them in this mirror, and has been doing it for well over one hundred years, but outside of that we are left guessing.Directed by Mike Flanagan, the film actually flows fairly well, with bumps at times. I actually thought he did an overall good job of directing the film. It is a hard R rated film, which is sadly missing a lot from the horror genre today. The film uses jump scares here and there, but doesn't overuse them like other genre films have recently done. Flanagan deserve a lot of credit for that. The acting however, he lost me at. Overall the actors were loose in their roles. Not really sticking together, and certainly not acting like a family. Then again the horror genre is not exactly known for top of the line acting.Overall the film has far too many problems to even consider spending five or even ten dollars on. If you have any interest in this film the best option is to wait until home video release, and just get a rental. Some who enjoy the Paranormal Activity series may find some enjoyment from this film, and even so it is still best to catch a discount showtime.4/10",Oculus
139,williambendavis-933-218958,An extremely well put together film,9,23 May 2015,"I really loved this movie. I thought the filmmakers handled this movie very intelligently and brilliantly. They put a strong emphasis on building a super creepy atmosphere rather than focus on pointless blood and gore. Because of this, you're on edge pretty much the whole time. I can't say it's the scariest thing I've ever seen, but it was certainly nerve wracking throughout. The plot of the movie revolves around a brother and sister trying to prove that this weird mirror is haunted and is responsible for many deaths over the years, including their father's death. This mirror makes you see things that aren't really happening and it screws with your perception of reality. It makes the main characters kind of lose it mentally. The film loses structure and coherency as the the character's minds deteriorate, and that isn't a bad thing at all. It adds to the movie really. I thought the correlation between their state of mind and the film's structure was pretty cool. Also, the child actors in this movie are fantastic. They were never annoying and the way they acted like normal children (for the most part). That being said, it isn't flawless. You could watch this and completely hate it. I could definitely see the overall confusing narrative turning people away. It's a fairly subjective movie I think. You could love it or hate it. That being said, I personally loved it and I think people should see it.",Oculus
140,donb-519-335075,"A ""must see""",10,18 December 2014,A haunted mirror? Are you kidding? Yes - I was doubting how believable/scary this could be. You need to watch it - it is totally believable - and very scary. In fact this movie cracks my top 10 favorite horror movies of all time (the first change in the past 5 years)!This is true horror - as horrible things happen to people - especially the two main characters in their childhood - and later as adults. The two children show incredible bravery as the horrible events unfurl with their parents. But the brilliance of the movie is the smooth back and forth between the past (11 years ago) and the present. Add in the mirror's ability to distort reality - and neither the viewers nor the actors know what is real and what is not - which has tragic consequences for the actors - and the movie.I do not want to reveal much about the movie. Just that we have been waiting a long time for a horror flick this good.I am shocked how good this movie was - and it did not get a lot of press. Well neither did Halloween at the beginning.If you like horror - this is a must see.,Oculus
141,sjarja,very good .. and i am surprised it is...,8,5 August 2016,As with most horror/suspense movies - i usually visit them without great expectations ... because i am just too often disappointed by them.The bad thing about this attitude is - that it is purely academic ... and in fact does not prevent one from being disappointed by a bad movie ... but it does kind of give you a surprise when the movie turns out to be good.Oculus is such a movie. Aside from the much better known cast than many horror movies ... It is also the story itself and the twists and turns of storytelling.The story is quite simple. Evil mirror makes people do bad things. But that is not where it ends. It is the storytelling that becomes more frantic and chaotic with each minute towards the end. At some point it simply is not clear at all anymore what is real and what is fiction.Although the end is kind of predictable (obvious the second the fail save is presented ... really) the path to this conclusion was by no means boring.What i loved the most about this movie was that it kind of portrait the act of staying alive while also capturing the event in an actually pretty good plan. For a change ... i couldn t think of much (aside from the fail-save) to do what the two siblings (or rather the one) thought about.If you want to see a good movie without the stereotypical jumpscares (much) ... and with good acting and storytelling - this is the movie for you.,Oculus
142,brettchatz-1,Dread & Horror,8,19 April 2014,"Oculus is certainly a cut above the rest. The film rouses your innermost fears and never relents. The supernatural story tracks a brother and sister who are trying to come to terms with what happened to their family back when they were little kids. Oculus is expertly crafted and surprisingly unbearable to watch. Such is the feeling of helplessness you feel, that it becomes painful to endure the torment taking place. Clichés creep in from time to time, but they are superbly well woven into the screenplay. The dread ratchets up to fever-pitch levels until eventually you are left paralyzed with indecision, doubt and fear. The demonic entities in the film are omnipotent and menacing. The film neatly fixates on the characters - past and present - as it ties up all the loose ends in a roller-coaster ride of sheer mayhem. Expect the unexpected with Oculus and you will not be disappointed.",Oculus
143,RomanJamesHoffman,Intelligent and creepy psychological horror that shows that contemporary American horror isn't dead,8,27 December 2014,"Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) has spent the last eleven years incarcerated in a mental institution after recovering from a harrowing childhood trauma. Upon being released, His sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan) meets him and tells him that the events that unfolded eleven years earlier, which saw their dad kill their mom, wasn't the result of their father going mad but instead the result of a curse that befalls whoever owns a special mirror which their family was in possession of. What's more, Kaylie has gotten hold of the mirror through her work and is set on proving the mirror's supernatural power by taking it to their former home and meticulously filming what transpires overnight. At first sceptical and believing his sister to be suffering from a psychological aberration the likes of which he is familiar with from his incarceration, Tim gradually begins to doubt himself as the mirror begins to play increasingly devious mind-games with them.Like most American horror films of recent years, the film is slickly produced, oozes atmosphere, and directed by someone who knows what they're doing as the fragmented backstory pieces itself together in tandem with the increasing eeriness as the mirror's power takes hold. However, what sets this film apart from the slew of horror flicks that slop out each year are some very convincing performances from both Old Tim and Kaylie but especially young Tim and Kaylie. What's more the film has (stop press) an intelligent script. Okay, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but the refreshing lack of gore, the focus on character, and the consistent theme of the shaky foundations which our ideas and memories are built on lends the film a driving watch-ability factorand to top it off, the film doesn't sell itself out at the end and leave the viewer feeling cheated at having invested their time and thought into the film. A lot of the integrity the film seems to exhibit no doubt derives from the fact that it was originally conceived as a short movie by director Mike Flanagan back in 2006 and did the festival circuit under the name of ""Oculus: Chapter 3 - The Man with the Plan"". So what we have is a near decade long gestation and the tight plot, well-developed back-story, and artful playing with memory and hallucination across two time-lines at the films conclusion are testament to the care with which the project has been handled. Other directors in the genre (e.g. James Wan) should sit up and start taking notes.P.S.Curiously, another ""haunted mirror"" movie was released later in the year across the pond, simply going under the title ""The Mirror"". The movies share nothing save the conceit of using a mirror but it also has some good chills and makes for an effective complement to ""Oculus"". Watch both in the same sitting at night for some real old-school scares.",Oculus

Period.,9,9 June 2021,"The Good: We talk about Hereditary, The Witch and It Follows, but Oculus is right up there with the best of the decade. Where do I start? The concept of the film is just amazing, with you wanting to learn more about it every frame. I can't credit this movie enough for turning an INANIMATE OBJECT into one of the most menacing and terrifying villains I have ever seen. The film oozes a creepy, unsettling atmosphere and weaves two timelines together in possibly the best way I've seen. It is so tense and anxiety inducing that even my chronic phone checking sister put it down for the entirety of the 2nd and 3rd acts. This movie just takes you and never lets you go.Oh, and the PERFORMANCES. Everyone here is at the top of their game, especially the kids. I could imagine lesser child actors completely ruining this thing. But, they are the emotional heart and soul of this movie. That's not to say their adult counterparts are slouches either. Gillan is flat out fantastic here, in what may be her best role ever.Yeah, if you can't tell, I freaking ADORE this movie. Flanagan let us know from the jump that he was a force to be reckoned with. And honestly, his first might still be his best work.The Bad: with a weird, psychological, time weaving story like this, there are bound to be plot holes. One in particular (*radius*) is a nagging one that I sort of just explain away with...um...it's supernatural stuff, whatever. But it's telling that I've seen this movie like 6 times and I don't pick up anything else.The Ugly: Okay, so let's get this out of the way. If you have a particularly hard time watching domestic violence, abuse, children in peril, a family breaking down (it may hit close to home for some), this might not be the movie for you. If you can handle it, definitely watch this one if you love horror.",Oculus

This renaissance continues with Oculus, easily the best haunted-mirror film ever made. The worst aspect of the film is how scary it isn't. It's atmospheric, to be sure, but I cannot recall any point where I was leaning forward out of my seat. Everything else, though, is quite good, and well worth the time of any horror fan. But the best part is the story. Elegantly told in the parallel timelines of the present and flashbacks, the mind-bending tale of what's real and what isn't encourages repeat viewings to glean all the secrets from its twisted core. And it's twisted, all right; I don't know what parental violence against their children looks like in real life, but I'd imagine it looks pretty damned close to this. So if you're one who's easily rattled by that sort of thing, you can feel free to pass on this one. But you'll be missing a fiercely original horror flick that is guaranteed a few sequels.",Oculus
147,politehere,Nonsensical doesn't Quite Put it,1,2 October 2014,"I got the point of the movie, but it still didn't make much sense. I'm sorry to say, but shouting, screaming at the top of your lungs, having characters strangle and then let go of each other, smashing stuff, going back and forth between two different versions of the lead characters at random and confusing the audience, and depicting a few blood stains on your fingernails and clothes is just not enough to make a horror movie. The storyline is the most incoherent I've ever seen in a movie and it keeps leaving you confused rather than scared. It was clearly inspired by the 2008 movie ""Mirrors"", but that movie had been done right. It had a logical and coherent storyline, which you could actually follow. Also, the performances in Oculus were rather artificial and didn't sound natural at all. They were either weak or over-the-top. The younger versions of the lead characters bore no resemblance to their older selves whatsoever, but I wouldn't have minded it if the story was coherent and actually scared me. As a horror movie fan, I say avoid it. The IMDb rating is unbelievable. This movie deserves no more than a 3 or 4 and I'm being generous.",Oculus
148,andell,"Some Good Moments, But Mostly Bland & Ultimately Predictable!",3,29 April 2014,"""Oculus"" is a horror film that tries very hard to be clever, hip and psychologically terrifying. I stress the term ""tries"" because unless you're a theatrical snob who mistakes style with substance and convinces yourself that you're brilliant enough to know the difference even when you're not, you're likely to find this film to be a total flop.The story in nutshell goes like this: a mirror destroys a family, leaving the Mother and Father dead, and their 10 year old son incarcerated while their 12 year old daughter is forced into foster care.Fast forward 11 years, and 21 year old Tim Russell is being released from a mental health facility, where his Doctor warns him if he must choose between his sanity and his sister, he needs to choose his sanity.Meanwhile Kaylie Russell picks up her brother, and informs him that she has access to a cursed mirror that led to the insanity and ultimate demise of their parents, and she expects him to make good on a promise he made when he was 10 to help her destroy the evil being in the mirror.We get a general accounting of the horrors that have been visited upon all who have come into contact with the mirror, a strategy to destroy the mirror that makes utterly no sense, a fail-safe that the moment you see it you just know one of the siblings is going to wind up impaled on it, and a convoluted passing of the evening that intermingles the experiences of the siblings as children and in the present day.There are some interesting parts and some scenes that are quite stylish, but for the most part the only questions I have are as follows: 1) If the house remained in the possession of the kids after their parents died, why didn't the mirror?; and 2) Why not just put the mirror up, set the timer on the fail-safe, and walk out the front door and let it happen? I mean all that planning by Kaylie, and she couldn't figure out that summoning the evil presence with them still in the house served no logical purpose??? This movie has gotten critical praise, and I'm sure some people who conflate style with substance will call this movie a horror classic, but it really isn't.It is the proverbial story of what Bill Maher calls ""a smart stupid person,"" and there's just too much bland monotony to have the film go down THAT ridiculous path!",Oculus

The layers of the story were revealed in a suspenseful fashion, keeping the viewer engaged with tension and uncertainty.

153,stephenlovelette,Nuance and Production Value,8,4 September 2014,"Self-reflection.How much is too much?Although the story remains unread on my bookshelf, I'd imagine Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Grey deals heavily with this notion.Since publication, many other horror stories utilize the mirror motif. Candyman (1992) is one of the scariest movies of all time. Mirrors (2008) isn't as good, but hey – further fright by looking glass!Bearing in mind horror movies are graded on a curve, Oculus is great.Not only is it scary, it's thought provoking and nuanced.Plus, Karen Gillan!Throw her on a list of promising young up-and-comers. She plays the bionic woman in Guardians of the Galaxy.Brenton Thwaites isn't the cat's pajamas, but he does just fine.Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff turn in solid performances as the parents. The kids, Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan were also very good.First and foremost, Oculus establishes fair and realistic circumstances by which the viewer can suspend disbelief. Some of the best horror movies nowadays struggle with this.Also, despite a tiny (five million dollar) budget, the movie looks great. You can feel the production value, the effort behind the movie-making.Unlike the Paranormal Activity franchise, which I've been screaming about since the first was released in 2009. It seems like folks have caught on since the trailer for the fourth movie, but I'm going to be upset if I have to sit through a preview for P.A. 5.I'll get back to Oculus in a moment but one last note on the P.A. franchise.It lessened the credibility of the horror genre by supporting a notion introduced by The Blair Witch Project.The idea that production value doesn't necessarily increase believability, and success can be achieved through marketing trickery and cheap filmmaking.Therefore what's debatably the campiest genre became even less appealing to the out-group as a large source of revenue. What is commonly perceived as a 'lesser art form' is further denigrated by the cheapness required to satisfy the audience.My soapbox has a stepladder I'm currently descending.Anyway. Oculus puts the theme of reflection to good use.Man, horror guys really love their overlapping dualities.The ending (and Rotten Tomatoes) leads me to believe there will be a sequel, which I'm very intrigued to see.Two separate timeframes unfold through the perspective of two protagonists, under similar conditions in the same setting. The viewer watches along as the memories overlap with the present.See? Nuance!What we have here, folks, is an unreliable narrator.A subjective third-person omniscient narrator, to be precise.A perspective that swivels willy-nilly between past and present, reality and delusion.Oftentimes it's difficult to discern what's an objective historical account or concrete memory. The blurred lines between the individual perceptions of both past and present are a theme reflected throughout.Thus resulting in some rather subtle social commentary regarding psychotherapy.After all that time spent in self-reflection, how much good does it do him in moving forward?Didn't think I was going to bring it back around, did you?",Oculus

155,jaguiar313,"Smart, inventive and often very scary horror from Absentia's Mike Flanagan!",8,11 April 2014,"I am a big fan of Mike Flanagan's low budget chiller Absentia so, I was very much looking forward to his next flick. And Mr. Flanagan didn't disappoint. Supernatural horror starts out introducing us to two siblings, Kaylie (Karen Gillan) and Tim (Brenton Thwaites) Russell. 11 years ago a horrible incident occurred in their home leaving their mother, Marie (Katee Sackhoff) and father, Alan (Rory Cochrane) dead, with 10 year old Tim incarcerated in an institution. From appearances, Alan murdered his wife and Tim killed him in self defense. It's over a decade later and Tim has just been released and his older sister has come to help him get back on his feet and destroy what she claims is the real culprit in their parents' deaths. After years of treatment Tim sees the murders as a simple case of domestic problems and negative emotions gotten out of control. His father driven to torture and kill their mother and he, forced to defend himself and his sister by killing their dad. A tragic but, rational explanation. Kaylie believes it to be the influence of a demonic entity that lives in an antique mirror purchased by their father for his office. While Tim was away, Kaylie has been planning to prove her belief, once and for all, and has tracked down and procured the mirror through her job as an antiques dealer and brought it to their still vacant former home. She convinces Tim to join her on calling out and destroying the sinister force that she believes, from her research, has left a trail of bodies and tortured souls for over 100 years. Is Kaylie delusional and in need of treatment herself, or has Tim's treatment created a more practical way of rationalizing an even more horrible truth? Director and co-writer (with Jeff Howard) Mike Flanagan crafts an intelligent, inventive and really creepy horror film that certainly has it's share of out-right scares, especially in it's last act. But, much like his spooky Absentia, Flanagan never bludgeons us over the head with the horror and thus keeps it effective by keeping us from getting numb to it. As with his previous flick, he doesn't give us everything at once and plays with our heads for a bit as to whether Kaylie is creating a supernatural fantasy to avoid the realities of the domestic horror she witnessed or, is Tim candy-coating the nightmarish truth with the psycho-babble fed him by his doctors? The film is a moderately paced but, constantly unnerving and creepy build-up as the siblings delve deeper into the events that occurred over a decade ago and Flanagan who also edited deftly mixes in flashbacks to those horrible events and seamlessly blends them so that at times they all seem to be happening at the same time and in the same space. It's really disturbing as we try to figure out if these two are finally reliving and facing what happened, or, is there an evil presence in that mirror that is happy to make them experience again the memories that torment them most. It's in the last act where the full truth is revealed and I will say no more except to be ready for the film to deliver the goods when the time is right. It's an intense and scary ride Flanagan takes us on to get our answers, made all the more effective due to the skilled and disturbing build-up by a director who makes good on his potential. Again, Flanagan also has an underlying theme about the effects traumatic events have on a our lives. With Absentia it was the emotional effects of a missing loved one and not knowing their fate. Here it is growing up and living with the trauma of witnessing domestic abuses and violence. He weaves these into his story subtly so they are not intrusive to the plot but, they are there. And that is one of the things I like about Flanagan's work and especially with this film, he knows when to be subtle and when to get intense and he does both here to maximum effect. Sometimes less is more and Flanagan's instincts are good at knowing when to feed us an underlying creepiness and when to outright scare the pants off us. It's what makes Oculus work so well and made Absentia such a treat. He knows what degree to feed us the films elements and when. He is also clever with his use of the traditional elements so, they appear fresh. The director also gets good work from his cast with Gillan and Sackoff really standing out here with strong performances but, the acting is solid all the way around. No one ever goes over the top even when the film is in full scare mode, the performances stay grounded and thus more effective. He got good work out of Katie Parker and Courtney Bell (who has a cameo) in his last film and seems to have a knack for writing and directing strong female characters that aren't stereotypes or caricatures. The film is not perfect, but, it's flaws are very minor and I loved that when the blood does flow, it was practical effects as did a lot of the make-up and effects seem to be. If digital was used, it was excellently rendered so it was not noticeable which, in a film like this, is the way should be.Overall, I really enjoyed Oculus and how it was equally effective in it's subtle moments as it was in the more intense ones. It never overloaded you with plot elements or the horror elements and fed you the answers to it's mysteries gradually so it held your attention till it was ready to let you have it.. and the final act does exactly that. A smart, disturbing and sometimes downright scary horror from Mike Flanagan. Also stars Annalise Basso and Garett Ryan as young Kaylie and Tim respectively.",Oculus

My only issue is with the general sub-genre of 'messing with reality' movies... and how, once all the tricks have been played, you're usually left holding a big bag of nothing. Very similar to how I felt about 1408. I'm fine with not having all the answers at the end of a movie, I generally prefer it to whatever nonsense the writers dream up to tie it all together. Still... there needs to be a story... and I'm not sure this movie really has one. Not past the point of 'some bad stuff happened and here it is happening again'. Is there really any point to it? The characters are not fleshed out much at all... they're just there to react to stuff as it happens.

This flick was decently enjoyable, however a few things took me out of the moment like why the brother is freed, the acting sometimes, and probably the worst scene I saw in the entire movie. It's a scene when she introduced him to the efforts she put into the mirror and show off the technology and techniques proudly and he isn't liking it because he thinks differently.

The action does bounce back and forth between when the brother (Garrett Ryan) and sister (Annalise Basso) were 10 and 12 and when they're 21 (Brenton Thwaites) and 23 (Karen Gillan). But if you follow the story, this makes complete sense. I found the idea of a supernatural mirror very creative. I think they could have done more with this idea. I give it 8 out of 10.",Oculus
165,jhigginbotham151,"Smart, atmospheric Horror film that (mostly) ignores jump scares.",8,28 July 2014,"Oculus surprised me. I wasn't expecting anything amazing because at the day its a modern horror film and the market is saturated with the same formula time after time, so when something like Oculus comes out, of course I ignore it ... but thankfully I got to see it and it, along with films like Sinister and The Conjuring, could mean a renaissance in smart, atmospheric Horror films.The story follows a brother and sister, Kaylie and Tim, who together try and prove a mirrors supernatural powers after a traumatic experience from their childhood leaves both of their parents dead. The plot jumps between the past and present showing events leading up to the death of their parents and present events showing Kaylie and Tim trying to prove the mirrors supernatural powers.I like how the film doesn't say upfront that the events that occurred was down to the mirror, it leaves you in suspense as to whether the main characters are actually just experiences lapses in sanity the same way their parents were. All the evidence that Kaylie built up to support the mirror having powers is nicely given a logical explanation by Tim, this shows that we have intelligent characters that wont jump at light flickering (which they don't).The film does have a few faults in that it has a few pointless attempts near the beginning which were not effective in the slightest. I assume they were put there to put some scares in the film at the beginning because it does take quite awhile for the atmosphere to build up and for the scares to come, I think the attempt just put the pacing off and didn't help the film at all. Logic is also sacrificed in some instances for dramatic or atmospheric effect and although I think it pays of, it also makes you think ''yeah that was stupid'' so its a back and forth whether it works or not.Overall, I really like Oculus. The film has a fantastic story that comes full circle at the end without the need for a cop-out ending and you can tell the actors and film-makers cared about the project from how much effort they put into it.",Oculus

That means research, training how to fight instead of balancing on your 3 inch hills... 3. Don't eat or drink. Come fully prepared. So you won't accidentally eat anything. In fact, throw all furniture so you won't accidentally hurt yourself. 4. Ask your fiancé to bring along other people to search the house. 5. Don't be so tall. Crouch and walk along so the anchor OBVIOUSLY can't hit you. Or hang the mirror higher. Better yet, kick it off a cliff so it will obviously shatter. 6.

170,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Oculus Review,3,11 April 2014,"My Thoughts:This movie had potential but tries to do to much in the time they have given themselves. What I mean by that statement is this movie is really two movies smashed into one and neither of them get the time they deserve. The first film we get is a Young Kaylie (Annalise Basso) and Tim (Garrett Ryan) moving to a new house with their parents and dear old Dad (Rory Cochrane) decides he needs an antique mirror. We come to find out that this mirror is of course not what it seems to be and start effecting Dad and Mom (Katee Sachoff) which of course ends badly. The second film we flash forward ten years where we see older Kaylie (Karen Gillan) working at an auction house tracking down the mirror. Older Tim (Brenton Thwaites) is just getting out of a mental hospital after coming to realize that the events that happened to him when he was younger were not supernatural but his brain just making up things to fit events. The second movie entails the sister wanting to document and prove that their dad wasn't a killer but taken over by a supernatural being and so sets things in motion at their old house with her brother tagging along trying to tell her it wasn't real. Needless to say bad things happen.So if you take those two movie ideas on their own I think they would have been good but they took those two ideas put it in a blender and it the mix button and what we get for 105 mins is a back and forth movie that sometimes pulls you out of the scary moments and throws you into another situation that just doesn't help them out.And then the because they smashed these two movies together you get inconsistencies in the story line such as; in the older time-line they state how the mothers body was found during the younger time-line, but then we see what happens to the mother and it doesn't match up to what was told to us.Overall they make a valiant effort to try to make this a scary movie but fall flat and really doesn't keep you entertained enough to spend $15 for a movie ticket. My Recommendation:Skip it. It isn't worth the money you would pay to see it. If you are really interested to see what it does then wait for Red Box or Netflix.You can find my other reviews on www.shepfromtamp.com",Oculus
171,Zulfmanauthor,A horror film with depth!,8,28 June 2014,"This movie aims to be what most horror films sadly fall short of being, and that is a good watchable movie. In recent years, most film makers who want to direct a horror movie simply employ the same formula of blood, suspense and shocks with an open ending. They fail to realise a chilling movie doesn't necessarily need lots of blood to be effective, as with any genre it should have a strong storyline, good acting and an appropriate pace. This is where 'Oculus' hits the mark, a very well made horror film which is more creepy than scary. The film focuses on an ancient mirror and it's effect on the fate of a small family. Primarily the main characters are the brother and sister and the film cleverly goes from the present to the past and back again to reveal the mystery surrounding this mirror. It's a very attractive film with characters that you begin to care about and relate to, which is not often the case with most horror movies. Despite come criticism, the climax is good and stays consistent with the main story of the film. Overall I was impressed, it might not satisfy the hardened horror movie junkie, but this is a thinking man's film with clever direction and strong performances being the highlights.",Oculus
172,jamespurcell-17815,Honest review of Oculus,6,11 November 2017,"This is a well made, well acted, well directed, well written movie that I didn't like and would never recommend to anyone. That's because this movie, after the first 20 minutes or so, goes like this:They are walking around the house. 5 minutes later- flashback to a time period that is not disclosed to the viewer. They are walking around the house again. 5 minutes later- flashback to a slightly different time period that is not disclosed to the viewer. Walking around the house again. 2 minutes later- flashback to a completely different time period that is not disclosed to the viewer. More house exploring. 1 minute later- new time period- House walking. 30 seconds later- new time period.It's just not an enjoyable watch, or at least wasn't for me. I read other reviews, I thought I was prepared for flashbacks. Not like this. Nothing like this. I've never seen such incessant, liberal use of constant flashbacks. This movie did so much right. -sufficiently creepy, doesn't rely on jump scares (were there even any?) -well acted -good music, good effects -just fantastic all around.Except for the flashbacks. You wouldn't think that would be a deal breaker, but guys - this is a new level of fail. It almost has to be seen to be believed, although I don't recommend you waste your time.

173,TheBarleyGuy,"Not a bad horror flick, but relatively forgettable",6,3 May 2014,"Alright, so first off the movie is about : A woman tries to exonerate her brother, who was convicted of murder, by proving that the crime was committed by a supernatural phenomenon.What phenomenon? A huge, gaudy, and very evil mirror. The movie is, as far as I can tell doing very little research, based on a short film made by the same director, Mike Flanagan, called ""Oculus: Chapter 3 - The Man with the plan"" I think that the new title is better. Anyways, Mr. Flanagan is a relatively new face to horror, his other effort was called ""Absentia"" which, I actually enjoyed. It's not a modern-masterpiece or anything, but its a worth while little horror movie. Anyways, back to Oculus.First off, the movie works. It has a foreboding-enough atmosphere, the mythology of the mirror is interesting, and Karen Gillan was enough to get me through the parts of the movie I didn't care for. Now, speaking of Karen Gillan and the other actors in this movie the acting is relatively flat all around, which was unfortunate. Gillan was able to coast through on my fondness of her from Doctor Who, but if I'm being honest, it seemed like there was almost more focus on sounding not-British, and really, she could have just been British and it wouldn't have taken me out of the movie at all. Brenton Thwaites who played her brother was not particularly engaging. Actually, the children who played their young-selves delivered some dynamite performances comparatively and I look forward to seeing what else they can do. The parents, played by Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff seemed to coast through the movie, however Sackhoff came into her own later on in the movie when her character had become completely mentally detached. As I mentioned, I didn't hate this movie. It did make for a reasonably effective theater-going experience. Which, with some horror movies, that's all you can ask for. There is a lot in the movie that relies on the soundtrack, and sharp, loud noises, so its a real jump-scare type movie. However, it's not a lousy one. It does build up effectively, and I actually didn't mind the disjointed way the story was told. This one won't be a horror film that is remembered for years, or anything, but if you're going to the theater on a date, or on cheap night, or looking for something new to rent when it comes out on DVD, you could probably do worse than this.I have to say, I'm a little surprised by the 7/10 on IMDb and the 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, and I do think the Doctor Who fanhood and their collective love of Gillan MIGHT be building it up a little bit. It's not terribly unique, or terrible. I'm not really sure exactly where I come down on it. I will say watch it, and if you can see it in theaters it might be worth the experience. Final Note : I know it's listed on IMDb as a movie released in 2013. I don't care. It was released majorly in 2014, so lets not bicker. Final Grade : C+ (changed from C, May 2, 2014)For more of my reviews : BARLEYDOESHORROR.TUMBLR.COM",Oculus
174,JontheLobsterLover,"Sadly, just as I expected.",2,19 April 2014,"I was really in no dire hurry to see Oculus. I've seen the poster walking to work every day for weeks. I watched the trailer and was bored just watching that. Yes, I was excited to see a horror movie released in theaters, but that's the problem. Nothing about this movie was very scary at all. What some people liked about the movie I agree with to an extent. I did like the flash back scenes that were mixed with the present day. However I thought they did it way too much. Once or twice to kind of give you that ""woah"" feeling, but not many many times through out the movie. I thought the mother in the flashbacks was just bad. I didn't find her believable at all in the character and seemed to be over acting to me. Then she turns to in a neanderthal who eats plates. In my opinion that kind of came out of nowhere. I didn't like Karen Gilin's character at all. She's a major player in the movie, and I'm not sure if you're supposed to hate her or not, but if you are, I probably hated her for the wrong reasons. You're supposed to hate her because of how she brought her brother back into the mess and things of similar nature, but I also hated her for the way she talked to the cameras, the way she was just so up her own a**, a lot about her character made the movie hard to watch.On the other hand, I loved the brother. I thought the actor was the best part of the movie for me, and the way that he was trying to bring logical explanations to everything his sister brought up, I really loved. The scene with the light bulb and the apple, would of been a good scene, if not spoiled in the trailer for the film. The ghosts and ""scares"" were very poorly executed. Even the scenes where the ghosts jumped out behind from behind the doors, only managed to scare the young girls in the audience, and no one else. I was hoping to have my mind changed about the movie, but sadly my gut feeling was correct on this one.",Oculus
175,dunnypop,Refreshing,10,16 April 2014,"When I first read a slew of positive reviews in 2013 about Oculus, I really wanted to check it out. I really enjoy the horror film genre however it's a real cynical bunch of viewers (""not scary enough"", ""not enough gore"", ""this has been done before""), and with the reviews coming down like ""never seen anything like this"", I was interested and skeptical.Oculus is a slow-burn. It's slow and keeps to this pace throughout the film. This isn't the Conjuring which is pretty much fast paced... this reminded me of a mix Last Exorcism of Emily Rose and perhaps the Orphanage. You will either get really interested in how creepy the film gets or not. You will either really dig the layers of how things work in the horror realm or try to poke holes through everything (ex: 30 ft safe radius).The genius of Oculus isn't the concept (haunted mirror) but the screenplay of disjointed story telling and flashbacks mixing into a coherent and perhaps a complex story. Think of it like a toned down Inception. It's effective because you eventually feel and question what is reality and not.This is above mediocre but perhaps not for the mainstream. It's a great refreshing horror film.",Oculus
176,videodrome1234,Good scary movie and story,8,22 May 2014,"Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard wrote this story a while back. Not that that's a problem, just remember that James Wan made a short film version of Saw before it grew into the feature film. That's what happened with the film too. The evil mirror theme is concept that's been used before not just in fairy tales but by the director. And because a cheap horror is always worth making the producers of Paranormal Activity and Insidious thought it would be a good premise for a horror and they may make some money too, but the trailer and the marketing makes you think it's just another typical ghost story. But at least it's not filmed with a hand-held. Despite all this I think it's worth giving it a shot. Let's talk about the story. The film plays in 2 different timeframes today and 11 years ago. Today the main characters are siblings. 11 years ago they are a young couple who just move into a new house. They get an antique mirror that causes major hallucinations in the adults. It gets to the point where one parent is crazier than the other. Then we jump ahead to siblings that are investigate the mirror. The investigation is surprising and scary. At first anyone would think that a film where they spend a lot of time staring at an evil mirror can't possibly be interesting. And if that's all the film was then it really wouldn't be. That's when a director – who is also the scriptwriter – has two options 1. make the film really scary 2. do something that few have tried and actually give a horror flick a story. Luckily he chose the second option. Of course there are scary parts in the film, but that was absolutely not the point for me, cause I think that's a minimum expectation in a ghost film. While the really well thought out story hits home it's also directed well. It's thrilling, though it does get started slowly but then it keeps you drawn in all the way to the end and has surprising twist. It was a great idea to mix the past and the present. Of course with a story like this you need good characters too. Which they basically have, and the actors need to be commended, they made average characters good. For me the actors playing the young couple raised the film to new levels. I don't really like ghost stories. I think the Japanese have done all that can be done in this genre, but despite that I did like this film¬. I think that its mainly because the director wasn't trying to make a good horror flick, but was trying to make a good film period. It worked at it works in the horror genre so it raises it from average to make me give it 7/10. I hope the director keeps up this good habit. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1",Oculus
177,masonmorgan-92917,A surprisingly refreshing and clever bit of psychological horror,7,22 December 2016,"Judging by the title and overall aesthetics that we were shown in the trailer, Mike Flanagan's Oculus seemed like it was just going to be another bland and forgettable entry to the endlessly disappointing market of modern horror. While it is quite easy to dismiss most modern horror movies that come out these days, Oculus manages to give us some things that we have never seen before . While it wasn't quite enough to justify deeming Oculus as a modern horror classic, it was certainly enough to convince me that original concepts and ideas can still be explored within this creative wasteland of a genre. Many know Oculus as the film about ""a haunted mirror"" and while that is somewhat a brief synopsis of the story, it really doesn't do the film justice as it is much more than just a haunted piece of furniture. It is really a deeply disturbing and complex psychological horror as we witness the mental breakdown of two siblings as they attempt to reveal the truth behind a portal to hell disguised as an ancient mirror. One of the things that I found most surprising about Oculus is the talent within the cast. As viewers, we are generally getting used to flimsy and paper-thin performances from horror film casts but Oculus doesn't follow that trend as we have a few genuinely great performances, even from the child actors. Rory Cochrane in particular is incredibly menacing as his character grows increasingly evil under the influence of the mirror, leading to extremely disturbing, as well as effective, sequences. Even the child actors manage to convey realistic and believable emotions as they are exposed to brutal violence, especially the immensely disturbing treatment of their mother. This is one surprising case where the child actors in a horror movie aren't totally annoying and obnoxiously loud. Overall, the great acting increases the effectiveness of the dark and grim tone.Another thing that was very interesting about Oculus was the complex narrative structure and fractured method of story telling. Two story lines blend into one as we witness the fate of the siblings in the past (as children) and in the present. The switching between these timelines and the eerie similarities shared between them makes for a very unique and unsettling tone as the two stories mix together and our sense of realism fades. Our characters experience the major effects on which the mirror has on them, making for some of the film's best and most unsettling moments. While the structure of the narrative was completely fragmented, I found it worked most of the time. Sadly, there were moments where the two stories ran on the same timeline and this led to some frustratingly confusing stretches of mind-bending storytelling, which sometimes took away from the effectiveness of the creepy and dark atmosphere. But when this complex narrative method worked, it led to some clever and genuinely unsettling scenes. Oculus certainly is a better-than-average horror film by today's standards, but it borrows many clichés and tropes which holds it back from becoming a true horror classic. While it wasn't very scary, the gut-wrenching tension was constant all the way through, up until a predictable, yet satisfying, conclusion. It experimented on the minds of the viewer, exploring extremely dark themes of abuse and psychological terror, all through the viewpoint of believable and well-acted characters. This made Oculus an unsettling and effective experience that proves that creativity and innovation within the modern horror scene is still possible.",Oculus
178,mangoamante,"Really great creepy, psychological horror",7,11 October 2020,"If you like more of the gore horror genre, this may not be for you. This is the creepy, psychological more subtle kind of horror movie! Its got a slower build up, some pretty gross moments, and some scary moments but the truly frightening part is the psychological part. There is a lot of levels of frightening. It's deep if you're looking at it in a philosophical or allegorical way. Think it might take a couple viewings to appreciate all that's going on.",Oculus
179,lothos-370-690020,No Jump Scares to be found,8,3 October 2015,"First of all, a good rule of thumb when reading IMDb user movie reviews is to ignore the 1/10s and 10/10s, very few films have nothing to offer and most people giving such reviews are fooling themselves as much as anyone else.This film has the audacity not to rely on jump scares but good acting, some great suspenseful scenes and decent writing. I won't lie it's not a masterpiece but neither is it awful, as so many have claimed. Reading through other reviews it was easy to see the main complaints revolved around the use of flashback and the hard to follow plot. Neither of which are things I would cast in the negative column, unless you have the attention span of a Nat and the concentration of a caffeine fuelled ADHT sufferer.There is one scene, I won't spoil which many will see coming but still manages to unnerve all but the most jaded of viewers. The films strength revolves around the uncertainty of the plot. Are these two children witnessing a supernatural event or is it all in their heads. The ending has the intelligence to leave that up to the viewer and again is probably a source of contention among those who like have their hand held through a film.If you are of the mindset that everything you watch needs to be spelled out, linear and action packed then this isn't for you. However if you enjoy a bit of ambiguity in your horror film and can manage with a relatively slow paced film, then give it a try.",Oculus
180,guillermobosque,"Strange, smartly written and quite depressing; Oculus is a gruesome psychological thriller for a very specific audience.",8,6 October 2014,"Summary: Strange, smartly written and quite depressing; Oculus is a gruesome psychological thriller for a very specific audience. 82/100 (B+)The twenty-one year-old Timothy Russell is discharged from a mental institution by his psychiatric, completely healed from a childhood trauma. His sister Kaylie welcomes him in the parking area and brings him home. Then she tells that they need to destroy an ancient mirror that she has just bought in an auction. Tim follows his sister and has fragmented recollections from his childhood, when his mother Marie buys a mirror for the home office of his father Alan. The behaviors of Alan and Marie change, ending in a family tragedy. Kaylie blames the mirror and now she wants to destroy it with Tim. Will they succeed?First of all, I want to say that I waited months for this film (since the first teaser-trailer came out). So, I went to the theater with very high expectations. Surprisingly, this movie was as good as I thought. I left the theater quite satisfied and very happy. It was very strange and complex. It proves that a horror film doesn't need gore or jump-scares to be scary. Oculus relies on fear and tension. It's suspenseful and it has enough bloody scenes to satisfy horror buffs. It's definitely a psychological-thriller rather than a horror flick. The film explores several themes like skepticism, adultery and psychology.There were two or three funny moments, but most of the film was serious. The first act may be a bit too slow for some people, but not to me; it kept me entertained all time. It has some drama and lengthy discussions between the two main characters (Kaylie and Tim) and I actually found this moments very interesting and well written. Most of the first act is character development and there are a few jump- scares. Then, towards the middle of the film, Kaylie tells the story behind the mirror, this whole scene is rich in storytelling and extremely well scripted, it was very entertaining and intriguing to me.Oculus tells two stories at once, one of them is the story of Tim, Kaylie and their parents 10 years ago, the other one is about Tim and Kaylie (as adults) trying to destroy the mirror. Again, holy crap the script is excellent! The dialog between the characters feels so realistic and smart, and the decisions of the characters are surprisingly intelligent. They're dealing with a ""haunted mirror"" the most logical solution here is to break the damn mirror, but the problem here is that the mirror is indestructible! It has its own creepy defense organism, that's why I love this movie, it's so strange and original.Karen Gillian did a terrific job performing Kaylie. In addition, Annalise Basso performs the younger version of Kaylie and this little girl is undoubtedly the best actress in the film, good job! Brenton Thwaites performs Tim, he nailed it, his acting was astonishing, especially in the ending. Garrett Ryan performs the younger version of Tim and well... he was good enough. Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff perform their parents, Katee's acting was superb, she was perfect for the role, I just can't imagine another actress playing her character. Unfortunately, Rory Cochrane was a total miscast, he's kinda unlikable and his acting was a bit lazy.Oculus is easily one of the best horror films of the year and the best Blumhouse production since The Bay. Oculus was made with ambition and care. However it's not perfect at all, I actually have some issues with the movie. On the downside, it presents some flaws in its final act, it becomes way too explicit, it showed too much of these ""ghosts"" or victims of the mirror with creepy white eyes, it became somewhat weird; also, the last 30 minutes of the movie were very confusing to me and the story was really hard to follow. But the film quickly rises up with a violent, shocking and depressing ending.I am a huge fan of Mike Flanagan, few years ago he directed an indie horror film called ""Absentia"" and I have to admit that it's definitely a better movie compared to Oculus. But my point here is that both films offer a different type of horror, both deal with psychological issues and the skepticism of their characters about these supernatural issues, what is real and what is not. Oculus is not a film for everybody, but it is definitely a must see if you like psychological horror movies. I also want to add that the soundtrack made by The Newton Brothers, is modern, enjoyable and fits with the creepy tone of the film. (B+)",Oculus

182,IheartCali5882,"Gets off to a great start, but eventually loses its way. Still worth a watch.",6,18 April 2014,"This is one of the more complex story lines I've seen in recent horror films. Without divulging too many details, the plot weaves the past and the present together into one (arguably) cohesive story. In a nutshell: Brother and sister team up to defeat the malevolent forces contained in the mirror; the mirror that once was the source of tragedy for their family. Yes this past meets present has been done innumerable times, but not many recent films have made the effort to interlace past and present to this extent. One of the few that have managed to do it, and do it very well in my opinion, has been Insidious part 2. However I wouldn't liken this to Insidious II in quality or technical aspects.While the editing was top notch, the story became overworked by the time the movie reached the second half. This is a clear example of Keep-It-Simple-Stupid. Where the first 45 minutes had good build up and intrigue, staying steady on its course to the main event, the remainder of the film eventually became a mash up of time weaves, flashbacks, reality/unreality hallucinations, etc. It became overworked to the point that the viewer was pulled out of the story by what I think of as the ""silly"" factor. I realize that, by nature, you have to suspend disbelief to enjoy a horror film. However even horror films can cross over from intrigue to silliness with the slightest misstep. Unfortunately Oculus has made this mistake. This is unfortunate because with just a little more editing down, I would have gladly given this a 7/10.This is not to say it's not worth the cost of admission, because I did enjoy it. I definitely think the story has potential, and I'm glad I paid to see it. I appreciate the effort that went into writing and directing such a nuanced story. By no means is it a bad film. It's a perfectly decent film. However the distinction here is that it is decent, when it could have been elevated to the level of good with just a few less twists and turns.Final verdict: Silly at times and the story becomes overkill.

And of course a little bit of Stephen King's IT, with the youth making a promise to come back and destroy the evil. The ending was not foreseen, and was another shock.

The way the film jumps from past to present is just so well done. It not only tells the story in an interesting way, it also compliments the main theme of the film. Not knowing what's reality or fantasy. While I applaud the movie for this it also affects the movie in a negative way. At some points the story is getting so intense and interesting and then BLAM! Back to the past. Relieving all tension that was built up in the previous scene. But then again it leaves you in suspense, waiting for it to return to the present to see how things are going to go down. All in all it's just a very unique and tension building way to tell this interesting story.The acting in the film is top notch in my opinion. The entire cast gives strong performances, and you actually care about the well being of these characters. The only character I didn't care to much for was Kaylee's fiancée. But I felt that particular character wasn't a main focus point for the story so it didn't affect the film in the slightest. The film also has some very creepy and dark imagery that really sends chills down your spine. The ghostly images projected by the mirror are indeed scary and do give you an uneasy feeling for sure. There are a few jump scares that actually did catch me off guard and are well done. Before each jump scare there is a buildup of tension so that when the scare hits you, it actually hits you. The lighting is great and so is the sound and musical score. The movie isn't heavy on gore or special FX but that's not a big issue at all. The story doesn't call for buckets of blood anyways. There really isn't much I can say that was bad about this movie because it really is a horror gem. A real slow burner that messes with your mind and sucks you into its cool storyline of the supernatural. I'd give it an outstanding score of 9/10, if you're a horror fan check this one out!",Oculus
186,ario-34119,Incredibly underrated scary s#1+,9,21 August 2017,"At first, I thought, ""How come everybody didn't give this a solid 9?"" Then I realized that a lot of horror movie viewers expect blood flowing or human floating in mid air and slammed to the wall to be considered ""good"" horror movie. So yeah, maybe it's not for everyone.Without all those, this movie was successful in being bats#1+ scary! Despite the supernatural background, maybe it's more of a psychological thriller than a downright horror movie, but very scary nonetheless. I'm a horror movie lover and disappointed by A LOT of horror movies and this one really quenched my thirst for a good scary horror movie.The acting was solid for all cast and Karen Gillan was very easy on the eyes. Even so, I gave my personal award to Annalise Basso who played young Kaylee. The storytelling was top notch with seamless back and forth revelation of the past and the present. I just realized that I've watched another Mike Flanagan horror movie, which was also good and scary. I have to watch out for this guy's future work, either in writing or directing.",Oculus
187,Zebb67,Same old same old,1,10 August 2014,"A haunted mirror is a pretty silly concept even for a supernatural film. Maybe not as silly as a haunted couch or vacuum cleaner, but still pretty silly. This film provides zero scares (unless you're 13 or so) and the inter-cutting from the present to the past is annoying and confusing. Maybe I've seen too movies like this and they just don't do anything for me anymore, but the first two Paranormal Activity films (even though I don't believe in the paranormal) were fairly effective and involving and I was able to suspend disbelief and enjoy them. This poorly directed and acted film resembles the straight-to-video junk that winds up on Netfix streaming. Fans of this film can take heart though; I'm sure there will be many sequels, as horror films that turn even a meager profit (mostly because they cost very little to make) all have sequels these day.",Oculus
188,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: Oculus (2013),8,24 February 2015,"Not many horror films that have been made in the past 7 years were derived from individual ideas. Most were contrived in previous form and just updated for the younger audience, which in my opinion shows us just how bad Hollywood has become when it comes to individuality & original stories. Then comes along a film like Oculus, one that is surrounded in mystery, suspense, and just enough of the horror element to tickle our senses. Mind you this isn't your typical horror film, Blood, guts, & boobs. It's one of those rare intellectually charged horror films, one that truly makes you think about EVERY single frame and what is going to happen next.The film is based on a 2006 horror short film entitled: Oculus: Chapter 3 - The man with the plan. This film's antagonist isn't what you would expect from a horror film, in fact the antagonist is quite shrouded in mystery. This is a kind of hybrid horror film in that aspect.The story is about a brother and sister who experienced some serious trauma during their childhood, which resulted in the brother (played by Brenton Thwaites) being convicted of murder. His sister Kaylie (played by Doctor Who Alumni: Karen Gillan) and him made a childhood pact about what happened all those years ago. Once Tim gets released from his psychiatrist, together they try to remember exactly what happened that night and in doing so proving that the crime was committed by a supernatural phenomenon.This film as I said before is a ""Thinking Man's"" horror film. The opening sequence is a perfect start on how this film is gonna be and where is gonna lead you. The film is shot in present time but also in a variety of flashback sequences that meld into current time on occasion. The jumps are scarce, the cinematography really is the star of this film. The fact that a inanimate object can be created into a on screen villain is quite impressive. Mind you now, there are other aspects of the film that play a major part. The suspense and the intensity is definitely there. So much in fact, that when the twist ending comes around full circle one will be in awe.It's a film that deserves multiple viewings. If you haven't done so check this one out you won't be disappointed.",Oculus
189,filmfanperspective,"Are you afraid of the big, bad, evil-bronze rubbed stained mirror? (*1/2)",3,5 May 2015,"""You see what you want to see""– tagline for ""Oculus""If the above tagline made any sense to you, more power to you. Mirrors have the capacity to bring forth a myriad of emotions from those gazing upon them. From a single view, we can generate everything in our minds from self-doubt, vanity, horror, and even wonder. That being the case, I'm surprised it took this long for the horror genre attempt something preposterous about a mirror, as it seems ripe for the picking. Go figure, ""Oculus"" exists, if for no better reason than to give young people something to do on a weekend. It doesn't have much to say, and when it does, it is vague and non-sensical. Despite a fine visual sensibility and a smattering of palpable tension, ""Oculus"" just doesn't yield anything revelatory, and at times is simply maddening.'Doctor Who' alum Karen Gillan stars as the adult version of Kaylie, and her character is introduced looking rather smugly at a mirror she appears to have located at an auction house. We'll ignore the fact that her employment at said auction house is a convenient way for the script to explain her acquisition, as well as provide her an understanding husband (Ryan) who just happens to run the place. This mirror, with Gothic arches, serpentine decor, and an obvious 'Evil-Rubbed Bronze' stain, is an ominous-looking artifact. The sinister nature of the its' appearance is a dead giveaway that it has an ulterior motive other than, say, hanging on a wall.Keeping in mind the motives of inanimate objects, let's examine the capacity of a mirror to be creepy, and perhaps we can discern whether or not this movie's premise itself is ""ridoculus"" (see what I did there?). When I was younger, I saw mirrors three ways: 1) a reflective surface that was literally a framing device to develop my self- image, 2) a playground for my imagination, as I envisioned a 'world' behind the mirror, and 3) a horrific homeland for monsters and demons, particularly due to the ""Bloody Mary"" myth perpetuated by older friends and relatives. Does ""Oculus"" feel like exploring any of that territory?Of course not, for the mirror in this film has some kind of supernatural power. Those that gaze upon it are 'influenced' (not quite possessed) to carry out horrific deeds for the mirror. Here's the odd part- the mirror can apparently materialize into a physical presence as well, that humans can interact with, and the kids in this film actually see. It leads to an obvious question- why in the world would a supernatural presence have another body take care of what it could do all by itself? It's a good example of why this film doesn't work, for the script provides no motivation or origin for the mirror's nefarious behavior, or scientific reason for it's existence; therefore there are no rules, simply tired devices to advance the plot. In the likely sequels to follow, the writers will be forced to concoct an explanation out of the illogical mess they've created.Back to the ""story""- Kaylie is determined to get back at this inanimate object, so much so that she involves her brother Tim (Thwaites). I have a problem with this: the film shows these two siblings directly involved in the grisly death of their parents, then only reveals that one (Tim) has been hospitalized. Then, upon Tim's release eleven years later, Kaylie immediately involves him in her plan to return to their old home and destroy this mirror that was apparently responsible for their parent's fates. The movie could stop right here, as a healthy Tim would reject his sister's plot for revenge if he was, in fact, healthy. It also bears mentioning that Kaylie, as disturbed as she might also be, doesn't seem to consider her brother's well-being at all. In one step, the film shows us a pair of very close siblings that experienced something terrible, then in the next breath she's dragging him back into the fray and ostensibly risking both of their lives. These siblings aren't as in tune as the movie might suggest- at one point while 'documenting' the mirror's evils, they specifically tell each other to stay together the rest of the time they are in their old house. The very next scene? They split up.This is a good looking movie, capably made and all. There are even a couple of reasonably tense moments, and the score is a fine companion piece. As an entire film, however, it just doesn't work. I wonder if the filmmakers originally started with a story about perception, and the way we view ourselves, or (this is a stretch) perhaps a larger parable about children and the collateral damage of divorce, but ended up with a cheap horror movie. The latter is the more likely of the two. ""Oculus"" makes up rules to advance the story, gives us characters that make odd decisions, and even the film's centerpiece (a killer mirror, oh my!) is given no logical origin or purpose for existence. Even the plot device that seems logical is goofed- the story spends time setting up cameras, computers, and routines to prove the existence of spiritual wrongdoing, but oddly enough, within its' own framework cannot prove it. It's the blind leading the blind. I found myself disliking the film exceedingly more as I took the time to organize my thoughts for this review. Perhaps that's a disservice to the project, and maybe my more immediate reactions would have produced a more favorable result and a fairer assessment. Perhaps it's just a bad film, masquerading as a serious psychological thriller.",Oculus
190,chancellorpink,Family Fears: Childhood Memories of Mom & Dad Revisited,8,12 December 2014,"Oculus is a creepy, stylish little modern horror film that borrows on some old fashioned notions of good horror. Namely, to tell an actual story, while messing with common held expectations for film narrative along the way. The story? Imagine trying to make peace with your childhood fears, and the horrors inflicted by mom and dad, only to find that some things are better left unresolved. The narrative? It's a winner in modern horror because it manages to not overdo the gore or under do the scary. This movie MAY not be an all-time classic (yet), but it never becomes mind-numbingly clichéd or goes for over-the-top shock value points. It's very well-edited and pretty well acted, and if you know the difference between The Exorcist and Saw XXVI, you really need to give its 104 or so minutes a once over. Twice.",Oculus

Pretty much at outset it's possible to predict the outcome for the leads and the clumsy structure almost suggests that an original film and its sequel were spliced together to save marketing costs. The story borrows a great deal from Event Horizon with a mirror as the central source of evil with the ability to project hallucinations, unfortunately while Event Horizon succeeded in creating a malevolent atmosphere, this film falls flat. There are just no effective shocks or tension and the ending is pedestrian. While the plot is disappointing, at least the production quality is good.

192,nyanbatcat,"Strong movie but overuses ""Insanity""",5,30 November 2016,"The movie starts off strong, it takes its time to introduce characters, which are relate-able and interest you in the plot. It is a pleasure to see the story of what happened, being unraveled, the creepy moments get raised and raised very effectively, the first 50 minutes made me think I found a genius movie, sadly my joy would soon drop...The one problem I have with this movie is, that they use the ""what is real and what isn't?"" waaaaay to often. The first few times its very effectively done, but later I only got tired. Faking the audience over and over again, makes for no progress in the actual story at all, the second half nothing happens. Except at the end of course, but by the time you get there, you already realize whats going to happen, which is another reason why I wished, they would have simply cut 20-30 minutes of the movie. I never experienced such a drop in pleasure watching a movie, at first I thought it would become one of my favorites, later on I was at the brink of skipping a few scenes because I began to understand that nothing actually is going to happen.I still recommend this movie to horror fans, since apart from the things stated before, it is a very well executed movie, sadly though the second half falls flat for me and even made me somehow a bit mad (probably because of the wasted potential).",Oculus

The movie didn't feel like a thriller to me nor did the storyline pack a punch. I sat through the movie just because I wanted to write a review about it.The Good - The movie has some good grotesque scenes. I like Karen Gilan's narcissistic and cocky character. The non-linearity of the film is also good as it sways in between past, present and fantasy. Annalise Basso outperformed her role as a child actor.The Bad - The plot has a lot of flaws. The movie was kinda predictable. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat. Honestly, I just sat through it. I could sense it had ""The Shining"" and ""Mirrors"" vibe but failed to put through it.Overall I am not recommending this movie, neither am I tossing it.

194,matic-boh1,Too convoluted to horrify,6,31 May 2014,"Unlike the majority of horror films produced in recent years, Oculus relies less on the idea of suspense, and is defined more by its psychological features, which give the film a very distinct nature, one that somewhat resembles that of The Shining. Throughout the story which focuses on the activity surrounding a mirror that possesses supernatural forces, the audience is constantly exposed to shifts between sanity and reality, as well as separate time periods. Although the film is well set-up and proves to be very intriguing in its early stages, it is ultimately poorly developed and gradually emerges as extremely convoluted, as it becomes increasingly difficult to separate between the different time frames. Despite it offering some disturbing imagery and proving terrifying at times, particularly during scenes accompanied by a chilling soundtrack, Oculus proves to be a film with a clever and well-designed premise that lacks solid execution, which ultimately hurts its ability to horrify.",Oculus

The parallels drawn between the past and present was interesting, but ultimately pointless because you already know the path the past storyline takes as it's conclusion is already stated in the beginning of the movie. The differing viewpoints between the siblings was far more interesting, but never fully utilized.The plot failed more than anything; for a supposedly bright girl to devise such a poor ""plan"" to defeat a mirror that manipulates people. As the mirror manipulates people, there was a HUGE lack of foresight in her plan to begin with.

It is too slow.Acting was fine, that is why I gave it a 3/10. So if you are looking for a decent horror film, skip this one.

The story is that the family mirror makes people do things they can't remember and turns them a bit evil. The son shot the dad and the dad murdered the mum. Years later the son and daughter (bro and sis) go back to the family home and do an elaborate experiment to try and trap the mirror and film all the events to prove how evil it is. It's got a feel to it like insidious, and I liked how the story started straight away. No big build up or character building! The movie flips between when they were young and the present day. You get a better insight into how the mum and dad changed with the presence of the mirror and there are quite a few jumpy bits.. The mirror keeps tricking them and playing with the siblings heads until eventually things don't go to plan and the trap that was set to kill the mirror kills the main character which leaves her young brother taking the rap for yet another crime he didn't commit, it was the mirror all along!! The story is a good story. It there just wasn't enough terror or scary bits for me. After the film finished I just felt like something was missing. Could have been more exciting?

199,ralo229,A Very Unique Horror Film,8,14 December 2014,"After seeing the trailer for this movie, Oculus just kind of looked like the same rehashed crap that we've all seen a million times. But after hearing about all the praise it's gotten, I decided to give it a try and stream it on Netflix. And boy I'm glad I did.The plot follows two siblings whose parents were supposedly driven crazy by a haunted mirror resulting in the sister going into foster care and the brother, who killed the father out of self defense, being sent to a mental institution. 11 years later, the two siblings reunite and return to their old house to try and prove to the world that the mirror is in fact haunted and that the events that unfolded were not fictional. What follows is a series of events that leads the main characters to question what's real and what's not.Unlike most horror movies, Oculus doesn't rely on violence to deliver its scares. In fact, it doesn't even really rely on scares in general. It's meant to be more of a psychological dive into the minds of our two main characters who find that the line between fiction and reality is so blurred that they can't even tell what's real anymore. And the movie tries to make the audience feel the same way by messing with our heads. Who perceived a certain event correctly? Was it really a supernatural occurrence or are the characters just losing their sanity? Oculus doesn't rely on cheap scares like most horror movies do. It takes a more complex and psychological approach to its premise. That's what makes it such a great and unique horror film.",Oculus
200,screenotes,Better than 'Hush',6,14 June 2019,"When her younger brother is finally released from a psychiatric facility years after his conviction for the murder of their parents, a woman seeks to prove the existence of the malignant and supernatural force she believes actually responsible. Conveniently, the locale of said force is a mirror and therefore easily transportable back to the family home-come-erstwhile crime scene.Playing out less like the haunted house story one might expect from the outline above, this interesting take on psychological horror initially subverts expectations by presenting us with a brave and capable heroine with a well thought out (though necessarily flawed) plan. Writer and Director Mark Flanagan who later made the derivative and lacklustre Hush (2016)* and valiantly attempted the 'unfilmable' Stephen King adaptation Gerald's Game (2017), has made female protagonists with agency a feature of his work.**There is some real artistry in the way Oculus employs the storytelling technique of constantly shifting between flashback and present day. Over and above using this device as a clever short cut to character development, it is in the moments where past and present seemingly overlap that the viewer receives the most vivid portrayal of the characters' fraying mental state.Yet it is perhaps these intriguing elements which become the film's worst enemy. In allowing these glimpses into the mind of the characters, there are hints of a rich vein of storytelling left unplundered and therefore 'setup' without payoff. Rather than leaving us wanting more, the untapped potential of Oculus has the unintended effect of relegating it toward mediocrity.Oculus is not without gore nor jump scares and most fans of the horror genre will therefore find it serviceable. Yet in setting up something truly unique and promising a subversion of the genre, there is the abiding feeling that the film lacks the courage of its convictions.* Specifically derivative of the excellent Wait Until Dark (1967).

201,Imaculata,"Underwhelming, not scary, and poor narrative structure",6,31 October 2014,"Oculus is a horror movie that is pretty original in its premise. It's about a mirror that warps people's minds. As long as they are within the influence sphere of the mirror, it makes them see, hear, and think things that are not real. A girl and her brother track down the mirror at an auction, with the intent of proving that the mirror made all its victims commit atrocities. And if that fails, they'll destroy the mirror. However, destroying it is not as simple as you might think. For example, the mirror makes you think your aim is right, but you are really just striking the wall. And when you decide to leave the house, it could be that you are still inside. Phone calls that you receive while in the sphere of influence of the mirror cannot be trusted. So you can't call the police, because you won't know if the phone call is real. Pretty original idea for a horror movie. However, it's not scary, and it can only end in two predictable ways. Since this is a horror movie, the inevitable outcome is probably bad. You also know that you'll never find out the motives of the mirror, because there are none, and you know the movie can't really surprise you. Because its a mirror. It's just a mirror. That just limits the scope of the movie.Now the acting is well done, and I like the make up effects and the overall look of the film. The soundtrack is however annoying, and it really starts to grate on you (especially during the credits, where the same tune is repeated to death). I don't like the narrative structure of the movie. The way it is set up, it constantly flashes back and forth between memories and current day. And it does this from beginning to end! And while you learn more about the fate of the parents of the protagonists, its nothing really surprising: the mirror drove them mad (which you already know from the start of the movie). What I do like, is how the girl in the movie plans to prove that the mirror made all of its victims commit atrocities. She has a very decently thought out approach, with contingencies in case the mirror tries to fool them. Her only flaw in the plan is her brother. Right from the start of the movie, it is clear that he is an idiot who refuses to believe he's in a horror movie. He is probably the last person she could have chosen to assist her during this experiment.By the time the credits rolled, I had kind of lost interest in the movie. There just wasn't enough substance to fill a whole movie. So on the whole, its a bit underwhelming.",Oculus
202,sstetsko,"To give it a 10 undervalues 10s, but is it good... well, yes.",7,20 June 2014,"Honestly it is not as original as some people make it out to be. Movies with supernatural forces which enter the mind and alter perception are commonplace enough... haunted objects which become obsessions to their victims also commonplace enough, but in this day and age to dismiss a tale because it lacks originality is unfair. There are few if any really original things under the sun anymore... at least not in conventional narratives. With that said I will chip in with the masses and say the tale is artfully told. The background is well set up, the way the realities/memories collide visually and work on the character's minds catches the imagination, and the acting is convincing and compelling so you can be carried along into the tale more easily. Cinematography is cleanly done, it does not rely on cheap gimmicks and jump scares, atmosphere is well maintained throughout, and all in all it was well worth the watch. In a year where good movies seem a little sparse it actually shines by comparison. But don't be too swept up by the hype. Certain elements of the ""haunting"" were much more predictable than I would have liked and the general ending was given away too easily from near the very start.

203,dareent-amethyst,Fun to watch,7,26 May 2014,"I saw oculus' trailer a few weeks before it came out and was immediately hooked. I was curious what the movie is about and was pretty excited when I finally got to see the movie. Even though I came in excited I didn't really have high expectations because from past experiences high expectations will just lead to disappointment. So I came to see the movie with my friends and we were all pleased. The movie is fun to watch, and even though it's a little confusing at first we grasped the idea quite quickly. Oculus is very fun to watch because its confusing and unpredictable and you don't know what to think or expect would happen next. You don't know which scene is real and which is not, you don't know if someone is going to get killed anytime soon or a ghost is going to appear in 3 seconds. I also enjoy the bloody scenes especially the one where the sister chewed a light bulb. Basically everyone in the theater gasped in horror and I couldn't stop whispering 'oh my god', I've never really seen such reaction in the theater before so it was quite awesome. The downside of this movie for me though, is that it doesn't really tell the audience why the mirror is haunted or who the ghost inside the mirror is. But that's just my opinion, some people think this is in fact the upside of the movie since it lets the audience to think for themselves what the answer to these questions are. I don't quite like the ending even though its good- I feel bad for the guy and think that he doesn't deserve anything that has happened to him. The sister is clearly the crazy one and its clearly not his fault that his sister died.

205,banglainey,Very Disappointed,5,29 May 2014,"I love the horror genre, and I will tolerate a bad horror film to see new concepts, new monsters, new paranormal threats, or new horrific themes in the genre. To me, even bad horror movies have something to add to the genre and are worth watching. When I saw the previews for this movie, I was immediately interested. It looked original. It wasn't a monster movie, it wasn't a psycho murdered movie, and it wasn't your average ghost story. After watching, I must say I was pretty disappointed with the lack of innovation.The first half of the movie is more or less an introduction, laying the groundwork to the story, the background, the characters, etc. and I must say this part was done quite well, and it was very intriguing. As the explanation unraveled I was eager for the adventure to begin because the story setup was excellent and leaves the audience primed for a good story. The last half of the film is the bulk of the ""horror"" part, however there is a strange element of time in this film which made it kind of hard to follow, and the film doesn't display a consistent timeline. Often I was left confused as to exactly if the characters were in the present, reliving old memories as their old selves, or if what we were seeing was just a flashback. Usually if a story has a lot of time changing (going back and forth through time in flashbacks), what happens in the present is mostly, somehow, explained in the story when it switches back to the present, but what happens in this film is that once the flashbacks begin to take over the story, there is almost no explanation of what is happening in the present. The story will flash back to the present and leave the audience wondering what's going on, or what happened in the interim, or why this character is doing this, or why that character is doing that.The film could have also been so much better if there was perhaps a ""tell"" of some sort when what the characters were experiencing was a paranormal event or not. The film makes many references to illusions or hypnotic states as a plot driver, but at some points it is so diluted even you as the audience member are wondering, wait is what's happening here, really happening, or are the characters just imagining it happening? There is no way to tell, and the film does nothing to explain it. You are just left wondering, and that to me is a weak storyline, leaving it up to the audience to decide.In all, it started off promising and ended quite ridiculously, with none of the phenomena really explained at all, and the characters more or less completely failed at every objective. Not to say that a story MUST have a happy ending in order to be a good film, but it must have some sort of resolution, even if the ending is not always a good one for the characters themselves. This story failed to grasp the really interesting parts- the paranormal phenomena surrounding the circumstances, the two lead characters having opposing ideas about what had happened, and how what happened in the past is explained (or in this film, not explained.)

I'm sure many will say they loved this movie, but I found it to be utterly dumb and the whole scenario of the movie to be futile.The movie boils down to a traumatized girl thinking some how she can out smart a mirror who's killed at least 40 people over hundreds of years. Either she's crazy or full of herself and that's my issue. Most horror movies you know it isn't going to end well, but this movie tells you in the first 30 minutes how exactly it won't end well. So I kinda felt like I was watching a pointless movie.It just feels so dumb. At what point does a writer not realize he is writing a character who doesn't some how understand that her and her brother have always been the mirrors next victims. If I was in that situation as a kid, I would stay away from the mirror. Knowing I need to respect the power of the mirror and not think I have the smarts to to beat a mirror that can make people kill themselves.",Oculus
207,TheMovieVlog,Instant Horror Classic!,7,3 April 2014,"This was really not that bad for a horror movie. The whole mirror monster sort of thing has been done before but what made this movie refreshing to me was the complete mind trip that was going on throughout the movie. I spent more than like 3/4ths of the movie utterly confused yet it made sense by the end. It was all over the place but slowly, I was able to piece things together. I personally thought it had the right amount of horror that it was actually able to make me jump at some parts without being too cringe worthy like most horror films are. Also, I was impressed with what was done despite the simplicity of the film. Tons of thrills, tons of fun. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this.",Oculus

In all the other movies they burn the doll or break the statue and everything is cool. This was different.Now, I was disappointed in the ending a bit. I hated the flashbacks during the end... Right after sis gets it in the neck. It was okay because I see the correlation but... I guess my issue was, why not just kill Tim? To keep the legacy alive? Nah, as long as the mirror is alive the legacy will continue. To promote a sequel... Well, I can't imagine him getting out of prison AGAIN! Especially with the taped evidence...

But for me, who screams at the sight of my own shadow, Oculus is just the right amount of creepy & thrilling. Sometimes it's a bit weak, but the acting & superb editing keeps you glued and at the edge of your seat. The score which gives you a sense of foreboding also adds to the impending doom that has been masterfully manipulated by the director using a series of flashbacks intertwined with the siblings' present & increasingly is-it-delusion-or-is-it-really-the- mirror dilemma. Karen Gillan deserves a mention for an excellent performance as the lead character.And I'll seriously be on the lookout for Flanagan's future projects.My Rating: 4.5/5 - It's not the best horror film ever and I doubt if it's gonna be a cult classic, but for the genre it belongs to it surely deserves better recognition.READ MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON BLOGGER: http://strangereview.blogspot.com/#sthash.k9wDSUgJ.dpuf",Oculus
213,blatherskitenoir,A well done distortion of reality,6,11 April 2014,"""Oculus"" offers up a slow and twisted mind screw of a film. Like the brother/sister pair, the audience is never quite certain whether what they're seeing on the screen is real, false, past, or present, creating an unsettling, disorienting horror film. Fans of slash and violence will dislike the slow build and more cerebral nature of ""Oculus,"" but anyone who has ever feared going out of their mind will be terrified.Beautiful to look at and with an exceptional child actor for young Kaylie (Annalise Basso,) the film has some minor flaws holding it back from achieving cult-classic-hood. Adult Kaylie (Karen Gillan) may be the film's greatest weakness, as the character is neither strong enough nor broken enough to truly like. Instead, adult Kaylie comes across as increasingly manic and unfeeling as she disregards the well being of her fresh-from-the-asylum baby brother and even attempts to sacrifice a dog to prove her blind obsession with the mirror is real. Because we don't like Kaylie, we don't forgive her when she makes character in a horror film mistakes and don't particularly care what she suffers; our detachment detracting from the overall horror experience. ""Oculus"" is a better than average, creepy mind-bender of a scary flick, and I would recommend it for lonely popcorn nights in.",Oculus

This, of course, was one of those movies that promotes scary commercials, but never keeps their word.  The plot was different. That's what was interesting about it. It had its moments that made me jump a little, but the ending ruined the entire movie. There was no closure, now his entire family was dead and he was on his way back to prison. Seriously?!The characters were copacetic. They're weren't any kind of big time actors.

216,mrstrangerjones,Mike Flanagan's Best Film (to date),8,10 April 2018,"Mike Flanagan is still a relatively unknown name to mainstream audiences, but fans of the genre will recognize him. He is the director of ""Absentia"", ""Hush"", ""Oculus: Origin of Evil"", and ""Gerald's Game"". He is also signed on to create the Netflix show ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and the upcoming Stephen King adaptation ""Doctor Sleep"" (a sequel to King's novel ""The Shining"").
However, two of his films are underrated: ""Before I Wake"" and ""Oculus"".""Oculus"" is a brilliantly told and twisty thriller about two siblings who try to prove that a mirror is responsible for many deaths, including that of their parents. Much like the novel ""It"", this film alternates between these siblings when they are children and when they are adults.The performances in this film are great, even from the young children. However, the standout performance is from Katee Sackhoff as she slowly starts to lose her sanity. Her turn in the movie is quite terrifying, and even adds some emotion later in the film.Another thing about this film is its twisty narrative. Normally, it would get convoluted, but Flanagan does a good job of making it cohesive. I really like how the film almost starts to make it seem like it might be a psychological thriller instead of a supernatural horror. This uncertainty towards what I'm watching is what really makes this film so interesting. It also does a good job of switching between past and present.Finally, the tone of this movie is perfect. It's an extremely dark movie, with an ending that just tore me apart (while also expecting a sequel of some sort). The film is also very emotional, due to its superb performances.""Oculus"" is a very scary movie that really should get more attention than it got.

Definitely for those who like films about Paranorman, so I believe that this film will certainly not disappoint them, and I recommend everyone who likes this kind of horror to watch this film.",Oculus
218,Phillip_Tomasso,Surprisingly Horrific,8,9 June 2014,"When I first saw trailers for this film, I decided it looked lame. I was set against paying ten bucks for a film I knew I'd hate. Oculus recently hit a bargain theater in the area. With little else to do, I figured, why not? Rory Cohcrane portrays Alan Russell. Due to a job, he's moved his family into a new house. For his home office he bought some furniture including an old, old mirror. With him he brought his wife, Marie (Katy Sackoff), his ten-year-old son, Tim and thirteen-year-old daughter Kaylie.The story takes place in the present, and eleven years earlier. As ""adults,"" Brenton Thwaits plays Tim, and Karen Gillan is Kaylie. Garrett Ryan is the ten-year-old, and Annalise Basso is young Kaylie. All four actors do an amazing job.During a particular night in the past, the Russell family issues come to a head. Tim is arrested for shooting and killing his father. Locked away in a psychiatric hospital the movie begins with his release. Upon his release his sister has one goal in mind. She has kept a pulse on the mirror's whereabouts, and recently bought it at an auction. The intent, to destroy it and the evil spirit living inside and behind the glass.The mirror will not allow any harm to come to it. It has powerful defenses. It controls a person's mind within a radius. It implants thoughts and memories. It also steals them. The illusions, and delusions are horrifying and complex.The plot continually jumps back and forth between present and past. I worried this would hurt the storytelling. At first the jumps are obvious, then seamless, and instead create amazing amounts of tension and suspense.The scares are not cheap. The plot is well-crafted and tricky and well- played. It was a scary movie with great characters and a smart story. The acting was spot on, and the chills never stopped. Yes – there is a fair amount of ground worked laid in the first twenty or so minutes. But it was informative and interesting. After that, the terror is non-stop and edgy.I loved the film. Am almost mad I did not rush to theaters to see it when released. Mike Flanagan both wrote and directed the movie on a $5 million dollar budget. At 103 minutes (and rated R), I'd have to give Oculus 8 out of 10 Stars, and label it as one of the most entertaining horror movies I have seen in a while.Phillip Tomasso, Author of The Vaccination Trilogy and other novels! www.philliptomasso.com",Oculus
219,gorepump,Surprisingly decent 'mainstream' horror...,6,9 November 2014,"""Oculus"" wasn't as bad as I expected, though it's far from anything I would consider great. At least it took a slightly different approach than most other 'supernatural'-themed American horror films of late.An auction house worker comes across a mirror that she suspects caused her father to torture and kill her mother when she was a child. After her brother gets out of the nut-house where he had been since that incident, she takes him to their childhood home where she has rigged a series of surveillance cameras and other such props in order to prove her suspicions and destroy the evil mirror once and for all. The movie switches back and forth between present time and their childhood and what led up to all the craziness that unfolded amongst their family's devastating outcome...What makes ""Oculus"" stand out from a lot of the other 'mainstream' ghost/possession movies these days is that it goes for a more 'slow-burn' type of advent, as opposed to the million jump-scares and CGI ghost method that is popular now. I guess my main problem would be that it really feels like two-movies-in-one with the frequent flashbacks, which actually makes a lot of the present day stuff seem a bit pointless in the long-run. The childhood stuff is MUCH more interesting and could maybe have worked on it's own, I'd say, without all the present day drama sh*t getting in the way. All that could have worked, I thought, but it ends up kinda getting buried beneath the much more engaging flashback B-story. I that way, the movie as a whole felt a bit 'clunky' to me and not as well thought out as it could have been. Overall, ""Oculus"" is a fine one to put on if you got nothing else to watch some night...More of my horror reviews @ swinesewage.blogspot.com",Oculus

224,didonatope,Not for the Squeamish,9,11 April 2014,"""Oculus"" is one of those horror films that you rarely see in recent years: a wide-release scary movie with an actual sense of dread and horror. This along with last year's ""The Conjuring"" and ""You're Next"" could easily signify an improvement in Hollywood horror. Starring up incoming actors Karen Gillan (appearing this summer in Guardians of The Galaxy) and Brenton Thwaits (appearing in this summer's ""Maleficent""), Oculus tells the disturbing tale of two siblings going face-to-face with a supposedly haunted mirror that haunted them as children. After the brother Tim (Thwaits) is released from a mental institution, his arguably more unstable sister Kaylie (Gillan) recruits him to take part in an experiment to prove that an antique mirror is responsible for the death of their mother when they were kids. In the wrong hands, this plot could have been handled haphazardly and poorly. However, writer/director Mike Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard do a fine job in crafting a genuinely unsettling but well-made experience. The structure of this film is fantastic. While other films like ""Twilight: Eclipse"" and ""Man of Steel"" poorly execute flashbacks into the main story, ""Oculus"" actually uses flashbacks to its advantage. Throughout the movie, the audience is shown what happened to the main characters as children. Instead of showing all of the events chronologically, the writers make the wise choice of interspersing the events of each story (the past and the present) in a parallel fashion. For example, what happens at the beginning of the past's story is shown back-to-back with what happens at the beginning of the present's story. The events are shown in a way that both stories reach full circle by the end. In many ways, the structure itself is symbolized by the mirror; the past and present are reflected and shown parallel to each other.Moreover, the sheer unpredictability of the plot makes the terror even more effective. Considering that the characters are both mentally traumatized by the events of their childhood, it isn't sure at the beginning whether or not the mirror is actually haunted. Before the answer to that question is revealed, the main characters constantly have disorienting hallucinations. Whether it's suddenly finding themselves in another room or seeing people that aren't there, the story is reminiscent to a nightmare where nothing you do can stop what's going to happen. No matter what the characters do, there is always a sense of not knowing what really happened and what didn't. The Grade-A editing of this film certainly helps its effectiveness too.Something else that makes this a superior modern horror film is the lower-than-average emphasis on cheap gore. While there are some bloody, grisly scenes in ""Oculus,"" their sporadic appearances make them even more terrifying when they show up. The violence is mixed perfectly with the creepiness to ensure a much more terrifying experience than the average moviegoer would expect. It is perhaps the first time in quite a while where I could take gory scenes seriously. The same goes for the performances.Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaits elevate a fine script into a masterful film with compelling, honest performances that make the film much more raw and fear-inducing. I for one am looking forward to seeing their blockbuster debuts this Summer; with performances like these, I'm sure they will make it to the big time in no time. While I'm not expecting ""Oculus"" to do HUGE numbers at the box office, I sincerely hope a sequel is made (a theatrical-level one, not a poor direct-to-DVD one). Without spoiling the film, the plot is tied up nicely at the end, a fine franchise could certainly be made of this. If you're a fan of disturbing, creepy, competent horror films, I'd highly suggest checking this one out. Be prepared though; I can honestly say it is one of the more disquieting films I've seen in recent years.",Oculus
225,lestatbesa,"Sly, Pleasurably Frightening, Shocking Horror to Watch",7,2 August 2020,"I have seen a lot of work of Mike Flanagan aside this one. I know exactly he is the one directing/writing due to its film has a same approach as The Haunting of Hill House. Though the ending is upsetting or rather I say shocking, it is one of pleasurably frightening and heart pounding film I've watched. I am glad Flanagan took different approach in this film because if the other director work on it, it will be found footage film. The film is creative and intelligent. They proficiently manage to build a tension that make feel the ending open to question.Another thing that stand out in this film is how captivating the performance of cast with high notes to Gillian, Basso, Thwaites, Sackhoff.There is a scene that I hate due to false jumpscare that make me cringe a bit but almost all of jumpscare is properly use.

228,writerever365,Defies The Horror Movie Stigma!,10,27 May 2015,"I saw this on Netflix and thought, ""what the heck?"". I've been on a horror flick kick recently. This movie blew my expectations out of the water. From the beginning, I could tell it was going to be something different. Every thing about it is beautifully horrifying. The cinematography is genius. The real star of this film is the subtle scares. Most horror films nowadays rely on scream queens and copious gore. This movie was notably restrained in its depiction of gore. This does something special for a movie - it makes it more jarring when there is blood (which there is never too much of).The acting really takes a backseat to the story and the way it unfolds on screen. That's not to say the acting isn't good - far from it, I believe these actors surpass those in typical horror films. But the way the story unfolds and is filmed is so tight, so precise, so perfect, nothing can hinder this film from being amazing.Another thing you should know. The scares are VERY REAL in this film. There aren't many jump scares, but those that are there are again used sparingly for better effect. But I think I've never been affected this much by a horror movie. And I'm not easily scared (I laughed at Psycho). How much did it affect you, you ask? I had to walk into my garage after seeing this film, and I took a kitchen knife. Just in case...See this movie. Simply see it. Deeply effecting and scary.",Oculus
229,Mrbrown43,Oculus: See the mirror....,8,16 January 2017,"One of my central ideas of a piece of horror is the one of two scenarios that most works of horror fall into. The first one is where you are running in a dark wood with something chasing you. You have been attacked by this something and you cannot run much longer. You are sweating and shaking with fear because even through you do not know where the something is you know that it is there and you know it is going to get you at anytime.... The next scenario is where you are in your house and you are totally safe, nothing is out to get you and there is no reason for anything to get you. But you can't tell what is real. Which one of these ideas scares you more? If you picked the latter then you most likely be affected by this movie as it takes the second scenario and makes full use of it. Oculus is a fantastic horror film about distorted perceptions that is sadly let down by some short comings.The plot centers around two people namely Tim and Kylie Russell. Brother and sister who lost both their parents when they killed each other. The film jumps between the past when Tim and Kylie are children trying to survive their parents decent into insanity and the present where the adult siblings try to kill the mirror who Kylie blames for the cause of her parents madness. The film's most important aspect is the mirror itself as it is able to twist our five senses to what it wants us to see, smell, taste, hear and touch. This seeming simple aspect and with first class editing the movie becomes a horrific decent into a nightmare as Tim and Kylie struggle to tell what is real and fake. The uncertainty bleeds into us, thanks to sheer perfection of the editing we start to lose track of what is happening where and what is really happening on screen. This might sound like a negative but I mean all of it with the highest praise I felt as lost as the characters. The mirror feels like a very real threat which never stops lying and tricking us. I do not what to give much away because Oculus is one of those films that need to be seen with as little knowledge beforehand to get all the surprises and shocks at their full power. The two plots run parallel and sometimes seemingly cross paths at key points. If they are real are just fake is left to the viewers interpretation. Another key thing to consider is how Tim and Kylie are introduced. Tim went into a mental institution after his parents died and was taught that there was no haunted mirror and their dad had a mental breakdown. Kylie was never taken into therapy and continued to believing the mirror killed her parents. Her obsession with finding the mirror and killing it is told very early with the detail that she became an auctioneer's assistant and hunted for the mirror, lying her way into having it for the fateful few days. The contrast is meant to keep us guessing either side has mental problems with Tim suppressing trauma or Kylie losing her mind over a tragic event and chasing a childhood fantasy. This aspect is where the film slips up. The film tries to keep us wondering whether our protagonists are suffering from some sort of metal sickness, that namely of dementia or schizophrenia. The film tries to do the same the parents but it does not work due to revealing the supernatural aspect far too soon, it cheapens the theme and makes the attempts somewhat pointless. If it had pulled it off then it would have gone from simply fantastic to a full on masterpiece. I am sorry if I seem vague about this movie. I can't risk ruining the twists and atmosphere of this movie, Oculus is a great movie that, with a bit of polish could have been something amazing. Tim is played by Brenton Thwaites. Kylie is played Karen Gillan. Oculus was directed by Mike Flanagan.",Oculus

232,Joe_Chadowski,"A brilliant, creative, slow-burner of a horror movie sandwiched between a lackluster opener and predicable ending",6,12 April 2014,"A while ago I reluctantly accepted that we will probably never see a truly groundbreaking horror movie again. A film that is both truly cinematic and gut-wrenchingly horrifying. Hollywood has just become to commercialized, too calculated, and to conveyor belt-like in its approach to horror. Everything is summer blockbuster, Oscar season, and the crap that comes out January-March. Horror has become a get-rich- quick investment for producers. Invest small, obtain profit 10-fold. But once in a while, a horror film gives us a glimmer of hope. Not redemption, but a little window of light from someone who almost gets it. And the skunkworks group from the Saw-Insidious-The Conjuring clan are to thank for that. They're latest work, Oculus, is the story of a brother and sister who obtain a mirror from their childhood that (they think) was responsible for the possession and murder of their parents. They rig their childhood home with cameras and lights, and wait for the proof that the mirror is possessed to get captured on camera.Oculus is properly scary and, once you get past the awkward first 20 minutes, has a wonderfully progressive nature to it. Too many ""horror"" film nowadays deliver an uneven stream of gut-punches in the form of BOOM scares and disfigured faces. Oculus relies on an unsettling tonality, and a quantum state of uncertainty, making it a much more effective scare. The colors and set design is vintage Gothic horror, and the majority of the film is flashback driven which is was a very creative storytelling method and integrates perfectly with the story. And there's a scene or two that were so intense, I was making noises like I was lowering myself into scalding water, and fighting the intrinsic urge to turn my head.My frustrations are centered on the beginning and the end. The first 20 minutes of the film, which set the story in place, is the only part of Oculus that takes place outside the house. It feels tacked on, ham-fisted in its delivery and lacks narrative, especially against the rest of the film. And given the flashback-heavy story, I believe the setting of the story could've been built into the flashbacks, strengthing the narrative and setting the whole film inside the house, which would make the film feel terrifyingly claustrophobic. And about the ending... It's just clichéd, predicable, abrupt and leaves too many questions unanswered.Oculus isn't the last word in horror or quality, but it's scary as hell and it does what so few horror films do nowadays; it dissolves the world around you and makes you buy into a ridiculous story. The weak narrative gets a little long in the tooth around the third act, and I was left wondering if the script was ever going to reveal anything worth discovering. And ultimately it doesn't. Much like the never-ending winter we've had, we've had so many lackluster horror films lately, that when an average film comes along it feels like a gift.",Oculus

234,shotgun-69216,Mind-Bending and Original,9,13 November 2018,"This is not a mindless horror flick. This is not a slasher gore-fest. This is not a mes of jumpscares and poor choices. No, Oculus is the kind of horror movie that many others should strive to be. Between the atmosphere, the acting, the sound design, and the overall writing, this is a near-perfect horror film for those who enjoy a slower paced but intense movie. The characters act like real people, showing confusion and fear, and asking questions along the way.Now many people will complain about plot holes and unanswered questions, but if you pay attention, especially in the beginning, most of them are cleared up. The one involving the last failsafe is somewhat well-founded, but even that one isn't big enough to ruin the rest of the film, even if it does make a major twist somewhat predictable.The best part, though, is the way you get to feel how the characters themselves feel as events escalate. You feel the increasing sense of dread, the increasing blur between perception and reality. And the way it shows both the events from the past and the events of the present works brilliantly for this film.The only reason I'm not giving this film a perfect score is because I did see the biggest twist coming because of something that would've taken a minor change to hide better. Other than that, this is one of the most original horror films of the modern day, and with the way characters will ask questions and mostly act like real people put this high on my list.",Oculus
235,tasev1,It is more than you think.....,8,8 May 2014,"First off, I am not one to see very many horror movies. This was my first experience seeing one in the theatre. I was actually scared going in, and watching the trailer gave me visions.So, if you call this movie 'horror', then it failed because I wasn't really scared at all. What I WOULD call this film is a psychological thriller - and a good one at that!!! Why? Because it kept me thinking about the plot, and even after the film I formulated a theory. The movie itself gives you all the clues to make your own judgement, but no matter the judgement, it can't be wrong. The story is rather different, puzzling, and refreshing. Cinematography was done brilliantly by melding the past and the present, child and adult, to show parallels in the story.Here's the jist, without much spoiler - a girl obsesses over a mirror that she believes to be haunted and responsible for the death of her parents. Her brother, fresh out of a mental hospital is dragged to the old house with her to record and document the events she is about to cause. Based on statements in the film, I have formulated this theory: Is the mirror really haunted, or are the lead characters suffering from mental illness and everything they see and believe is in their head? In either case, it is plausible.",Oculus

237,gidmid,"Great, but I didn't love the ending",8,17 April 2021,"Kaylie dying is fine, it works, the final fight needed that powerful moment/twist, but the ending still should have been more hopeful. The ending should be bitter sweet, not just pure melancholy. They should have won, but still lost. Because they didn't destroy the mirror it makes the whole film feel worthless in retrospect.Okay here's How I think It Should Have Ended:
So Kaylie dies, Tim runs to her, he's sad, screaming(like in the film), but when he hears the sirens, he gets a determined look on his face. He runs back to the rope, begins lifting up the trap, Kaylie's body falls to the ground. He's sad but keeps lifting, then she jumps up, tells Tim that she's all right and that he can stop. He's sad but pulls the trap all the way up and gets ready to reset it. She jumps in front of the mirror. Tim sets off the trap, it goes through Kaylie's body, since she's not really there and shatters the mirror to pieces. Tim runs to it checks if it's real and then starts crying next to Kaylie's body. When the cops take him away, he's not screaming like his child self, he's just quietly mourning for his sister, knowing he revenged her and their parents.I feel like this way the ending would be a lot more powerful and it wouldn't feel like the it was all for nothing, especially the rest of the film was so good.",Oculus

Sooo many stupid jump scares.If she had planned everything perfectly for years why did she make so many stupid decisions and give the mirror so many oportunities to manipulate their minds - like she knew it would!

239,Shewattsi,"Very unnerving film, a must see for horror fans",9,13 June 2020,"I think Oculus is really underrated. I watch a lot of horror films, and unlike other haunting or possession themes films this one actually scared me.
It's hard to describe why this film succeeds for me where many others don't, but I think the main reason it that it relies less on jump scares and actually has a solid premise. Without giving anything away, there's a moment where the characters don't know whether they are in or outside of their house. This is just one of many confusing moments (for the characters) but it perfectly captures the horrifying concept of not knowing whether you can trust your own eyes or not.
There is some criticism that the film doesn't explain certain things enough, and I do see what those people mean. My recommendation would just be to go with it and enjoy.",Oculus
240,Cinemafou,Same old,4,5 February 2015,"I wanted to like this. It seemed to have potential. The haunted mirror is a good start, a mechanism used very effectively in much earlier films, such as one of the stories in ""Dead of Night"" from 1945. Unfortunately this film is like virtually all modern horror films. It does not follow up well on promising details offered at the beginning. It goes on too long. It pulls in unnecessary and distracting supernatural characters. It gets confused. Worst of all, it is NOT SCARY. When it got to the point of seeming way too familiar, I knew. Why movie producers are so utterly helpless with horror films I do not understand. I won't suggest that all old horror films are good, but there some real gems from yesteryear whereas these days it seems nothing since ""The Exorcist"" shows any real skill in making something truly creepy.",Oculus
241,Viator Veritatis,Devoid of any logic,2,19 February 2016,"Oculus has no real sense of logic and in its second half it relinquishes any attempt to build up a coherent plot. As we it so frequently happens in horror movies, the authors apparently intertwine, but effectively confuse past and present, reality and illusion in order to conceal the lack of any consistent storyline and feel free to serve the viewer with a confused sequel of horror sequences governed by no logic at all.I liked the beginning. The meticulous preparations the girl undertakes in view of the experiment made me hope in a movie centered on a solid, rational battle between the characters and the evil force imprisoned in the mirror. Yet subsequently we experience that the mirror has godlike powers of illusion over the human brain till 30 yards or so of distance. What's the sense of being prepared with cameras and switches against an opponent that can make you see or feel anything at any time, with no limits at all? Why doesn't she trigger the anchor at once and makes an end to it? At that, why does not she simply shoot the mirror with a rifle from outside its influence radius? What is the sense of forcing her shaken brother – just released from a mental institution – to help her without informing or preparing him in advance, to the extent that he ends up arguing the whole time and botches the whole thing? The real reason why the movie makers introduced the absurd godlike supernatural entity simply is that, in this way, they have a cheap excuse for making up any sloppy scare they can think of with no concern for a coherent outline and no need for a rationale.Only recommended for those who care nothing for consistency or a solid plot.",Oculus
242,hugorocksmy,Twisted Story with Excellent Performances,8,1 May 2014,"Even though it wasn't as scary or gory, as I wanted it to be. It still managed to creep me out and get on my nerves, with it's very creative and elaborate story and excellent performances from all it's cast. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the two younger actors played by Annalise Basso & Garrett Ryan, and the relationship they had as characters, which added a lot of heart and sentiment to the whole story. Moreover, this movie was more a drama with some horror, because it didn't played with the whole scare and gore factors, but instead it was more about the the story behind the mirror and the effect it had with the people that surrounded it. It would be a good idea to make this a franchise because of how extensive its universe could be, as well as how many different stories and characters it could incorporate and continue to haunt, even though it's ending was melodramatic to me, it felt conclusive and eerily heartbreaking. Overall, it was a very good little drama-horror film that goes more farther than you could imagine and think.",Oculus
243,edwardscissorhands12-874-850830,Oculus,9,17 April 2014,"OCULUS is that movie you hate that tries to be deeply phsycological while trying to juggle the more-complicated-than-it-needs-to-be style of horror movie. About 90% of thee films fail, but OCULUS is a movie that excels in every sense of the way. The twisted, mind-bottling scenarios set up by this evil mirror with a soul crushing oculus are the perfect way to set up suspense while maintaining the psychological aspects necessary for a horror movie. As you see he mirror twist and question reality for the characters, you're right there with them with a constant question of ""Is this real?"" looming in your mind, which is a great approach to pull off psychedelic suspense. These strategies are well assisted by a great story structure with the technique of switching between time periods to create character development of characters by revealing similarities to themselves in the present to the past, a very very effective story telling technique. The acting is all it needs to be for a horror movie mostly due to the fact acting is not where importance lies. Katee Sackhoff is phenomenal as the emotionally scarred scared-s***-less mother, a strong lead for the movie. The pacing of this film is phenomenal, some of the best I have ever seen in a horror movie. The one downfall it had is some poorly done CGI for things that could have been done using practical effects. Also, I think the ending was off, but only by a couple of beats, not surprising for a horror film though. But overall, Oculus is the best horror movie since The Conjuring, and it certainly will be remembered as one of the best psychologically disturbing films ever made.GRADE: 94 / A",Oculus

This movie is great, it has a great story line about how they are trying to prove that the mirror caused their parents deaths. The best part I think personal about the movie is that, it had the ability questions what's really happening in the movie, always wondering did that actually happen in the movie or is it one of the mirrors tricks? It keeps you entertained by the story line, it's not to gory it mentally messes with the mind of the main characters, and makes them think they do not know what's real or fake. Which in turn questioning what the characters are seeing or real or fake? It's also not one of those movies where you know when something going to jump out at you, you can never tell what's going to happen next that deepens the plot line. You never know when you learn more history about the characters on the past. They are playing 2 stories one about what happened in the past and what's happening during their present. The stories are what happened when the first came in contact with the mirror and what they are doing to prove that the mirror caused their parents deaths.

Yes, that is how good Oculus really is. Horror films are a much beaten genre these days and it is incredibly difficult to get a horror movie without one of the standard plots: 1) tortured human soul turns into terrifying ghost 2) exorcised human hanging off the top corner of a wall 3) plain corny movies about serial killers mutilating their victims. Most of the times you already know what to expect when you see a scary movie but nothing will prepare you for the intrigue that Oculus whips up just after about 30 minutes into the film. Thankfully, the director did not personify the evil spirit( as in Mama(2013) and The woman in black(2013) and kept the evil forces as abstract as possible thereby impressing upon the audience of its power to deceive, destroy and kill.

247,ub92,What a Joke,3,18 June 2017,"The film had the potential to be pretty decent (6/10). However, the main issue was with Karen Gillan's acting, more specifically her line delivery, and unfitting emotions. Now Gillan by no means is a bad actress so I'm inclined to blame the director for this one. Second, the ending was rather uneventful and underwhelming. Gillan's line delivery was terribly cringe-worthy, especially during the scene when she was explaining the mirror on video. The tone was off, it felt unnatural and unlike someone in that situation. It was almost as if the character was opening for a cheap horror house or circus. Take special note when she delivers the line ""please smash it, by all means"" she smiles, her eyes dilate, and she whispers it like a line a campy bond villain. I laughed.I think the ending of the movie was planned like ""You know the good guy always wins in the movie, let's be different"" *eye roll*. In addition to such a pretentious effort, the ending itself is rather blah and felt phoned in. Guy kills his sister by accident, repeating history, he'll be forever known as a psychopath killer, while the mirror continues to circulate home to home. MEH.",Oculus
248,atiyaahsan,Finally.....The horror movie of the year has arrived!!!,10,19 September 2014,"Each year there comes out at least one horror movie that is labelled either a cult classic or an instant hit; and this is one of those movies. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a genre-setter like ""Paranormal activity""/ ""Blair witch project"" or the original ""Saw"" film but it is definitely at par with last year's ""The conjuring"". I'm not going to delve too much into the story as I don't wish to give away any spoilers. All I will say is that the story deals with a cursed mirror and that that it scared the living daylights out of me. I haven't been this afraid watching a horror flick since the original ""Nightmare on Elm street"" franchise came out. What both these movies have in common is that they instil a sense of helplessness in the spectator. Just like you can't escape from Freddy Kruger's clutches once you enter into his world of dreams, similarly, you can't escape the horror this satanic mirror will subject you to once you get within 30 feet of its radius. Usually when you are watching a horror flick, you do so with a sense of laid-back detachment thinking none of this could ever happen to you, and even if it did, you wouldn't be so stupid as to do what the protagonist or the other characters are doing but in this movie, you will find yourself powerless to do anything other than what the mirror wants you to do and all the while you will be thinking you're doing the right thing cuz' that is the illusion the mirror surrounds you with. The twists that you see when the characters find out what they did, as compared to what they thought they were doing, will leave you dumbfounded and horrified. The performances are all top-notch, the editing, crisp and quick- paced. I have rated this movie a 10 although in all fairness, it probably deserves an 8 but I hate to see such a good film saddled with a lower rating than it deserves just cuz' some people failed to see the brilliance in this flick.

Too bad none of the money, apparently, was spent on finding a screenwriter or actors. The plot is obvious and meandering at the same time, leading the viewer into a kind of bored lassitude. The device of the mirror was laughable. It's been done before, it's obvious and not well executed. The ""pact"" is also laughable, as is the performance of the pushy woman insisting on it. There is no character development of any kind. You get what you see on first appearance, annoying stereotypes on a loop. I'll even take issue with minor aspects, such as the makeup. Protip: slathering enough facial makeup on a woman to stop a bullet really detracts from any verisimilitude, not that there's any to begin with in this film. I give it a Z minus.

Acting is good, and the visual is good too, but the idea itself sucks. There are some jumps and some scary moments, but globally the script is predictable, and linear with no twist at all.

252,timaenot,Spoiled again by bad script - a pity,4,26 July 2018,"This is basically not a bad movie; it is interesting to watch, it keeps the tension, and there are some emotional scenes in it. But it suffers from major problems with logics and plot holes in a way which does not allow it to be a good movie. Shortly said, the script is so full of implausible turns, especially regarding the psychology of the characters, that the movie had no chance whatsoever to come out as a coherent and consistent story.Besides, I wonder how so many here call it a new and original story. The plot is as old as the world. A magical mirror is a motif best known from myths and fairytales. A family moving to a new home which soon becomes threatening in one or another way is an age-old story. The device of blending present and past, showing figures simultaneously as children and as grown-ups is nearly as old as the cinema itself. So what is new or original about this plot or this device?.. Neither the development oft he events nor the ending are surprising as well, they follow as expected under the given circumstances. And now to the script failures: in the first five minutes of the film, it is revealed to us that a young man has been released from a mental asylum where he has spent more than 10 years for murder. And here the problems start: This murder was out of self-defence - would a young boy ever be shut in a mental asylum for self-defence?? We are being told that he received psychological help, but his sister did not. How come that in modern days America a little girl who survived a family tragedy never received any psychological help?.. Now the story goes on with this same sister, taking her brother to the home of their parents almost immediately upon his release and confronting him with the evil mirror story. Would a loving and caring sister, which she is constantly shown like as child, upset his brother in such a brutal way just upon his release? Well, after all that has happened to them (you will see) she might not be the same loving and caring person any more. But the question still is: if you know from your own experience that the mirror is that evil , would you really risk staying tete-a-tete with it? Such problems spin further, on and on. 
It's a pity that today's script writers do not seem to care about credibility at all. It destroys many movies with good potential. Not to mention this film relies heavily on ""Shining"" but has nothing from Kubrick's masterpiece accurate, compelling plot and lead act genius.",Oculus

Instead, what you get is one or two fantastic jump scares, mind-boggling twists of reality that leave you wondering just what the heck is going on, and an ending that I won't reveal to you, but it's certainly not wrapped-up in anyway.

They usually now revolve around some big breasted girl being stalked or possessed. It's safe to say that by now a good horror movie is a rare find.This movie however was beyond good. It was truly amazing! The writing was beyond amazing. The storyline itself is enough to earn a golden globe! It is brilliantly put onto the screen whilst keeping the story complex and full of nail biting moments.Also this is not a horror movie that relies on cheap jump scares! This film does not have random scares. It builds up tension and instead of 104 minutes of being edgy in fear of jumping, it cleverly goes into your mind. Oculus is one of those rare films that after watching, keeps you up at night. It cleverly plays with your mind during the film and after. It is every psychiatrists nightmare! When a scare does come up it creates an atmosphere allowing that scare to stick in our minds.Also I HAVE to say a very well earned well done to the young actors in this film! The actors who played children in this feature were truly outstanding! The movie was frightening enough to watch let alone be a part off. Considering their age they handled the situations brilliantly and were, dare I say it, the best pair of actors I have ever seen!Also a hats off to the camera men for their skills. The cinematography in this film was superb! It really captured the feel of a scene. It made me as a member of the audience really feel as if I was in the film.There is literally nothing I can think off to improve the film. I think it is actually the best film I have ever seen!

This film captured the essence of this perfectly. There was not a lot of action, not much blood or violence, but just enough to scare the audience. Just when you think that you have the mirror figured out, something else comes around to make you think otherwise. It makes you wonder if the characters are just crazy, that none of the film is actually real. You will never know exactly what is going on.

Overall, it was a boring snooze-fest that should have been released straight to video. Thank God that I attended an advance free screening. So the movie is about a woman that goes on a mission to destroy a mirror that has a history of killing others by Supernatural forces. The premise sounds promising but that is where it ends. The movie gets off to a slow start with extensive monotony but ends up becoming more melodramatic with incessant tears. The acting: I must say that the acting was pretty good. My only complaint was the continuous crying that made me question if I am watching a horror or chick flick. The characters were well committed to their roles (especially the mother played by Katee Sackhoff). Other than that, the script was their downfall.I really thought that this was suppose to be a horror film. When one thinks of horror, you expect some scares, jumps, and overall frights. None of this came to pass for me. The movie used the same, played supernatural characters that we've all seen before without any element of surprise. Where's the ingenuity? Maybe I went into the movie with too high of expectations but I should have known that this plot has been used before (Mirrors 2008). Usually I could say more about a movie but there's not much to say but... why? Even one of the movie goers in my theater felt the same sentiment... he started snoring mid-way during the movie (yes others started yelling at him). Again, it seems like I'm the only one that didn't like this movie, but I highly recommend that you wait until it comes on DVD.",Oculus
263,jacob-pavelka-13,Biased by Brenton Thwaites,9,11 April 2020,"After seeing him in The Signal, I made it a personal mission to watch every film Brenton Thwaites starred in. Oculus was first on the list, as a horror movie I had been tangentially interested in but never watched. As soon as I discovered that the other main character was Karen Gillian (Amy Pond from Doctor Who), my interest shot up. Both of the main characters, and their child actor counterparts, are phenomenal in how they tell the story. The movie is admittedly slow starting, but ramps up quickly and has some really creepy scenes that push this movie into the realm of Great Horror Movies.",Oculus

265,kschwiz,I love horror movies and I thought this was rubbish.,2,28 May 2014,"1. The acting was very bad for starters. The girl was extremely over-the-top and the guy just another mediocre actor that probably got a shoe in to Hollywood because of his past modeling career or sheer good looks.2. Illogical. There was very little premise as to why either of these characters--with renewed lives at the start of the movie--would venture back into the creepy-mirror-infused lifestyles they had as children. Don't get me wrong they made a pact when they were 10 years old to return to this *event* (shall we call it), but again, there was no logic to actually following through with the promises as youths. I certainly wouldn't have.3. Disturbing (without any entertainment value). I love a well done horror movie with disturbances, but I found this movie attempting to be disturbing without actually keeping you on the edge of your seat. I was rarely--if ever--freaked out by any scenes as they weren't really frightening. But the core of the premise was dark, disturbing, and completely dumb. I kept expecting more but ultimately wanted this movie to be over as the ""more"" I was expecting only came when the credits rolled.Usually I am the guy to disagree with the single BAD review when a move on IMDb gets a 6.9 rating; in this instance I am that guy though and therefore thought it was worth writing a review as I think some people will find this movie pretty tasteless. I am shocked by the IMDb reviews as other movie sites are quite harsh on this one as well.",Oculus

As me it is must watchable by every horror movie fan.My reasons are....* It is a different story plot from traditional horror plots. * Very less background sound, many times none which leads us unpredicted next happening. * past story is disclosing step by step until the end of movie. * illusion of past and present makes a new type of horror. * use of modern equipments like cellphone, camera, laptop, temperature indicator etc feeling us real happening in current time period, not in older days as in many horror movies shown. * one can't know the suspense of the mirror over more than half movie passed. * seeing three covered statues in mirror by girl is really horrifying scene. * over head tool to destroy the mirror is also horrifying thing.So viewers must watch this movie.

267,fashionable_boy420,"Not the best horror movie out there, but certainly worth watching",6,12 April 2014,"The movie is somewhere between an average and above average horror movie. Some people may like it more than me, cause after all everybody has a different taste.The thing that i liked about 'Oculus' is that it is somewhat different than most horror movies. The movie needs your brain to work a little to understand the plot. The use of past and present at the same time has worked just fine. The movie is overall gripping and enough to give you some goosebumps. The movie is kind of a psychological horror not the one with ghosts running around.But the movie just lacked something for me. Fear factor for me was 4- 5/10, and i don't like to brag or anything but there was not a single moment in the movie where i felt like 'jumping out my seat'. For me a perfect horror movie is where you feel that you don't wanna see the next scene just because it might scare the hell out of you.So the bottom line is, one can give 'Oculus' a fair chance, and its one of those movies which people just love it or hate it. So give it a try and enjoy watching it.For me its 6/10 (just above average/watchable), may be different people with different perception and taste may or may not agree with my rating.",Oculus
268,andy441970,Below average,3,17 October 2015,"There are inevitable predictabilities in all films. However this one let me down because as soon as I saw the ""kill switch"", which is a very complicated device to assemble on your ceiling, and the girl must have had professional help installing it, as soon as I saw it while they tested it, I knew instantly that someone would die from it. Then I thought there was no reason for the device to be assembled so that it can kill a person simply passing in front of the mirror at the wrong time. The device could simply be adjusted to swing higher, simple safety precautions. This is so basic that the script fails badly, considering the kill-switch is the largest ""twist"" of the film.The sister had many years to prepare the experiment, in full knowledge that all sorts of crazy things and hallucinations take place when you are around the mirror. Still, she appears to fail (absurdly) in another two areas.Firstly she has invited her shaken brother to the experiment area which she has meticulously thought of and has setup, however she has not prepared him at all, he really has no idea what this is all about. So he is startled and spends most of the time on camera being completely useless or even contradictory. Might as well have stayed at home.In addition she makes no effort, except in just one scene, to ""stay together"". They both roam around the house as if on a picnic making no effort to protect themselves against the hallucinations which they had experienced before as children and should know by now or be prepared at least with an exit strategy. Which was kind of hinted in one scene, ""the influence stops at 30 yards"", well then dumb-ass stay farther than 30 yards. Doh! The girl has lost her mother and her father and has seen her brother institutionalised because of the mirror. She has researched dozens of victims through the years all dieing gruesome deaths and clearly suffering hallucinations. Yet she displays a cocky attitude walking around the house carelessly like a botanist observing his plants!The few scenes that we see of their parents are also absurd. Both behave illogically with ridiculous dialogues such as the ""woman in the office"", the ""voices"", their reactions to the dog's behaviour, the husband who appears to be from Mars... If you see a woman suddenly materialising in front of you I doubt you will simply brush it aside and go eat your corn flakes.The general idea of the malevolent mirror is sound and its exploitation could have been done so much better. The author has a free hand, like in Harry Potter, to create any situation he wishes. The mirror is magical and can create any situation imaginable. Those situations should have been engineered to lead the actors inexorably to their destruction but without having them acting absurdly.The whole story can be summarised ""magic mirror kills people around it"". That's about it.",Oculus
269,culmo,Good Except for the Ending,6,13 November 2018,"I thought the psychological aspect of this film was well-done. The characters never knew what was real and the audience had to keep guessing as well. The mirror really was a character itself and boy is it evil.
The cast did a good job, including Karen Gillan in her first American role.Spoilers:So the premise is that these two siblings who are now adults experienced a horrific series of events when they were growing up. Through flashbacks and dialogue, we learn that the boy shot and killed his father after his father shot and killed their mother. The boy spent his childhood institutionalized while the girl grew up in foster care. When the boy is released from care, the sister picks him up and promptly asks him to help her expose the truth--that their father and mother had become possessed by the evil in the mirror. The girl has set up the whole house to detect the paranormal, complete with a failsafe device that will (hopefully) destroy the mirror unless they are still alive to keep resetting it.The mirror almost immediately begins to mess with their minds, twisting them so far out of reality that the experiment ultimately ends in utter tragedy for both of them.I do wish the ending had been different, but I understand they were trying to establish that the mirror is too evil and too powerful, or that perhaps the siblings should have simply destroyed the mirror first without trying to prove anything. At any rate, the way the film ended felt a bit abrupt. Perhaps they planned on a sequel?",Oculus

273,DVDExotica,An Interesting Failure,5,6 June 2016,"I'll take an interesting failure over another by-the-numbers formulaic flick. Just too bad it wasn't a good movie.The film has some well crafted atmosphere, a fairly clever script, and it isn't afraid to get pretty dark. I put off seeing this for a long time because I thought it was just another glossy teenage popcorn flick, but it's not that. It even handles the ""let's spend the entire running time debating if there are really ghosts or if it's all in the person's mind"" better than almost all the others, save for a handful of the very best, like the original Turn Of the Screw or The Shining.But if you look at The Shining, you also see how painfully short this film falls. The script is mostly pretty intelligent, but gets dumb just enough to spoil things when all of the film's weight is leaning on how clever it is. But the real weak spot is the acting. Think how profoundly memorable Duvall and Nicholson were in the Shining, and then look at these dweeby CW types they cast in the leads of this film. You just can't care about these shallow characters for two hours. The woman who plays the mother is nailing it, but the father falls short and the two twenty-somethings are just awful. I mean, it's more that they're seriously miscast than bad actors, but they still manage to fail to deliver on their own terms, too.The characters' plan is pretty silly and the film goes to the ""tricked you! That last scene didn't happen; it was just a dream"" well a couple times too often. Plus it doesn't help that the film tips its hand very early about most of what's going to happen and how, so the audience is spending most of the time just waiting for the story to go through the motions trying to draw out suspense. Honestly, it feels like this was a short film script padded out to be a feature length movie, so you really feel its length.But I gave this movie five stars, not zero! It's not all bad. In fact, I could see how a movie studio would look through a glut of low budget horror and pick this one out to give a wide release to. It's better than most of the junk horror we get every year. Whether they're real or imagined, the ghosts have a cool look. The out-of-chronology story is effective (though the editing starts to get a little too cute in the final act); you can tell people really put in the effort to make a worthwhile movie here. It's played very straight and earnestly, and even the most jaded horror fan will have to admit it's got a really great kill in it.I was honestly expecting this film to be worse. Most viewers can definitely skip it, but if you're a serious horror fan, it's worth seeing. The mother's pretty awesome.",Oculus
274,Ufo476,There is a special place in hell.....,3,26 October 2016,"for people that make movies like thisIf you haven't watched this movie, please stay away, since I am going to include major Spoilers. Or keep reading if you don't want to waste your time as I did.This movie is a perfect example of how screwed up is our world, and provides an excellent insight to why it is so messed up. Why is that? Because people liked this movie, and this is the worst part! It means that a tremendous amount of people root for Evil against Good and secretly identify themselves with the former than the latter otherwise producers couldn't make movies like this and get away with it!In short, some (or a lot) of movie-making people seem too stupid to understand that, when we watch a movie with a supernatural threat, we want to see the good guys WIN and not the demon/entity or whatever. THAT'S THE MAIN reason we are watching the movie! (There are some notable exceptions- like when the main characters are unsympathetic and get what's coming to them, or when you already know the ending like in some ""found footage"" film, or when the villain is so enchanting and powerfully presented on his own etc- Nightmare on Elm Street had me sometimes rooting for Freddy, albeit not against the main characters!) None of the above however is the case here.Hence, when a movie shows the dark spirit to win, not only we are not happy about it, but it ruins the entire experience and just gets us angry! Its a form of sadism from the part of the producers and its repeated continuously as if these people use the movies to satisfy their own repressed feelings which they can't do anyway else. This happens so often in horror movies that not only is not original anymore, it simply becomes utterly boring! In other words, YOU HAVE NO REASON TO WATCH THE MOVIE IF YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO WIN, ESPECIALLY if that's the bad ""entity"" against the main heroes of the movie.Like I said, there are a lot of movies of this sort that you just don't give a damn. But its a lot worst when the movie is actually GOOD (in terms of script, acting, ideas, originality etch) and the protagonists are not only likable, but they are given so many reasons to need to win (like avenging their parents etch), that help you even more to identify with them! Although it was pretty obvious where the movie was heading, I kept watching until the end hoping it would surprise me somehow, but of course it didn't; it just verified how perverted the people who make this beloved genre (thriller- horror movies) are nowadays instead, which is part of the reason this type of movies has sinked so low in the recent yearsIn short, this movie should be a big hit in Hell, but not with an audience of ""normal"" people in our world! Someone must unscrew the head of the people responsible, but that is not going to happen until we massively protest against this type of ""endings"" and show that we are not going to take it anymore!As you understand of course, the above was not a regular review: it was mainly me expressing my frustration, hoping that more people will wake up until we can do something about it! (Other people suggested the mirror was just a metaphor-that's irrelevant, it still had a completely obnoxious ending!) So, 3/10 stars from me (it really deserved 4, but I want to lower its overall ranking), and should anyone reads this review before actually seeing the movie, please be warned!P.S: Notwithstanding all the above, the performances were great, especially from the children (Young Tim and Kaylie).",Oculus
275,mvinnaco,Lame,2,17 April 2014,"Oculus does not deserve the rating it has.I went to see it based on the reviews. I should have known better, as a real genre fan, but I have to admit I got suckered. A haunted mirror is a pretty weak premise, but I wanted to believe in Oculus. I love a reality-bending, atmospheric slow burn, but I was disappointed with Oculus.They could have had such a cool sci-fi/horror story if they had explored the time travel idea AT ALL, but as soon as they offered it they chickened out in favor of crap CGI ghosts. Oculus could have been the Inception or Looper for the horror set, but it bailed out on itself. What really crippled Oculus was that the story didn't seem to have a real plan for itself. It meandered through so many plot points it felt more like a brainstorming session than a finished story. It was mind- numbingly slow with no payoff in the end. The effects were god-awful. I could have made better-looking ghosts with some whiteface and a bruise pallet. Hell, cutting eyeholes in a sheet an throwing it over an actor's head would have been scarier. CGI had no place here. They could have done all of their effects cheaper and better with a trip to Party City. I'm going to give it two stars for the acting.

And you almost give them a skip, but somewhere you read some reviews, which say that it's one of the best Physiological horror movie or something of that sort, and well, life being ""short"" but still left with some unknown time, not knowing when you'll perish, you think you'll give it a go, and THEN kaboom, you are pleasantly surprised with how good the movie turns out to be. Oculus is one such gem, brilliantly conceptualized, splendidly picturised and with a very good musical score etc etc. (I am an amateur reviewer, so limited vocab). It was one of the very rare movies, which made my heart beat super fast, come to think of it, I don't remember any other movie which scared me. And it does it with panache, and a superb story.

281,DEATHSukka4,World Wrestling Entertainment produced a good movie?,7,15 November 2014,"THANKFULLY, WWE just simply invested money into it. Not one wrestler is in the cast, there's no mention of WWE, and there's only one very subtle nod to the wrestling company. WWE's involvement was the only reason I dismissed the movie for so long...With that out of the way, what we have left is an interesting spin on the old cursed inanimate object premise that is linked to mysterious and gruesome deaths. The film revolves around a mirror, the Lasser Glass.I've looked into it, there aren't many cursed or haunted mirrors in the world but there's at least one famous case at the Myrtles Plantation. A simple Google search of Myrtles Plantation Mirror, you'll get a plethora of obscured photos of the famed mirror. Apparently it holds the spirits of Sara Woodruff and her two children. Claw marks and hand prints are said to be seen, as if the children were trying to escape it. The plantation itself is considered one of the most haunted places in America.Anyway... back to Oculus.It's actually a revenge film. The object has already worked its magic on our main characters, Kaylie and Tim, siblings. They encountered the mirror as kids, when it hung in their father's office. It drove their parents to insanity, eventually causing Tim to shoot his father. Tim was sent to an institution where he spent the rest of his childhood and teenage years being counseled. Kaylie was sent to foster care, where she meticulously researched the mirror. This plot line unfolds simultaneously with the present plot line; Kaylie has set up an elaborate revenge scheme that will prove her brother's innocence, her parent's wrongful death, the mirror's supernatural power, and finally the destruction of the mirror. Will it work? Karen Gillan (Not Another Happy Ending, Doctor Who) brings a powerful performance to the film as adult Kaylie Russell. At first I was like ""That's not Jennifer Lawrence?!"", but it doesn't take long for Gillan to win you over with her character's intense confidence and focus. She perfectly narrates the mystique of the mirror throughout the first half. Many times it influences Kaylie and Tim, but its more wondrous than scary in the beginning, which is very Spielbergy.Brenton Thwaites (Maleficent, Home and away) plays adult Tim Russell. At first his role is more annoying, the character that dismisses obvious supernatural occurrences with logic and reasoning. Tim is a weaker character at first, saying very little and mostly he dismisses Kaylie's research and testing. We begin to see more of his true character as the mental walls he built from years of counseling start to break down, leading to a powerful performance by the end.Brilliant casting in this film! Even the kid versions of Kaylie and Tim were watchable. I typically hate horror films that put kids in prominent roles, but it was passable here due to their limited screen time.Mike Flanagan wraps production in under a month with only a $5 million budget. All I can say is, wow! Oculus offers very clever storytelling and strong performances from a good cast, leading to less expensive special effects to keep audiences hooked. Flanagan proves that simple and easy is still a cost effective method in a time of movie budgets up and over $100 million! Oculus comes from the same mold of Insidious (2010) and Paranormal Activity (2007); Blumhouse Productions. So its okay to watch a WWE film as long as Blumhouse is attached.The movie is a must see if you've enjoyed the Insidious and Paranormal franchises. It offers something different and is a solid movie with a used but still rich premise. I am looking forward to Oculus 2, and this time they've got my $20 movie ticket on opening night!",Oculus
282,karan-virgo92,Not just another typical Horror Movie!,8,8 June 2014,"In recent times, Horror genre has become quite predictable because of the over usage of same formula that has been working for so long. Either a horror movie ends up being a murder mystery which the protagonist has to solve to end the crisis he/she is facing in a house he/she recently bought. Or it is about a psycho killer hunting down partying teenagers. Or it is about a devil taking possession of a body and calling a lame ass priest to perform an exorcism. Or it is a bundle of quick hand held camera movements to provide chill and adrenaline rush rather than actual fear.Oculus is great in the sense it is so different and fresh. The movie is not your typical average horror flick. It is scary and so unpredictable that it keeps the audience engaged and guessing till the very end. The intermingling of past with the present in the movie is executed brilliantly and it gives the content of the film just the right amount of mystery and adrenaline that it keeps one intrigued and on his edge of the seat to see what is going to happen next.The tried and tested formula of a demon mirror in this movie is experimented and taken to an altogether different level by the director Mike Flanagan. What one sees is in this movie is not a typical haunting. It is a psychological war played out between the protagonists and the demon mirror. The conclusion of the movie might not satisfy every one, but I am sure no one will be arguing the logic of it.I am already hoping for a sequel to this horror flick.",Oculus

The reviews are way off as well. I don't quite understand it. The movie is being portrayed through reviews as coming in just under the bar set by 'The Conjuring,' but this movie is nothing more than a low-budget stinker. The acting is crap, the story is crap, the pace is really slow, etc. I have no idea where this film ought to rate in the ranks of low-budget horrors, because I don't watch them. It might be the best crap B-rate movie ever made, I wouldn't know and I don't care. All I know is that this movie is exactly the same to me as every other low-budget independent stinker. I recognize them in the first few seconds and then I shut them off, but for this one I didn't do that. I actually gave it a chance, and then I fast-forwarded to make sure it doesn't get any better. I saw scenes right out of Scooby Doo, Nightmare on Elm Street and Paranormal Activity. The story takes itself very seriously, and I get the impression the screenwriter and director wholeheartedly believed in this film. But it feels like the writer and director are teenagers in awe of something that can't make an adult raise an eyebrow. Don't believe a rating of over 5.0 for this stinker.

Ultimately 7 did the movie a disservice so I think that 8/10 is fair.The movie was thoroughly enjoyable and an engaging take on the classic idea of the haunted object. The acting, production and script in general deserve high praise.You'd be hard pressed to find a negative to claw at. The one thing that I would critique would be that it seemed all-too apparent that there was never going to be a happy ending. The mirrors powers seemed too much to overcome and you could argue that it was a matter of ""when"" not ""if"" it ended tragically. However, this is the genre we all know and love so it's not necessarily a deal breaker. The ending befits the film and ties up the things that precede it. It leaves potential for a sequel, and if they do decide to make one I would definitely be eager to see it, although it seems very clear based on the lore from the movie that there's no way to ""defeat"" the mirror.It goes without saying that if you're a fan of the horror genre you will enjoy this movie.",Oculus

""I'm going to prove so-and-so isn't a murderer and that it was a ghost or other paranormal entity"" or whatever has been done how many times? Whoever is calling this brilliant, refreshing, or original must be getting paid do so. There is nothing refreshing or original about a haunted house or object being brought into someone's home and starting to mess with their heads and turning them into murderers.This movie takes soooooo long to get going, if it even does that, and it is so boring. Every scene that seemed like something was about to happen, I was like ""sweet Jesus, this is finally about to take off"" but it didn't. And it never really does. It was hard to get into a scene (or the movie itself for that matter) because it constantly went back and forth between stories, cutting you off from anything you were starting to feel or expect. There's really no character development at all. Any characters you were supposed to feel bad for towards/at the end were made impossible because they all seem without feelings. The two couples in the movie, the mother and father and then Kaylie and her fiancé, Michael, seem like they're just existing together as opposed to being in love. Especially Kaylie and Michael. You see the guy, like, twice throughout the entire movie and when you do it's them having an awkward conversation and then giving each other a quick peck and a hurried ""love you, bye"" and that's it. They aren't convincing at all and you can't even tell any of them have any kind of relationship with each other.I'm giving this a three only because it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not good. I don't know why it's labeled a horror when it is far from that. I'd lean more towards suspense or maybe a thriller, but it's the usual ""somethings going to jump from around that corner"" or ""there's going to be someone standing there when they turn around"" which makes it predictable and unsurprising. I liked that they eyes of the dead were a shiny white rather than the usual all black, and Annalise Basso, who plays a young Kaylie, does a really good job, but that's it. Let some more people see it and rate it and I'm sure it'll drop below a seven. I was already surprised it was above that. Do not spend money to go see this, by any means. Maybe rent it if you're bored and just want to see what it's all about, but do not spend $10 at the theater on it. Side note: Karen Gillan totally sucks in this movie. She tries way too hard to be, I don't know, something. I don't even know what she's trying to do or be. I hated her immediately and wanted to punch her in the face the whole time.

It effectively depicts one certain character's descent into insanity. It's a little slow in the beginning, but even then builds a sense of mystery and psychological intensity - there's something strange about a certain antiquity item in the story, and the movie gradually gives us hint after hint of the strange occurrences surrounding this item. Later the activity in the movie becomes more horrific, though the movie doesn't over-rely on gore and violence. Leaves the door open for a sequel.

292,avibluestein,"Nicely done, well shot but somehow lacks the sting",6,15 June 2014,"This is a good movie overall which could have been 7.5-8 but it somehow lacks a 'sting'. The scenes are nice, the acting is good and definitely it does manage to mess with your mind as the director wanted - but somehow, this is one of those movies where you have great expectations but as it ends - you feel it missed its point big time. That's the point where you exit the cinema and say to yourself - ""This is a movie I could have watched on TV...."". I think one of the main reasons this movie fails to deliver a blow, is the fact that it lacks an explanation or reasoning for what is happening and why - and things just happen from the beginning to the end without good reason. Furthermore, the movie focuses on various events but overall - nothing really happens other than moving from scene to scene and that leaves you not with a taste for more, but rather a hunger that makes you feel lousy when it ends.

298,jpx400,Too brainy for its own good,5,25 March 2016,"A good horror movie can frighten us simply by going for the most basic survival instincts we have. A lunatic with a hatchet can make us check our door locks a few extra times. A killer shark can make us spend all summer on dry land. And for reasons I've never been able to fully relate to, ghosts and demons can also scare the hell out of movie watchers. Unfortunately, Oculus throws most of that conventional wisdom out the window and instead takes a more cerebral approach to horror that doesn't quite pay off.Eleven years ago, Tim and his older sister Kaylie witnessed the deaths of their parents under bizarre circumstances, with Tim being convicted of their murders and put in a mental institution. In the present, he is declared sane and released. In the meantime, Kaylie has acquired a mirror she believes is related to what happened to their parents and several other suspicious deaths over many years. With Tim's help, she intends to prove that the mirror has genuine paranormal properties and exonerate him. She returns the mirror to their old home, fitted with cameras and other safety measures to protect them, but the power of the mirror proves difficult to fight.In some ways, Oculus works great. Gillan and Thwaites play a sibling couple well and it's kind of enjoyable to see a horror movie protagonist take such a proactive, clinical stance to fighting a paranormal foe. One thing that works particularly well is the use of a non-linear story. The present-day story is interspersed with scenes of Tim and Kaylie's life when they and their parents moved into the house. As the film goes on, we jump between the time periods, culminating in the night that put Tim in a mental institution.However, for me, the film failed in the worst way a horror movie can fail: it simply wasn't scary. There are one or two scenes that are genuinely creepy, but they don't really amount to anything that leaves a lasting impression. The other scares are too badly delivered to work, either because the timing is way off or because anyone who has ever seen a horror movie can see them coming from a mile away. The jumping between time periods is well done and ambitiously thought out, but sadly it doesn't really deliver enough genuine frights to fit into a horror movie scenario.The fatal flaw of Oculus is that it spends so much of its runtime showcasing the nonlinear story that it fails to deliver any truly visceral scares. Simply put, it tries to scare you in the mind when it should be going for the gut.",Oculus

At least 'The Possession' attempted to explain that the 'box' was cursed by some kind of evil spirit.I like Katee Sackhoff, Karen Gillan will no doubt go very far in Hollywood and overall, this was a relatively decent idea.

300,olalara,A Great Decent Horror Movie That Has Been Rated R For Violence.,10,4 May 2014,"Oculus is a 2013 American supernatural drama horror film directed by Mike Flanagan. The movie had its world premiere on September 8, 2013, at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, and received a wide theatrical release on April 11, 2014. The film stars Karen Gillan as a young woman who is convinced that an antique mirror is responsible for the death and misfortune her family has suffered. The film is based upon an earlier short film by Flanagan, Oculus: Chapter 3 - The Man with the Plan.Oculus's Plot: The film takes place in two different times: the present and 11 years earlier. The two plot lines are told in parallel through flashbacks.Eleven years ago, computer developer Alan Russell moves into a new house with his wife Marie, 10-year-old son Tim, and 13-year-old daughter Kaylie. Alan purchases an antique mirror to decorate his office. The mirror induces hallucinations in both adults; Marie is haunted by visions of her own body putrefying and decaying while she is still alive, while Alan is seduced by a ghostly woman named Marisol, who has mirrors in place of eyes.Over time, the parents become detached and psychotic, with Alan isolating himself in his office and Marie becoming withdrawn and paranoid; during the same period, all of the plants in the house die and the family dog disappears after being locked in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie witnesses Alan interacting with Marisol and tells her mother, Marie becomes feral and, after a period of starving herself, attempts to murder the children. Alan overpowers her and chains her to their bedroom wall.Alan remains isolated in his office for an indeterminate period of time; when the family runs out of food, the children attempt to seek help from their neighbors, who disbelieve their stories. Attempting to contact doctors or the authorities, Kaylie discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man, who admonishes her to speak with her father.One night, Alan unchains Marie, and both parents attack the children. Marie briefly comes to her senses, only to be shot dead by Alan. Alan corners the children in his office, but also experiences a moment of lucidity, during which he forces Tim to shoot him to death. The police arrive and take Tim into custody; before the siblings are separated, they promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror.Eleven years later, Tim is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, having come to believe that there were no supernatural events involved in his parents' deaths. Kaylie, meanwhile, has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of the mirror, obsessively documenting the lives and deaths of everyone who's ever owned it. Using her position as an employee of an auction house, Kaylie obtains access to the mirror and has it transported to the family home, where she places it in a room filled with surveillance cameras in an attempt to document its powers; using a ""kill switch""—an anchor weighted to the ceiling and set to a timer—Kaylie intends to end the night with the mirror being destroyed, whether or not she herself survives.Tim joins Kaylie at the house and attempts to convince his sister that she's rationalized their parents' deaths as being caused by an external force, in order to avoid facing the truth. The siblings argue for the duration of the evening until they find that cameras in the room have inexplicably moved in their absence; reviewing the video, they realize that the mirror induced them to rearrange the contents of the room without their knowledge. Tim accepts that the mirror has some diabolical power and attempts to escape the house with Kaylie, only for the pair to be repeatedly drawn back by the mirror's influence. Trying to call the police for help, they are only able to reach the same voice who spoke to them on the phone as children. Kaylie kills her fiancé as she sees a ghostly figure with mirror as her eyes in place of him. The pair begin to hallucinate and experience visions of everyone killed by the mirror, who appear as ghostly figures with mirrors in place of their eyes.As Kaylie is drawn to the mirror by an image of her mother beckoning to her, Tim experiences a hallucination of being trapped alone in the room with the mirror. He activates the kill switch, causing the anchor to descend and fatally impale Kaylie.The police arrive and arrest a hysterical Tim, who insists that ""the mirror did it."" Tim is taken away in the back of a squad car as the ghosts of his parents and sister watch him from the house.I Recommend This Great Decent Horror Movie To All Audience.

305,samuellop10,Effective trip into psychological horror,7,12 April 2014,"21 year old Tim Russell is released from a mental institution.That same week his older sister is able to get a few days alone with the Lesser mirror. Kaylie, the sister, decides to take the mirror back to their old house, where unspeakable horrors unfolded during their childhood shortly after they moved to the back-then-new-house, and their father bought the infamous mirror. Kaylie is convinced the mirror is haunted: the mirror being some sort of evil supernatural being. Tim, on the other hand, has grown completely skeptic about the supernatural aspect of the mirror, believing his sister only holds on to that notion simply to have a way to cope with the horrific events of their childhood. Needless to say, the mirror does seem haunted, and as the night progresses for the adult siblings, the door to those memories open up, revealing more and more those events which both are trying to move on from; albeit in very different ways. These two timelines (their childhood and their present-day adult selves) unfold in a parallel manner, with the ending of the film culminating the two timelines' climaxes together. One of the things the film gets right is the acting. Both Karen Gillian and Brenton Thwaites do a very decent job in portraying the adult version of the siblings. Their children counterparts also do an impressive work in portraying two small, terrified brother and sister with no one to turn to for help, slowly accepting the fact that they are both alone against the mirror.The second good thing about it is the staging of the story. Although the concept is nothing new or original, the execution of such concept is both new and original. This injects a healthy dose of re-freshens and also a decent amount of unexpectedness to the film. Both helping in making this horror film one in which the audiences are actually engaged and interested in what will happen next, and at the same time they can have fun in the direction the story advances to. A neutral element in it is the way they decided to unfold both story-lines (past and present). Like mentioned above, both of them move forward hand-in-hand, with various parallels presenting themselves in the way of flashbacks from both siblings. While this works wonderfully in the first half of the film, the second half of it loses a good chunk of the excitement which this sort of narrative added to the first half. That is not to say however, that it hurts it, but by the ending it just feels it needed to continue this way to explain what had happened, rather than using it to strengthen the present events.More personally speaking, the ending felt rather frustrating and just almost unimaginative. While the final events fit into the pattern of what the mirror does, it feels like it should have had a more surprising ending due to the excellent build-up the film provides in the first two-thirds. The moment when the final twist happens, it is shocking, with everything falling into place seconds later, only to add more shock to what happens. However, moments later the feeling of shock is quickly replaced by one of been-there-done-that, leaving the audience feeling that there should have been more to it, rather than it being so simple and straight-forward. If you are expecting an explanation for what the mirror really is, what entity it holds, or how it came to be, you will be disappointed. If you are rather more interested in the how (instead of the why's or what's of the mirror) you will feel more satisfied. The focus of the film is in tricking its characters, and along with them the audience as well. The story is very effective in messing with one's psyche, making one actually wonder what is actually happening to the characters, and what is fake and just a product of the mirror. Overall, adjust your expectations into knowing that this film is good, but it does not redefine the genre in the slightest. It does feel refreshing, but other than in its execution, there is nothing new to see here. The movie is fun and unexpected (something very few recent horror movies can say), so with everything else, it is definitely an enjoyable ride as a whole.",Oculus
306,milosz-skow,"A masterpiece in writing, let down by simple mistakes",7,31 March 2016,"I enjoyed Oculus very much. I am aware of all the criticism it received and I must say a lot of it is deserved. However, I would recommend this movie to any horror fan for one simple reason - it's intriguing, and that's not something much of the modern horror movies can boast about. Plus it's got some solid acting and unexpected plot twists, so there's that. But first, let's dissect it and see what's inside.The movie tells a tale of a family whose fate was derailed the moment they decided to ""adopt"" a less-than-friendly member of the family: namely, an old mirror. Their usual, idyllic existence turns horribly wrong, and so the daughter and (to less of a degree) the son decide to end the nightmare that was haunting their family by exposing the cursed mirror's machinations, and ending its killing spree. Little do they know, the mirror has more tricks up its sleeve than they had bargained for.Just quickly, on the positive side, the actors, even the children, did a solid job. Really, you can't fault them in one way, even if Brenton Thwaites seems like he just got out of the winter hibernation not knowing what to do. I mean, he IS a mental case without any adjustment period, so I guess he'd be a little tense.Another BIG positive is the story. I mean, WOW! At some point you'll ask yourself whether the thing you're watching now is really there on the screen, or whether it's just something the mirror would show you in your weakest moment. Am I right, John? Is that correct, Sophia? Look behind you. Now. And if your name is not John nor Sophia, than sorry for failing at my attempt to scare you :PDirecting and camera work is spot on, couldn't ask for more. Half of the time you just sit there and wait for something to finally MOVE just so it relieves the tension of the scene. I mean, DAMN, that third cover sheet-figure-thing.Now for the bad... and there's a good couple of things wrong with this film... sadly.*Kinda minor spoilers, but not really*First up, the zombie-face-folk. You know what I mean by that - those guys that just pop out of no where for the sheer spookiness effect. They serve no purpose in the story and they're just there to jump- scare you, but the problem is they are not even THAT scary. AND they look out of place most of the time. If I was the director, I'd just cut them out completely. There's no real reason for them to be there. Focusing on the tragedy that befell this family would have so much more impact if they replaced the ""spooky"" devil-lady with... hmmm... the mom maybe? The devil-zombie-folk are a miss in my book.Another tragedy that befell this film rather than the family is the sound. Beginning with the soundtrack which sounds like some bad remix of Skrillex's new album (womp, womp, womp, wa, wa, wa, womp, womp, etc.), all the way down to the sound design which is SO hit and miss it's more miss than hit. Like the ""spoopy"" whispers from the mirror. Out of place, not scary at all. To be honest, they'd have gotten more of an effect out of the film by NOT using any sfx in some scenes. Less is more I say, less is more.But, again, I have to commend the brilliant story and dialogue, which felt natural, had me hugging myself in some places and in others had me flipping the table and going ""WTF!?"" It was that good. Really good. Almost undeservedly good. And all that backed up by solid directing and cinematography, which accented all the right corners, and omitted all the right corners as well. Solid, spooky horror filmmaking right there, no doubt.And that is why I give this movie a 7/10. With added solid sound work, which is so important in horror movies, I'd rate this an 8 or even a 9, but as it is, it only stands as a testament for all the writing, acting and directing talent ready to be exploited for the good of the horror genre in some other movie. BUT, thankfully, the movie is still a watchable Friday night flick, and so you should watch it. I'm talking to you, John. And to you, Sophia. Get right on it.So, if you watch it without expectations you'll be more than pleasantly surprised. Just ignore the demon-folk - they be useless. And on that note, I'll leave you with one more piece of advice: You're going to have your father call. The doctor will be there tomorrow.",Oculus

Or madness that often runs in families. While the occult theme would make for a very ordinary Dr.Who episode, Karen Gillan (or more famously known as the doctor's companion Amy Pond) gives the film an anchor from which we can relate to.

315,janerin-50685,Suprisingly Good,6,24 July 2018,"I was suprised at how trippy the film got during the second and third act. I will say the first 30 minutes didnt impress me too much, and I considered turning it off, but once inside their childhood home, things got rolling for our two main characters and I was interested. For the movie as a whole, Id give it a 7/10. Its not perfect, and I may or may not watch it again, but I enjoyed it, and the more I think about it, the more I appreciate it. The ending is grim and the parallels made to the past throughout the film are a nice touch. The way the two stories within the movie (the present and the past) intertwine and interfere with one another is confusing to both the audience and the main characters, which adds to the atmosphere immensely.Its almost as if the characters are high; they lose track of where they are, whats happening, have hallucinations, and time slows down. Its a brilliant touch and I would recommend checking this one out.",Oculus
316,awit72,meh,3,23 July 2019,"I was really disappointed in this movie as a horror movie fan. It started out pretty punchy, scary, and sweet, and then it got irritating quickly. The twin sister's super long exposition on the mirror made me realise I was headed for a snooze fest. I honestly found this movie more frustrating than fun or scary and gave up. I don't feel like the makers of this movie really believed their own premise about a haunted mirror. I think this movie had more style than substance. A miss for me.",Oculus

(similar to the Babadook but not as good)Acting and effects are good with a reasonable ending.

320,josephmarkdavis,I wanted to like this...,3,6 July 2014,I'll be brief. This is just not a great film or even a good guilty pleasure. If I wasn't watching it on a plane right now I'd walk out. Tired clichés... not very scary... poor written... poorly directed some really B level acting especially from the adults in this film. The only thing that was really well done here were the trailers that tricked me into thinking that this would be fun to watch. If you plan to see it stop here as I mention a spoiler... This was so poorly done that I laughed at the tragic ending of the film.If you want a good scare go watch The Exorcist or The Omen... again. This entire performance and production felt like it was all phoned in for some quick $ from the lucrative horror market.,Oculus
321,oneill-charlene55,Not a horror,5,28 July 2016,"I find that the trailer is more promising and thrilling than the movie itself. It is not scary enough and I don't think it should be classified under the genre 'horror'. I enjoyed the flash-backs that builds the story line, but I think that the characters, especially the adult versions did not have strong enough personalities in comparison to their 'younger self' characters. If the movie had more of a psychological twist (which at times was present) without any supernatural phenomenon, it could have been more interesting. The supernatural did not have a strong enough force and thus there is a lack on both sides. Either scary ghosts and stuff or a psychological thriller. However, it is not a bad movie and I think young teens can watch it because it is not scary nor has inappropriate content.",Oculus
322,Avatarman614,A thought provoking Horror-Thriller in my Top Ten of 2014,9,19 August 2014,"This movie, is excellent. It grabbed me from the first frame and took me on a ride that was disturbing and heart breaking. But I shall revisit this film. Director/Writer Mike Flanagan has constructed a new and original (at least to my knowledge) psychological horror thriller that is sure to please ""gore-hounds"" as well as people who love character studies. The film is constantly asking you to question what reality is? Is the mirror evil? Or are the characters so psychologically scarred by their past that that is the only logical answer they can think of? If you look past the obligatory jump scares Oculus is an amazing achievement in horror film-making, a character study bathed in blood. The performances by Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites as brother and sister Kaylie and Tim are mesmerizing and draw you into the story from the offset and the two younger actors who played their child counterparts were just as excellent. If there is anything I can say about Oculus, it is a clever film. Of course there is a bit of predictability but there isn't so much to over shadow that the film knows how to get into your head.Final Verdict 9/10I am sure that when I revisit this film and peel back the layers of it's amazing story and performances, that I may re-rate the film 10/10. Oculus is this year's Evil Dead (2013) for me, an unexpected favorite, that will surely be in my list of top 10 films for 2014.",Oculus

While watching I kept imagining a room full of student writers passionately conceiving what they thought was a clever, artistic, highly intelligent and complex tale of the supernatural. The problem is that none of what was conceived in that room translates effectively on film, and the constant flip-flopping from past to present, an ambitious gimmick to help tell the story, doesn't help matters. I didn't buy any of it for a minute. However if you're a fan of cheesy Disney-esque cheapies like 'Insidious' and 'The Conjuring' that feature rehashed ideas from better movies 'spine-tingling' evil spirits, and families in peril, you might enjoy this dud.",Oculus
324,shoy_Miss_Murder,Too Many Inconsistencies And Goofs To Be Enjoyable,2,24 August 2015,"Number one: An Oculus is a round opening, or eye. It is NOT a mirror of any kind. Number two: Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff are two good actors that had criminally small parts as the doomed parents of our two main characters, Kaylie and Tim. Listing all the problems would take too long but hey, if the mirror has power by looking into it, and not when it was covered, then why the heck didn't they just smash it while it was covered? It made it too hard to enjoy the film - plus the fact that the sister was so obsessed with revenge she didn't seem to care a whit about her poor brother who had only one day out in the open before he was sent right back where he started - probably for good. About the only part I liked (even it it was somewhat confusing) was the meshing of both past and present together to tell the story.",Oculus
325,brijester,A pretty good moviebut the climax was a big let-down!,7,24 April 2014,"I'm not a huge fan of horror movies. But ever since I saw ""The Conjuring"" I try to see any new horror movie that gets released. And I saw this movie only after seeing the rating on IMDb. And since it had a decent rating, though I would take the risk! Some horror-fans may not find the movie scary enough, but believe me it is. Maybe not THE most scariest movie enough but scary enough to pass as a horror movie. And the proof of that would be that , a LOT of people in the audience were screaming during some scenes! No doubt, the movie is quite good. All the actors have done a good job. And so has the director. But my complaint is with the story. The movie is about a mirror that is haunted. May not be a new concept but still enough to get audience interested. As the movie progressed I was eagerly waiting for the background/origin of the mirror but sadly we (I mean the viewers) NEVER get to know the secret of the mirror or how it came to be. Generally, in any horror movie, there would be at least one ""main"" evil spirit/ghost, that is the reason behind all the trouble and killings. But here, there was nothing like that. We do see people possessed and a few ghosts but those ghosts are the victims of the mirror. There is no specific ""ghost of the mirror"" as such. That I felt was bit disappointing. SPOILER ALERT - BEGIN And the MOST disappointing part for me was the climax. The story was very engrossing, lot of twists. And I was keenly waiting till the end to find the secret of the mirror and hoping that the protagonists would destroy the mirror. But sadly, nothing like that happened. The secret of the mirror, remained a secret, that is one thing. Another thing was that the climax was a big tragedy. Generally , when I watch a horror movie, I'll expect at least some kind of a happy ending; like an evil spirit being defeated or something like that. But here, like many other horror movies, it was like the evil continues unabated and innocent people keep dying. Maybe that's the way horror movies work. Anyway, the way the climax is, there's definitely room for sequel. SPOILER ALERT - END The best part about the movie was how the past and present events are shown. During the movie progression, the past events are displayed in between the present events and at the climax, they overlap. And it was shown brilliantly. Kudos to the director for that. I haven't seen anything like this in any other movie. The movie is very gripping, entertaining and suspenseful. As the story moves on, you as a viewer get deeply involved and can almost feel the plight of the children trapped in the house, when their father doesn't allow them to go out and their mother is possessed. The way the mirror manipulates things around it is shown very well. It kind of affects the reality at a certain distance around it so that people don't realize what is the truth and what is not. In the end, I'll just say that ""Oculus"" is definitely a must watch movie but be prepared to get disappointed at the end. I was.",Oculus

A woman who is convinced that a mirror is haunted and a man who is convinced she is delusional attempt to prove to one another what really happened during the traumatic events of their childhood.

327,bloodyhigh,Oculus is a well-executed and underrated horror gem.,8,2 October 2018,"TL;DR:
Oculus is a well-executed and underrated horror gem. Presented as a story that unapologetically hops between present and past, it features strong acting performances and beautiful cinematography. Highly recommended for fans of mind-bending supernatural horror.The LONG version:
Sometimes being a fan of horror can be difficult. For every The Shining or The Exorcist, there are countless dozens of terrible horror movies that should've never been greenlit. It can be tough to navigate through the rubbish. That's why I get really excited when I come across a gem -- an under-the-radar horror movie with quality acting, beautiful cinematography, and an engaging story.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for an over-the-top gore-filled schlockfest. Toxic Avenger, anyone? But it's nice to see when a noticeable amount of effort was put into creating a quality film that exceeds the notion of what a horror movie is expected to be. Oculus is one of those films.Before I dive in, I need to disclose one small detail. I enjoy watching movies (especially horror) while high. Apologies in advance to anyone out there who that may offend. That said, I started the evening off by selecting some King Louis OG from my stash. King Louis is an indica strain that's a cross between OG Kush and LA Confidential. These particular buds were from Chong's Choice -- Tommy Chong's personal line of cannabis. If Tommy is comfortable putting his name on this strain, that's as good of an endorsement as I need. Also, weed, so... yes, please!Nugs are a nice deep green dusted with shiny trichomes. The aroma is delicious and gives off a thick dank smell of an enchanted forest. Grinding the weed only enhanced the aroma making it even more potent. The flavor is what you'd expect from an OG strain - earthy with notes of hops, and pine. Also picked up a bit of sweetness. Maybe like a lemon peel or something citrus.The movie sets the stage with two young children played by Annalise Basso (Kaylie) and Garret Ryan (Tim) trying to escape from inside a house. As they attempt their escape a man holding a gun enters. The gunman approaches the kids and his face is shown just as he fires a shot. The gunman from the dream wakes up from his nightmare. It's revealed that he is the grown up version of Tim, the boy from the dream, now played by Brenton Thwaites. Tim is in a mental hospital and this dream was the ""breakthrough"" doctor's were hoping for to recommend release. Right away, Oculus establishes that it will be presented with a series of flashbacks. The movie frequently and unapologetically jumps back and forth between present day and their childhood. This storytelling technique may cause confusion and frustration, but knowing that detail going into the movie will surely help.This opening scene is only about 5 minutes long, but that's all the time it took for Chong's King Louis OG to take control of my consciousness. It started with a tingling feeling of pressure around my eyes and forehead. Then my jaw slacked open transforming me into stoned-out mouth breather. I was all but locked into place ready to soak in all this movie had to offer. The good thing about this particular strain is that it didn't prevent me from staying focused. I felt good. Really good.Meanwhile, Tim's sister Kaylie, now played by Karen Gillan (Guardians of the Galaxy), is obsessed with an item up for sale at auction called the ""Lasser Glass"" -- a mirror, we find out a bit later, with supernatural powers. During a conversation between Tim and Kaylie over lunch we discover that the cursed mirror is what possessed the sibling's parents when they were children and pushed their dad to murder their mom then commit suicide. Murders that, during his time in the mental hospital, Tim has been convinced he committed. This is when Kaylie confesses her plan to him -- capture video evidence that the mirror is cursed, then destroy it so it can no longer inflict death and destruction on others.That is essentially the plot of Oculus. Simple, right? Don't let the simple premise deter you. What makes Oculus so exceptional, in my opinion, is how the subject matter, cinematography and direction are treated with respect. There are some standard horror movie fallbacks and a jump scare or two, but for the most part the horror set pieces are clever and the pacing keeps you engaged. The time-shifting element is effective in creating micro ""cliffhangers"" as they jump between present and past. Things becomes especially mind-bending during the final act when both timelines begin overlapping as historical similarities start putting the puzzle pieces into place.I absolutely loved this movie from the opening frame until the very last. The movie is smart and doesn't hold you hand throughout. It forces you to stay alert. Not only can I recommend watching this movie high, but I can confidently recommend watching it sober as well.",Oculus

329,cinema_horror,Great Horror with Heart,9,29 January 2020,I'm a huge Mike Flanagan fan. This was the first movie I saw of his. The thing I like about his movies and shows is that he brings captivating characters with heart into the horror movie genre. This movie definitely gave us a good glimpse into what he could do. All the actor do a great job! The story is very refreshing. I hope to see more horror movies like this and will continue to watch out for what Mike Flanagan has next.,Oculus

They are all either involved with the project or are being paid to write positive reviews.Seeing it was produced by WWE Studios during the opening credits was the first red flag.It was so horribly written and acted! It was all just tropes, stock characters and stereotypes. It's a cookie cutter horror film and the recipe grew old in the 70s. You could always tell where the story was going, then you roll your eyes when it happens. Despite the claims of other (paid) users, there aren't any twists or surprises. I am insulted that people would straight up LIE about this movie just to get the word out, but that's corporate America foe you.",Oculus
332,AlwaysVanilla,Riveting psychological film,7,21 April 2014,"I give this film a 7/10 for many different reasons.First of all, this isn't your typical horror film. It isn't filled with blood and gore, and there isn't sex and nudity. Instead, it's a psychological thriller that has your mind racing, which I enjoy. I've watched horror movies religiously for almost the past decade now, and have to say this is one that really intrigued me.The story is about 2 siblings, Kaylie and Tim, who went through trauma as children, the daughter Kaylie believing the mirror was the cause for the tragedy that occurred in the home (the father shot dead and it is apparently caused by the son, and the mother is also murdered). Kaylie and Tim made a promise back then that one day, they would reunite and kill the mirror. Kaylie has a full blown plan of how to stop this mirror...and the effects are devastating.I've been watching horror movies for so long now that the blood and gore is boring to me. It's been a long time since movies like Saw really got my attention, but this movie did. It starts slow and isn't a fast-paced movie, which is one of the reasons I didn't give it a higher rating, and also the ending wasn't one I enjoyed although it was extremely disturbing (but also predictable). The flashbacks from their childhood to the current were brilliant and extremely well edited. You have to pay attention, though, especially near the end as the flashbacks become closer together and merge more with the reality, causing confusion. The child actors also did an outstanding job.Overall, this movie kept me at the edge of my seat (most of the time) and was psychologically thrilling. It wasn't a movie that chilled my bones or disturbed me greatly like some people might expect from a horror movie, but it was entertaining and surprising and a breath of fresh air to the horror movie industry, and I was pleased with it.",Oculus
333,spiderwing,Creepy and atmospheric,8,14 December 2014,"I watched this film to see what Karen Gillan got up to after Doctor Who, and I have to admit I was very impressed by her performance. By all of the performances, actually, though there is a very small cast.As others have said, this movie was not too graphic, but there were some situations so cringe worthy I couldn't watch them anyway. One scene in particular which involved an apple, I just had to turn away from. As far as formula, my daughter and I took bets on the ending about a third of the way through. I pretty much called it, but wasn't completely sure until the last five minutes. Not too formulaic, not too out of left field, no clear explanation given but a lot implied. I enjoyed this one a lot, but hope that there isn't a sequel, it's very good where it ended.",Oculus
334,ferreiragon,A new kind of eerie mysterious horror films with multiple readings,9,29 June 2014,"I made my way ""oculus"" and ""absentia"", from the same director, the same day. Though they are clearly different, both films share many issues regarding the cinematographic style.I find very interesting the scripts and the atmosphere of Flanagan's movies. They are mostly psychological atmospheric thrillers following things that do not have a clear answer in the end. Those of you who like gore or horror mostly based on visual effects and action might not like his work. However, pay attention to the development of the stories and how they are getting more and more intense as the film develops.I love that Flanagan usually plays (inteniollay or not), with contemporary physics issues that are quite controversial (time travels, parallel universes, chord theory, mater and antimatter). At the same time those issues are developed in a normal neighborhood, house, objects. Added to all these, there is drama and tension as well. To myself a plus on these movies is that they also keep you thinking in many philosophical issues and that the reading of them is almost infinite. It is like listening to a good record in which you will always find something different. With these movies, any time they are ""replayed"" in our heads, you always get different explanations and results, travelling in a universe with twisted logic causes and effects.This movie, along with ""Absentia"" by the same director, share all these issues. Highly recommended if you like David Lynch. Peter Weir first Australian era movies or Adrian Lyne's ""Jacobs ladder"".In summary, a very smart director and writer that likes to play with mysterious things that can be find in ordinary life, making the audience extremely confused regarding what to believe, what not to believe and what did it really happened or how can you explain the movie.",Oculus
335,LegionAvalon,Slow burning suspense,5,6 November 2015,"Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Katee Sackhoff. Slow starter, Gillan (Dr Who, Guardians of the Galaxy), makes a pretty good stab at a mid-American accent, I did keep expecting a blue box to turn-up however. Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica) is underused. Nice vehicle for, to me, the less well-known Thwaites. Spooky mirror movies go way back to silent film but after an hour I found I really wanted to watch to the end. Liked the use of sound but having said that there are some spoken parts I found difficult to hear. Nicely suspenseful but nothing that special. 5/10",Oculus
336,getchethanbr,An exiting psychological movie after a long time!!,10,29 April 2014,"I haven't reviewed any films here (except for some TV series), but for this movie i had to.This is an excellent work from the director Mike Flanagan in a horror genre. Well written story, even though at first it may feel old concept, just after 10 min after the start you will be completely inside the story. More than the spine chilling moments there are a lot of psychological elements that will bring goose bumps. Another highlight is the wonderful acting though camera work should have been better. Karen Gillan looks cute throughout and Brenton Thwaites leaves an impression.I loved this movie, don't go with negative reviews. Go watch it, worth every penny.

337,electronicsspa,"Plodding, boring, and about as scary as Tupperware.",2,22 June 2014,"Let's say Insidious and Sinister bumped uglies, then nine months later this film was born. Only it was born with its umbilical cord wrapped around its neck, and its brain was deprived of oxygen for a good ten minutes, but somehow the doctor and nursing staff revived it. You have the wandering spirits with shiny eyes, the jump scares, the lack of any real character development or plot, the unstoppable object of doom that can control everybody who comes within pissing distance of it... And so on. Karen Gillan gives a terrific performance, dropping her Scottish lilt for a damn good American accent, but she's only a spark from a lighter that ran out of fuel a long time ago. This movie isn't understated, it's pointless. It's a slasher film without a slasher. Above all, it's a waste of ninety minutes I could have spent staring at the wall. In summation: This movie's so bad it needs its own drinking game. Every time a female gets choked out, take a drink. Every time the little boy sheds crocodile tears, take two drinks. Every time Katee Sackhoff's false teeth almost fall out, take three drinks. Every time you're bored... never mind, you'd never put your drink down.",Oculus

The trailer was fascinating with a mirror that supposedly had a 400 year history of bizarre deaths of it's owners.The good things first. The effects were really scary. Also, I found the acting top notch and very believable by both the adults and the children. This is what carries the movie.However, most of the movie takes place in the same house in two time periods. One is now when the two siblings have grown up, the other when the parents were killed. The fact that the plot involves few other people than the the two siblings and the parents give it a budget like feeling. Also, there are several logical inconsistencies, which I wont't go into the details of, as it would introduce spoilers. Suffice it to say that there were several places where I would spontaneously say: ""why don't you ... instead"". These things make the movie lacking in depth and believability.",Oculus
339,josh-halse,Original Psychological Horror That Left Me Wondering,8,14 June 2014,"After having watched the trailer for Oculus I felt like I had to see this film. I went to view it on the opening night and left with my expectations exceeded. Mike Flanagan has done an excellent job leaving me guessing what was real and what wasn't. This film plays on people's psychology which is not present in many modern day films. The scares were well earned and put at the right places. This film does not contain cheap scares as you would see in Paranormal Activity or Insidious, or tons of violence gore used to keep an audience. Both the brother and sister in adult years played by Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites have dealt with their family trauma in different ways. Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) believes that the death of her mother and father was caused by a supernatural phenomenon whereas Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) believes that there was no supernatural occurrences at all. I got the impression that Kaylie was trying to blame the accident on the supernatural rather than accepting the fact that her father was sick a twisted murderer. Tim had got psychological help in prison therefore comes to terms that his father was in fact a bad person. Upon staring into the mirror together memories of the past come flooding back to them both. The events of the parents murder almost feel as if they are happening again as the house brings back the eerie, uneasy feelings at the time. Kaylie is constantly telling Tim to remember actions of the past until he is convinced enough that the event was caused by the supernatural. The atmosphere was dark and disturbing throughout and I think the editing and CGI lacked a bit due to the majority of the film being filmed in the dark to keep this eerie atmosphere.I hadn't watched any of Mike Flanagan's films prior to this but after watching Oculus I would like to see a lot more from this director. There wasn't many negatives to this film but I felt disappointed that the ending was predictable and the film wasn't as scary as I would have hoped. Yes, there were many disturbing scenes but despite having the well placed jump scares they weren't as scary as I would have hoped. The acting in this film was phenomenal. Performances were done exceptional all round especially Annalise Basso as young Kaylie and Garrett Ryan as young Tim who mirrored the roles of Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites. Overall this psychological horror got me thinking for hours after watching. There is potential for a sequel to this film although it is not entirely necessary. Rating 8/10",Oculus

It is actually very fresh concept in the horror genre and I like the movie for that.Actors were new but have done a great job.Sister and Brother bond was actually very good and emotional.I know this ain't getting any Oscar awards but its definitely worth a watch.The whole idea of story and progressing it was actually also great.Horror movies are mostly a let down most of the time but this time its different.Overall the main star of the movie for taking crown is Karen Gillan,not only she is beautiful she also has acted well.",Oculus
343,birchonator,May have been overly ambitious,7,20 April 2014,"Generally in the horror genre, especially when intertwined with ambiguity at the core, stylistic approaches to story are nearly without boundary. Here, some should have been made.First, I'd like to state how impressed I was by the film's ambition. The general idea behind a haunted object in a home is not necessarily original--but the psychological tricks potentially played upon the viewer make for something, at the very least, entertaining.At 24, and a Film Studies minor, I have yet to see a film in ten years that has scared me. This is no exception. But, where it does succeed in its trade is through its mystery--mystery which is, very often, the underlying (and often underused) backbone to most horror films. This, along with a surprisingly decent performance by the children, are reasons why I didn't rate Oculus lower than 7.What separates Oculus from an 8/10 for me is that it takes is strength--the mystery and psychological angle--and over uses it until the ambiguous cuts begin to become a natural entity in the film; which would be acceptable if this were simply a drama. But by the end there had been so many 'what the hell' moments that I found myself drained by the film and apathetic toward the state of the characters.The ending (no spoilers, simply a comment). You find many parallels between the film's beginning (chronologically speaking) and the film's end which provides a cinematic sort of poetry. Having said that, let's face it, many of us walk away from a horror flick thinking ""it would've been better if this happened"" and I'd be lying if I said that I hadn't done that with Oculus.",Oculus
344,thomasheinrich,So Underrated,10,3 July 2020,"Rarely do you find a horror movie with a relatively creative idea, well executed acting and writing that isn't painfully forced. This movie is excellent at creating genuine tension, and you really feel like you're there with the characters. Although above 6/10 isn't bad for horror movies for some reason, I was shocked this wasn't at least an 8. This horror movie is tense, unique and most importantly ANYTHING but forgettable ... it'll stick with you, and that's honestly the mark for a great horror. In today's age, this is a true gem!!",Oculus
345,m-haan11,Disappointment,6,25 April 2014,"This movie is being marketed as a horror-movie. But the film never gets scary. It has some tense moments and therefore is a thriller. Not a very good one at that. As a viewer you are guided through the events as they work towards the climax. You are waiting for things to actually get going, but they never do. Just scene after scene of stuff being explained by the girl and then talked over with her brother. In the end we some creepy characters emerging from the mirror. But who is that woman? Why is the mirror the way it is? It is never explained. Also the ending is not very original and you can see that coming from miles away. A really disappointing movie that never gets scary or give you the chills.",Oculus
346,CrookedStairs,A Crooked Stairs Review (Oculus),9,1 February 2018,"Director: Mike FlanaganThis movie originally made itself known to me with quite a few strong reviews online and a bit of a buzz surrounding its relatively new to the genre director, Mike Flanagan. With such an unknown new title causing such a stir, I was very eager to see for myself if Oculus would deliver.BASIC PLOT: A sister is reunited with her brother after many years apart due to a dark family past. Obsessed with the notion that an old antique mirror hiding supernatural forces is to blame for the family's bloodstained history, she sets about trying to prove the mirror is indeed cursed and finally destroy it. But she will need some help...REVIEW: Straight off the bat, I found this movie an absolute joy to watch. The cinematography and camerawork are excellent, submerging most of the scenes in a dark, sepia-green, almost Fincher-esque finish that churns the viewers stomach throughout. Right from the get go, you can feel something is not quite right through the visuals and shadowy lighting. This feeling is intensified as the story progresses, expertly preying upon the viewers sense of unease as things unfold.The story is a classic. Not too many horror titles come to mind when I think of old mirrors, which is surprising as there can be something uniquely unnerving and almost other worldly about a reflection, especially in this mirror. The character development between the family is brilliantly played out, with a narrative taking place both in the past when the sister & brother were just kids and in modern day after so such has happened. This way the audience catches a glimpse into the creepy occurrences that transpired all those years ago in the family home while also following the siblings in present day and the choices they are now faced with.The acting is really first rate all round, Karen Gillan & Brenton Thwaites do a stirling job as the siblings (even if the latter does seem a tad on the bland emotionless side at times, but I think that is also half down to the character himself after he has been through so much to the point where he is now numb). Katie Sackoff delivers a phenomenal performance as the mother, her slow descent as she deals with her situation is palpable and adds weight and reality to the tale. Rory Cochrane also deserves top credit for his role as the Dad of the family, sucking the audience in for the ride as his family, his life and even his mind start to unravel around him.I also feel I need to strongly compliment director Mike Flanagan for delivering a fresh new and exciting approach to the horror genre. He has managed to perfectly balance a strong gripping story with constant scares and thrills to cater for all. The movie feels like a big step forward, nodding to the moody atmospheric horror titles of old while also acknowledging it's place in the twenty first century. The storyline even goes as far as including numerous modern high tech technologies and gadgets and yet it never once crosses the line into cheesy or unrealistic. I am looking forward to more gems from this flourishing new director.VERDICT: A fantastic find. A well thought out and portrayed horror tale containing enough tense armchair gripping moments and downright nasty scares to make you pause before you next glance in the mirror! (9/10)",Oculus

348,Meow127,Just Lame...,2,28 June 2014,"I was excited to see this movie, but I was extremely disappointed! The acting was horrible and the storyline was tired and predictable. The female lead (adult Kaylie) was annoying and looked like she was rehearsing lines in her head whenever the camera was on her. I knew what was going to happen about 5 minutes into the movie. The movie started off incredibly slow and built up to a nice level of bland mediocrity. There was also no inclination of what was behind the evilness of the mirror or who the woman was. They just kind of glazed over it. Also the back and forth structure of the film was poorly done and felt rushed. It made it extremely difficult to keep track of what was going on and made the story feel disjointed.

349,Miigi86,Nope...Nope Nope Nope,1,19 September 2014,"Occulus (SPOILER ALERT just to be safe) is possibly one of the single dumbest movies i have seen in a while. Why film it when all anyone can see is them moving the camera's? Why stay in it's radius of influence aside from from re setting the contraption timer? Come to think of it why wait until it gets more powerful instead of using the contraption right away? Just to show them moving the cameras and ""screw over"" her brother who spent all his life coping with what ""he"" has done and learned to live with it and is happy? Why use a contraption like this when all the THING THAT CAN MIND CONTROLL YOU has to to do is a) make you move it b) put something between the contraption and itself (as it has done). Why not (when doing all this dumb...stuff) chain yourselves up so you can only reach the contraption timer/food/water and put the key on a similar contraption that only releases if the first contraption has been released (hell a string attached to the first contraption with the key on it would do it^^)? But why care to begin with? The dad is a male primary sexual organ from the start, the mother is pants and Kaylie is actually more interesting as a kid (she does a pretty great job and Karen Gillan seems kinda misplaced/cast not bad acting or anything but she doesn't seem to fit in). But the worst part is the movie is boring my first thought when i saw the contraption was ""well that ain't gonna end well"" the ""IT"" esque going back and forth between present/past just rips you out ""of the moment"" instead of going more deeply into the lore of the entity and establish a tense mood.",Oculus
350,kirrwed,Deus ex Machina ending,2,16 April 2014,"The 2 stars are for what was an intriguing setup that positioned itself to resolve by way of a clever or satisfying ending based on the rules the film setup for itself.Disastrously, however, the finale of the film completely abandons all the ""rules"" it setup for the situation. Possible spoilers follow....The protagonist establishes that this evil mirror has ""predictable"" behavior and the entire film fortifies that theory. In the current as well as the historical cases, the plants wither on cue, people dehydrate for some reason before this thing, and it protects itself if someone attacks it, etc... However, just as another commenter pointed out, they knew the thing had a range of ""power"" of about 30 feet, inside of which, it would use the power of suggestion or whatever to make the person miss-hit or just not strike. So why not take it out with a rifle?Additionally, the very last few minutes of the movie shifts into a huge film violation, which is to simply create illusions. What the viewer and characters are seeing aren't really there, but sometimes, it is really there. There is no consistency as to when something is there but really isn't or when something is really there but we and the characters can't perceive it. There is no consistency with using a camera to see what is real or not either. So basically, the writers of the film created a canvas from which they allowed themselves to do absolutely anything they wanted. This is Deus ex Machina to the extreme. So they just write the characters perceiving themselves to kill the mirror when in reality they are hallucinating and one of them ends up getting killed. It is simply poor writing, and a disastrous, unsatisfying ending. Frankly, with all the hallucinations and illusions the writers set up by this point, we, the viewers, don't even have good reason to believe anything in the movie really happened. What's to stop them from making a sequel that says the last 10 minutes of the movie were just the protagonists' daydream, they snap out of it and resume the movie where they snap out of it. There is nothing to stop the story from going that direction if the writers' feel like it because they established anything goes, we can fake anything you see, etc....Besides all that, the acting was generally flat as well. I can't recommend it.",Oculus

It is a good story with a very clever construction and without using cheap FX and blood buckets it really did scare the sh*t out of me... The top notch acting from all actors involved (but the children deserve a special mention!) plays an important part in the fact that the movie reaches at you so well.

As an avid horror movie fanatic,it takes a lot to freak me out in a movie and this movie not only disturbed me it stood out to me.This movie is based off of psychological mind tricks and you will feel as if you are being deceived by the mirror.This does not get its horror based off of cheap jump out scares or gore, it messes with you so you no longer know what's real and what's not. While the ending was very abrupt,I love how the whole film mirrors itself in the past and that the two story lines interconnect.This may not be for everyone, but I can say that this movie is psychologically terrifying. This generation is used to over used gore and predictable horror, but this movie is different than that. Despite what others say it is not just another scary movie. I left the theater afraid after all of the illusions the movie pushes you through. It is slow, yes, but it is full of suspense and the slow dread adds to the plot.

353,madballs4,"Clever, original film",7,4 May 2014,"The film centers on Kaylie and Tim Russel as Kaylie tries to prove an antique mirror is the cause of several murders throughout the centuries; including that of their father and mother. Kaylie believes something living inside the mirror controls it's victims to murder those around them and destroy themselves. Tim had just been released from a mental hospital, and is trying to take control of his life and get over the terrible events of his childhood. As Kaylie tries to convince him about the mirror, he in return tries to convince her that her mind is trying to cover up the terrible event of their past. The movie is filled with great plot twists and mind f***s. If you get past the fact that paranormal movies have been done to death in the past decade, this movie really stands out if you give it a chance. The acting is excellent, even the children are quite believable. Unlike most movies of it's genera, it has great character development. Instead of wanting them to die, you end up routing for them throughout the movie. Highly recommended, but some may find it slow.",Oculus
354,darkmarshall,A Methodically Hypnotizing Film,8,10 February 2015,"After about 40 minutes into the movie I began to question my own reality.First of all, the film is above all else, a ""ghost"" story. Whether those ghosts are in a mirror or in ones' head, that is entirely up to you. That is probably the most interesting part of the film; even at the end, you still aren't entirely sure.The reason people may not enjoy this film is because of the time line story telling. There is none. This is used to the films advantage, though. While the film is meant to keep you guessing, it isn't trying to confuse you with the story. However, the film is trying to confuse you on what is real within the story.This can get a bit frustrating. All throughout the movie, you slowly start to lose your bearings, until you can't trust anything in the movie. Which is where the horror comes from: not being able to tell what is real.The characters can't take a single step without worrying about whether or not they're actually walking anywhere; or, worse yet, walking into something very dangerous.Also, with many horror films, the audience natural reaction is to look away from the scary images/moments; with Oculus, the opposite is true. By the time I had made it half way through the movie, I'd become so paranoid about the weird, creepy s**t in the background that I was constantly scanning the edges of the scene for what would happen next.This movie is not scary is the sense that you will scream and jump. Instead, you will be sitting uncomfortably for virtually the duration of the film.While the film is nowhere near perfect, it does so much right that the little mistakes are almost unnoticeable. All of the actors (the child actors as well) give some impressive performances. For some reason, I love the editor(s?) of this film. The style and pacing make this movie, but the editing is what sold it. The way they planned the crossovers from past to future is very well done.Finally, the movie is beautiful. Everything looks amazing. The mirror is creepy, but beautiful. If I didn't think the f**ker was haunted, I would want it my Pretentious Room. The music is beautiful and ominous. Karen Gillan is VERY beautiful. And so is Katee Sackhoff.All in all 8/10. No film is perfect, and personally, I like films with a bit more closure in their conclusion, but this one is now a favorite.",Oculus

It did creep me out a lot of the time and give me goosebumps, but it never really scared me or made me jump or yell. I'd consider this more of a thriller than a horror. Also, I didn't notice any cool or scary sound effects on the surround sound, so I was pretty disappointed there too.Next paragraph contains possible spoiler!!********One thing I don't get is why they didn't just kill the darn thing. I understand that like half of the movie was them trying to prove it was dangerous, but why? They already know it was the mirror responsible for the death of many people, why not just kill it?! Then in the end why they do finally try to kill it, it doesn't work out. The only thing going through my mind was ""Really........""**********Like my title says, it was an interesting and creative story line with great acting and I think it would be at least worth a watch to see if you like it.

357,praveer-mishra,Evil Mirror Mirror On The Wall,7,5 May 2014,"Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) has just been released from a mental hospital. Several years have passed since he shot his father to death. His older sister Kaylee Russell (Karen Gillan) has spent years going through foster care and college sharing a dreadful and eerie secret with Tim regarding circumstances surrounding the horrific death of their parents.Oculus is the brainchild of writer/director Mike Flanagan. The centerpiece of the story is the centerpiece of Alan Russell's (Rory Cochrane) home office. An antique centuries old mirror that looks every bit as ominous and dark as the story of the Russell family. An evil demonic force contained within the mirror has cursed every owner of the mirror and now the upper middle class Russell home is slowly becoming a twisted reflection of the worst fears of each member of the Russell family.The film goes back and forth from flashback memories of Tim and Kaylee and their parents moving into their new home. Their software engineer father, Alan has bought a new antique mirror to decorate his office. Much to the consternation of Alan's wife, Marie (Katee Sackhoff) who isn't exactly thrilled with Alan's new purchase. Jumping back to the present, Kaylee has been obsessively following the journey of the mirror from owner to owner noting the bizarre and dark deaths of the individuals that have possessed the mirror from hell. Kaylee has been plotting her revenge on the mirror she is convinced drove her parents into the depths of insanity.Now that Tim has been released she has acquired the mirror from an auction house and has an devised an ingenious plan to chronicle the evil in real time and destroy it. Tim while in the hospital has been cleansed of his paranoid and horrific thoughts regarding the mirror, is no longer convinced the mirror is to blame. Kaylee while setting up experiments to prove the mirror is evil is also contending with Tim's doubts and her own paranoia. Director Mike Flanagan beautifully directs the flashback and present time sequences as the film progresses with a growing sense of dread. As the evening continues, Kaylee and Tim experience a growing sense of paranoia toward the result of their ""experiments"" and towards each other. Flashbacks and present time are no longer easy to differentiate. What is reflected is becoming real and what is reflected is terrifying. Time is running on Tim and Kaylee to survive the nightand each other.THE VERDICT: Most horror films follow the same formulaic plot of bogeyman coming back over and over to haunt and slaughter victims in some gory and awful manner. The best horror films feature well paced supernatural thrills and chills with vulnerable characters finding themselves in a cold and desolate environment. The best horror films stay with you after the credits roll. While Oculus certainly isn't The Exorcist, the film efficient delivers your moneys worth of chilling suspense. Most importantly, Oculus does leave you wanting to see the sequel!See more reviews at www.silverscreened.com",Oculus

The mirror as the focal point of the movie is a much different take on horror movie plots, but it works very well. I see why the online reviewer Nostalgia Critic called this a new Halloween classic. I also see this movie becoming an actual classic when many more years go by. There is no murderer or even any common haunting...the film makes it clear that the mirror is either haunted or it is the insanity of the main characters. It was great to see how well done the movie's interweaving of the past and the present was.

It actually used suspense and used solid performances to make it a chilling and effective horror movie.This is the rare horror movie that actually lingers in your mind and have you thinking. The constant time shifts also made it a really enjoyable and intriguing film.Many of you have probably seen the trailer of this movie and thought that it was a lame, clichè jumpscare fest. But, the trailer really doesn't do the movie any justice. There is one particular scene where the protagonist mistakenly bites a lightbulb instead of an apple. That scene would probably get laughs in another kind of movie, but, not in this movie. Though, I am not saying that this movie is without its corny moments. Probably, most people will laugh at the sight of the protagonist telling the mirror,"" You must be hungry.""

I tend to jump at some point at most horror films normally because as bad as most of them are nowadays at least there's something which draws you in be it the plot or the characters performances. This particular movie in question here though made no attempt to provide a digestible storyline or an explanation to the reasons why the main protagonist which was the mirror came to be what it was... 'it's just here so deal with it and get over it'.I thought to myself I have to watch this flick looking at the reviews and star rating on IMDb. Now upon reflection I honestly believe a lot of the reviews on IMDb are definitely not genuine reviews by lay people, It's just does not make sense some of the positive and 7 - 10 star rating this flick has received unless maybe... just maybe of course there is a vested interest towards making the rest of us film goers believes this film is something that it is most definitely not...GOOD!If these script writers need some out of the box genuine ideas in writing a good storyline they only need to ask and I guarantee they will thank the day they did but unfortunately this will never happen. So until they change the format that is used in this industry I guess we all have to succumb to wasting 2hrs or so of our lives pretending that we were captivated by their work.I rarely write if ever at all write reviews or comment about films but in this case I felt compelled, why I don't know....'Maybe it was the mirror'",Oculus

While I like the idea of a possessed mirror as an original idea, the movie just didn't make good on the subject. The use of jump scares was strong with this one. There was no build up or atmosphere to leave me on the edge. Everything was expected. While the visuals were nice and the acting fantastic, it didn't leave any room for actual horror. If you saw the trailer than you knew everything that was going to happen. The scene with her biting what she thinks is a light bulb and pulling glass out of mouth quickly goes from dramatic to quite funny as she realizes it's an apple and pops the piece she was eating back into her mouth and continues with her business like nothing happened.

371,isajimenez-8,A story riddled with plot holes and lazy writing,2,9 January 2015,"I came into this movie with high expectations after reading the plethora of wonderful reviews here. However, my expectations were not met.The movie had various flaws, but I will not go into details in order to avoid spoilers. The main problem was the blur between reality and the ""hallucinations"" (caused by the demonic mirror). We have no idea what is real or not, and the movie does no attempt to make anything clearer. Spoiler: X person dies; X person calls on cellphone AFTER dying. Did X person really die or was it a trick? We don't know. The movie goes out of its way to make X's death ambiguous, yet we, the audience, get nothing out of it except a ""huh?"" moment.Add to this the fact that they kept overlapping flashbacks to the point were the present and the past were almost speaking to each other. This would have been fine if it was relevant to the plot. However, it was just another tactic to confuse the viewer and make the movie more convoluted (probably in a pathetic attempt to hide the lazy writing).Everything in this movie is confusing. It might have as well ended with some ""it was all in their heads"" cliché.Also, another fatal mistake is the whole idea of videotaping the mirror's powers. The sister clearly understands that the mirror controls people in order to do its bidding. Therefore, all she would get on tape is herself and her brother going crazier and crazier by the minute. Not much of a proof if you ask me. Sure, the demon/ghost woman is creepy-looking, so she might scare you, but the plot is completely lacking. The lazy writing and stupid decisions were just too much to bare.I give this 2/10 stars because the premise was interesting and the ghost was scary.",Oculus
372,Pinhead88,Creepy & 2/3 originality,10,11 April 2014,"This film starts out a little slow. Not that that's a bad thing but it most definitely is slow. It's a build up. It sets up the story nicely and then when things get dark, the monsters start coming out literally. Its tries to be original which I give it credit for. Think of it as a supernatural thriller wrapped up in a ghost story formula, with better planned scares and some one that you see coming, specifically one scene. It really plays mind games with you until you don't know what is real, just like the characters. They also intertwine the present and the past very seamlessly. I saw one review that said too seamlessly. You cant use the word seamlessly in a bad sense. Well overall I give this movie a 10/10 it was creepy and although not completely original it tries to steer in a direction that people didn't expect. And a word to critics and self reviewers like myself. This film is constantly being compared to mirrors. Mirrors is about a evil force that resides in a house that kills people through mirrors. Oculus is about essentially a mirror that possesses people. It does have it cliché moments but you cant bash a movie for trying to be original then tearing it apart because it didn't go the way you wanted or the way you planned it to go. The conjuring was far from original yet well made and well planned, still cliché. This film is a original and tries to divert itself away from cliché horror films. You cant have anything your way.If a film is original, it execution is weak. If its execution is good and its original, its acting was bad. If all of that is a plus, movie reviewers pick on something like a characters hair or the way someone said something. Movie reviewers will never get their way and they will never suck it up and take a movie for what it isOriginal.",Oculus
373,valerielaforgia,Worst Movie Ever,1,21 August 2014,"If I could rate this movie a 0 I would. The entire movie is talking and flashbacks. Nothing to do with horror was included in this movie an hour and 8 mins into the movie nothing but talking and flashbacks. This movie was really nothing more then a boring story telling point of view. Nothing in this movie had anything to do with horror, the talking was continuous, the story line was boring it felt as if it went no where. They tried to make the ending seem as if it were a possession movie, but it really just a sad display of bad directing, and screen writing.How could this possibly have been the scariest movie of the year when nothing happened to be scary. No ghouls, ghosts, demons, monsters, not even a ""boo"". What a disappointment. I would say if you're looking for horror, watch Night of the Living Dead or something because this had nothing but flashbacks being played through the whole movie. One minute the sister and brother and talking and then they flash back to when they were kids...back and forth. If I wanted to watch a boring documentary I would have watched that. The actors were stale no personality, the actors were a bore. The woman who played the sister so dry the man who played the son, just no character ability at all in this movie. I don't believe it was the actors though just the story line that went no where on and on relentlessly. The whole movie went stale until the last 20 minutes where they finally showed a demon or witch whatever the hell it was. ENTIRE MOVIE NOTHING HAPPENED ....NO HORROR, NO GORE, NOTHING...IT WAS STRICTLY TALKING AND FLASH BACKS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I COULD REPEAT THAT. Do not watch it unless you want to be so bored out of your mind you throw yourself into a mirror for some action and gore.",Oculus
374,livia-ella-laitinen,Twisted,6,28 June 2015,"I kinda liked the trailer and i thought that this movie will be interesting to watch. Although i didn't like that there were nothing else just illusions and ""accidentally"" killing each other, it was an OK movie to watch. The mirror had an evil entity in it that created false things in the characters' minds. So they never knew what was real and what was not. Actually the mirror didn't do anything else, just playing with minds.I don't like movies without explained end and unfortunately this movie had to make me unsatisfied also. The ending left me with mixed feelings, i wasn't sure what to believe... I think either there will be a second part of the movie or who directed the movie, like to be sadist and make you feel bad.The brother just got out from prison for killing their dad and now in the end ""accidentally"" killed his sister, so he goes back right away to prison...

375,grapplefanmel,If you hate flash banks do not see this film!,6,15 June 2014,"Having seen this film I immediately went to the reviews interested to read what other people made of this perplexing film. What a mixed lot of reviews - you would swear that these film goers had seen two different films. Some love it! Some hate it! I guess it's a marmite sort of a film. If I'm being honest, I read the reviews to see if any cast light on what the back story might be - what is the mirror, an entity, a haunted piece of furniture, what? Somebody please enlighten me because quite frankly it's bugging me. I'm obviously the kind of viewer who likes to know about these things. That apart, it's a scary, interestingly different little horror film. So why did I only rate it a 6 out of 10? Basically because I hate flashbacks - they tax me, they worry me, I feel that I have to keep myself mentally sharp so that I can make sense of the film at the end of the proceedings. This means that I cannot sit back and enjoy the film and that quite frankly, irritates me. I think the acting is good - especially from the younger actors. It made me jump a couple of times and it is very much a slow burner with effective music that only helps with the mood of the piece. It's just a shame that I don't feel able to rate this film more highly. I love horror films but it is nowhere near the standard of film like The Shining as the first reviewer suggested. Different, interesting, irritating and strangely disturbing. Take a punt and go see it!",Oculus

I'm a big supernatural horror fan, and I had heard that this movie was different- how different it actually is, I never would have expected!I won't give anything away, but I will tell you this: The way the story is told is so so so golden. It takes a high level of attention to follow and is just brilliant. The viewer becomes just as frustrated as the characters as you discover how IMPOSSIBLE it is to distinguish reality from the ghostly hallucinations. It's frightening to put yourself in their shoes and imagine that you might be doing something completely different from what you think you're doing.

379,aklindsay1109,Oculus review,2,15 August 2014,"I had high hopes for this movie given at the time it had a 7/10 IMDb rating. I am a huge horror fan and have seen most every horror movie ever made so I was excited to watch this since it had good reviews and was rated R which usually means it's better, more scary, and gruesome. But alas yet another disappointment much like The Conjuring was to me. Basic premise is old antique mirror is possessed and causes people to hallucinate and at times commit murder. My advice is to watch Mirrors if you want to see a good horror movie about a possessed mirror that actually has gore and is worthy of its R rating. I found nothing scary or original for that matter about this movie and really want my time and money back. Since this genre is my favorite, I likely was expecting too much since there are few horror movies made today that are scary or even creepy. Some of the best horror movies are from the 1970's and 1980's and in today's world nothing compares to some of the greats. I will continue to watch the old much creepier horror movies and leave the ones from this century alone as they simply don't compare. It's too bad as technology could help make some great movies but instead it seems all are low budget and simply don't amount to much of anything, all just to save a few bucks, ridiculous is what it is! Watch Mirrors instead and don't waste your time and money on this.",Oculus

Saw this coming a mile away, as soon as the ""anchor"" was shown. It's a major flaw that ruined the whole movie. They could have made it more interesting with the real/unreal aspects But the whole time this anchor is looming above the premise rendering the point moot. Also the flashing back and forth between present and past was not interesting it was more annoying than anything.",Oculus
381,sgntheone,Enjoyed it immensely....!!!,8,13 April 2014,"Oculus reinvents the horror genre...by making it a brain twister. Congrats to the team for giving us a break from the normal one ghost chasing women/kids genre. Here you r as much part of the movie as much the characters. The story telling technique is terrific...as we watch two stories unfold at the same time with the mirror wrecking havoc in both of them. It moves seamless from one to another tying the past to the present at each step. As viewers, it keeps u on the edge, never giving a dull moment as u try to separate the real and the surreal. There may be detractors comparing it to classics and saying it is not original. But the treatment is completely different from the other horror movies and is damn realistic. The director does not go overboard with the scaring tactics, but creates a puzzle which unfolds in two parallel stories,both equally interesting and thrilling. All the actors give sincere performances, playing well within their characters and making it feel as real as poosible.Let me say this, if this one has a sequel, u would see me there ready to experience it again....totally enjoyable....!!!",Oculus
382,halcyonsummer,I didn't care for this one.,2,10 April 2014,"This evil mirror story just didn't cut it for me. I'd heard a lot of positive things from the festival circuit and it had good reviews, so I was pretty excited going into this, but in the end I can't get over how average and even boring it was, and this is not being said by someone who enjoys constant action and explosions--I can watch Lars von Trier films and not be bored, so what does that say about this thing?The plot is fairly straightforward: a mirror has caused the deaths of its owners throughout the four centuries of its existence. The deaths run the gamut from starvation, dehydration, fire, murder, you name it. In keeping with the cursed object theme, things don't go well for the last owners (a story-line which takes place in 2002 and runs simultaneously with the present-day story-line) and the parents die while the family's son is sent to an asylum for murder and the daughter is forced to grow up in foster care.Cut to present-day and the son is now 21 and being released from the asylum, being instructed by his doctor to get back in touch with his sister, though that recommendation might have been revoked if the doctor had known what the sister was up to. The sister, now 23, has managed to track the cursed mirror down and get it sent to her boyfriend's auction house, where it is sold to a new owner. But before another unlucky owner can fall victim to the curse of the mirror, our female protagonist has a few days to arrange an elaborate experiment in the hopes of proving it houses a supernatural force...and she wants little brother to help her.The set up to this was very interesting: our female protagonist shows a great deal of cleverness in designing her experiment that includes timers to remind them to eat and drink as well as thermometers installed in every room and multiple battery-operated cameras to document everything going on. Add in a fail-safe that ensures the destruction of the mirror should something happen to either of them, essentially giving the mirror a reason to NOT hurt them and the instructions shes gives her boyfriend to call every hour on the hour to make sure they're okay, and it -seems- like she's got this all figured out. Right? Well the mirror has other plans.Once the experiment begins, things slowly go off the rails. There is some brief discussion of psychology when the brother attempts to debunk the curse of the mirror using logic, denouncing his sister's beliefs as a protection device she made up in her mind to shield herself from the reality of what really happened, but sadly this interesting angle doesn't last very long as the mirror soon starts exerting its power on the two and manipulating everything they see.This is the problem with the film: once the mirror gets going, there is nothing for the viewer to distinguish between fantasy and reality. What results is an hour of being tricked by various means as we realize the protagonists' perceptions are not what they seem to be. While I give the filmmakers props for trying to be innovative, in the end all I could think was how pointless it all was. At any given moment in the film, we're not sure whether what we're seeing is actually happening or not, as the film often shows different situations from multiple POVs that all conflict with one another. We're repeatedly wrapped up in something happening to one of the siblings only to have a quick ""reset"" occur where we realize the other one is not experiencing the same thing at all. Or, we think one thing is happening while the cameras are recording something completely different. I found myself growing bored with this tactic, which unfortunately makes up the bulk of the latter half of the film. If we can't trust that what we're actually seeing is real, then basically...what's the point of all this?In the end, it was a great setup to what ended up being a confusing, pointless mess. I appreciate the fact that these guys were trying to think outside the box, but by adopting the unreliable viewpoints of the protagonists, the film robs its audience of any meaningful suspense as nothing we see is ever quite what it seems. I appreciate films that try to make you think, but this just felt sloppy.",Oculus
383,taurenpaly,Unpleasant and predictable,3,1 November 2014,"As someone who's always got a taste for supernatural horrors, I brought this movie at full price because I thought the premise of the story sounded interesting. What I got instead of a predictable plot line, a very baseline story that has been done to death and offered nothing original or creative. The acting from some of the actors was mixed, Brenton Thwaites was good in his role, and the younger versions of the main characters played by Garrett Ryan and Annalise Basso were very good young actors. But even that couldn't save this movie.The biggest complaint I have is just how awkward and unpleasant the story felt as it went on, there should be a rule with any horror movie that either you are able to scare your audience and draw them in, or just be a romp and blast them with jump scares and cheap moments to make it fun at least. This movie doesn't deliver on any of these, the story is unengaging and irritating to follow, and the scare in it are just awful, worse then Mama or the 4th paranormal activity. So to sum up, a very basic plot with no taste or even care for the characters, acting ranging from standard to downright ridiculous, and a predictable premise we've seen hundreds of times before. Do not buy this movie now at full price. Either wait for it to become dead cheap, or rent it dead cheap.",Oculus

The intensely researched back story, the filming style, and the psychological games that the film plays with the viewer made it stand out to me. I thought this would become one of my favorites, but as is the case with many movies, the ending ruined it for me. Not in the sense that it diminished the rest of the film, but in that just wasn't logical. By all laws of the universe, that damn mirror should have broken, but it didn't. It sustained a crack when someone's head fell against it, but the contraption that the protagonist installed had no effect. For how much power that thing had, there's no way it wouldn't have done even the most minute damage. Even though it had to go through a human body before it could contact the mirror, it had more than enough force to impale the person and still crack the mirror. In the end it just didn't add up.",Oculus
387,samtepesfour,Loved it!,8,23 July 2015,"Twenty-one year-old Timothy ""Tim"" Allen Russell is discharged from a mental institution by his psychiatrist apparently healed from a childhood trauma. Kaylie is shown getting a vintage mirror through an auction along with her boyfriend who also happens to be her colleague but it's obvious he knows nothing about her past. Kaylie welcomes her brother and brings him home. Then she tells him that they need to destroy the same ancient mirror that she just bought. A reluctant Tim follows his sister and has fragmented recollections from his childhood about the time his mother Marie buys a mirror for the home office of their father Alan. The addition of that mirror brings the strangest changes to their childhood home and Kaylie and Tim both see a woman with their father in his office. Suddenly, the behaviors of Alan and Marie change, and everything goes haywire, dark things start happening around the home and no one knows what is going on and before anyone can do anything about it, the worse happens.Now Kaylie blames the mirror and she wants to destroy it with Tim. The rest of the story is about Tim telling her that they just hallucinated something and made things up in their mind to erase the trauma, but Kaylie is sure that there was something supernatural going on and is a little annoyed that Tim let himself forget all about it. Through the same fragments, which is a stylistic approach by the director that makes this movie so much more special because you see the past not as something that has happened, but as something that is still happening--a lot like traumatic events that don't leave you even years later.There is some gore but overall it's the frightening elements of the supernatural entity namely the mirror that cause most of the horror in this film. It captured my attention until the end because truly I was dying to find out what it really is and the ending though it might not have been satisfactory for some, I found just perfect for this kind of a story.*SPOILER ALERT* Personally I like that film was about a traumatic time in the children's lives and I love horror that stands not for the blood and gore or the supernatural being itself, but for the subtext, which in this case was the stuff that the children lived through and at one point, Tim actually gives a very good explanation of what's really going on but from what I gather, the whole film was a euphemism for a couple of siblings struggling with childhood trauma. As for the matter of whether the fiancé was actually killed, I think he did die, because obviously the sister is not mentally stable either, which is something they keep hinting at in the beginning: saying to Tim that his sister hasn't had the 'help' that he had et cetera. And Tim, who looks stable in the beginning part of the movie, also gets into the same unstable mindset by the end and ends up killing her. Even the tag-line: ""You see what it wants you to see"" is basically a variation of ""You see what you want to see"" *END OF SPOILER* Yes, it's not a perfect film in any way, not even close to be honest. It could have been better directed and the acting could definitely have been better, the characterization too, of the brother and sister as new adults seemed somewhat lacking, but all in all this was truly one of the best films I've seen in the horror genre recently.",Oculus

The actors are also good so that's not something to complain about. THe movie gets going quite early so there's no beating around the bush either. But the movie mixes past and present with dreams or memories which can't be interpreted if they are real or not. It just becomes too much (especially the second half or so) and you start to look for the clue that will be the last piece of the puzzle but it never happens.. Well, maybe just a little bit at the end but thats not enough. The characters seem just as confused as me. Now thats because the ""object"" (as they refer it to be) manipulates the mind. Also, at too many points in this movie you just sit back and laugh because its absurd or you snap out of the intrigue and start looking at how the movie was made. Now thats always a pointer that the movie doesn't catch your attention.. Where the heck was this house located? In the forest? On a street with neighbors? Was this movie a budget one since it just revolves around that house?One more thing. I can't write reviews and my English is horrible.

Was expecting alot of jump scares with slow, intense and adrenaline pumping scenes (Like in the Nun, Conjuring, Insidious etc) however there were few scenes in this movie that matched. It wasn't so much a scary horror movie but a weird/creepy one with aspects of scariness (possessed looking people, dark rooms etc.) in it, which was countered by the whole illusion idea (scary in its own way). I was still very focussed for the whole movie as the extremely unique idea of the illusions and going back and forth in time was done well. It had me thinking if certain events were real or fake, which made me second guess my own thoughts in real life. Some could say that the plot was ""obvious"" but for me some of it was, and some it wasn't (the ending did catch me off guard). I will say that there could (not so much should, depends on the viewer I suppose) have been more intense scenes and jump scares, which is what I prefer, but it doesn't necessarily need these things to be a good, scary movie. Some scenes seemed a little bit ametuear (weird camera positions, awkward talking, no sound etc.) which didn't really have that bad of an affect anyway. Overall a great movie, keeps you thinking and a surprising ending.",Oculus

I'm happy to say that I was wrong.The story is great. It's not convoluted with 1000 actors and subplots which makes it great to focus on what is happening. This is important because the movie plays with your mind in a lot of different ways. It is very effective.The acting is more than OK. Of course the actors are no top billed heavyweights. Nevertheless they manage to do their job and make it believable.Another great thing is that the movie doesn't rely on special effects. The horror and the suspense happen all in the mind of the viewer. In my opinion this is what makes a great horror movie. To not actually see what is happening. Fantasy is really powerful and underrated tool! The sound and music design are masterful.Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed!8/10,Oculus

Personally, I found it somewhat reminiscent of The Shining, although not up to the scratch of that particular horror classic. The story is not particularly imaginative but is executed well enough providing good atmosphere and some nice, creepy moments. The story arc is split between the current and a previous time. I had no problem with the latter, however, Karen Gillan's acting is so appallingly bad that when the story switches to the current time, it's very jarring and very distracting. Gillan acts very much with her eyes. You can almost hear the director telling her how she is feeling in certain scenes. The only time her performance becomes passable is in moments of hysteria, when the tendency to over egg the acting pudding can be somewhat excused. I would recommend this movie to horror enthusiasts and people fond of some good creep and scare. A nice, well rounded creeper sadly let down by one bad acting performance.",Oculus

For a while there's a great struggle for the characters and the audience between the supernatural and the psychological. However, the film kind of fell apart for me in the last third. After so many mind games I stopped being invested in what was happening on-screen and the suspense pretty much disappeared.

400,ManpreetB,Oculus: A psycho-thriller masterpiece of horror and sheer excellence!,9,1 January 2016,"Gone are the days when horror movies relied on shrill screams, dark walkways, eerie musical score or haunted houses to entertain us. The horror genre in movie-making has a come a long way since classics like Bram Stoker's Dracula or The Exorcist and Oculus is the latest in taking a shot to do something innovative in slowly standardizing zone of movies.Oculus sports no direct implication of a demonic possession, no exorcism and basically no supernatural paraphernalia that you see in a classic exorcism regime movie. Mike Flanagan (the director) has worked with something called subtlety and you'll absolutely love it. This here is a true masterpiece in the realm of intellectually challenging movies – ones that hit hard on your brain and does way more than get you scared of the dark.There is thrill, and real horror in this movie and after a long time, something other than a freakishly painted up actor is being used to deliver the scares. You are looking at a spooking antique mirror that majors in mind warping and fostering hallucinations to make one do anything it pleases whilst thinking they are doing something else. The plot is simple, a woman Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) aims to prove that her younger brother Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) who was convicted of murder 11 years ago is innocent and committed the crime under the influence of the mirror. Tim has just been released from a mental institute when Kaylie re-acquires the evil mirror through an auction and they go to their old family house to destroy the evil. The main antagonist in the movie is the mirror of course, which creates delusional hallucinations and visions wherever it goes making people go insane and commit heinous crimes without realizing it like murder and/or suicide in grizzly ways. Yes, the mirror is a character and it is absolutely frightening. Kudos to Mike Flanagan and his team for successfully giving a spooky personality to a mirror. The background story of the main protagonists is given using flashbacks occasionally while covering the present day. The story is gradual and very descriptive. Most of the beginning is reserved for debate over whether the mirror is a supernatural ill omen or just an antique piece of junk. The beginning is slow and too explanatory but it serves its purpose of creating suspense and tempo. After an in- depth history about the mirror and a little about Kaylie and Tim, the plot advances, and the mirror's influence finally kicks in. What is really enjoyable here, is that the story moves step-by-step, gradually advancing to the tipping point of fear. The scares are delivered in steps and that is far more frightening than any jump-scare or spooking music or haunted house and murder(s) cliché. There is a lot of confusion, suspense and downright chaos towards the end of the movie where the past and present begin to blur and it's difficult to understand what is real and what is unreal. This confusion is achieved through a clever mix of first person and third person story-telling where you get to see flashbacks as a spectator while witnessing the illusions caused by the mirror as Kaylie and Tim abruptly which makes you wonder whether it is flashback or an illusion of the flashback in the minds of the protagonists. This is better seen than told but all I can say it that this concept is a stroke of genius. Oculus is a great brain exercising movie with a lot of twists and turns but the main splendor is in the direction which differentiates it from all the other generic horror flicks. This movie relies on its smart cinematography and so there are no elaborate sets or costumes, just a crisp script and entertaining plot.Whether you like slow-developing plots and descriptive back-story movies or not, Oculus is a must watch. It is different from the other movies out there in its concept and as mentioned before, is a psychological thriller based on the variables of the supernatural world. A complete horror!",Oculus
401,harlowroos,Not a fan,4,16 April 2014,"Came into this movie feeling like I might be seeing something original for once, but yet again, just like the Conguring mind you, I find myself watching a weak remake of 'Mirrors'. However, the beginning of the film made me feel as if something spectacular or jaw-dropping was going to happen, but I was left feeling totally neglected at the end of the movie. The dialogue was atrocious. There was far too much, and not enough scares solely based on suspense or dread. In fact, there were no scares whatsoever. No goosebumps were had. The only thing some viewers may find 'scary' are the cheap and grotesque violent scenes where some individuals eat shattered glass. Cool. The last half hour of the film was so poorly put together that it gave me a headache. Honestly, the acting wasn't all that great either, aside from Annalise Basso, one of the younger stars in the film. Had high hopes, but was sorely disappointed.",Oculus

I can't see any point for myself to watch such kind of horror/mystic movie that ends unhappy! All the time I spend while watching the film is the time I'm waiting for the solution of the story! When I see the unhappy end I feel veeeery uncomfortable and always start to the thinks the the movie's producers aimed the only one goal - to earn money on the sequel! And the sequel is necessary must be, 'cause this one ends badly! What's the stupidity?!

In addition, the casting of Karen Gillan was just another draw since I'm also a fan of Doctor Who.Those things said, this was a decent film with some well-executed, if predictable, twists. I was mildly distracted by Karen's natural Scottish accent peeking through at parts, particularly toward the beginning. Even with that, the acting was very good. I was particularly impressed with the younger actors who played the child-versions of the main characters. The music was well done and helped create a foreboding atmosphere. The switching between flashbacks and present became a bit overdone by the end, but worked effectively for the intended purpose nonetheless.

Differentiating from the childhood/adulthood was very interesting, in the way they interpret things and the idea of believing whether something is true or not.Whilst you can see the people from PA involved in it as you sometimes find same concept of free video to look around...Its a good movie worth a look and hopefully there is a second part that conclude it.

The movie starts out quite promising, an interesting premise and good production quality. It is competently acted and there are a few scares that offer the potential for more. Unfortunately as the movie progresses things begin to fall apart. It seems as the writers paint themselves into a corner, or it may be better as the opposite of that. They seem to lose sight of a coherent and satisfying conclusion. As they do so there seems to be less and less rules to reason which can come across as either lazy writing or a failed attempt at being ""deep"". After watching there are just too many questions that can be asked without reasonable, let alone definitive, answers. The last taste the film leaves you with is one of disappointment. That being said the filmmakers are more than average and I look forward to watching their next movie, no doubt they will have learnt from this movie making experience.

412,registracija0,Mediocre and frustrating,3,6 August 2014,"I wasn't too impressed by the trailer but I decided to give it a look. The premise seemed good enough for the base of a horror movie - although the haunted mirror is not in any way original it is a good start, and the decision of characters to explore it's behavior in a logical way seemed like we had a great movie ahead. Sadly, that's about it as everything after that point (first 20 minutes or so) becomes boring and almost unwatchable. The movie tries to tell two stories simultaneously (past happenings and present) and that is the frustrating part. At one point (about an hour in the movie), I stood up thinking about dropping it because ""if these god damn kids show up again I'm going to..."". Sadly, after calming down I decided to see the rest of the movie and - it didn't get any better. I understand that the constant flashbacks (past story) was an attempt to present us with the state of mind of the characters but it does not work - if it did, they would go frenzy on each other way too early. Aside from the original premise (first 20 minutes of the movie), we learn nothing else about anything: What are the mechanics of this mirror, did anything really happen, why is the movie named ""Oculus"" instead of ""Probably Haunted Mirror"", are the magical characters emerging from mirrors really past victims and so on. The great problem with this movie is that the intended behavior of the mirror renders any specific event obsolete - anything can and does not have to be true. At one point (also the beginning of the movie) they make a conclusion that the mirror has 30 feet range due to dried out plants, which contradicts itself in the part when they are outside and still under the effect of the mirror - but as the mirror casts illusions it is possible that they are inside it's range all along as much as it is possible that the mirror tricked them about it having a specific range of effect in the first place. Hell, it is also possible that the whole ending with the police thing was an illusion too - It's a mess, and not a smart one. You really can't get anything from anything.That being said (I probably got a bit too carried with the mirror), this movie does not have any other good aspects to redeem itself. Characters are boring and we don't really get anything about them other than specific events in the childhood. We know that the sister character was in foster homes or something like that but managed to get a lot of expensive equipment and seems to have a nice life. That sort of seems like a success, why didn't we hear more about it? The brother being in the asylum could also make a great story and boost the character a bit but the movie never goes there. It's just mirror, mirror, mirror, flashback, mirror, flashback, mirror. As soon as you see that spike hanging from ceiling you'll know how it's going to end, and that's the thing about this movie. Everything after the first 20 minutes is obsolete. There is nothing interesting, new, scary or fun to see.Rating: 3 STARS (+1 - looks decent +1 - decent acting +1 - decent base for the story)",Oculus

""Oculus"" presents a refreshing view on the typical good vs evil battle, and while the scripting is generally good, the acting is convincing for the most part and the pacing is good, I thought the chop and change style film making made following the story a bit difficult.

She played the mother very well but there is a fragment in the film where it shows a tattoo on her arm that spoiled it for me in a instant. In this movie she plays the well 'normal' mother raising kids i don't see tattoos in that picture, at least not in this whole creation.

415,alleycee,So much more ..,9,24 December 2015,"This film is what in the old days they would have termed a 'production line feature' - a B movie like the Val Lewton flicks - turned out quickly and of the kind nowadays we see with Saw 9 and every other horror flick. Oculus however, much like some of the Classic Jaques Turneur/Val Lewton features, is something specialIt is the conflict between the psychological and the paranormal which is at constant play here. The Character of the little brother, unsure of the traumatic events of his youth that have him locked in an asylum for over 10 years, at the very beginning of the film, recounts his dreams of killing his own sister, in what is echoed in the climax of the filmIn Fact, it is this perfect circle of a plot arc that so distinguishes the movie. rather than follow the beginning, middle, and end convention most films follow, Oculus just has a beginning and an end, and they are both interwoven and intermingled throughout the running time to come to completion at the climax to make a nice, neat, Deadly-Grim Perpetual Spiral of Chaos, crossing dimensions, time and spaceAnd yet, at the same time, it fulfils all its contractual obligations to include Shocks, gore, ghosts, violence, terror - everything the makers were commissioned to produce by the financiers - they exceeded their mandate. In short, a lot of (ignorant) people have commented how Darabont's 'The Mist' is one of the finest horror films ever made, but while that Hefty, weighty production which for me is just one enormous prank on the audience, leading us on just to pull the rug out from under us, THIS film treats us with intellectual respect and leaves us genuinely thinking. essentially just a piece of furniture, Oculus nonetheless manages to evoke masterly-crafted, under-your-skin evil, that left many of the people I viewed it with in the cinema genuinely Distressed",Oculus

A departure from the 1950s ""monster as other"", the beast within typically relies on a conflation of the paranormal and dread of madness. Perhaps the best, or at least most sophisticated film in this genre is Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents"" (1961). I shudder to think what Oculus' director Mike Flanagan has done, or will do with yet another remake of The Innocents (originally adapted from Henry James' story, ""The Turn of the Screw"").It is difficult when watching Flanagan's Oculus not to think back to its inspiration: the British horror anthology film of 1945, ""Dead of night"". One story in this much praised film concerns ""a mirror with a violent past"". The execution of the story is dated, sentimental yet quite magical. Not so with the in-your-face treatment of Oculus.

Oculus (the feature film) is inspired by one of his earlier works, a short film – Oculus : Chapter 3 – The Man with the Plan. It is identical to Oculus in terms of the overall plot but is different in some aspects.Let me at this stage say that Oculus is not a scary movie. It may have been made with an intent of being scary and does achieve that in parts. But at the end of the day, it would qualify to be a thriller and not a horror flick. Eerie looking spirits with glazed eyes popping out of the mirror every now and then do not just a horror film make.

429,rudi-engel,Skip this movie if you're looking to be easily scared,10,31 August 2014,"I've never written a review on IMDb before, but with this movie I have the urge to defend it from noises I hear around me. To start with, Oculus is not The Conjuring. However I love both movies, they're both dealing at the complete opposite ends of the horror spectrum.I keep on hearing people saying they're disappointed with Oculus because the frequency of jump-out-of-your-seat scary moments is too low. That's correct; Oculus isn't even trying to achieve that. Whereas movies such as The Conjuring are about bumping your head out of nowhere, cursing and moving on, I find watching this film as getting a tattoo on a painful spot. You're excited beforehand, after the first minutes in the chair you feel relieved because the pain is easy to deal with, after half an hour the constant scratching gets irritating and after an hour all you want is to be done with it.Translated to Oculus and without trying to spoil the plot: at the beginning you're asking yourself whether you're even watching a horror movie, after half an hour you feel the palms of your hands getting sweaty and your gaze transfixed to the screen, and from then on the pressure keeps on building, building and building until you can't hold it anymore and you feel yourself praying for the end credits to roll over the screen.It's such a good thing for this genre people like Mike Flanagan still exist. He already showed some early potential with the low budget horror thriller Absentia (2011); with Oculus he has made a classic film like I thought they don't exist anymore in this fast food decade.

434,semcharmed,Awful movie. Total waste of time.,3,6 June 2014,"I want to start by saying that i'm a big fan of horror movies. I've probably seen almost everything out there that's considered a ""decent horror movie"". I also read many horror & thriller novels by authors such as Stephen King and Dean Koontz. In short, i'm a big horror fan.When i saw the trailer of Oculus and read a few reviews on here with headlines ""Refreshing"" , ""instant horror classic"" etc. i got really excited and decided to give it a watch. Boy was i disappointed!!! I don't want to say that it's the WORST horror/thriller movie i've ever seen but it's pretty close.I'm not a professional so i'm not going to comment on script , director ,sound etc. All i want to say is a WARNING to dear horror fans, Stay away from this movie unless you really have nothing to do. Boring as hell. I had to skip the last 30 minutes or so just to see if it makes sense at the end ( couldn't take it anymore) and i was happy with my decision. If you have a ps3 you could set the forward option to 2x or 4x so at least you won't feel like missing out and not waste any time in the process. :)",Oculus

I wanted a twist, for it to go off in an unexpected direction. What I got was a very predictable and clichéd story. Don't get me wrong - there are some seriously creepy moments in there - for me, anyone crawling about on all fours is creepy; someone moving their mouth and you hear someone else's voice. But, obviously, that is just me! In the end, there were just too many scenes that I cringed at; too many scenes that I laughed out loud at; too many holes in the plot. The direction with the scenes that were in the past/present/imagined was masterful, but with a little more imagination and back story, this movie would have been a psychological thriller with a supernatural twist.",Oculus
437,polomarco07,Unreflected Mystery,8,14 April 2014,"While the use of mirrors as a medium for supernatural elements is nothing new, Oculus strives to define it's own standard by reflecting two sides: inventive yet deceptive.The mirror itself is the adversary. In the same sense, the battle between an intangible force and mortal beings is most likely no-win situation.The film takes time in establishing it's foundation. Moderately paced, yet putting the action to it's proper places.It embraces the quality of the mirror by using it as a logic in the execution of scenes. It reflects the past and the future and cleverly overlaps them.The focus of the film aren't the scares. Quite reasonable since there are two events happening at once, so if the scares get too overpowering, it will distract the audiences' concentration. The second act sustains a gripping and engaging sequence but doesn't hold a variation making it hard to get where the film wants to put an emphasis. Same as the ending, the conclusion draws the viewers' energy in determining whether it is successful in conveying its point across. On the technical side, the editing is outstanding. Acting-wise, the whole cast gave a solid performance and are perfect for their respective roles. Bottomline: Oculus is more than your average cookie-cutter, unpredictably suspenseful, without revealing the mystery behind the ordeal. People who aren't familiar with Director Flanagan's formula in storytelling may find it a little alienating. But he has more to offer once he rolls up his sleeves and reach for his bag of tricks. Fearless comparison (on a personal note) this film shares a similar string, and is heir to 'The Shining'.",Oculus

The scene with bloody finger, and scars infected was so stupid, and don't want to talk about the girl that recording all like a documentary about the mirror and the stupid photos of his victims,a mom possessed against his children and the only she can do is hit the doors.And the end...

440,lukebreyley,Creepy but inconclusive,5,22 December 2014,"A creepy aura and a nice interplay between past and present makes this very watchable and the whole premise of the mirror is set up nicely, however while you begin to see a conclusion in the past story as more of the childhood is unraveled the present seems to drag on a little and after the original explanation of the mirror's ""possession"" there is relatively little reference to any understanding behind the mirror. Which means that there is a lack of substance of threat until about the last 20 minutes, yes it's creepy but the sense of imminent danger just really isn't there. Before the two time lines begin to interchange more frequently the only real tension is the interaction between the brother and sister but this is also found wanting. However it was watchable, despite the attempt at closure by intertwining the two endings the films conclusion was rather lacking and ultimately disappointing.",Oculus

But then I suppose I will be right just by chance every once in a while.

I can't say it's horrifying, not in my opinion at least, because I like the oldies horrors (think Wes Craven, Steven King). This movie messes with your mind. Not to say it wasn't good, it had jump scares, and did get me several times. It's between time periods, but only tells you once that it was in the past...so after that you're left guessing past or present, which is why some people may not like it- it can get confusing. It doesn't have massive amounts of graphic effects- I liked it none the less though, it didn't need them to carry itself.

446,MercilessRaven7,We had such high hopes for this movie.,2,12 April 2014,"Me and my horror movie buddy Jeremy saw the trailers for Oculus and it looked excellent and couldn't wait to go see it. However it turns out that the trailer is the best part of this movie.The story moves at a painfully slow pace and seems to be a rip off of several different movies. Basically it's the same plot as 1408 (which was an excellent horror movie by the way) using a mirror instead of a hotel room. They never actually go into why the mirror likes to manipulate and kill people, just that having it or being around it is bad news.You've got to do a little research so you'll understand WTF is going on before you watch it. Traditions, urban legends, old wives tails, silly bloody Mary stories, superstitions about ghosts and peoples souls being trapped in the mirrors when they die. All of it is relevant, none of it is made clear in the movie. Here is the most complete stockpile of information on haunted mirrors I found:http://www.hauntedamericatours.com/museum/hauntedmirrors.htmSo to get you stated, BING (or Google) ""Haunted Mirrors"". This will take you to several sites that will explain it. The movie will then make more sense.SPOILERS Also, if you intend to destroy a mirror in revenge for it killing your family after making everyone nuts, maybe don't charge it up and feed it first and give it the energy needs to fight back and kill you. Take a sledgehammer to it or drop it off a bridge in transit, or if it's influence is 30 feet, FINE get a riffle at 100 meters and blast away.

448,vanilladrpepper1,"Very good, beyond my expectations",10,27 April 2014,"The idea of a haunted mirror isn't typically that scary to me, especially Bloody Mary and things of that nature. That being said, I thought this movie was fantastic. The ""haunting"" of the mirror is never explained, which I like. I feel the unknown is more creepy than something that is fully shown with an explanation. You really don't need to know who the lady in the mirror is or why she's haunting it. The real gold in this movie is how the lady ""haunts"" people through the mirror. Psychological horror at its best. She gets inside a person's mind and makes them see what she wants. This plays with the viewer's mind throughout the film; you can never tell if something is actually happening or whether it is a product of the mirror. The story revolves around a brother and sister whose parents were murdered 11 years before. The police story is that a crazed father tortured and killed his wife before being shot and killed by his son. The boy, who was put in a mental institution, has recently been released and his sister (who's been raised in foster care) contacts him and tells him he must fulfill his promise to help her destroy the evil that lives within the antique mirror that used to hang in their childhood home. She believes that her mother and father were normal, happy people and that whatever is in the mirror killed them both. The sister has rented the mirror and brought it to their childhood home, along with a thorough set up of cameras, lights, timers, thermometers, etc and a full proof mechanism that will destroy the mirror should anything happen to them while trying to draw the evil out and kill it. The brother has gone through tons of therapy for the traumatic events from his childhood therefore doesn't believe his sister and tries to disprove her belief. He claims to have different memories than her which dispel the idea of anything supernatural having happened. She responds angrily to his denial and what ensues are a series of flashbacks from both siblings cleverly entwined with the present that tell the story of what really happened to their parents and simultaneously leads to the dramatic conclusion. The best part of this film is the uneasy feeling you get from never knowing whether anything is real or simply the evil playing with your mind. The plot is original; creepy camera angles only accentuate the exceptional performances from all actors, in particular the younger Kaytie. Definitely worth a watch, maybe two. Just remember that it's not a movie you can half watch or ""watch without thinking"". As long as you're paying attention it's easy to tell the difference present occurrences and flashbacks.",Oculus

If they had just cut out half of the scenes where they're children again this would not be a problem. Second of all, is anybody else p***ed off the brother was dragged back into a situation with the mirror ( which btw had no story to it, seems like a miss at something that could be very interesting) and then has to go to jail YET AGAIN? The siblings didn't even make any progress in destroying the mirror because the director was to busy showing scenes from their past!! The apple scene and the sisters death were both quite clever and are proof that this movie has a lot of potential, but it definitely did not live up to its reviews.

I'm a horror fanatic and pretty much see a lot of the horror movies that come to theaters. When I saw the trailer for this one I thought that it looked pretty decent but I should pretty much know by now that trailers really aren't the way to judge if a movie may be good or not. I have seen some pretty bad horror flicks, and like I said, one of the worst. So, let's get this straight, there's this mirror...And this mirror apparently makes people commit these tragic crimes. This sister works as some lady at an auctioneer place so she finally gets this mirror back that was in her childhood home. She wants to get it back so that she can ""end it once and for all"". She waits for the day her now 21-year-old brother gets out of a mental facility for apparently, as we find out later, murdering his father, just so she can make him do this strange experiment-type ritual thing with her. How charming. Anyways, I am not going to type the whole movie because that would be just a waste of my time AND yours. Everyone who peers into the mirror somehow becomes evil and has a scary look to them. Woah!I'm warning you. It's just insane. Glowing eyes. The only part of the movie I thought was scary was probably when the mom was chasing her children around the house after having looked into the mirror.The end of the movie is what really gets me. So, when they peer into this mirror, the brother and sister don't even know what's real and what isn't. The sister ends up accidentally killing her fiancé, the brother ends up accidentally killing his sister, and now he has to go back right where he came from. And, of course, the mirror is still out there, forever. And no one believes him at all, because of course, this is the second time it has happened. Just, no. Please. SAVE YOURSELVES.",Oculus

The main reason I went to this movie was to take my Four very bad children to get the sh*t scared out of them, and it somewhat achieved that. But for most people who enjoy ""scary"" movies, this is pretty close to the bottom of the barrel.

If I'm able to sit home alone with the lights off after a horror film, it didn't do it for me and this one is one of those.

456,bloodheap,An interesting movie with a few glaring flaws,5,17 April 2014,"I have to admit that I received pretty much what I expected when I entered the theater to watch Oculus. A supernatural thriller about a possessed mirror that murders people. I actually liked the movie for the most part. It really does set up a rather creepy atmosphere and while the occasional scare does happen it is nowhere near as frightening as watching the family unit degrade and eventually self destruct as the parents fall under the influence of the mirror. A large part of the movie is how the mirror's influence warps reality and makes you see and hear things that are not really there. At this time I still do not know if a certain character who is killed near the end of the movie was actually killed or if it was just the mirror's influence. The mirror does manipulate the entire event and hints are given that it actually did happen but I still do not know if it did or not. One of the more interesting parts of the movie to me is how the brother was essentially brainwashed by his doctors into believing all of the supernatural horror's that he observed were just a safety device created by his brain to protect him from the true horror of what happened to his parents. A major part of the movie is the sister's desperate attempt to make her brother accept the truth of what really happened.In the end though, the biggest problem for me is the ending. Yes, it is foreshadowed several times in the movie which is why it loses it's impact quite a bit. Basically, no one can physically break the mirror because when anyone does try the mirror's influence stops them. We see several examples of this in the movie, so the sister devises a fail safe device that will break the mirror if they are not alive to reset the timer on the device every 30 minutes. A slight spoiler does follow: we see the mirror get cracked when someone falls against the bottom of the mirror frame, so it is obviously very fragile. With that being said, what eventually happens in the climax of the film should have broken the mirror into tiny pieces. I can't understand why no one else has pointed this massive flaw in the movie out yet. Needless to say the ending really all but ruined the movie for me. This might make for a decent rental with someone who scares easily, otherwise I have a hard time recommending it.",Oculus

But not clearly telling about the cursed or haunted mirror. :( But, it's kinda hanging in the end. Because it didn't tell about the mirror more. I hope they make the sequel for this movie.

458,dexteroses,"I guess, I would say, it was decent.",7,20 April 2014,"To start out with, the director did indeed do a great job when it came to parts that should have scared me or creeped me out. It's just that, some parts were not realistic enough. For example, when someone was stabbed or when a character's flesh was basically being torn apart, the blood could have been delayed for a tad bit just to make it look and feel more real. For the most part though, I actually enjoyed the constant flashbacks too since it really kept me interested in the movie; it's just that, in my opinion, at one point there were just too many flashbacks. There were so many that it basically became irritating. The ending though, the ending could have been better. Seriously, it would not be hard to twist the ending just a little and make it a good ending. I mean, those Apple computer screens were there, seeing as IT could not have gotten that much life force from the little amount of plants and the escaped dog, the amount of power it could sustain giving both of the main characters illusions would not have given it the time to also mess around with the cameras. One look at the screen would have changed everything, but no. Just because they want a 'part two' as every other horror movie, the ending just HAD to be like how it was. Anywho, I would have only given this movie a rating of 5 points, but because they did such a good job of scaring me and making me paranoid for the rest of the night, I gave the movie two extra points.",Oculus
459,claire-reynolds17,Great Psychological Thriller,9,30 April 2014,I personally thought this movie was great especially with the way it was filmed. It constantly flashed back in time and back to the present which really added to the suspense of the movie. I really liked that you could never actually know for sure where they were and what exactly they were doing. The director also did a great job releasing information as it seemed fit so the audience could fit the pieces of the puzzle together and make judgements on what was really happening.

461,xphiex,Review of Oculus,6,30 May 2014,"Oculus is the heavily anticipated horror movie of 2014 staring people such as Karen Gillan (Doctor Who) and Brenton Thwaites (Maleficent). To say that I had great expectations for the movie is an understatement. Having reached a rating of 6,9 from IMDb's picky users and a total rating of 70% on Rotten Tomato I expect Oculus to be no less than fantastic. I wouldn't say I was particularly disappointed, but the movie was not quite as grand as I had expected. In comparison to horror movies such as 'Children of the Corn V' and 'Paranormal Activity' it is in no doubt much better. My general feelings about horror movies is that they often rely on gore and background music to do all the work for them and combined with shitty camera-work and acting, horror is only something I only watch when I'm feeling particularly uncreative or have to challenge myself. With that being said I surprisingly really liked Oculus. The plot was surprisingly well-made and it seemed as though it had actually been a priority to make a real, substantial plot for this movie instead of just having a lot of freaky, supernatural stuff happen and then think that that will make the movie worth watching (I'm looking at you, Paranormal Activity). The movie centers around Kaylie Russell and her brother Tim and of course the dreaded mirror. Throughout the whole movie we keep shifting between now and when Kaylie and Tim where kids. Because as kids their father bought the mirror to hang in their new house and, not very surprisingly, the mirror starts making their mother and father go crazy and their father tortures and kills their mother. While not being any surprise at all and basically very cliché for a horror movie it was all so well-done, that you mostly forget that you totally know what's going to happen. The one thing that surprised me though was how the mirror didn't seem to affect the kids. While the mother, father and dog go crazy, plants die and other weird stuff happens nothing seems to actually happen to the kids - they're just scared because everyone else are acting weird - what's up with that? That little possible flaw aside, as we move further in the plot we find out that Tim killed the kids' father after he had killed their mother. That was presumably why the boy was sent to a mental hospital to live until the age of 21. All of this we find out while simultaneously watching the present where Kaylie has convinced Tim to help her try and 'kill the mirror'. She has taken a lot of precautions - cameras with their own power-supply, kitchen timers to remind them to hydrate and eat ever so often and having her fiancé call every hour to make sure that she is okay. Aside from that she has also installed a big knife-thing in the ceiling which will drop every hour unless they prevent it from doing so, effectively smashing in to the mirror. Now, as a viewer you might think 'why don't they just smash the mirror'? But as we see throughout the movie Kaylie has an answer for everything. The simply can't. The mirror has some way of protecting itself and when trying to smash it they never actually hit the mirror. Spooky. This is where the plot gets a bit flawed. Because as the present continues I find myself thinking 'Well Get on with it', because despite Kaylie's constant talking about having to kill the mirror and prove her brother innocent, what they do most of the movie is just running around letting the mirror play tricks on them. I fail to see what they hope to achieve by doing this seeing as they are not killing the mirror but simply feeding it. The movie does culminate in trying to kill the mirror though, when Tim releases the big knife-thing and lets it smash in to the mirror. Except it doesn't. The mirror has made sure that Tim could somehow not see Kaylie standing in front of it, thus releasing the knife on Kaylie resulting in her death. In the end Tim is being hauled away by policemen screaming about the mirror, leaving the ending very open for a sequel.While the plot wasn't very original it was well thought out and well conducted. The performances which shone through were not those of either Karen Gillan or Brenton Thwaites but instead those of the kids, Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan. Especially young Annalise Basso surprised and showed off her massive skills. These kids no doubt have a big career in front of them. The rest of the acting wasn't spectacular. It wasn't bad either but it was nothing special maybe except for Katee Sackhoff, when she played the entirely crazed-out mother.Another plus about the movie was the filming. A thing I see often in horror, thriller and that kind of movies is really sucky camera-work as if that would make the movie scarier - the only scary thing is how horrendously bad the camera-work itself is. But with Oculus the crew has seemed to throw out the idea that bad camera-work is good camera-work and actually filmed something decent. It makes the movie much easier to watch when you don't have to cringe every other second because of particularly bad camera-work.Director Mike Flanagan sure did a good job and writers Mike Flanagan, Jeff Howard and Jeff Seidman deserve most of the praise for the movie. All in all I have decided to give it 6 out of 10 stars with the predictability, un-originality and lack of 'that special something that makes a movie really great' dragging it down. Oculus can definitely be recommended for a lazy Saturday night.",Oculus

There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie AT ALL. Who do they ask to review these movies, twelve year olds? You go halfway through the movie without anyone getting killed, yeah you see pictures of dead bodies but thats it. Seriously, i've seen scarier movies on the lifetime network. If anyone rates this more than a 3, you would probably die of a heart attack from watching a REALLY scary movie like gremlins.

463,phil-35-335627,An awesome film that kept my blood pressure up the whole time!,9,23 June 2014,"Oculus is a nail biting thrill ride which artfully takes us on a complex journey of the two main characters and it charts how their lives have morosely ended up at this salient moment in time. We are frequently taken back to the past and brought back to the present with an ease that defines the characters and the film. There is little in the way of location and this adds to the desperation of the characters as they live out their lives constrained by an evil power. The whole cast are exceptional and their performance draws you deeper and deeper into the film, and has you mentally willing to help these poor souls in anyway you can. The direction and script are outstanding and intelligent without being all smart ass! An excellent movie and a must for movie fans who enjoy losing themselves in film.",Oculus
464,mitchintheworld,Rebel Mirrior without a Cause,2,9 July 2014,"Truly great acting, wonderful script right up to the last page. It's one of those stories done by a writer who wants to make a big finish and leave the viewer wowed but forgets to include the wow. The pacing is nicely frantic and complicated enough to require the viewer to pay attention. The acting escalates as it should. The plot peaks and then unfortunately plateaus. The script would have benefited from some other input than the isolated writer. There is no triumph over evil or improvement, no proving of nerves, or a nice chance to show one's bravery. It just ends with bitter defeat. The first 3/4ths of this story zing. It's a journey into adulthood and then we throw all that in the trashcan in the last three minutes. Kudos to the actors. They made absolutely the most of truly difficult dialog and scenes, set great pacing. The writer let them down.",Oculus

Looking back, I'm so glad I chose to watch this film! I'm a huge fan of mind-f*** movies (Fight Club, Inception) and that's exactly what this film is. The ending is a huge ""Mind=Blown"" moment, and does in fact leave room for a second movie. It has it's scary parts, and it's suspenseful parts, but manages to bring it back to chilling every time. This certainly isn't a screaming movie, though- honestly, films rarely are.

Then once it got to where it should of been scary it was horrible and very confusing. The illusion of the mind did not work in this movie because there was way to much flipping around between past and present. The movie also doesn't give you any idea to who is who or what is what. Ending to the movie was terrible. I would of took a little more time writing the screen play. This movie had potential. It could have been a great horror movie that was made legendary. The writer and director is horrible and I will never watch one of his movies again.,Oculus

I thank Mike Flanagan for blessing us all with this here art. I rate it 10/10! Before I took the time to watch this movie, I heard so many bad reviews. After watching it, I have no idea what was not to like about this movie. In my opinion, it was near perfect. This movie had all of the things I want out of my scary movies.

471,jburlew-183-429035,stunk like a skunk,1,11 December 2014,"This movie is not only frustrating, but continues in the cheap horror category to rely on characters with sub-zero IQ. Acting wasn't bad, but plot was so agonizingly reliant on stupidity that I was left frustrated. This is a great attempt at horror by a blossoming writer, but fell far short of frightening, interesting, or satisfying. It should be noted that due to a ten line minimum for reviews, I must go into painful detail about how this movie fails to live up to horror movie expectations (including attempts to understand why stupidity plays such a role in modern attempts to be frightening). This film and a few others like it (scream, freddy versus jason, mercy) utilize protagonists that couldn't wipe their own butts without directions. How on earth can a movie be frightening if you're constantly imagining the character's demise by their own hand in a fashion that would make Charles Darwin shudder at the state of modern man's genetics? If you are looking for a horror movie that won't leave you unsatisfied, and represents a similar horror feel, go watch Babadook. The characters in this movie never grow up from their childhood, and I've met 2nd graders who would have ended this story in about thirty minutes because a single original and useful thought would have done the trick.",Oculus
472,abemuriel,So real...,10,1 January 2015,"This film is so scary to me for a simple reason : everything could be real! I've seen things about haunted objects, I know that mirrors keep informations of the past, and that people can be driven crazy without knowing what makes them act strangely. There are stories about old artifacts and entities, whispers and mind-control. I used to believe it was just a fantasy, until I experienced something weird with old furniture. The mirror chosen for Oculus is so creepy, like a door opening on another world. And that is also something that truly exists. Can you believe me ?

This writer of this story should seriously consider another job, like cleaning toilets. The hard thing is that the story was good, and had everything to end up as an awesome movie, but somehow the dude who wrote it managed to screw up in the end. I think they shouldn't let people with mental disorders write stories like that, as they may have a devastating effect on weaker minds, especially of those who already experience a tendency to depression. WHAT SURPRISES ME IS THAT THE AUDIENCE GIVES SO MANY STARS TO THIS PIECE OF JUNK, what fooled me into watching it. Totally misleading.",Oculus

So I would recommend that you should go in with the expectation of this movie as equal parts suspense and psychological thriller, a partial mystery with a dash of drama and a smidge of horror.If you are looking for a stereotypical gory horror where the body count is endless and each paper cut bleeds the volume of three entire bodies then this is not the movie for you. There is no sex, nudity, gore, gallons of blood or constant dismemberment, but, if you are looking for a movie where your intelligence is catered for and the only sex and dismemberment is your brain being mindf***ed all over the walls then rest assured this movie comes highly recommended. Spectacularly written and directed, and I applaud all the actors for their outstanding efforts that really tip the scales, initially I was apprehensive at the choice of cast but upon finishing this movie I could not imagine any other actors for those parts.",Oculus

Why this has a 7 rating is beyond me.Maybe the last 5 minutes is spectacular, but I'd never subject myself to such an awful movie for the first 2 hours ever again.

479,mulockdelaney,Never Judge A Book By It's Cover,4,1 October 2015,"They say never judge a book by its cover, and boy were they right. The cover art for the movie Oculus was the scariest thing about this film. Based on short film by the same title, Oculus is about an antique mirror that has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people including the parents of Kaylie and Tim Russell (Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites), the main characters in this film. After their parents' deaths Kaylie was sent to live with foster parents and Tim was sent to a mental institution because he claimed the mirror was possessed. Now as adults, Kylie and Tim are reunited to prove the mirror caused their parents' deaths and destroy this evil once and for all. The premise of the story may sound very exciting and it was in the original, fast paced, thirty-two minute version; unfortunately, the ninety minute expanded version failed to deliver any real entertainment. At first, the movie started out very slowly, but I kept watching because most horror movies tend to start off that way, but after about thirty minutes, I started to wonder when the excitement was going to start. The extended film really ended up being ninety minutes of continual build up and no a climax. Throughout the film we see little bits and pieces of the demons that came out of the mirror, such as the mysterious women in the father's office or the mirror turning Kaylie's apple into a light bulb. However, there was never really any confrontation with Gillan's character. I believe once the directors realized they only had about thirty minutes of useful storyline, they decided to add scenes that included long and confusing flashbacks of when the mirror possessed the family. While some (not all) of these scene were important to the story, it seemed like most of the flashbacks were just being used to take up screen time, and never truly answered all of my questions. In most films, a seamless transition from a scene to a flashback is applauded; however, in Oculus, the transition was so smooth I could not even tell that there was a time jump. Some of the flashbacks included both past and present day characters, and at one point it even appeared that Tim could see his younger self, so it was hard to tell if the scene was a flashback of the family, or a vision the mirror wanted them to see. What I considered even worse than the confusing and ineffective flashback scenes was the fact that it was not scary. The whole purpose of the horror genre is to keep the audience on their toes; unfortunately, Oculus didn't even try to make me jump. The whole premise of the movie surrounds the, not so scary, powers of the mirror; however, the idea of an indestructible mirror that will kill you if you try to break it, is so ridiculous that it is almost comical. Throughout the movie I found myself shouting out ideas on how to break the mirror without being directly responsible, but like any horror movie spoof, they couldn't see the obvious answer. Oculus turned out to be just another ""by the book"" horror movie, but they forgot to put in a scare factor. There is a reason this movie came out on Netflix so quickly after its release date and that is because people shouldn't bother spending their money to go see it.",Oculus

It could have been so much better, like, the sister could have been the one imagining all this, and we'd have seen her inside an asylm at the end, having gone crazy after trying to ""kill"" the mirror, or even since she was a child, no having been able to cope with her whole family's death, imagining her brother actually being still alove nowdays... And so forth, the possibilities are endless, but dying like this? Too easy for a movie that was kinda good up unti the end.I wish we'd been given more details about the why's and how's of the mirror's killings, origins (I mean the occult origins, not the historical ones that were pretty much given to us in one go at the beginning of the movie)
It was sometimes too fast paced and sometimes the total opposite.As I said, It definitely could have been much better since the actors were pretty good and the scenario was a good one. Oh and to the people wondering who the ""lady from the office"" was, it's simply an illusion / ghost of the woman who died years prior due to a miscarriage/botched abortion, she's briefly mentionned at the beginning in the list of casualties caused by the mirror.",Oculus
482,moviebattle,Good movie but a weak Horror,6,5 September 2018,"This Paranormal / psychological thriller was very interesting With some very high points and kept its lows to a minimum. If you take the basic approach to this plot its sounds all to generically cliché. A family moves into a new home, They get a mysterious object in this case a very beautiful antique mirror. With this new object odd things start happening small stuff at first plants die and animals start acting up and eventually go missing. Till you start seeing things like people and other entities in the house. The adults start acting odd and they climax to a very Amityville/ shining like way. As I said very generic but this movie is anything but generic. It is and does all the things I just described but presents it in a very interesting way. The movie plays with the idea of memories and what we believe happens to what really happened. It is also presented in a very interesting way moving the timeline back and forth from the past to the present repeatedly until that even gets blurred . The entity in the mirror even manipulates the perceptive reality of the family in a cool new first person kind of way. Even though this is the same old same old this movie is actually very creative the editing was a huge win for the movie. The acting in the movie was ok not bad by any means but also no one had a break out performance in this. The score was unremarkable it did it job with suspense and breaks and jumps but don't think it is iconic score at all. As far as a horror movie it has low in kills low in gore the jumps scares were not great and it wasn't all that scary. To me it's all about the story and the subject it is trying to look at that make this a win in the genre and the editing executed on every level.Horror score
