0,Leofwine_draca,"Superficially entertaining, but highly derivative and unoriginal",5,10 July 2016,"This film starts off with an adequate plot, concerning suspicious events at a local high school. Halfway through, however, it loses all direction and momentum and simply becomes a roller coaster ride of increasingly bigger and better special effects, starting off with a tiny little alien creature to a huge, slimy monster. The obvious inspiration for the film is INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (which is repeatedly referenced, somewhat cheekily), but THE FACULTY is a lot less powerful than that masterpiece.The full implications of the alien take over are rarely hinted at, and put aside in favour of in-your-face shocks and thrills, which dampens the impact a lot. The killing blow, though, is the ending, a huge letdown. Compare this to the starkly powerful and horrific ending of the 1978 version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and you'll see that there is simply no match. THE FACULTY is nothing more than moving wallpaper, something to look at while you're eating your dinner. Similar to reading a glossy magazine, all style and not much substance. It can hardly be called a horror film at all really, but then again these days film makers seem to have forgotten what horror actually means; they confuse it with blood and guts and gory effects.I did like the little alien in the fish tank. I thought the special effect was very good indeed, and the first time you saw it, it was also very impressive. After the first couple of times though the novelty wore off and we'd grown used to the special effects, even if they did become more and more outlandish. The ending was also fun, with the fight against the big tentacled monster, even though it may have been cheesy and it may have been clichéd and unlikely. There were a lot of clever minor things throughout the film, it's just a shame they couldn't have put them together to make something cleverer as a whole. But what can you expect from Kevin Williamson? I didn't like the incessant swearing at all. There didn't seem to be much dialogue in this film, it was thrown aside to pave the way for a number of expletives. I also thought it was pretty stupid the way the film makers decided to have a naked girl in but then they were too scared to show her completely naked. I didn't think much of the child actors and actresses, who were typically mundane and boring, the outsiders we're over familiar of from all of the other mind numbing horror films which have been coming out these recent years.There are a few interesting actors amid the teaching group, namely Piper Laurie and Robert Patrick, the liquid metal man who is always sinister in any film he's in. Patrick was a good reason for me for watching this, I just wish he could have played a bigger part. I hated the glossy, DAWSON'S CREEK style of the film. I hated the self-referencing of Spielberg and other film makers (and even Neve Campbell, how original). I detested the stupid jump scares which weren't scary. And all of the other clichéd stuff (such as the alien slugs moving under the face from THE X-FILES. The finger cutting scene from THE BURNING. The head with tentacles from THE THING. The shadowy-jump scares from HALLOWEEN). But that's enough of me complaining. It is mildly refreshing to see a monster movie instead of having a maniac on the loose with a razor-sharp weapon. Just don't expect much more than something at a superficial level.",The Faculty
1,SnoopyStyle,Pretty good with some problems,7,19 October 2013,"Six disparate teens must prevent an alien species from taking over their high school and probably the world. Jordana Brewster is the bitchy queen bee Delilah Profitt. Clea DuVall is the weird loner Stokes Mitchell. Laura Harris is the newcomer Marybeth Hutchinson. Josh Hartnett is the genius drug dealing Zeke Tyler. Shawn Hatosy is the star quarterback Stan Rosado. Elijah Wood is the geeky Casey Connor.Writer Kevin Williamson has written a knowing script of witty smart teens. Then director Robert Rodriguez adds his sense of action. Both of them have combine to create a smarter than average body snatching movie. Still I have a couple of problems.First they show their hand too early. The first section with the teachers is just unnecessary. It'd be better to have the audience question if there was an actual problem. Also it'd be better to start with the kids since they're the lead characters.Second the logic of the twist doesn't make sense. If the aliens can be wipe out by killing the queen, she should be much better protected. And the fact that we know neither Bebe Neuwirth nor Robert Patrick is the first alien. It makes those encounters less compelling because we know for sure they're not the queen.There is still much good here. It has many memorable elements that Kevin Williamson and Robert Rodriguez have piece together. They've got good actors playing all the different teen types. It's a horror from people who've watched a lot of horror.",The Faculty
2,claudio_carvalho,They Are Taking Over the World through the Back Door,7,18 March 2015,"On the Harrington High School in Ohio, the newcomer Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Laura Harris) tries to befriend the outcast Stokely 'Stokes' Mitchell (Clea DuVall). The quarterback Stan Rosado (Shawn Hatosy) quits the football team and breaks off with his girlfriend Delilah Profitt (Jordana Brewster), who is the editor of the school newspaper and head cheerleader. Zeke Tyler (Josh Hartnett), who is repeating the senior year and sells drugs to the other students, has an argument with his teacher Elizabeth Burke (Famke Janssen). When the bullied Casey Connor (Elijah Wood) finds a weird being on the football field, he brings it to his Professor Edward Furlong (Jon Stewart) that finds that the unknown specimen lives in the water and has the ability of replicating. Later, Delilah brings Casey, who is the photographer of the newspaper and has a crush on her, to the faculty room to snoop around and find any evidence for a story, they need to hide in a closet when Coach Joe Willis (Robert Patrick) and the teacher Karen Olson (Piper Laurie) arrive. Delilah and Casey witness the coach and the teacher attacking Nurse Rosa Harper (Salma Hayek) and they stumble with the corpse of Mrs. Jessica Brummel (Susan Willis), who has recently died, in the closet. They call the police but are discredited by Principal Valerie Drake (Bebe Neuwirth). On the next morning, Casey discloses to Delilah, Stokely and Stan that he believes that aliens are taking over the planet through their high school. Zeke and Marybeth overhear the conversation and join the group. Further they discover that the aliens need water to survive and Zeke's drug is diuretic and kills them. But the problem is who can be trusted in the group?""The Faculty"" is a great sci-fi with a tribute to the classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". I saw this movie for the first time in the late 90's and yesterday I saw it again on DVD and it is impressive the cast joined by Robert Rodriguez in this film. The plot is mysterious, entertaining and well resolved and also supported by an excellent soundtrack. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Prova Final"" (""Final Test"")Note: On 18 Aug 2020, I saw this film again.",The Faculty
3,kosmasp,The Faculty Thing Snatcher,8,3 February 2021,"Why not take notes from Horror movie classics and bring them into a teenage world, with teenage angst and terror - aka school. And if you do that, why not have a cast that will be looked back to as stellar to say the least? I don't know how much luck one can have with the casting or how Robert Rodriguez essembled such a great group of people. Be it on the teacher side or on the pupils side of things.This may have classic horror and science fiction elements to it, but it also is clearly a 90s movie too. This throws as many twists your way as you can handle. Not to mention enough jump scares to get a dead heart beating again ... and I'm saying this not in a bad way. Other movies have issues with those tropes, but they work with this one quite well. And it's the script on the one hand, the direction on the other ... and of course that cast. Have I mentioned the actors yet? Kidding aside, the effects may have aged badly in some respects, but they are still ok all things considering.",The Faculty
4,gavin6942,Very Much 1990s,7,30 September 2015,"Students suspect that their teachers are aliens after bizarre occurrences.This is very much a film of the 1990s, especially the second half. That same teen horror subgenre that ""Scream"" mastered and ""Disturbing Behavior"" did well. Get a mix of teen idols, add a soundtrack, and boom, you have a film. This is no exception, with some of the biggest names of the time on the screen (now, about fifteen years later, it is interesting to see who is big and who is forgotten).As far as being a ""body snatcher"" movie, it is pretty good. It is obviously aware of its past, as it overtly makes reference. But it also tries to steer clear of being a copy. Some references to past films are over the top, such as naming a character Edward Furlong. Really? Although not one of Robert Rodriguez's best films, it is still a nice trip down nostalgia lane. And it is probably not his worst (it may be time to stop with the ""Spy Kids"" and ""Machete"" sequels).",The Faculty
5,jboothmillard,The Faculty,5,24 April 2006,"From writer Kevin Williamson (Dawson's Creek, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer) and director Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids, Sin City), I may have seen this film once before, but I guess I didn't pay full attention, as I didn't recognise any of it, so I'm glad I watched properly. Basically at small town Herrington High School in Ohio strange things are happening to the faculty teaching staff, one or two of them have become almost emotionless in attitude and demeanour. Casey Connor (Elijah Wood) in his science class one day finds a new strange insect like creature, and the teacher says it is a new form of life, this comes into play later. It is after he and his friend Delilah Profitt (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning's Jordana Brewster) hiding witness two of the teachers who have been acting strangely murder Nurse Rosa Harper (Salma Hayek) by strangulation that they know something is going on, especially when she comes back to life. Casey works out that it is not just the teachers, but also many of the students that are part of this thing going on, and eventually they realise that it is to do with the weird creature they found, it is multiplying and taking over the minds of those who come near it. So now Casey, Stokely 'Stokes' Mitchell (Clea DuVall), Zeke Tyler (Josh Hartnett), Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Severance's Laura Harris) and Stan Rosado (The Cooler's Shawn Hatosy) are trying to find a way to fight and eliminate the alien infection. The teachers infected by the phenomenon include Principal Valerie Drake (Jumanji's Bebe Neuwirth), Coach Joe Willis (Robert Patrick), Miss Elizabeth Burke (GoldenEye's Famke Janssen) and Mrs. Karen Olson (Carrie's Piper Laurie), and they are all aware the teenagers are suspicious. The way to stop it is to kill the queen, and using a mixture they created that the alien parasites resist the search begins to find the queen, it turns out to be the last person you would expect, but the aliens are stopped in the end. Also starring Usher Raymond as Gabe Santora, Jon Stewart as Prof. Edward Furlong and Daniel Von Bargen as Mr. John Tate. The cast of both young rising teenage stars and older established stars do pretty well, the script is witty and amusing, and the alien invasion concept is interesting with creatures doing mind control, I agree the special effects are dodgy, but it doesn't matter, it is a fun science-fiction horror thriller. Worth watching!",The Faculty
6,BA_Harrison,Today's lesson: kicking alien ass.,8,2 March 2012,"Originality is not The Faculty's strongest suit, the basic plot being a reworking of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers (with a touch of Night of the Creeps and The Thing chucked in for good measure), its characters your typical high-school movie stereotypes (The Jock, The Nerd, The Outcast, The Stoner, The Head Cheerleader, The Hard-ass Coach, The Tough Principal etcetera etcetera.) and even the movie poster displaying very little imagination.But although this kind of thing has been done many, many times before, the film still proves to be hugely entertaining thanks to a sharp script by Kevin Williamson, assured direction by Robert Rodriguez, great special effects (particularly the practical MUFX by KNB), and a cool cast including Bebe Neuwirth (40 and fabulous), Jordana Brewster, Salma Hayek, Elijah Wood, Robert Patrick, Clea DuVall, Famke Janssen (hubba, hubba), Usher, Laura Harris (naked!) and Piper Laurie. Hell, even Josh Hartnett and his bad hair didn't rankle me that much, which is a change.The movie opens brilliantly with an amazingly tense scene (Williamson having had prior experience in writing such scary openings with Scream and Scream 2), and the excitement continues unabated until the spectacular finale which features one hell of a cool monster, a Cthulu style alien with lots of gnarly teeth and thrashing tentacles. Along the way, Salma, Famke, and Bebe get all sexed up, Josh gets all macho with a makeshift machete, Elijah takes drugs, and Harry Knowles hoists his fat ass out of his armchair for a pointless cameo. It all adds up to a whole heap of fun.",The Faculty
7,Quinoa1984,"neither director or writer's best work, but it's got a good riff on its repeated subject matter",7,2 September 2006,"From the get-go one can figure the Robert Rodriguez directed film of Kevin (Scream) Williamson's The Faculty is like Invasion of the Body Snatchers given a dose of full-blown 90s High School horror movie without it being too compromised. I can't compare to how it might hold up to die-hard fans of the original 50s film, but The Faculty earns its keep as a pretty decent thrill machine by putting up some good characters to sink into. What struck me more though than the characters- even through some notable turns from its main teen cast (Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Clea Duvall, Shawn Hatosy and Jordanna Brewster) and choice teacher bit parts (Jon Stewart, Salma Hayek, Christopher McDonald)- is Rodriguez's fun with the material. The first chase/action scene puts everything into context. And once the developments in the story become fairly familiar- albeit with some occasionally clever if a little easy- points made about the robotic, submissive nature of high school, the gears can kick in with the style. The premise itself could come in any form, even a Goosebumps book. But given a similar need to put some gore and violence and abandon with the context of the real action and suspense (including an extra creepy, twisty-as-Williamson-does last ten minutes) Rodriguez makes it a good attempt after his classic From Dusk Till Dawn. Exploitive, sure, and with some of the bits that aren't totally strong. Even a performance or two can become irksome. But it's a worthy enough B-movie in the guise of something much more in the Scream vein then one might expect. It's smart about what's its doing somehow, and it makes a fine, Dimension-movie style attempt to go into the sci-fi social consciousness that was originally begotten with Siegel's film.",The Faculty
8,edwagreen,You Can Lose Your Faculties With This...Worst Ever 0*,1,9 January 2012,"Truly dreadful film where the faculty at an Ohio High School seems to have been taken over by aliens. They're acting mysteriously and the dead from among them are waking up.6 teenagers try to stop this rampage and impending doom. However, the problem is that among them, one is an alien who is creating all the mayhem and resulting damage.Despite an impressive cast, the film is awful since the writing just plain stinks.Our teens are reduced to taking drugs from one of them, a drug dealer. This will invariably prove who among them is an alien. This is absolutely ridiculous, inane and an insult to watch.",The Faculty
9,wes-connors,There's a Monster in My Class,6,20 September 2008,"Six stereotypically diverse Ohio high school students suspect their teachers are being replaced by an invasion of parasitical body-snatchers! Their assumption proves to be correct; and, soon, the high school is crawling with alien body-seeking creatures! The starring teenagers are: nerdy geek Elijah Wood (as Casey), outcast lesbian Clea DuVall (as Stokely), sexy cheerleader Jordana Brewster (as Delilah), football jock Shawn Hotosy (as Stan), nubile newby Laura Harris (as Marybeth), and rebel stoner Josh Hartnett (as Zeke). Their mission becomes discovering, and destroying, the Queen of the ear-invading slugs.I saw this film shortly after its original release, and was able to enjoy it again, recently. Perhaps I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention, originally; because, I didn't experience the certainty of déjà vu until the scene where the six students are in Mr. Hartnett's home lab, wondering of one of them might be ""infected"". This scene highlights the good characterizations, writing (Kevin Williamson), and direction (Robert Rodriguez) in ""The Faculty"". The script has some wit, the cast is great, and the story moves; though, it doesn't really achieve the above ordinary status obviously intended -- it's no ""Scream"".Of the adults, coach Robert Patrick is the main villain; he and the other adults play their roles with a good amount of creepy teacher edginess. Science professor Jon Stewart is a treat. Usher has a small, non-singing role. The ""kids"" don't look too, too old to pass for high school seniors; but, a college setting might have been more interesting, and believable. Neglected genius Hartnett, who is repeating the twelfth grade, and Ms. DuVall give the younger stand-out characterizations. DuVall's character is introduced as a lesbian, but, don't get your hopes up; she's only pretending (wtf?).****** The Faculty (1998) Robert Rodriguez ~ Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Clea DuVall",The Faculty
10,BandSAboutMovies,Simultaneously commercial and anti-commercial,5,2 September 2020,"David Wechter (The Malibu Bikini Shop, Midnight Madness) and Bruce Kimmel (The Creature Wasn't Nice) wrote their first draft of this film eight years before it was made. The success of Scream led to Miramax bringing Kevin Williamson on board to rewrite the dialogue and Robert Rodriguez to direct.The result is a very hip for the 90's remix of Invasion of the Body Snatchers that stars plenty of gorgeous teen actors like Elijah Wood, Usher, Josh Hartnett, Clea Duvall and Jordana Brewster.The teachers are all taken over by the time the movie begins. Coach Joe (Robert Patrick), Miss Burke (Famke Janssen), Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth), Mrs. Olson (Piper Laurie), Mr. Fulong (Jon Stewart) and even Nurse Harper (Salma Hayek) are all soon transformed into the carriers of a ""cephalopod-specific parasite called a mesozoan.""Becca remembers that when this movie came out that it was part of a Tommy Hilfinger promotion, even featuring a character named Venus who was only in the commercials and the clothing promos. Whatever it takes to get your movie made.There's also a scene that's a homage to Carpenter's The Thing, but this time involving doing drugs. Another interesting thing is that each of the teens has a counterpart in The Breakfast Club. Stan (Shawn Hatosy) is Emilio Estevez's jock character Andrew Clark, Delilah (Brewster) is Molly Ringwald's Claire Standish, Zeke (Hartnett) is Judd Nelson's John Bender, Stokes (DuVall) is Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds and Casey is obviously Anthony Michael Hall's Brian Johnson.

11,Coventry,Drugs are the answer...,8,25 July 2004,"Behold: The most outstanding screenplay that ever came out of Kevin Williamson's pen! The scriptwriter of meaningless, new age horror nonsense like `Scream' and `I know what you did last Summer' pleasantly surprises here with a clever and lively sci-fi plot, filled with homage to the all-time genre classics. The Faculty unites a group of typical high-school outcasts in their battle againstaliens. Extraterrestrial Intelligence invaded the modest Ohio lifestyle and takes over, starting with the Herrington High teaching staff. The unfriendly ET's are like the pod-people in `Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and can only be killed by drugs, which dehydrates their water-filled bodies. The film is a terrific spitfire of typical high-school jokes and situations, and it's very funny because of the `Breakfast Club'-like characters. They're all there! The geek (Wood in his pre-Hobbit era), the head cheerleader (Brewster), the jock (Hatosy), the scum with intellect-potential (great role by Hartnett), the anti-social goth (DuVall) and the new kid in town (Laura Harris). Other than the young stars, the cast is filled with brilliant B-actors who all clearly had fun playing their roles. Christopher MacDonald, Piper Laurie, Robert Patricktoo many to name! A lot of the film's quality certainly depends on the class-direction of Rodriguez. He creates a light-hearted surrounding and slowly builds up tension without the viewer really realizes it.

13,hitchcockthelegend,Body Snatchers was just a made up story...,7,18 January 2010,"Herrington High School, just your everyday place of learning. That is until the teachers start behaving strangely. It seems there is an alien plot to take over the world and only a rag-tag group of students can save us!When you pair Robert Rodriguez (director) and Kevin Williamson (writer) what sort of movie do you really think you are going to get? Well the answer is The Faculty, which in all honesty holds absolutely no surprises for anyone familiar with the guys who gave us From Dusk Till Dawn & Scream respectively. That's not to say that The Faculty isn't a fun horror/sci-fi film, because it absolutely is, it's just should be noted that The Faculty is all that it can be as regards the makers and the nature of the genre beast.The film has rightly been tagged as a cross between Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and any teen led Highschool movie (you can add Invaders From Mars in the mix too), this is intentional, something that's apparent since our intrepid students discuss ""Snatchers"" amongst other movie references, and one of them, Stokely (Clea Duval), is a sci-fi aficionado . As things progress it's also evident that the makers here are movie fans making a movie for movie fans, all be it one aimed solely at the teenage demographic. There's much satire around and cliché's are widely embraced, but again it works because there is no hidden agenda. There's gore and hugely effective scenes involving blood, slugs, heads and an eyeball, whilst slasher fans are catered for in a couple of - if seemingly pointless as regards the alien's intentions - memorable scenes.The youngsters in the cast, all purposely playing total stereotypes, all do what is required, with Josh Hartnett, Duval & Elijah Wood particularly shining. Yet it's with the adult actors that The Faculty really gains its tongue in cheek momentum. Robert Patrick, Famke Jansen, Salma Hayek, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth and even Jon Stewart all file in for a bit of alien parasitical fun. Come the end of the mania, with the staple alien queen reveal and showdown, there's the overriding feeling that the film could have been so much more. Certainly it's guilty of being a touch too derivative, where a little focus has been lost in the self referential and knowing in-jokery genre winks. But ultimately it's a groovy ride is this one, not in the least bit serious, but one to clip open a tin of beer with and embrace it for what it certainly is. Entertaining sci-fi alien invasion hokum. 7/10",The Faculty
14,Theo Robertson,Likable Though Totally Unoriginal,6,7 April 2014,One of the problems of coming up with a story is coming up with an original story . In fact there's no such thing as an original story since long before my lifetime so the problem is trying to bring an unoriginal story to the table and developing in an entirely new way . What about a new spin on INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS ? How about setting it in an American high school and doing everything in a post modernist manner where the characters refer to all these alien infiltration movies ? If that isn't bad enough get Robert Rodriguez to direct it and you'll have a recipe for disaster I'm happy to report that years after THE FACULTY was produced it's far from a disaster but it suffers from two slight problems that it can't overcome . First of all the story is too overly familiar to be entirely successful . The 1978 remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS really surpassed the original and the terrifying premise was developed to its full potential and isn't a film you'll forget in a hurray . Compared to that masterpiece anything else is going to be lacking in comparison . Secondly there was a whole slew of movies in the 1990s either written by or inspired by screenwriter Kevin Williamson like SCREAM where smart ass teenagers find themselves in the same situation as other cinematic teenagers have been and feel the need to reference this . This fad died out as quickly as it appeared which means there's a very dated quality in watching these type of films almost twenty years later Not to be totally negative it is one of Rodriguez better films and he resists the temptation to bring stupid humour and unneeded gore to the movie . In fact the lack of gore makes it a strangely likable film in an era where horror films revolve around torture porn . The likability extends to the characters where even the rebellious drug dealing bad kid is a good kid at heart and seizes the opportunity to save the day . Compare this to the anti-heroes of ATTACK THE BLOCK who are total and absolute scum throughout the entire narrative and you notice the world of difference . . One thing Rodriguez could have done a bit better is bring a sense of crushing fear that seems to be missing here . That said as a sci-fi horror movie there's been a lot worse before or since this one,The Faculty
15,Hey_Sweden,And YOU thought you hated YOUR teachers...,6,27 August 2015,"An unlikely group of high school students must band together when they become convinced that the staff at their school have become alien slaves. They each fit a common stereotype: The Loser (Elijah Wood), The Outcast (Clea DuVall), The Stoner (Josh Hartnett), The Jock (Shawn Hatosy), The Cheerleader (Jordana Brewster), etc.As could be expected with a Robert Rodriguez venture, there was clearly some fun had with the casting choices. How would YOU like to have Santanico Pandemonium (a.k.a. Salma Hayek) as your nurse, The T-1000 (a.k.a. Robert Patrick) as your coach, Lillith Sternin Crane (a.k.a. Bebe Neuwirth) as your principal, and Margaret White (a.k.a. Piper Laurie) as one of the teachers?The script is by ""Scream"" creator Kevin Williamson, based on a story by David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel, and that can be either a selling point or a turnoff for the prospective viewer. Not surprisingly, the script gets annoyingly self-referential, with sci-fi stories like ""The Puppet Masters"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" getting a shout out. Rodriguez is a John Carpenter fan, and that's evident in the way that ""The Faculty"" plays out, as it hits a number of the same beats as Carpenters' ""The Thing"" - including a pivotal ""testing"" sequence and a severed head gag. This is all just a little too self-consciously ""hip"" for its own good, right down to the soundtrack.The effects are a combination of some practical work and a fair amount of CGI, a lot of it rather ropey. Still, the monster design is pretty fun.The attractive young cast inhabit their roles reasonably well, and are supported by a superb bunch of veterans - also among them are Christopher McDonald are Woods' father, and Daniel von Bargen. Jon Stewart plays the science teacher! In small roles are Danny Masterson, Harry Jay Knowles, and Duane Martin.As youth-oriented genre fare in the post-""Scream"" era goes, this is fairly entertaining stuff.One could take a drink of water every time a reference is made to water in this movie, but you'd probably have to go to the bathroom before long.Six out of 10.",The Faculty

17,poolandrews,"""I'm going to shove my foot so far up your a*s you'll be sucking my toes till graduation."" Brilliant Sci-Fi Horror, a personal favourite.",9,31 July 2005,"The Faculty is set in Herrington High in Ohio. Herrington High is populated by the usual assortment of misfits, oddballs & stereotypes & appears to be a just another normal American high school. However strange things start to happen at Herrington High, for instance when the best footballer in school Stan (Shaun Hatosy) is taking a shower one of the teachers Miss Brummel (Susan Willis) stumbles in with a bizarre skin disorder & begs for help. Casey Connor (Elijah Wood) is a photographer for the school paper, while hunting around for a story in the faculty lounge with Delilah Profitt (Jordana Brewster) the sexiest journalist & head cheerleader I've ever seen they both witness two teachers Coach Willis (Robert Patrick) & Mrs. Olsen (Piper Laurie) appearing to attack the schools nurse, Rosa Harper (Selma Hayek), they also discover Miss Brummel's dead body in a closet. After telling the schools principal, Miss Drake (Bebe Neuwirth) who doesn't believe a word of it they decide their on their own. While talking to social outcast Stokely (Clea DuVall) Casey becomes convinced that aliens are trying to take over Herrington High, he rounds a few unaffected students up, a drug dealer named Zeke (Josh Hartnett), new girl Marybeth (Laura Harris) plus Delilah & her boyfriend Stan. Casey has a hard time convincing everyone but after they are attacked by the science teacher an alien controlled Mr. Furlong (Jon Stewart) it's up to these six mismatched teens to save the world from these mind robbing parasitic aliens...Edited & directed by Robert Rodriguez I happen to think The Factulty is a fantastic film. The script by Kevin Williamson obviously rips off Invasion of the Body Snatchers by Jack Finney & Robert A. Heinlein's The Puppet Masters which are also about parasitic aliens trying to take over the world by similar methods, both of which were also turned into films & both of which are name-checked by Williamson. Williamson's interpretation on the premise is to take the themes & ideas & insert them into a modern horror teenage high school setting that was proving so popular at the time with the likes of Scream (1996) which Williamson also wrote. I really liked all of the characters in The Faculty which is a rarity with an almost all teen cast full of clichés & stereotypes, Williamson gives everyone just enough personality to shine. The Sci-Fi horror elements aren't ignored or forgotten about either as The Faculty moves along at a great pace, it never became dull & I was never bored. There is a nice mystery element as well with who is the Mother alien that started it all plus the ongoing question of trust & who has been taken over by the aliens? My only real complaint is that the film ends too conveniently when by killing the Mother alien all the other smaller parasitic aliens die & everyone simply returns to normal. Director Rodriguez uses the mistrust & paranoia well to create some good tension. Rodriguez gives the film a nice polished look throughout & at $15,000,000 it seemed bigger budget, there are also some nice touches here & there like the alien being in human form as it walks down a darkly lit locker-room but giving off the shadow of a multi tentacled monster that engulfs the whole floor. The monster alien at the end looked good & the special effects which switch between animatronic & CGI work well together for a change. There is also a fun effect scene that pays homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). There isn't much blood or gore in The Faculty, just some chopped off fingers, a stabbing with scissors & a bullet in someones head. But there is some drug use & a fair amount of bad language though. The acting is very good by a young & attractive cast, from a pre Lord of the Rings (2001 - 2003) Elijah Wood to a very sexy Famke Janssen. Mega star rapper Usher Raymond makes an appearance as well, better known these days simply as Usher. I love The Faculty, I love the characters, I love it's sense of humour & fun, I love it's story, I love it's modernness, & I love it's ability to entertain me & make me feel better that all great films should be able to do to some extent. Highly recommended so watch it as soon as you can, & if you've seen it already watch it again sometime soon & remind yourself how brilliant it is...",The Faculty
18,utgard14,"""Everyone's been acting really weird, especially the faculty.""",7,25 August 2015,"Invasion of the Body Snatchers comes to high school in this sci-fi horror flick directed by Robert Rodriguez with a script from Kevin Williamson. The faculty at an Ohio high school are taken over by aliens and it's up to a motley crew of subverted teenage stereotypes to stop them. The 'teenage' cast is great with Josh Hartnett a standout (despite his embarrassing haircut). The actors playing the faculty members are all good and seem to be having a fun time in every scene. Most of them are recognizable names like Famke Janssen and Robert Patrick but a lesser-known one that deserves some praise is character actor Daniel von Bargen, who sadly died earlier this year. In addition to Body Snatchers, we get homages and references to many other films, including The Breakfast Club, The Thing, and Terminator 2. Solid direction from Rodriguez and a funny, self-aware script from Williamson. Both men were in their creative prime here. Good soundtrack also helps. It's a fun movie that has only gotten better over time.",The Faculty
19,zardoz-13,"""The Faculty"" Is A Lot of Fun!",8,4 September 2008,"Teenagers thrive on science fiction and horror flicks because these renegade movies with their improbable pulp fiction plots appeal to youthful sentiments about alienation and the lack of power that juveniles wrestle with in an adult-dominated society. Not surprisingly, ""Desperado"" director Robert Rodriguez's clever but derivative creature feature ""The Faculty,"" starring Elijah Wood, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, and Famke Janssen, ridicules those traditional authority figuresteachers, parents, and the policewho curtail adolescent curiosity. As scripted by ""Scream"" scenarist Kevin Williamson, ""The Faculty"" amounts to an entertaining but irreverent hodgepodge of ""The Breakfast Club"" meets ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with a scene or two from ""The Thing"" grafted on for good measure. While adults may cringe at the messages that crop up, teens will revel in this spooky, sometimes scary spectacle. Inevitably, any movie celebrating a drug dealer as a hero is bound to arouse the wrath of either the PTA or the PTO.The teachers at Herrington High School in suburban Ohio have started acting a little weird. Weird enough so that several students suspect aliens may have turned their faculty into puppets and are using them to stage a hostile takeover of not only their campus but also their town and perhaps even planet Earth. Of course, students have always felt that their teachers come from another cosmos, and ""The Faculty"" winks mischievously at this premise. Initially, nobody believes that anything adverse is occurring, and ""The Faculty"" unfolds like a hip 1990s' update of ""The Blackboard Jungle"" where the kids ruled the campus and the instructors were the casualties of an apathetic school board. An early scene invites such a comparison when Principal Drake (Bebe Neuwirth of ""Jumanji"") informs her burned-out faculty that only the football team will get any new funding. Everybody else will have to suffer. Forget those new computers for the classrooms; the drama teacher will have to recycle last year's sets, and kiss any field trips goodbye.Things take an ""X-Files"" turn for the worst when Casey (Elijah Wood of ""Deep Impact""), a geeky, non-entity that bullies love to bash, discovers an egg-roll shaped critter on the football field and lets his biology teacher, Mr. Furlong (Jon Stewart of ""The Daily Show""), analyze it. Like a gremlin, this squirmy thing mutates after they dunk it in an aquarium. When Mr. Furlong sticks his hand in the tank, the things sprouts teeth and rips a chunk out of him. What the students don't know yet is that the critter has already assailed their hotheaded football coach, Dick Willis (Robert Patrick of ""Terminator 2""), and that he has attacked the Principal Drake. Furthermore, this parasite thrives on water, and eventually the entire faculty cannot seem to gulp enough water. Basically, this critter slips into your ears and takes over your body, a variation on Jack Sholder's ""The Hidden"" (1987), but ""The Faculty"" parasite adds recruits to its zombie-like ranks instead of skipping from one host to another like ""The Hidden."" Insidiously enough, the alien parasite plans to use the popular Friday night grid-iron contest to boost its numbers.Scenarist Kevin (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") Williamson populates ""The Faculty"" with a generic cross-section of high school types played by a talented young cast of fresh but little known faces. Shawn Hatosy brings humility to Stan, the star quarterback who quits the team in a fit of conscience to improve his grades. As his girlfriend Delilah, who heads the cheerleading squad and edits the school newspaper, Jordana Brewster of ""The Fast & The Furious"") is appropriately catty and snobbish. Delilah dumps Stan because his newly found academic efforts clash with her need for prominence. Wearing more make-up than Elvira, Clea DuVall of ""Heroes"" impersonates Stokely, a moody misfit unfairly accused of being a lesbian. Although Stokely isn't really gay, she adopts the persona because she refuses to click with the cliques. Meanwhile, Zeke (Josh Hartnett of ""Halloween: H20"") pedals drugs and taboo videos out of the trunk of his GTO, but he conceals more brain cells than any druggie could, especially when he duels with his English teacher about poetry. According to the script, his irresponsible parents have abandoned him, so Zeke has the run of his house. Finally, as Mary Beth, the new babe on campus, Laura Harris deploys her designing Dixie charms to ingratiate herself with even the most dispossessed. No matter what she does, just about everybody shuns poor Mary Beth.Nothing is either as simple or as straight-faced as it first appears in Kevin Williamson's ingenious script. Although the kids have found a cure, they must solve the mystery of who was first infested so that they can kill the parasite and free everybody. Complicating matters is that the alien's army of zombies is multiplying like crazy, and the enemy has our heroes surrounded, outnumbered, and perhaps even infiltrated. Predictably, too, Zeke's stash of narcotics runs low, and the kids have to run a gauntlet of zombies to grab what little drugs remain to destroy it. Director Robert Rodriguez generates sustained suspense as our heroes struggle to outfox the elude the alien spawn and rarely lets the momentum flag.Bristling with atmosphere, issues, and surprises, ""The Faculty"" qualifies as a witty, rip-snorting, reptilian chiller that never takes itself seriously. Good paranoid thrillers that keep audiences guessing up to fade out are few and far between. Indeed, the characters get the short shrift, but action rather than characterization propels ""The Faculty"" to its nail-biting finale. Nevertheless, the filmmakers offset the lack of character development with cinematic and literary references to genre classics. Stokely and Casey engage in an illuminating colloquy about sci-fi literature and point out that Robert Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" beats Jack Finney's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" to the book racks. On the other hand, they reveal that Hollywood has exploited Finney more frequently than Heinlein. Even if you abhor horror movies, you might be able to tolerate this playful, well-paced hellraiser.",The Faculty
20,Boba_Fett1138,A fun but just not solid movie.,6,16 June 2007,"It's funny how Robert Rodriguez his more 'light' movies are also his 'worst' ones (Spy Kids-trilogy, ""The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D"") but yet he continues making movies like this. But who can really blame him for making them, they seem like fun movies to make.Problem is that it is unclear what the movie is trying to be. A fun spoof of high-school movies, a tense science-fiction thriller. But whatever is the case, ""The Faculty"" is obviously not a movie that is brought seriously. The movie mixes so many different styles (think ""The Breakfast Club"" meets ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".) that the movie its style is incoherent and the movie lacks a real identity of its own. The one moment you don't know if you should be entertained or scared by what's happening on the screen.The story is way too simple and simply uses all of the high-school clichés, also in all of its characters. It works in a spoofing kind of way and therefor in a way also adds to the fun but it's just not solid and surprising enough to fill a 104 minutes movie with. Because it's so cliché filled, nothing in this movie ever comes as a real surprise. It also is the reason why this movie just never becomes tense or mysterious to watch.The good news is that the movie itself luckily also doesn't take itself seriously. It's what saves the movie and what makes it a good and fun one to watch. The characters are so deliciously over-the-top that they become very entertaining, which is also really thanks to the 'big-name' actors playing them, some in some small bit parts such as Jon Stewart, Salma Hayek and Christopher McDonald. Everybody clearly had fun playing in this movie. Some other parts are there for some fine actors such as Famke Janssen and Robert Patrick. They also deliberately cast some irritating teenagers in the main leads. Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Shawn Hatosy were all still some fairly unknown actors at the time. Surpising to see how much I enjoyed Josh Hartnett in his role. He was so much fine. I also was surprised by Usher Raymond, who I also enjoyed in his (small) role. So really nothing wrong with the casting here.The editing was really off at times. It even seemed as if the movie was incomplete at the time of its editing process and some in between shots were simply missing. Seemed like Robert Rodriguez still had a lot to learn with his 'shooting and chopping'. The special effects and its typical genre movie gory effects also weren't much good but somehow I have the feeling that they deliberately made the effects look fake to add to the movie its fun and light atmosphere.A good movie to watch but it still left me with the feeling that it had more potential.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Faculty
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty entertaining,7,7 March 2004,"This is pretty much the typical slasher, with just one twist. It's also helped by the fact that there's other things going on than just a bunch of killings; there are conflicts between the characters from the very beginning, before the killing starts. This is pretty unique for a slasher, and it definitely helps the film become more interesting. The plot is interesting, well, more interesting than slasher plots usually are. The acting is pretty much all very good, the actors nearly all give top-notch performances. The special effects are good, and mostly pretty convincing. I've heard a lot of people complain that this movie is a ripoff of the Carpenter classic ""The Thing"". While that film is the better of the two, this is by no means a simple ripoff. The plot in this is not the same, there are just a few striking similarities. I would rather think of it as a reference, something to honor Carpenter's abilities - Rodriguez was inspired by Carpenter, after all. I would recommend this to pretty much anyone who enjoys slasher movies, sci-fi flicks, or crossovers of the two genres. It's very enjoyable; the only thing I hated was that they had casted Elijah ""babyface"" Wood in one of the leads... oh well. You can't always enjoy all aspects of a film. 7/10",The Faculty

The key in remaking/revisiting a movie that has been done already is to shake it up a bit. This movie had all of the cliché teen roles with a bit of misdirection for the conclusion. But I must say that one of the things that shocked me most was the sheer amount of known faces in the movie. Frodo (Elijah Woods), Jean Gray (Famke Jannsen), T2 (Robert Patrick), Slevin (Josh Hartnett), Lillith from Cheers (Bebe Neuwirth), Shooter McGavern (Christopher McDonald), Jon Stewart, Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayak), Usher.

It feels like an attack on teachers and authority with the students retaliating at these aliens poised as teachers. Why don't the aliens just stick to the old fashion stealing of the lunch money? These aliens constantly drink water as their source of life. Somebody needs to get them drunk. That ought to screw with their world domination plan. Elijah Wood plays a wiz kid who senses that something is wrong. Laura Harris plays a sunny girl who tries desperately to fit in. Josh Hartnett sells illegal items. Jordana Brewster rounds out the cast discovering a body in an office closet. Lame plot followed by routine hack fest where teenagers become cafeteria food to aliens. It is as juvenile as a horror film can get and contains as much stupidity as the screenwriter can pack in. Directed by Robert Rodriguez who applies the same graphic action that ran rampant throughout his From Dusk Till Dawn, with fine visual effects but acting is bad. For a superior recommendation I recommend the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which was much more fun and inventive.

One of the better features with this one is the fact that the setup of the alien invasion is handled exceptionally intelligently since it comes off in a unique manner. Their original plan of attack, slowly moving through the parents and faculty of a small-town one-by-one under the guise of the behavioral changes which is slowly working it's way through the school on the down-low of doing the ear-exams. This small-scale invasion tactic is an exceptionally unique one that in concept works nicely and gives this one a great build-up throughout the first half exploring their plan. The gradual influx of strange behavior everyone undergoes, not only from the sudden water consumption, the obsessive status and the much more important tormenting their friends and family into their ranks all works as a fine build-up in here which spreads throughout the first half and allows the revelation to come naturally. Due to the fine explanations offered up that signify a change has occurred at the school, the action seems to showcase this is rather fun here with the collection of the students and how they continually come after them throughout the school as their realization in the classroom as the fun brawl which finally clues them into what's going on. The finale is where this one scores well on the great action in their confrontations at the school with the aliens which gives great encounters in the gym, the stellar attack outside where they chase around the teachers in the parking lot and all leading up to the final confrontation with the huge alien creature stalking and tormenting them throughout the school. That has some great work throughout from the stalking in the showers to the chasing in the basketball court where there's plenty of brawling with the giant alien creature and finally getting to the fun measure of how to finally defeat it. Given that all this is accomplished with some solid gore and a realistic-looking full-size puppet for the creature, these here make the film rather fun and exciting even though it does have some minor issues. The biggest problem with the film is the fact that the beginning here takes awhile to get going as all the great work done to build up the threat of the aliens around the school doesn't feature any action to do that. Despite how engaging this section is, it shows how long it takes for that to occur with all the conspiracy issues and side-plots that hold off the big action pieces found in the second half. As well as some really sketchy CGI for the time-period, these here really hold it back.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Nudity and heavy drug use and slang.",The Faculty

The most anticipated film of the year was a huge disappointment, The Matrix was a real Phantom Menace, and little surprises like this came out of nowhere and really made going to the movies worth while.Because of the posters, you instantly think that this will be another Scream, and the beginning really does hark of Casey and Ghostface, but this is so much more.Its the most 'un-Rodriguez' Rodriguez movie there is, really the only trait of his here is Salma Hayek, who gets infected, and you never see her again.The film feels fresh still as it did back then, and although some of the effects are a little dodgy now (just what was that flying out of Zekes car), the cast look they are having a lot of fun with their respective roles.Of the teachers, Patrick is the one having the most fun, and you know toward the end of the film Janssen will turn into an extraordinary beauty.The college kids differ slightly, watching it now, you think of a few of them ( i wonder where they are now?) but they are all great, especially Hartnett and Duvall.The film never takes itself seriously, and despite the many references to The Thing, it's original enough for you to forgive the over the top ending.Well worth seeing for B movie fun.",The Faculty

""The Faculty"" is cut from the same cloth except it goes too far over-the-top in its wannabe edgy depiction of high school life in Middle America, to the point that it can only be viewed as a satire or black comedy. This turned me off the first time I watched it but, if you roll with it, you can enjoy the movie to some degree.The story doesn't become compelling until the second half when a group of students team-up to tackle the unbelievable situation. It's basically ""The Hidden"" (1987) set in a high school environment.Laura Harris is the top female, although the overrated Jordana Brewster is also on hand, as well as Clea DuVall. Bebe Neuwirth looks great as the principal while Salma Hayek plays a nurse, but not enough is done with her (don't expect the dance sequence of ""From Dusk Till Dawn""). Meanwhile Famke Janssen appears as an intimidated teacher that has an entertaining metamorphosis.On the other side of the gender spectrum, Shawn Hatosy is notable as the main protagonist; Josh Hartnett too as a chemical-obsessed older student. Robert Patrick from ""Terminator 2"" plays the vein-popping coach while Jon Stewart has a small role.The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in East Texas as follows: Austin (Herrington High School), Lockhart (high school parking lot, football field & town exteriors) and San Marcos.GRADE: C+",The Faculty

32,JamesHitchcock,Post-Modern Irony at Herrington High,5,3 April 2014,"It is often said that the British and the Americans are two peoples divided by a common language, and I certainly learned a new word from ""The Faculty"". In British educational usage, a ""faculty"" is a university department (Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of History, etc.). In America, however, it would appear that the word is used as a collective noun referring to the body of teachers at any given school, what we in Britain would call ""the staff"". There can be few schoolchildren who have not, at one time or another, suspected that their teachers are alien beings from another planet, and ""The Faculty"" is about a group of students who discover that their teachers are, quite literally, exactly that. Herrington High School, Ohio, is your typical All-American high school as seen by Hollywood. You can tell it is typical because the pupils include representatives of all Hollywood's major social stereotypes of American teenagers- the handsome, musclebound (but dim) star athlete, the attractive but bitchy star cheerleader (who is inevitably the star athlete's girlfriend), the gloomy, unsociable Goth girl, the nerdish academic and the rebellious intellectual outsider. The racial make-up of the school is 100% Caucasian, apart from one token black kid and one token hobbit. (Actually, I don't think he's supposed to be a hobbit- he and his family live in a normal house, not a hole in the ground- but ever since ""Lord of the Rings"" I have been unable to think of Elijah Wood as anything else). The plot is hardly original, being that old science fiction/horror standby about alien parasites trying to take over the world by controlling people's minds and bodies, in this case starting with the pupils and staff (sorry, ""faculty"") of Herrington High School. If that sounds like a rip-off of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", it is. Moreover, the scriptwriters are quite shameless about having ripped off the earlier film, which they refer to several times, although they justify their creative theft by having one of the characters point out that ""Invasion...."" was itself a rip-off of a Robert Heinlein story. I think this sort of thing is known as ""post-modern irony"". Only a small group of students realise what is going on; their suspicions are first aroused when the notice that a few of the teachers have begun to act oddly. Yet again there seems to be an element of irony involved, because some of the supposedly suspicious changes actually seem for the better; the head football coach suddenly becomes a normal, rational, human being, rather than the foul-tempered, tyrannical disciplinarian he has always been. (That seems to be a common view of sports coaches; the one at my school rejoiced in the well-deserved nickname of ""Hitler""). One of the female teachers, previously a frumpy and prissy young woman (even though she is played by the gorgeous Bond Girl Famke Janssen) suddenly becomes a sexy vamp. When I first saw this film, not long after it came out in 1998, I disliked it, seeing it as just a dull, derivative mass of Hollywood teen movie and horror movie clichés. Having recently watched it again, I dislike it rather less than I once did. It may make use of stereotypes but it also subverts them. Musclebound jocks in films of this type are generally arrogant show-offs with no life outside sport, but Stan, the school's star football player, is actually quite a likable guy who even quits the team to concentrate on his academic studies. The anti-social bad-boy outsider, Zeke, proves to be a hero when the illicit drug he has been peddling turns out to be a key weapon in the fight against the aliens. Casey, the nerdish academic, proves to have more physical courage than anyone. And so on. Yes, ""The Faculty"" is clichéd, but it is all very tongue-in-cheek and makes use of traditional film clichés in order to have some fun with them. I think that also qualifies as a sort of ""post-modern irony"". It will never be ranked as a great classic, but it makes for enjoyable late-night watching. 5/10",The Faculty
33,MovieAddict2016,"A fun tongue-in-cheek referential horror film from the writer of ""Scream""...",8,19 January 2004,"THE FACULTYA Film Review by John Ulmer (Copyright, 2004)""The Faculty"" piggybacks a lot of great horror films, but also provides a great modern perspective of them all in this multi-remake. Its references range from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the film's primary inspiration), to ""Pod People."" But this is no surprise -- the film was penned by Kevin Williamson, the guy behind the self-aware horror hit ""Scream"" One and Two, as well as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" (One of my least favorite horror films of all time, surprisingly.)This is one of his best efforts. It involves a pack of kids at a high school in Idaho who begin to suspect that their teachers are aliens from another planet. A comical idea, yes? That's what I thought. Then I started getting into the movie and realized that it was one of the most fun -- if silliest -- horror films in recent memory.John Hughes would love this film. We have The Nerd (Elijah Wood), The Criminal (Josh Hartnett), The Jock (Shawn Hatosy), The Princess (Jordanna Brewster), The New Hot Babe (Laura Harris), and The Basketcase (Clea DuVall).As I sit at my keyboard and recall the plot and characters, I realize just how routine and clichéd the film really is. But none of these clichés struck me as I viewed the film, which is a bit startling in retrospect.The Nerd, a pre-""Lord of the Rings"" Elijah Wood, begins to suspect that his teachers are aliens after the football coach (Patrick Stewart, the T-1000 from ""Terminator 2"") inserts a strange alien creature into another teacher's (Salma Hayek) ear. A moment later she is fine, and rejects the boy's claims that the coach assaulted her.Then the school begins to be taken over by the alien species, which thrive on H20 and seem intent on taking over the entire planet. Before they do, however, the pack of kids form together and try to stop the aliens. The Criminal (who is really smart but plays down his genius) creates caffeine-based drugs at his home that dehydrate the aliens and destroy them. So with drugs in hand, the kids march against the aliens in an effort to stop the queen alien. ""Since when did you become Sigourney Weaver?"" one of the kids asks another.Where, I wonder, are these kids' parents? As these events go on, they seem pretty careless. The Criminal has an entire drug factory in the basement of his house. Do his parents know this? Do they even care? The film doesn't provide a very large backdrop. It is so weak with character introductions, in fact, that it supplies us with freeze-frame name credits every time we see one of the kids' faces. (This is usually an early warning side of a bad movie -- check out ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" if you need more proof.)The cast is pretty impressive; along with all the other actors I mentioned above, there's also Christopher McDonald, Jon Stewart, Piper Laurie and Famke Janssen. Pretty impressive. I wondered what drew them to the project before I saw the movie. Then I understood.This is fun. People don't see the fun in this movie because they criticize the flaws too much. It's not meant to be taken seriously -- in case you haven't figured out by now, ""The Faculty"" is entirely referential and tongue-in-cheek. It's not a remake, as so many critics perceived after their screenings. It's a subtly funny parody.The film is directed by Robert Rodriguez, who is infamous for having strong style but weak plots. His film ""El Mariachi"" was the breakthrough, and it was followed by two sequels, ""Desperado"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"" both starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Hayek is in just about every single one of Rodriguez's films -- she was even in last year's ""Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over."" I wonder if his inspiration is John Hughes, who constantly cast Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and John Candy in his films.Here Hayek has a small part, and the film mostly belongs to the teenage characters. As I think over everything that happened in the movie, it's almost laughably bad -- the things that happen are ridiculous. Very clichéd.But yet I had a lot of fun watching ""The Faculty,"" and any movie that convinces me it isn't stupid when, in fact, it is, is worthy of a recommendation in my book.

Now I like these premises, where something mysterious starts to happen and a few group of people tries to figure out what is going on. And while doing so, paranoia and distrust starts to happen. That is why I am thoroughly entertained when watching movies like ""The Thing"". The setting takes place in a high school with a group of high school students trying to figure things out when the teachers start to act very strange. To be honest, if I saw this movie when it first came out and rented it on VHS when that was still relevant. I would have been glued to the screen from start to finish. Watching it now, the teen interactions and relationship between one another is very typical and kind of boring. They did bring different personalities and categories of teens that applies in high school. Such as the nerd, the hottie, the druggy, the goth and the jock. However when they start to band together it actually starts to get a bit entertaining to watch. Especially when the paranoia and distrust goes off, it's actually executed quite cleverly. This is a fun Robert Rodriguez movie that is a alright watch especially with a group of friends while doing some guessing among each other. It's not as violent, gruesome and crazy as I thought it would be, especially for a Robert Rodriquez film. I was expecting more of a exploitation film with lots of gruesome violence, nudity and craziness. It leans more towards the humor, teen interactions and entertainment. Plus when it comes to who's body is going to get taken over next, it's not all that predictable. Overall this is a film with a decent build up with a entertaining second half when things get real. It's worth one watch, would have thoroughly enjoyed it if I saw it the year it came out.7.6/10",The Faculty
35,cherold,Disappointing but picks up in second half,6,28 November 2020,"Robert Rodriquez directing ""Breakfast Club meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" sure sounds great, doesn't it?Unfortunately, the movie is less than its elevator pitch.This highschool horror flick immediately establishes that teachers are being attacked and then acting quite differently. While this offers some thrills, we meed a variety of students struggling through day-to-day existence. Eventually the students figure out what's going on and work together to stop it.The first half of this is not that interesting. Rodriquez shows little interest in cinematic flourishes and the movie has the look of a low-budget high school drama. The students are cliched and uninteresting.Things pick up in the second half when the students finally connect. The group dynamics are much more interesting than any of the individual students, and the action gets much more thrilling. For most of the second half this movie is the elevator pitch movie, and until its rote postscript, it's quite solid.Ultiamtely, The Faculty is Invasion of the Body Snatchers without the social and political commentary melded with a Breakfast Club that never explores the complexities below the surfaces of its student archetypes. Thus that elevator pitch is both accurate and accurate; factually correct but leaving out the final words ... ""without soul.""",The Faculty
36,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 June 2019,"Surprising movie. I knew nothing about it going in, and that made the experience so much better. interesting fun story with good suspense and some startling moments as well as good comedic relief. (1 viewing)",The Faculty
37,Cineanalyst,Invasion of the Breakfast Club,4,30 July 2021,"There's a reason those movie-pitch gags in ""The Player"" (1992) were so funny; it's because they're true. I just wrote a few days ago about this in my review of ""Freaky"" (2020), another high-school horror flick, which in that case was ""Freaky Friday"" meets ""Friday the 13th."" Here, in ""The Faculty,"" it's ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) meets ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (adapted in 1956, 1978, 1993 and 2007). ""Freaky"" is even more explicit about this, while ""The Faculty"" only mentions the ""Body Snatchers"" part--and largely defensively, as it dismisses Jack Finney's book for stealing the pod people idea from the parasites in Robert Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters."" Note that Heinlein's name doesn't seem to appear in the movie credits here, either, let alone that of John Hughes, for whose name I don't recall even being mentioned at all in the movie. Dismiss it just the same as Finney's novel, then, I suppose.The first ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" film, from 1956, is usually appreciated as a McCarthyite metaphor, which I don't necessarily agree with, but there seems to be no doubt that was the intention of Heinlein's story, which involves rooting out the invaders in the U. S. government. I wish Heinlein's slug-like parasites came from Mars, so I could call it the Red Planet Scare, but I'm afraid they came from Saturn's moon Titan. Anyways, all of that is lost on ""The Faculty."" The aliens are still about hive-mind conformity, but so is the high-school movie genre. The difference is between the single trope of the alien invasion and the five tropes of ""The Breakfast Club."" Regardless of which side succeeds by insinuating itself within the community, it's a teenage dream of inter-clique bonding. The athlete, basketcase, brain, criminal and princess combining forces to fight off those pesky adults who just don't get it, which they do by... using drugs. Talk about peer pressure.Also, I'm going to include this in my list of pandemic-related titles, as it does allude to the notion, as do some of the other ""Body Snatchers"" iterations, that the alien invasion is akin to a virus or disease outbreak, which this one does early on with the character of Salma Hayek's (quite a recognizable cast amounting to naught in this movie, too, by the way) nurse having a cold or flu.",The Faculty
38,cricketbat,"Seriously, what is going on with Josh Hartnett's hair?",7,13 October 2021,"While The Faculty was obviously made to be the ""cooler"" teen version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it still has some fresh scares to offer. This horror movie feels pretty dated--and I'm not just talking about Josh Hartnett's hair, because I don't think that was ever in style--and it's obnoxiously vulgar, but it's got a solid premise and an impressive cast for the time.

I think Famke Jansen is totally hot and Clea Duvall especially, she's just totally gorgeous. Not enough gore either. In, fact there's not much else to The Faculty. The cheap CGI effects were pretty crap and the post-Scream script by over-celebrated writer Kevin Williamson is too self-aware and modern to be effective. In a few years, this kind of thing is going to seem dated.I guess it was entertaining in a silly kind of way which it was supposed to be but it could have been a LOT better.

40,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,6,3 July 2013,"The Faculty The most awkward aspect of attending high school as an alien is showering with your mono-penised classmates after gym.Fortunately, only the administrators in this horror movie appear to be aliens.When Casey (Elijah Wood) uncovers a strange creature at school, he takes it to his science teacher, Mr. Furlong (Jon Stewart).Eventually, like other faculty members (Famke Janssen, Salma Hayek, Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Patrick), Furlong hosts a species dependant on Earth's water.To prevent a town-wide assimilation, Casey and his classmates (Josh Hartnett, Jordana Brewster, Shawn Hatosy, Usher) must use a homemade narcotic to overthrow their alien oppressors, and return their teachers to normal.An archetypal teen horror movie from the late-1990s, the only thing separating The Faculty from the era's other slasher schlock is its done to death secret invasion premise.On the bright side, with their numerous appendages, alien educators are well equipped for today's overcrowded classrooms.Yellow Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.com",The Faculty
41,tabuno,An Above Average Teenage Alien Horror,7,20 January 2019,"18 October 2008. There is an undercurrent of ""The Breakfast Club"" meets ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" in this edgy horror/sci fi monster thriller that incorporates teenage angst, particularly in the beginning half of the movie. The build is nice. There is even a decent attempt at emotional connectivity during the climax that is rarely accomplished. The movie seems to waiver on the dark humor aspects and isn't sure what direction to take the movie and probably missed an opportunity to incorporate the novelty of teenager comedy to balance off this movie or playing it real straight. Overall, this is horror movie with a good dose of relational insight along with a number of twists and turns that for the most part work. The movie, however, loses a bit of its hard edged freshness and descends somewhat into the traditional horror clichés towards the end without really crashing and instead ends with an acceptable ending. 7/10.",The Faculty

45,JohnSeal,Surprisingly entertaining,6,5 April 2000,"It seems entirely appropriate that this teen horror film has a cameo appearance by Piper Laurie. Piper appeared in Carrie, the film that started the trend of slasher films with fake endings that presumably unsettled the audience just as they were preparing to leave the cinema. Those fake endings were de rigeuer throughout the eighties and nineties, becoming so thoroughly predictable that there was absolutely no shock, thrill or horror value in, oh, a good 90% of the genre. And now here is The Faculty, with Piper as a possessed school teacher trying to impart her slimy space slugs on her students. Guess what? Screenwriter Kevin Williamson has abandoned the 'fake' ending in favour of a good old-fashioned happy ever after wrap up. And it works. The Faculty hardly breaks new ground thematically--from Invasion to the Body Snatchers to Night of the Demons, you've seen it all before--but it's reasonably talented young cast and well written screenplay lift this one head and shoulders above Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, or any of the Friday the 13th movies.",The Faculty
46,hellraiser7,High School Invasion,10,23 January 2015,"The strange think about high school is despite everyone in close proximity with each other we don't really know the person we pass by because where never really ourselves.This film I feel is an under the radar gem, I may'be in the minority on this but this is one of my favorite alien invasion films and it's also one of my favorite films from the director Robert Rodregiez. This was one of the first times this director stepped out of his comfort zone to do something different and this to me is his only hit in that area.Yeah it's another horror film involving teens but what makes this different is that it's not a slasher; instead it's alien invasion. Which I think is a cool idea and a change of pace; instead of having the standard of having teens deal with some killer on the loose they have to deal with alien invasion and save the world which I think is awesome; it's pretty much ""The Breakfast Club"" mixed with ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" which I think is a great combo.I really like the high school atmosphere they create which doesn't feel like another positive stylized high school you'd see on any teen TV drama, but actually felt like a real high school as you see it's almost a cesspool of dysfunction. This I feel increases the realatablity factor because things like this do happen in high schools.The effects on the creatures are solid, it's a slight mix of both CGI and practical. The designs of the aliens are solid if not the greatest aliens, their pretty much nasty parasites or slugs that you just want to pour a big bottle of salt to.But to me it's not really the aliens that make the film it's more the characters and suspense that to me drive the film. I really like how the characters interact with one another, each of them at first are wearing psychological social masks to protect and hide themselves. But once crap goes down, they all take them off and be what they should be to win the war, themselves.Two of my favorites are Casey played well by Elijah Wood (TV's Over the Garden Wall) whom is an actor I really like. His character is great because he is a bit like myself. He's shy, a bit of a loner, ill confidant but not short of courage, but the guy is a real underdog. He doesn't have much luck with ladies, he's a target for bullies, doesn't have any friends or at least any we know about which is all the more reason we really route for this guy to win. Even like the chemistry he has with Deliah there's a bit of a Mary Jane and Peter Parker like vibe going on with both of them.Though my favorite is Stokely (Clea Duvall) whom I thought was kinda cute, she is a goth almost. She has a lot of attitude but what I love is that she is kinda a geek at heart since she's a big sci-fi fan as she reads lots of sci-fi books which makes her relatable since I'm also a fan of the genre and love to read the books in it. But also that deep down she is really possess a lot of warmth. I really like her interaction with Stan to me their the one couple in this film that stand out, I really like how both slowly open up and warm up to one another.I really like how there is a blend of both teen agust drama and the alien invasion suspense. And of course the film is light hearted fun as well, it doesn't take itself too seriously but has it's heart in the right place all the same.One of the dramatic moments that stand out is when Stan talks to Stokely about quiting athletics because he wants more and focus on academics to find himself. Which I though was a very humane moment and pertains to the theme of the film. Part of being a teen is about finding out who you are and figuring out what you can do, and sports careers aren't forever.It's true there not really much in action which is a bit of a first for Rob's films. But that's because this is more of a suspense thriller which I think is great and makes the protagonists and the actions they have to take more believable because their all just ordinary people; and the pacing is great there really isn't a slow moment or any time to really relax much. There is the sense of isolation but also at the same time community with the protagonists.One sequence which to me is one of my favorite one's of all time is seeing all of the character take the drug test which is reminiscent of the blood test scene in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". That scene was also really funny as we see afterward their all kinda tripping. And of course yes they use drugs as a weapon against the aliens which I like because their using a non cleche weapon.I really like how the film tackles the issues of alienation and isolation that teens go though. But I also think on the fear on being pressured to conform to certain standards and norms that are constantly imposed on us and how it will turn us into something we don't want to be. And the film I feel has a good message which is to simply be yourself, determine your own identity don't let anyone or any system do it for you, it's your life you decide.Overall, ""The Faculty"" gets a pass.Rating: 4 stars",The Faculty
47,atinder,Just when you thought it safe to go back to school,9,8 August 2009,"I was watching this last night for 20th time, The Faculty"" is a fun little sci-fi horror flick that I really like, it's was really entertaining.At Herrington High School what seem normal hight school but soon thing turn very dark, when the teacher start to act very strange.The number of people we got know really fast and new girl has just joined the group, while Casey is coming from class he notice the teenager are acting really strange, later on football filed his found this bug on fall he then show to the teacher who put in water.This bug turn to be a parasitic organism that is alien that goes into the ear of the victim, which takes over the brain and make different person.Soon Casey goes looking for that thing is found, when goes back class room the thing as gone, then friend don't believe until the teacher come in and turn out they are Aliens after all.These teenager are the only one who can stop these Aliens before whole town is affected The Faculty is definitely a favourite of mine because of all the homages it has to other movies, such as the snorting scene (the blood test scene from The Thing) and the idea of aliens being within people with their same memories (Body Snatchers)and the twist was really good, I did not seen it coming.I do think movie is little underrated and acting from the whole cast was superb",The Faculty

Here we had a great ensemble cast of new hot talent & a great Director with Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Desperado, Spy Kids films, Machete, Sin City) the guy is a legend of Cinema as much as his buddy Quentin Tarantino, i prefer Rodriguez personally but both are legends of Cinema, here Rodriguez gathered a great cast of talent with the always cool Josh Hartnett (Halloween H20, Black Hawk Down) & the great Elijah Wood (The Lord of the rings films, Maniac) & the always excellent Robert Patrick (T2, D-Tox, From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money) & the super sexy Salma Hayek (From Dusk Till Dawn, Desperado) & many others like Clea Duvall, Laura Harris, Shawn Hatosy, Bebe Neuwirth & Famke Janssen & John Stewart, Piper Laurie & Jordana Brewster, pretty great ensemble cast.This is definitely Robert Rodriguez's ""Studio Film"" as it's nothing like his usual wild & quick edited manic style, here he's settled on the more typical straight forward Slasher approach of directing & that's not bad it's fine here & a greatly directed movie, it's just not got Robert Rodriguez's signature style, it could have been directed by someone else & you wouldn't have known it was a Robert Rodriguez film unless you heard it was.
I grew up watching The Faculty & is definitely a Classic of the 90's & a classic of the resurrection of 90's Slasher flicks, i watched this tons of times on video, i love the amazing practical effects & amazing creature design of the huge Alien queen & i love the group of misfit teens (The Breakfast Club style) fighting back against an ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" type invasion of their school & town, this is an exciting film & has a great group of characters, especially Josh Hartnett's Bad boy ZEKE. Memorable moments of slimy gore & quotable dialogue & a so 1990's mentality & atmosphere of it's time complete with ""Men In Black"" & ""Independence Day"" & ""Spielberg"" & ""The X-Files"" references, this is a pure Cult flick to some but to me it's simply a Classic movie of that great decade the 90's!!!

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Buckets of gore, buckets of fun, a genre winner",8,22 July 2015,"Robert Rodriguez's The Faculty is a spectacularly funny gross out horror trash fest that has been a bit forgotten these days. It's a fun, lighthearted yet dangerous piece that plays like Dazed And Confused meets the Body Snatchers. In sleepy Midwest America, a deadly alien parasite attaches itself to the brain stem of a high school teacher, with the sole purpose of converting every human in town into a soulless vessel for these extraterrestrial hosts. The sassy, usually diverse bunch of high school jocks, nerds, weirdos, bimbos and social rejects are tasked with assassinating their whole faculty who has become infected. The effects are appropriately slimy, the performances are knowingly cunning, and the script, penned by Scream's Kevin Williamson, is a deftly comic 'scream' heh heh. Josh Hartnett makes a likeably sleazy lead as the local dealer who figures out the aliens weakness (I won't spoil the hilarious surprise). Clea Duvall, Shawn Hatosy, Jordana Brewster, Usher and a twitchy Elijah Wood are great as the students. Robert Patrick has a ball as the short tempered football coach moron, Bebe Neurith makes a silky, nasty villainess, and Jon Stewart, Salma Hayek, Piper Laurie, Daniel Von Bargen and shooter mcgavin himself all show up in memorable supporting turns.

Herrington High school is your average high school, full of a bunch of diverse teenagers who have just began the school season again. But something's a little weird this year, and the staff begin to act strange, one by one, their attitudes and personalities randomly disappearing, leaving lifeless, robotic-like teachers. Things get really weird when Casey, a nerdy student discovers a strange species on the football field. When taken to the biology lab, they discover that is revived by water, and it begins to multiply in a fish tank. Only a small group of the teens at the school seem to notice the strange phenomena, and they uncover that some alien life-force is overtaking the staff, and slowly consuming the students. It turns out that the only thing toxic to these deadly aliens is the ingredients in some drugs that Zeke, a low-life student sells to his peers at school. Now it's a battle for survival between some teenagers armed with drugs, and an alien force with intent on taking over the world.The film has some very integrated characters, although none of them are really friends to begin with, but they all band together to try and fight against the aliens that are taking over the school. The film features an all-star cast, I'm sure you'll recognize dozens of the actors in this film, and they all give good performances. The cast features Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Jon Stewart, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth, Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen, and many more. I'm sure most movie goers have seen a film featuring at least one of them, this is a fairly impressive line up of actors. The plot for the movie may seem a little bit cheesy, movies about aliens in this day and age may seem a little bit far fetched, which they are. I'm not even a sci-fi fan, in fact it's one of my least favorite genres. But this film was entertaining enough and held my attention the whole way through.Bottom line - ""The Faculty"" isn't a serious movie, and it can't really be taken seriously. The likeliness of aliens taking over your high school are very slim, but most stories are a little far fetched in their own ways, not everything can be dead serious and completely realistic.

54,Reviews_of_the_Dead,90's Floating Heads Version of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers,8,18 August 2019,"This film was one that my mother actually took me and my sister to see when it was in the theater. At the time, I enjoyed, but it wasn't until I got older and started to learn the history of cinema that this film made that much more sense to me. I'll get into that here in a bit. The synopsis is students suspect that their teachers are aliens after bizarre occurrences.We start on the football field. Coach Joe Willis (Robert Patrick) goes off about the play on the field. The star quarterback for the team is Stan Rosado (Shawn Hatosy) and he is getting yelled at. The best defensive player is Gabe Santora (Usher Raymond). They leave the field together. Coach Willis loses his mind and flips over the bench, spilling the water and dumping everything. In this fit of rage, he tries to break the sprinkler that is turning on. Someone comes up behind him.Later that night we are at a meeting of teachers and the principal. The principal is Valerie Drake (Bebe Neuwirth). She breaks the news to all of the teachers that they are not going to get the funding they asked for. John Tate (Daniel von Bargen) calls her out about the football team getting a majority of it. She confirms this, stating that due to it being a football town and filling the stands every Friday night. Them getting the funding is what the school board and the city wants. As she goes to leave, she forgets her keys. She goes back inside and Coach Willis confronts her in the office. He stabs her hand with a pencil and she tries to escape. Another teacher, Karen Olson (Piper Laurie) tries to help her, but we see that there is something wrong with her as well.The next day, we meet the students the film follows. Getting off the bus is Casey Connor (Elijah Wood). He is the photographer for the school newspaper and is bullied. The head cheerleader and of the newspaper is Delilah Profitt (Jordana Brewster). She is dating Stan, who tries to talk to her to tell her about him quitting the team, but she keeps blowing him off. There's Stokley 'Stokes' Mitchell (Clea DuVall) who bumps into Stan and is rude to him. She is a loner and loves science fiction. Delilah bullies with things like calling her a lesbian. There is the new southern girl named Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Laura Harris). Zeke Tyler (Josh Hartnett) is a senior who was held back. He is really smart, but doesn't apply himself. He runs a store out of the truck of his car for things like drugs, laxatives, bootleg VHS tapes and condoms. He also is interested in Marybeth, who seems to be into him as well.In the teacher's lodge we meet Rosa Harper (Salma Hayek) who is the school nurse and also under the weather. Elizabeth Burke (Famke Janssen) is a prudish teacher with no confidence. Edward Furlong (Jon Stewart) is also a science teacher. A couple of them notice when Coach Willis comes in and is drinking a lot of water. He doesn't react to anyone until Karen enters the room.Casey has his lunch on the stands by the football field. As he is coming back to class he finds something on the ground. There's a run in with Coach Willis and he takes what he found to Prof Furlong's class where they examine it. He notices that it is similar to an underwater creature, but it doesn't make sense since they are in Ohio. Zeke comes up and looks at it with him, asking smart questions. Stokely makes a comment and Gabe mocks her. She bumps into him and water spills on the thing, bringing it back to life. Prof Furlong then drops it into a tank full of water and they see that it comes back fully. He goes to grab it and it bites his finger. His plan is to send it to the local university to see what they make of it.Things then start to get weird when Delilah and Casey hide in the Teacher's Lounge and see Coach Willis along with Karen attack Nurse Rosa. They know what they saw, but they can't convince anyone else. Casey seeks out Stokely who knows about science fiction. It is through an encounter with Prof Furlong that they do realize, he's telling the truth and their school is being taken over by something.As I've kind of already alluded to, I did really enjoy this film back when I first saw it. To my knowledge, this would actually be the first film dealing with parasites or aliens taking people over I had ever seen. Since then I've seen a few of the different version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, part of the Puppet Masters and even Night of the Creeps. It really is an interesting concept that keeps getting revisited throughout each decade.What I think makes this one socially relevant even knows is that it takes a meta approach. I'm not surprised to see that Kevin Williamson wrote this screenplay as it does feel a bit like his more famous film, Scream. In this world, science fiction exists. Stokely actually talks about Invasion of the Body Snatchers as well as Puppet Masters. I really like this as it helps give them an idea of how to defeat what is happening.Taking it even a bit farther, it is interesting in that this film really does show how some people are garbage. There are the two girls who get in a car accident and actually fight each other. Zeke is extremely rude to Miss Burke because he knows that he can. Marybeth is given a rude awakening from her upbringing in the south. It really makes it hard to not see the point of view of the parasite here that they're making a better world without fear and not being accepted. I think this concept makes it easy to adapt and update for the time it is made.There is the fear of those that are still normal of not knowing who is taken over or not. I find it interesting that they have Coach Willis being extremely angry and vocal. When he makes the change, he becomes quite docile. It makes Nurse Harper and Miss Burke much more confident in themselves, to the point where Miss Burke goes off on Zeke. I do think this is a bit of a misstep in not having them all act similar. I don't mind the change in character for them, but it is also doesn't keep in line with what the film is going for. It would make more sense for them all to be docile though.I want to move to the pacing of the film, which I think is actually really good. The movie does a great job at jumping into it while introducing us to all of the characters. This can be tricky with the amount of characters we are dealing with, but I think that director Robert Rodriguez who also edited it cut it in a way where it works. I never get bored and I do feel that it builds tension to the climax, which was solid as well. The ending is a bit too clinched for me but I'll let it slide.Something that is hit or miss for me is the acting. Brewster is gorgeous and I thought she plays the cheerleader well. She is bully and quite crude to Stokely. DuVall's performance though was spot on. She has an interesting dynamic with Stan. Harris I think was fine in her role. Harnett is interesting in that he does come off as very smart, but he is smug. His home life isn't good so he's acting out, but I do think he goes a bit far and it loses a bit of believability. Hatosy I think was miscast. He just doesn't look like the jock the film is building up. Janssen I also think was miscast. She is too good looking to be as mousey as the film is trying to pretend. Her make-over is fine, but I just don't buy into it. I also want to commend Patrick in his portrayal. He is night and day which works here and makes it believable. I do want to commend Hayek, Laurie, Christopher McDonald, Neuwirth, Stewart and von Bargen for their roles as well; they definitely rounded out the film for what was needed.That moves me next the effects. I was happy to see that the creature and I'm assuming practical effects were done by KNB. The creature at the end looked pretty good and the practical effects were solid as well. There is some really bad CGI in this film. It doesn't hold up and I do think that some of that could have been done practical. I will say that the cinematography was good though.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. There are some covers of classic songs which I didn't mind, but the score is very 90's. It does fit the feel of the film and to be honest, it never takes out of it either. This is another aspect that was solid in my eyes.Now with that said, this film does have its issues, but I still enjoy it. It is a more modern take of aliens or a parasite taking over and a group of students trying to stop them. Some things are a bit on the nose, but it doesn't ruin it for me. I thought it was paced well and aside from some weird zoom effects, it builds tension to a satisfying conclusion. The acting for the most part is solid; there are just people I felt were miscast. The practical effects are fine, but the CGI doesn't hold up. The soundtrack fit for what the movie was going for and definitely makes it feel like the era. This film isn't great, but I would actually recommend it to horror and non-horror fans alike, especially if you're into meta horror like Scream. Overall I'd say this film is slightly above average for me.",The Faculty

56,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It borrows from past films but alters itself,7,20 May 2014,"Every high school has its issues. Whether it is misbehaved youth, poor budgeting management, inadequate staff or out of date supplies, there's always something that needs work. Interestingly enough, most students would likely say that it's their teachers that make their time feel like a waste. Sometimes this is true, while other times teachers are used as scapegoats for another person's problems. But what if the teachers were the problem and their intent was much more serious than one would expect? This is what happens when a random cluster of students at an ordinary high school discover that their teachers aren't what they appear to be.Directing this movie is Robert Rodriguez who has a story in the genre of horror for the second time - before that was From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). Accompanying Rodriguez is writer Kevin Williamson who also wrote for Scream (1996) and the rest of its later sequels. The strange thing is, much of the material Williamson uses is blatantly taken from other movies. Yet he does it in a way that at least credits them and somewhat morphs it into his own without coming off as complete copy. For example, there are some conversations that discuss the previous ""Invasion of the Body Snatcher"" films. The leads even come up with a test to determine who is real and who isn't, just like John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). Again, it's not new, but it at least aims to entertain with a slightly different angle.The cast contains various new and old actors. Some of which the new actors would become highly regarded in the current day. Playing some of the faculty, you have Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen and even Jon Stewart. The young actors include Jordana Brewster as the uptight prissy girl, Clea DuVall as antisocial introvert, Laura Harris as the newcomer to the school, Josh Hartnett as the stayback senior, Shawn Hatosy as the Jock, Usher as his best jock friend and Elijah Wood as the bookworm. All of them portray their characters accurately considering they all look like highschoolers. Perhaps the most interesting character is Shawn Hatosy for playing a jock that decides that grades are more important than sports. That's rare for an athlete. Other than that, these characters are fun to watch but none of them stand out enough to be truly memorable.The creature itself in this movie isn't memorable either. However, in spite of that, its presence is still not to be missed. To explain it, it basically is like trying to explain what John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) looked like; you can't. It's a thing. Considering this movie partially exists in the horror genre the gore is respectable. Some of the gore moments are a little unpredictable but most are cliché because of them being taken from other films. For the most part, the CGI is convincing enough to get by even though there are some moments where it looks dated too. Helping to enhance the experience of horror is composer Marco Beltrami's score and unfortunately, it's not his best work. His music can be heard when it comes to the scares, but he missed a lot of emotional cues that could've been used. Oh well, it's still fun though.Its concept is not new but it has moments that make it different from past films with a decent cast and special effects. Its music could've been a little better though.",The Faculty

It is probably because director Robert Rodriguez had been making a name for himself with films like ""El Mariachi"", ""Desperado"" and ""From Dusk Until Dawn"". Of course many of the younger actors were just starting out. But practically every actor is perfect in their role. Imagine a school with Bebe Neuwirth as the Principal, Salma Hayek as the school nurse and Robert Patrick as the Coach. Piper Laurie makes a rare appearance as the school's drama teacher. The students include Elijah Wood as the geek, Josh Hartnett as the troublemaker, Shawn Hatosy as the earnest jock, Jordana Brewster as the pretty girl Clea Duvall as the goth girl and Laura Harris as a sweet and naive new student from the south. The movie is well scripted, performances commendable, the special effects excellent and the action sequences exciting and fun.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",The Faculty

They all find out that their teachers are really aliens after bizarre occurrences.When I checked out this film, I thought it was a slasher horror flick but I did some research to see it's an alien film. So then I thought it was a slasher/sci-fi film. When I watched the film, it's not a slasher at all but I wasn't disappointed. I liked this film.This film takes its time establishing character personalities from different characters and the first few minutes of the movie has its suspense and it maintains throughout the film. The acting by many people were good but some were bad like Josh Hartnett.I watched this film on TV so I was really annoyed by the editing and seeing not many violent scenes but still, it doesn't matter about the blood or gore (not much in the film). There are some surprises here and there which keeps your attention, although some of the special effects aren't good.If you're expecting a slasher flick, you would be disappointed.

I remember I really wanted to know who that terrible monster was, the one that infected everybody else with those sleamy worms. What is good, this film is not a cliché, banal or beaten one. Nay, you watch it with a constant interest and suspense. The plot is impeccable - a typical American school, with its Lovelace, outcasts (the one played admirably well by young Elijah Wood), Gothic girls, bullies and sportsmen; and this school is infected with atrocious worms that control the brain and then the whole staff and the students start to behave well and drink water in terrible quantities. The main hero, played by Wood, with the group of unlikely pals, starts a struggle against them all. Their adventures are blood-chilling - we see the fight with the Biology teacher, and the excellent banters with other teachers and students. Finally, the climatic ending comes to us like a powerful steamroller - the main monster is a lovely blond girl who was with Wood all the time and who was beyond the suspicion. She turns to a sleamy huge monster and it takes many efforts and some deaths to stop her in the end. Wow, this is a real winner, as well as the majestic OSD. Great film, all in all.",The Faculty
61,m-47826,Another highlight of the late 90s teen movies trend.,6,7 August 2020,"This movie is yet another example of why Kevin Williamson was a gifted screenwriter. He did there, what he did on Scream about slasher movies. Spoofing, being completely self aware of invasion movies tropes. While creating his own themed story. Of course, all credits do to the director, Robert Rodriguez. But apart from Salma Hayek appearance and that introduction scene, I did not recognize his « style ». As usual, high school kids are faced with changes that go with being a teenager. This time, aliens threaten to take over their bodies and minds. Just like they do in dictatorships. The use of a cover of « the wall » is no stranger to that idea. Speaking of which, the soundtrack is the perfect addition to the movie and what made a late 90s kid tick. Belonging but not in the wrong way. Which is exactly the theme of the movie. A group of colorful and still searching students trying to escape conformity. The influences are a little messy though. It goes from Scream (the opening chase/kill) to a western movie start credit, when each students are introduced. That are more or less a late 90s version of the ones you saw on John Hughes movies. And the full on sci-fi, horror even killer animal movie (one scene in particular reminded me of Piranha) takes most of what is left of it. Sprinkled here and there with pop culture references by cameos/supporting roles, to the movie/TV shows titles quoted. And savage yet appropriate humor. The Faculty was/maybe still is a very fun ride. Mostly to people who grew up watching it like I did, but probably to some of the newer generations too, who will discover these « big name » actors back when they were young and at the prime of their acting careers.",The Faculty

64,Screen_Blitz,"Robert Rodriguez offers a clever, campy high school horror flick, while borrowing elements from other sci-fi and horror entities",7,28 August 2017,"The best way to describe this high school science-fiction horror tale is a cross between the 'The Breakfast Club' and 'The Thing'. From the premise to the execution, it is clear that director Robert Rodriguez, the man behind the vampire-horror 'From Dusk Til Dawn', is drawing inspiration from other cinematic entities of its genre, as well as the classic teen flicks from the John Hughes era. The evidence could not be more clearer, especially with writer Kevin Williamson of 'Scream', 'Scream 2' and the teen drama television series 'Dawson's Creek' working by his side. So while the film never aims to be anything original nor does it present itself in a way to be taken too seriously, it is Rodriguez's campy execution that keeps thing moving without slipping into the cracks of tedium. After all, the genesis of this film is a battle between high school kids and their teachers may or may not be members of the extraterrestrial race. Set in the fictional town of Herrington, Ohio, the film introduces high school students Casey (played by Elijah Wood), a photographer of the school's yearbook who is constantly a target of meat-headed bullies, Delilah (played by Jordana Brewster), the vindictive editor-in-chief of the yearbook, Stan (played by Shawn Hatosy), Delilah's boyfriend and star quarterback who's quitting the football team run by his tough-as-nails coach Joe Willis (played by Robert Patrick) to focuses on his academics, Stokely (played by Clea Duvall), a goth girl who is rumored to be a lesbian, Zeke (played by Josh Hartnett), a rebellious punk who is repeating his senior year while selling drugs and IDs to his fellow classmates, and Marybeth (played by Laura Harris), a new student. When a mysterious alien parasite from an otherworldly planet begins spreading around the school campus and invading the body of the teachers and staff, these kids must work together to fight against this mysterious invasion. That is if they crack the code and find out who the queen is. The inspirations of classic novels like 'Invasion of The Body Snatchers' and John Carpenter's The Thing are crystal clear. Even the character make numerous references of this and other science- fiction works in the dialogue. While Robert Rodriguez sorely lacks fuel in the tank of originality, the best thing he manages to accomplishes is keeping clever, even when he more often than not burns through the playbook of overused high school tropes. The characters, each of whom resemblance archetypes of the 'The Breakfast Club', are gifted with some clever and at times, funny dialogue to make how thinly drawn they are. Josh Hartnett's character Zeke, in particularly, grants us with the most laughs. Kudos go out to his scenes with Mrs. Burke, played by Famke Janssen, which marks the most laugh-worthy moments in the film. But is the plot that marks the film's biggest strengths. The first half focuses on the buildup and growing paranoia as the characters witness this bizarre behavior of the teachers and staff, before building up an intensifying climax in which the battle between the characters and the gory alien showdown rages on. In the process, the story doesn't proceed without leaving sprinkles of suspense trudging through each scene the characters are in danger. Although the entire second half, particularly in one scene, too often reeks of familiarity of The Thing, Rodriguez know how to put on a show with his gruesome special effects once the action hits a boiling point. As for the cast, everyone is mostly solid, nothing really memorable -- unless considering the creep demeanor of Robert Patrick displaying a sinister portrayal of a football coach who always feels like he is on another planet.The Faculty is fun, campy science-fiction horror bound to please teens and adults thirsty for a gory alien invasion scarefest not meant to taken seriously. By no means does the film even closely match up the par of the cinematic bolts Rodriguez draws inspirations from. Of course, to expect something on that level would not be too reasonable.

Kevin Williamson splendidly has his way with stereotypical teenagers in a clever script stuffed with titillating genre references. All performances are outstanding - particularly Robert Patrick eats up every scene he's in - and the K.N.B. Effects Group delivers some of their best work, mixing CGI with traditional monster mayhem.

66,mstomaso,"Campy, ridiculous, but entertaining high school version of Body Snatchers",7,11 May 2005,"This film fuses elements of the Breakfast Club with Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Robert Rodrigues makes entertaining films, and does so consistently. The Faculty is no exception, though the formula is radically different from his standard approach. In place of large guns, spectacular stunt choreography and a silly soundtrack, Rodrigues made ""The Faculty"" with a classy ensemble cast and some awesome special effects. The script is also very good, featuring strong characterization and interesting dialog. All of these elements make The Faculty a very watchable film, and make up for the completely unoriginal and not very coherent plot.The film begins as a paranoiac comedy about a typical high school where the students and faculty see each other as alien species. Ho hum. However, after about 20 minutes of set-up, the faculty really starts to become an alien species, as they are assimilated by water-loving parasites with very bad attitudes and a kind of group consciousness straight out of Invasion of The Body Snatchers and Star Trek's Borg. Six kids, very unlikely team-mates representing the archetypal teenage personalities of the postmodern world, team up to try to save the world, once they realize that the aliens can be driven off by, of all things, caffeine. Especially impressive are Elijah Wood, Piper Laurie, Robert Patrick, Josh Hartnett and Clea DuVall.Like most of Rodrigues' films, The Faculty never loses its sense of humor, and pulls off its own absurdity with artful visualization and a tight, driving pace. Unlike many of Rodrigues' films, however, The Faculty is disposable - it's not really meant to be viewed more than once.

There was also great scenes in this movie delivered by slick dialogue and this movie certainly stands out from all the other horror movies that came out during this time, and different although it's not original this type of storyline has been done before ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" springs to mind but this one's a million times better, I also loved the science fiction elements tossed into this film especially towards the end.It's the characters and acting is what really makes this movie work, Eliah Wood before hitting A-list stardom with the lord of the rings trilogy was great in this movie, he played the geeky sci-fi nut Casey with depth and courage, he was really likable. Jordan Brewster played the head cheerleader and object of Casey's affections Delilah really well and was also nice to look at, definitely the sexiest babe in this movie the only problem is we don't see enough of her, Clea Duvall played the outsider Stokley brilliantly, she really looked the part at first she's bitchy and mean but her character develops more and more as the film progress, Josh Hartnett fresh faced at the time and this was one of the 2 horror movies he did that year, truly showing that this is his breakout performance and went onto bigger things, here he's playing Zeke the drug dealer/under achiever/main trouble maker, really well and his character really develops throughout the film. Shawn Hatosy plays the jock character Stan really looks the part and acts the part and shows that there's more to him that just being a jock and lastly out of the six students Laura Harris who plays the new girl Marybeth Louise Hutchinson who's really sweet in her role and while starting her first day at school, it gets overtake by body snatching aliens. We also get a lot of cameo type roles from some of the bigger names in the movie like Robert Patrick famous for playing the bad guy in Terimator 2, has fun playing the psycho gym teacher, Famke Janssen playing femme fatle Miss Burke and even R&B singer Usher Raymond and Salma Hayek in small and pointless roles.All in all I recommend this movie to anyone, if you like movies like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and The Thing, well the Faculty is just like a modern day telling of the those movies only much better, it's fast paced and will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time.",The Faculty
76,eibon09,Scifi Clunker,3,20 March 2001,"Attempted to do with the science fiction genre what Scream did with the horror film.  The Faculty(1998) fails to come up with an interesting take on the Science Fiction movie.  Written by the same person who wrote the first two Scream films.  This film is just as lousy as those so called horror features.  Tries to poke fun at films like The Thing(1952, 1982), Invasion of the Body Snatcher(1954) and fails horribly.
I was surprised that the movie did not make a reference to Horror Express(1972) as that film was in the same vein as the films mentioned above.  A much better and superior film school flick is the film, Class of 1984(1982).  Some of the film rips off the similarly themed feature, Class of 1999.  Famke Janssen is very good in her role of the shy school liberian. Robert Patrick steals the show as the alien possessed, Coach Willis.
The rest of the acting is below par.  The Faculty(1998) was another dud for filmmaker, Robert Rodriguez who hasn't done anything good since his debut in 1992 with El Mariachi.  The Faculty(1998) proves to me that Hollywood has given up on making daring and creative horror films that will be remembered for a lifetime.  The story is about aliens who try to take over the earth by using teachers and some students as hosts.  Salma Hayek is one of the few and rare reasons to watch this terrible motion picture.",The Faculty
77,Movie-12,"Contains some scary material, just not enough of it. **1/2 out of ****",6,6 June 1999,"A perverse coach, mysterious teachers, a meek principle, bizarre happenings, a high school with dark and creepy hallways, dozens of pointless corridors and rooms, and full of jocks, druggies, eggheads, nerds, new girls, so-called lesbians and loners.Those are the key ingredients to make movies like ""The Faculty."" Movies where nothing anyone does makes any sense. Movies where the plot is so ridiculous on paper that you walk in the theater to see it cold-hearted. Movies where the audience groans in agony when they see the formulas thrown at them. ""The Faculty,"" does contain all of that and more, but to my pleasant surprise, this film was a whole lot better than I expected it to be. This is a slightly above average horror thriller.Like I said, the plot is so ridiculous written on paper that it may throw you off right from the beginning. It's about seven high school students of an enormous variety of genres, who begin to suspect that their teachers may be possessed by aliens. That's right, aliens, straight from mars, who need lots of water, can be chopped up and shot, ripped apart and come flying back together again. They use the human body as hosts, and want to take over the world, as in the film's characters words, ""Entering from the back door.""The aliens appear to make zombies out of their victims. They open their mouths and shoot little creatures into the victim's ear. They start out only capturing teachers who roam around in the faculty lounge, and then start with the students. What I don't understand is why the aliens  kill some people and occupy others. Take the opening credits for instance; a group of teachers working late at night pack up and leave the building, one forgets her keys, goes back into the school, is chased by Coach Willis,(who is an alien) and eventually stabbed to death by a fellow and unexpected colleague (who is an alien as well). Now, why didn't she turn on the lights when she walked in the school, or why didn't the possessed teachers capture her, instead of slashing her body into little pieces? I'll tell you why, because it's scarier running though dark hallways compared to bright. And they killed the woman to scare the audience, not to further evolve the story.There is some very frightening material in this film, however. Near the end, there was nail biting, edge of your seat suspense. I was defiantly involved in what was happening. The ""Boss"" monster was really a terrifying creature, an a mystery until the end, unlike some monster movies. So, the movie is certainly not with out tension. It just didn't have enough of it.The stars portrayed their characters well. Its just to bad that they were so very aggressive with their attitude. Writer Kevin Williamson wrote them with vigor, making very sure that the audience knew who was the teachers pet, who were the suspects, who was the slut and so on. Its like he was holding a gun on us to believe in the characters, and he fails completely.Don't get me wrong, ""The Faculty"" didn't fail to give me a shiver, and it was entertaining.at times. Its not a bad movie, not necessarily a good one ether, though. I liked it in theory, but when it comes to giving it thumbs up or thumbs down, it's a close miss, but a marginal thumbs down. Its not a complete waste of time, however. If you desire to see it, I wouldn't  hold you back.",The Faculty
78,alice liddell,good: could have been great,6,21 July 2000,"With a tighter script, this could have been a classic - Rodriguez's flights of fancy are repeatedly, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, beaten down by extended scenes of static exposition, implausible plot mechanics, and the dictates of genre.  But THE FACULTY is still terrific - a proper horror with proper scares and restrained, justified self-referentiality; an excellent teen-pic centring on recurrent fears about conformity, independence, authority figures and sexual awakening.Just because you keep referencing INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (love the switch to 'books', Kev!), doesn't mean you're not INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  For better or worse, society and cinema has become less political, so instead of panic about reds or McCarthy, we have more general fears (task-force modernisation etc.).  But these are still valid.  The thing about this conformity is that in a way it is collective, erasing class, racial and generational boundaries; it sees itself as a force for good, a way of making the alienated, the abused, the geeky fit in with the nice people.  The film's whole conflict centres on a verbal pun, aliens versus the alienated.  The conformity is only quelled when the disparate outsiders form a group, a sort of conformity in itself (it's no surprise that an ultra-conformist is the first to be revealed as bogus).The film gives an alarming picture of life in American high schools, which doesn't seem that far-fetched to me now, having seem some documenataries exposing this metonymic environment.  As you would expect, there is the usual, horribly violent, bullying of the clever; the cruel taunting of the different; the apotheosis and corruption-enabling of the football team. Even within this latter unit, there is rupture and doubt, as one star-player sees the system's fraud for what it is, sees how it makes a mockery of his own self-worth.But the students aren't the only dissatisfied ones.  The teachers are so disillusioned by the favouritism of the football gods at the expense of their own subjects, that they turn to drink, 'medication', arid sarcasm, and general indifference.  This is perhaps an indictment of a system that fails its hypersmart kids, but we rarely get to see the teachers' side.  So when the alien horrors begin, it's not just an allegory, like BODY SNATCHERS, for a cruel conformity that already exists, but shows up the failure of a certain kind of current conformity.One could say that the film is just a catch-all expression of a certain, rather smug, alienated adolescent mindset; that the whole world is out to get you, from your peers, the girls you fancy, to teachers, parents, police. The profusion of narcotics strengthens this interpretation, the idea that all events are one big bad trip (there is a delightfully subversive subtext here which seems to contradict Richard Ashcroft).  This would explain the lumping of every enemy figure together.  The fundamental misogyny would be typical of teenage boys still at the episcopal-bashing stage.  There are some excellent rites revealing tensions within the group, where the individualism of mistrust threatens to explode the resistance.  But resistance to what?  What is the coda bitterly suggesting?What is most enjoyable about FACULTY is its rejection of current accepted horror practice, based on the slashers of the 80s, where the emphasis is very much on editing.  There are, of course, some jolting cuts here (Rodriguez is, after all, the best editor in the business), but the best scenes are a result of careful compositon, striking, haunting images and an intelligent use of space (the almost army-camp restriction to campus reminds one of Ferrera's BODY SNATCHERS), which owes more to the Universal horrors of the 1930s, the B-movies of the 1950s and Romero's allegories - the LIVING DEAD-like scenes of faceless mob attack are truly frightening yet very funny.",The Faculty

Josh Hartnett is perfect AND gorgeous as the mystery hunk Zeke and Elijah Wood is great as the geeky Casey. Laura Harris was quite convincing as the sweet little innocent new girl Mary-Beth. Who would of thought she would of turned out to be the evil queen of aliens. (I guess it was on the cards.) The film is directed by Robert Rodriguez who made the film even more brilliant. It would be cool if they would make a sequel but I don't think that will happen any time soon. (Maybe, one day?.) Anyway, The Faculty is a great film and I'm going to give it a 10/10.",The Faculty

The only thing original here, well let me think, there is nothing original here. I expected a lot of energy from the direction of Robert Rodriguez and it was totally flat. The special effects were pretty cool, but the story was lame. The main heavy in the film is identifiable almost the minute you see them.

81,meydiana-65242,Pretty Entertaining,7,28 October 2020,"Pretty entertaining
This is pretty much the typical slasher, with just one twist. It's also helped by the fact that there's other things going on than just a bunch of killings; there are conflicts between the characters from the very beginning, before the killing starts. This is pretty unique for a slasher, and it definitely helps the film become more interesting. The plot is interesting, well, more interesting than slasher plots usually are. The acting is pretty much all very good, the actors nearly all give top-notch performances. The special effects are good, and mostly pretty convincing. I've heard a lot of people complain that this movie is a ripoff of the Carpenter classic ""The Thing"". While that film is the better of the two, this is by no means a simple ripoff. The plot in this is not the same, there are just a few striking similarities. I would rather think of it as a reference, something to honor Carpenter's abilities - Rodriguez was inspired by Carpenter, after all. I would recommend this to pretty much anyone who enjoys slasher movies, sci-fi flicks, or crossovers of the two genres. It's very enjoyable; the only thing I hated was that they had casted Elijah ""babyface"" Wood in one of the leads... oh well. You can't always enjoy all aspects of a film. 7/10",The Faculty

I'm sure you'll be seeing these six actors in years to come. As for the veteran actors, they steal their scenes whenever they're on screen. You couldn't ask for a better group of actors to play the faculty than Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Patrick, and Jon Stewart.

86,baileycrawly,Extremely Dated but Fun,7,19 December 2020,"The Faculty came highly recommended to me, and it's something I probably would never have seen had it not been for that recommendation. It's a criminally underrated movie.
From the director of From Dusk Till Dawn and the writers of the first two Scream films, The Faculty tells the story of a group of high-schoolers who discover their teachers are alien after they begin to exhibit strange behaviours. It's a deliciously dated high school comedy/thriller with jokes that hold up pretty well, scenes of gore and horror that are still fairly effective, and acting that, while certainly nothing the Academy would ever acknowledge, serves its purpose to achieve what the film was trying to accomplish. Perhaps the biggest complaint one could have toward this film are the effects which, while decent at the time, are just as dated as everything else in the film. However, when viewing it on VHS (as I have), it's not so jarringly awful that it distracts from the film. It's a cleverly written (better than the Scream movies, in my opinion) thriller that just doesn't get its due recognition.
It's far from a perfect film, but it's one that is easy to enjoy despite the imperfections.",The Faculty

It is certainly not as good as ""Scream"", but so much better than ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". ""The Faculty"" is a very entertaining film with surprisingly interesting characters. But, like so many horror films, this movie is not scary. That is of course a huge flaw when you expect to see a scary film. And the ending where we get to see the queen parasite in all her ""glory"" is just a bit too much Why couldn't they have left it to the viewer's imagination? It's just so silly, and it would have been a better film if they had just let us see the queen as a human being, which is more scary too me. It's like that slimey skeleton smoking a cigarette in ""Hellraiser"" -- it just makes you laugh. I honestly think that only a few films, the Alien-series for example, can actually pull the monster thing off, in other films it turns out to destroy the experience of the movie.However, ""The Faculty"" is non-stop entertainment according to me, many flaws, of course, but I still think it's worth to watch.

88,chrisbrown6453,"The Faculty, or Invasion of the Teacher Snatchers, is a fitfully entertaining sci-fi/horror film that confirms every student's belief: kids are from Earth, teachers from Mars.",6,19 June 2002,"It gets off to a rousing start as we meet the students and teachers of Herrington High School. Drug deals are going down in the parking lot, fights are breaking out all over, teachers are sneaking nips from flasks and the school nurse seems to be tripping on something. Everyone at Herrington has a foul mouth and/or an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of movies. Is it possible that Hollywood rising star Kevin Williamson has done it again? Has he written another Scream? No such luck. The Faculty is better than I Know What You Did Last Summer, but isn't as sharp as the screamer that started it all. Aliens have landed in Herrington, Ohio and are infiltrating the populace. The principal, Ms. Drake (a funny Bebe Neuwirth), is ""converted"" by the football coach (Robert Patrick), who is in cahoots with the drama teacher, Mrs. Olson (Piper Laurie). The body snatching is accomplished by some creepy-crawly organisms that enter the host organism through the ear. No cumbersome pods to worry about. Our hero turns out to be the nerdy Casey (Elijah Wood), pure bully-bait, who is brutalized by just about everyone on campus except the sickly sweet Marybeth. She's a transfer student from down south with a mint julep accent. Casey's eventual allies are punky Stokely, campus queen/cheerleader/school-paper editor Delilah, star quarterback Stan and flunky drug dealer Zeke, who just happens to be a closet rocket scientist. In the beginning, it's kids vs. adults, but then the aliens start looking for younger blood. It's disappointing that The Faculty degenerates into a routine game of alien hide-and-seek, with a familiar special effects display as back up. The fertile themes of peer pressure and teen alienation are swept away with the appearance of drooling monsters, Sigourney Weaver-rejects. Director Robert Rodriquez, who burst upon the Hollywood scene with the energetic El Mariachi, provides some pep, as does the likable cast. Maybe Williamson, the screenwriter du jour, should spend a little more time on his homework.",The Faculty
89,acedj,What a ride,9,14 November 2019,"The Faculty is a great sci-fy movie dealing with an alien invasion. Clearly by the title, one can surmise that the invasion starts with the absorption of the teachers at the local school. It is up to a bands of students, all from vastly different social cliques, to thwart the invasion.
This movie features the best parts of many movies that came before it. There are huge elements of The Thing, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, and even The Breakfast Club thrown together. With Robert Patrick cast in a role, you might even see some of T2 in it as well. All of these elements were thrown in a blender, and out popped this fantastic movie. The cast is made up of a lot of young actors that go one to have some pretty great careers. If you like Penny Dreadful, well a very young Josh Hartnet is here. Fast and the Furious? Jordana Brewster is in her first role. The Lord Of The Rings? Mr. Elijah Wood, though this is far from his first role. There are also some established actors here like Bebe Neuwirth, you might know her from Cheers, and Jon Stewart, Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen. My point? The cast is hugely talented and does a tremendous job All in all if you love sci-fi horror movies, there is nothing to not like about this offering.",The Faculty
90,DavidSim240183,The Breakfast Club's Invasion of the Body Snatchers,9,22 April 2006,"When Kevin Williamson penned the script for Scream, he completely revitalised the flagging horror genre, by having the characters knowingly winking at the audience about the clichés while actually starring in a horror film. With The Faculty, Williamson has done the same thing for science-fiction, drawing upon such classic paranoia stories like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, given it a hip, teenage spin, and added a little self-referential irony for good measure.The actual plot of The Faculty is nothing groundbreaking or original, especially if you're a fan of Star Trek (it's almost a direct lift from the TNG episode Conspiracy), but the astute playing by the young cast and a creepy atmosphere from Robert Rodriguez makes The Faculty a very engaging tale indeed.Robert Rodriguez is a director not always known for subtlety (From Dusk Til Dawn). But with The Faculty, he manages to restrain himself, slowly building the menacing tension effectively, and it is really only at the end that Rodriguez succumbs to his need for special effects overkill.Set in an Ohio high school (not Chicago which is a nice change!), alien parasites have found their way into the school faculty and are spreading. There are quite a few good actors playing these parts, like Robert Patrick, Bebe Neuwirth, Salma Hayek, Piper Laurie, Famke Janssen, etc. Taking over their bodies, they start the slow process of converting the students too. To what end, who can say?Gradually some of the students start to catch on. Six in particular. All stereotypes of course. Delilah, the high school glamour queen. Stokes, (Clea DuVall, excellent) the high school misfit. Marybeth, the squeaky clean new girl. Zeke, the rebellious drug dealer. Stan, the high school jock. And Casey (Elijah Wood), the wimpy nerd.As our six heroes band together, it soon becomes a desperate struggle to remain one step ahead of the aliens. Rodriguez manages to create a very tangible feeling of paranoia. You can never be certain who's who. Or who can be trusted. There are some lovely touches throughout, such as the eerie image of three teachers standing watch outside Casey's home in the middle of the night. Or the teachers voices over the PA system telling students to report to the principal's office. Even simple things like the shadow of a person walking past a glazed window seems creepy. The highlights are endless.There is more than a few shades of The Breakfast Club to these kids, which is probably intentional. Stokes, for example, is a dead ringer for Ally Sheedy's Allison. They may be obvious stereotypes, but the characters are all sharply written, and given considerable buoyancy by the actors. Delilah's acidic bitchiness makes her very entertaining. Stokes is admirably feisty about being an outsider. Even Stan is more interested in his studies than playing football.It's just a shame the teachers aren't given the same exposure, especially with the eclectic list of actors playing them. They're not really used to their full potential, but when Robert Patrick or Bebe Neuwirth are on the scene, they make a huge impression.The structure of The Faculty is clever, because of the way it juxtaposes high school as a sinister place out to get kids. Which is actually a fear most teenagers go through. It's given weight and dimension by the inclusion of an alien invasion co-opting the teachers. The camera-work helps with the way it remains fixed on some of the schoolkids just staring at our six heroes, as if they're secretly talking about them behind their backs. Which of course, they are.Also like Scream, The Faculty is witty the way it playfully acknowledges the sources it's taken it's inspiration from. Casey is the first one to point out how like Invasion of the Body Snatchers all of this is, even quoting directors like Spielberg, Barry Sonnenfeld, and Roland Emmerich and all their associations with alien pictures.But the motives behind the alien invasion is kept in the dark for the most part, which was a bit frustrating. And as the special effects take over towards the end, The Faculty loses some of the atmospheric menace so well sustained throughout.But despite that, The Faculty is well above average. With some of Scream's brilliance from time to time, sharp characters, witty dialogue, and engaging design, there's hardly any room for complaints. Also, I love paranoia stories, and this ranks as one of the best.Marvellous.",The Faculty

I live in Norway, and there wasn't that much talk about horror movies in the media/on television, so it definitely got my attention.The Faculty is just plain awesome. It's a straight up classic. I rented it not knowing much about it, and I loved it. The plot is pretty simple, you know the drill, but it is so well made. Great cast! Several of the actors became house hold names.

Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen, Jordanna Brewser, Usher, Jon Steward, Oh, and of course, T1000 himself - Robert Patrick is in it, and he is awesome. The effects are really good, it has some serious suspense, a couple of scares, it's kind of over the top and goes pretty crazy. But what I like maybe the most is the general atmosphere.

Good soundtrack too.",The Faculty

Even though the idea seems to be laughable, it is almost flawless. The idea is crazy, but the acting and the story line is not.One thing, if an alien wants to take over, by killing the queen should not be able to stop the entire alien race, and let all the humans came back to normal again. Overall, I gave it a 8.",The Faculty
98,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Entertaining,Underrated SCI-FI/Horror-Thriller From Robert Rodriguez.",10,15 July 2015,"The Faculty is an excellent,entertaining and underrated SCI-FI-Horror-Thriller that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,a sharp script,fine special effects and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make The Faculty solid entertainment that's Robert Rodriguez at his best.Set in Ohio,The Faculty tells the story of High School teenagers Casey(Eiljah Wood),Zeke(Josh Hartnett),Delilah(Jordana Brewster),Stokely(Clea DuVall),Stan(Shawn Hatosy)and Marybeth(Laura Harris)who find out that their teachers and fellow students have been taken over and possessed by Aliens. With nowhere to run or hide,the teens decide to fight back against the Aliens and survive.After the critical and Box Office success of Wes Craven's Horror classic Scream in 1996 there was a trend and wave of hip and clever Teen Horror films that were released in theaters during the late 1990s and early 2000s(which also included I Know What You Did Last Summer in 1997 and Urban Legend in 1998)and one of the best Teen Horror films and one of my favorites during this time was director Robert Rodriguez and screenwriter Kevin Williamson collaboration The Faculty,a movie that that was a modest success at the Box Office and is a film that combines Rodriguez's special effects driven style with Williamson's dialog and is Horror movie that's truly underrated and very overlooked. The Faculty is a terrific and memorable SCI-FI-Horror-Thriller that would be described as The Breakfast Club meets Invasion Of The Body Snatchers with a dash of John Carpenter's The Thing and is a movie that gives viewers a fun and interesting take on the Alien invasion genre with High School and with teenagers dealing with adults even though the movie isn't serious. The storyline in The Faculty may not be original or creative but the movie is a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink with tons of thrills,excitement and suspense that is done in a over the top style that just works. While The Faculty is a SCI-FI-Horror movie it's not a scary one to make you keep your lights on at night,but there are moments in the film that are suspenseful and intense and will gives some viewers jolts and surprises. As for Blood and Gore there isn't much of it in this film but there is bits and pieces that show up in the movie. The screenplay by Kevin Williamson is terrific and memorable,with Williamson's dialog being clever and witty basically bringing the same type of dialog and style he brought to his Scream screenplay which makes The Faculty funny and humorous at times thanks to some of the back and forth dialog with the characters. While the characters and the dialog make reference to other SCI-FI-Horror movies The Faculty isn't as self aware or ironic as Scream was. The main teen characters are a direct homage to the John Hughes Teen/High School classic The Breakfast Club with all of the main characters pretty much representing some of the main stereotypes you would see in other Teen movies(geek,jock,criminal etc)but all of them are well-developed and interesting becoming more and more likable and heroic as the film goes on and we root for them as things become dangerous and chaotic. The ending of The Faculty is amazing,thrilling and filled with excitement,surprises that will leave viewers satisfied. A great ending.The cast is great. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Casey,a nerd. Jordana Brewster is terrific as Delilah,a popular girl Casey has a crush on. Clea DuVall is fantastic as Stoakley,a loner. Shawn Hatosy is great as Stan,a Football jock that's Delilah's boyfriend. Josh Hartnett is amazing as Zeke,a genius who makes drugs. Laura Harris is great as Marybeth,a new girl at school. Famke Janssen(Ms. Burke),Robert Patrick(Coach Willis),Salma Hayak(Nurse Harper),Piper Laurie(Mrs. Olson),Bebe Neuwirth(Principal Drake),Jon Stewart(Professor Furlong),Daniel Van Bargen(Mr. Tate),Christopher McDonald(Mr. Connor),Libby Villari(Mrs. Connor),Usher Raymond(Gabe),Jon Abrahams(Boy),Summer Phoenix(Girl)Danny Masterson(Messed Up Kid),Wiley Wiggins(Messed Up Kid),Duane Martin(Police Officer),Katherine Willis(Police Officer)and Susan Willis(Mrs. Brummel)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Rodriguez is amazing and stylish,with Rodriquez keeping the camera moving also using freeze frames,slow motion and giving the film a nice style and atmosphere. Fantastic direction,Rodriguez.The score by Marco Beltrami is impressive,suspenseful and intense and matches the tone of the movie. Nice score,Beltrami. There is also a wonderful Pop/Rock soundtrack that includes a great cover of the Pink Floyd song Another Brick In The Wall by the group Class Of 99.The Special and Practical Effects by K.N.B. Efx Group are terrific and effective mixing together practical effects with CGI very well. Great job once again,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Horror films,SCI-FI or Robert Rodriguez,I highly suggest you see The Faculty,an excellent,entertaining and underrated SCI-FI-Horror film that well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Faculty
99,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Really good!,5,24 June 2008,"Okay, you knew everyone in high school was just a little different: everyone looked at you strangely, the teachers were freaky, and you never could find the right groove to fit into. What if it turned out that it was all because your school was inhabited by creepy aliens from outer space? That's the enjoyably cheesy B-premise for this fun and scary flick from the pen of Scream's Kevin Williamson, the master of the post-modern teen horror film. Directed by Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi), it's The Breakfast Club meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers, as six disparate students from Herrington High School band together when they discover that an alien life form is invading both the student and faculty bodies, with plans to take over the world. Each of the heroes represents a different high school type: popular babe (Jordana Brewster), picked-on geek (Elijah Wood), goth girl (Clea DuVall), sensitive jock (Shawn Hatosy), new kid in town (Laura Harris), and bad-boy rebel (Josh Hartnett). The plot isn't much--a basic kill-or-be-killed premise spiked with a healthy shot of paranoia--but Willliamson and Rodriguez do a great job of building the tension slowly but surely. The suspense set pieces are genuinely frightening, and the film pokes fun at itself without deflating its scares; Williamson is a master at shifting gears from comedy to horror quickly and adroitly. The young cast doesn't have a weak link among them (with special kudos to Wood, DuVall and heartthrob-in-the-making Hartnett), and Rodriguez gets maximum mileage from the titular faculty, which includes Jon Stewart, Piper Laurie, Salma Hayek, Bebe Neuwirth, and Robert Patrick of Terminator 2. Go to the head of the class, Mr. Williamson.",The Faculty
100,rollernerd,We Don't Need No Education,6,8 October 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings from the dark...tonight's movie review is The Faculty (1999), where every person in their highschool years would usually question whether their teachers were from another planet...that's right folks, this is a flick of a sea dwelling parasite from another planet who lands in Ohio and takes over a faculty of teachers in a local highschool. What this organism forgot to think about is fighting against a band of misfit teenagers. This movie was enjoyable, which doesn't surprise me since it was made by Robert Rodriguez - El Mariachi, who blends previous adaptation including The Puppet Master, Invasion of The Body Snatchers in the modern era and incorporates it really well. The plot is interesting and you start getting onboard of this journey with the teenagers including Josh Hartnett who plays Zeke the lab guy who mixes a great deal of aspirin and caffeine, Casey played by baby faced Elijah Wood aka Frodo whose father (played by Shooter McGavin) brilliant tells him no more flogging the Bishop, Shawn Hatosy who plays Stan the quarterback who uses the D quite a lot - ""I worked hard for that D, that was my D, I deserved that D"" - yeh interest dialogue, Stokes the sci fi nerd who hates people played by Clea DuVall and F&F franchise star Jordana Brewster playing your cliched editor of a school's newspaper. The guy who steals the show to me is Robert the T2 Patrick as Coach Joe Willis...his performance may seem to replicate his T2 performance but in a teacher sinister like way. Every scene he is great, whether he is standing still in the middle of the football field while been rained upon by the sprinklers or to yelling at his team during practice is just on point. The actors give top-notch performances, the special effects are good given it was made in the late 90s. The movie does have small snippets of the classic (and one of my favourite scary flicks) Carpenter's classic ""The Thing"", however it is no means a rip off. If you want gory sci-fi horror film, give this a crack 6.5/10.",The Faculty

But it turned out quite fun in the end. Rodriguez's unique style that I admire so much is in full bloom. And another thing I must mention is its sticking onto a straight line. It doesn't include useless sequences or side-stories. It showed what it's supposed to show and that should satisfy the target audience.Well, there is not much gore to speak of, yet Rodriguez presents us a few terrifying scenes. There are interesting plot twists, especially the crucial one in the end. The film features a bunch of good yet not-so-famous actors who did their parts nicely. To mention some of them, I include Robert Patrick, Famke Janssen among the teachers and Jordana Brewster and Josh Hartnett among the students.The soundtrack is quite cool and includes Creed's cover of ""I'm eighteen"", ""Kid's aren't alright"" by The Offspring and a brilliant cover of ""Another brick in the wall"" by the act 'Class of 99' which includes Tom Morello etc.",The Faculty

As always in Williamson's great scripts, there are many references to other movies, in this case alien movies. The story is very suspenceful and realistic in a way, because the characters make sense. It was kind of creepy how, at a certain point, no one could be trusted and they had to take SKAT pills to prove it, everyone was a suspect.

106,RockPortReview,90's Teen Horror Done Right!,7,16 June 2013,"While in high school did you ever think your teachers were aliens from a different planet? That's the premise behind Robert Rodriguez's 1998 film ""The Faculty"". Piggy backing off the massive success of the ""Scream"" movies, teen horror in the late 90s was the hottest thing going. ""The Faculty"" has a great ensemble cast featuring Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Selma Hayek, Usher and many others. Also in a bit of strange casting John Stewart in his pre Daily Show days plays a science teacher named Edward Furlong who played John Connor in ""Terminator 2"".We are introduced to the students of Harrington High School in proper stereo typical form. There is the smart, drug dealing Zeke (Hartnett) who is repeating his senior year. The bullied and tormented Casey (Wood), the tough goth like rebel girl Stokley (Clea Duval), then of course the cutesy blonde haired new girl with sexy southern accent, Mary Beth. Rather then being a terrifying and gory horror film, it is more a fun and entertaining blast of nostalgia. Taking hints from movies like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and 50s style monster movies. These movie are also brought up by the characters and follows the formula of ""Scream"" in being self referential.Starting with the insanely intense football coach the entire faculty becomes infected by a shrimp like creature that goes in through your ear and wraps it tentacles around your brain to control you like a robot. The aliens need a great deal of water to survive and the water cooler becomes a popular hangout in the teachers lounge.Casey finds a small pod like thing on the football field and brings it to Mr. Furlong who finds that it jumps to life when introduced to water. Casey and the editor of the school paper Delilah (Jordana Brewster) start to investigate things and then witness the turning of the school nurse Rosa (Hayek). Just thing about that for moment the school nurse is Salma Hayek, needless to say that office must be constantly overflowing. Anyway, Zeke the cool kid deals this white powder stuff that's made up mostly of caffeine pills that he puts in clear pen tubes. They find out that this powder kills the aliens when they stab Mr. Furlong in the eye when he turns on them. Then the sh** starts to get real. The group of students hideout in Zeke's garage where they need to prove they are not aliens by taking a hit off the powder. A scene similar to the one in John Carpenter's The Thing. They figure out that to end this they need to find and kill the lead alien. Eventually one by one they get infected until Casey in one his own and has to save the day.""The Faculty"" is a very familiar story, but it knows what it is. I saw this way back when it was in theaters and really liked it then and still do. As with all teen movies it does tend to date itself and lose a little something in the process. So if your feeling nostalgic for the 90s take a look at Robert Rodriguez's ""The Faculty"". Also look for its bastard step child ""Disturbing Behavior"" in my next review.",The Faculty

109,BadWebDiver,I seriously cheered for the aliens in this movie!,3,7 March 2002,"I didn't have much sympathy for the humans in this story at all.  In most Body Snatcher stories, when the humans get taken over, they're said to lose their humanity, their personality, their dreams, their artistic qualities, perhaps their emotions, etc.  But in this movie, the aliens seem to enhance the characters personality, not detract from it.  They liven up, start enjoying themselves and having fun.  They even become experts at delivering little one-liners (almost like a sitcom character).  What exactly is supposed to be the down side here?!  Within ten minutes of this movie I was seriously wishing the aliens would just hurry up and put everyone out of their misery.  I surrender!And one other thing:-the line ""I only run when I'm being chased"" would have to rank as one of the most corniest plot-giveaway lines I have ever heard; especially as it's doesn't seem to make much sense on any level than as a plot-giveaway line!",The Faculty

Only a group of students can stop them, but the aliens might already be among them as well, and the only way to ferret them out was by the way of illegal drug which one of students happen to be selling. While I didn't really like the premise that illegal mind-changing drugs was the only way to detect aliens, it was an interesting concept. The show builds up its rhythm towards the climactic end quite quickly, and before you know it, the show's over.

The characters are absolutely brilliant and likable from the get-go, and they're outstandingly portrayed by the actors/actresses.Robert Rodriguez has brilliant direction and all the actors/actresses capture the essence and pizazz of the film perfectly to where you're loving every minute this story plays out and the characters interact. The characters are all likable and have their own different personalities to where we care for at least one. The dialogue is spectacular with tons of references to film industry legends and marvels that you're bound to find nifty.The opening chase scene pulled me in and then the rest of the script and acting was what kept my attention because of how admirably it's played out, as I have mentioned. I found myself loving the whole atmosphere, which was set up perfectly, and the story is fun and entertaining. The main alien, when you find out who it is, is not scary or even fresh, but they're intimidating and exciting because of how well the plot is revealed and how wonderful the characacter's work. Another venerable trait is how they are intimidating without the crew trying way too hard to make them seem like they're this cool, edgy alien that you should all be terrified of.The Faculty delivers, and it's an exhilarating ride from beginning to end loaded with humorous dialogue, great action and is brimming with virtuosity. Though some find it average and a bit overrated, I think it is deserving of much more appreciation and acclaim than it receives. Magnificent film, job very well done.",The Faculty

Talented young actors showed us a Horror scenario in a everyday world, and I was really hooked and cared a lot for the characters. Beautiful Jordana Brewster is a sweet actress we hopefully will see again in further projects...Though the film often relied on too many too cheap shock effects, and used the usual College film archetypes (the cool guy, the quarterback, the prom queen, the freak, the outsider and the new girl in town), it worked very well as a whole and has earned my ""thumbs up"".

118,Chromium_5,"I hate to say it, but I loved this movie.",7,10 September 2005,"""The Faculty"" is a bad movie, but it's campy, and when a movie is campy enough there's just no way not to like it. Rodriguez knows full well how campy it is and runs with it, resulting in a funny, fast-paced movie with a real 80's feel to it (thank God). He's also fortunate to have a very talented bunch of actors who understand what type of movie they're in and play their parts to perfection.The opening scene is at once hilarious and bizarre, letting you know right off the bat what you're in for. The subsequent transformation of the teachers and students into aliens is done in a very ""Shaun of the Dead"" type way, and the climactic scene where the kids have to protect themselves by doing drugs is so... well, I don't know what the hell it is, but it's funny. There's also some great suspense scenes and an ending twist that I didn't see coming at all.If I had one real complaint about this movie, it's that it doesn't live up to its potential. The faculty are mighty underdeveloped for having the movie named after them, and I think it would have been a lot funnier (and scarier) if the movie focused on them more, both before and after they become aliens. There's also a VERY cool idea that science fiction in general was invented by aliens to accustom humans to the idea of being invaded, but it's just briefly mentioned and never brought up again. But these are petty complaints. The movie is fine just the way it is, and makes for an enjoyable two hours. I give it 7/10 stars.",The Faculty
119,TheMovieDoctorful,A Strong Case For the Superiority of 90s Horror,10,18 October 2018,"90s Horror never really gets the credit it deserves. Fans often cite the 70s or the 80s as the best decades for Horror (It's the 40s, by the way), often overlooking the 90s as the period where everything supposedly went downhill. Oddly enough, I find myself gravitating to 90s Horror far more than 70s or 80s. Give me Scream or The Blair Witch Project over Halloween (Which I still love, by the way) and The Shining any day. And one of the films that, though often unsung, helped to define that generation is the 1998 Robert Rodriguez film The Faculty. I have very few flaws with The Faculty. If I had one major complaint, it would be this; it's not at all scary. To be honest, it's not even creepy. The aliens and those they possess never really come across as intimidating. Eccentric and darkly humorous, definitely, but never frightening. Their behavior and abilities lack consistency; sometimes they possess hosts post-mortem, sometimes they possess them alive. Sometimes they have heightened aggression, sometimes they're overly friendly. The film never manages to really capture the sense of dread and suspense that other High School horror films like Scream or Jennifer's Body managed to pull off. What kept me invested in The Faculty's emotional stakes, despite the underwhelming monsters and lack of scares, were the characters. I find it unlikely that somebody could watch this film and not find themselves relating to at least one of the teens, they feel more like characters out of a Stephen King novel than your typical 90s teen Horror film. The Faculty does a wonderful job of introducing us to a cast that subverts the expectations and cliches of their social cliques to become something more three dimensional and real; Zeke's a delinquent stoner, but also deeply intelligent and a leader who's wise beyond his years and not as invulnerable as he lets off. Delilah's a popular cheerleader, but with a genuinely sweet and sincere side. Casey's an awkward nerd and a social introvert, but he's incredibly proactive and stubborn and surprisingly tough when the situation demands it. Stokes is an edgy and hostile Goth using her aggressiveness as a shield for her own insecurity and hopelessly in love with someone who represents everything she should (In theory) hate. Even Stan, the dumb, superstar jock, is ambitious and kind, self aware of his own flaws with a burning desire for knowledge and intellect, for significance. These teens are all so fully realized in ways that many characters of High School horror movies before simply weren't. None of them were sloppily thrown into the film for shallow reasons; to die or to provide comic relief or to shove in a popular actor or actress. They're all clearly developed and they all have a strong narrative purpose.The story does a wonderful job initially presenting them for the hollow stereotypes and cliques that they fall into while slowly progressing them into the more fleshed out and three dimensional humans they are underneath. If there's one thing that works about the aliens in this film, it's their significance to the character's progression; while the aliens offer a quick and easy change for the teens into conforming to societal norms, resisting their assimilation of mankind is what offers them genuine growth and progression while still retaining their individuality.The performances are all fantastic. Josh Hartnett is magically charismatic in the role of Zeke, making him instantly likable roguishly charming while still imbuing the character with a deep sense of pathos to make him more relatable. Elijah Wood plays the role of a timid geek about as well as you'd expect, but what really caught me off guard was how convincingly badass he could be when the situation called for it. Shawn Hatosy has a couple of bad reads, but he really steps up his game in the third act and gives one of the most sympathetic and deeply human performances in the film. Clea Duvall similarly shows her best acting around the third act, bringing genuine poignancy and humanity to the role of an outcast trapped in her own self constructed bubble of hostility. The actors playing the teachers aren't half bad either. Robert Patrick is darkly hilarious as the over-the-top psycho Coach Willis, Famke Janssen is clearly having a lot of fun as the shrinking violet-turned-vengeful-vixen Ms. Burke and Jon Stewart does a surprisingly good job in a straight man role as Mr. Furlong.While the horror side of this horror comedy doesn't work, the comedy most certainly does. The dialogue is much more intelligent than you would expect and there are some really clever comedic lines and moments in this film that you might not notice on first watch. Casey accidentally calling Schindler's List historical fiction had me rolling, that went completely over my head on first watch.I absolutely love this soundtrack, one of my all-time favorites. The Faculty has a really impressive roster of indie and alternative rock bands that really help to contribute to the nostalgic, feel good atmosphere of the film. Stabbing Westward, Neve, D Generation and the ironically named Garbage all put in excellent work here and this soundtrack really benefits the film's tone significantly.In closing, The Faculty is a great 90s teen Horror comedy to watch. It's not at all scary, and it severely lacks suspense, but it's a really good film all the same. In fact, I'd easily consider it Robert Rodriguez's best film.(Final note; wow, that Harry Knowles cameo has not aged well at all. Especially given how Harvey Weinstein was an Executive Producer.)",The Faculty
120,benjyboom,Pros and cons,6,3 April 2020,"Pros:
Pretty cool creature design, the aliens and the mutations certainly looked cool
Themes, while unsubtle, weren't unwelcome
Plot made sense
Acting was decentCons:
Characters felt cheesy, even if they tried to be tongue in cheek
Action felt stunted, lacked weight
CGI is spotty sometimesBest part: when the queen first showed up, a chance to show off the creative design and the most action packed scene
Worst part: the teacher trying to seduce the drug dealer, weirdo and almost counterproductive to the aliens' goals",The Faculty
121,psycho_153,EXCELLENT MOVIE!!,9,23 December 1999,"The Faculty was a great movie. I loved the dialogue through out the whole movie. The plot was excellent and the acting was great. Maybe every school kids dream, the teachers are from another planet. Directed by Robert Rodrigueuz annd screenplay by Kevin Williamson you know what to expect a great movie. A especially liked Josh Harnett's performance as Zeke, his cool approach, his little business in the back of the car ""5 buck a pop""Faculty is a must see, it has action, plot, great dialogue, my only protest is that the alien died a little to easily for my liking, it was like they were just trying to end it quickly. But other than that is was an excellent movie.",The Faculty
122,kclipper,Solid stuff from action/horror director Robert Rodriguez,7,19 May 2011,"A young, talented cast and plenty of thrills highlight this interesting take on ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" combined with elements of ""The Thing"". A High School in a small sports town is invaded by an alien parasite that can replicate the human body and blend in undetected. Sound familiar? So be it. Director, Rodriguez pulls off this one with style and humor. From its brutally violent opening to its exciting climax as misfit students battle the unseen extraterrestrials, and of course, parents and police don't believe them, and fall victim themselves until the whole town is taken over with the exception of a football jock, a geeky half-pint, a bitchy beauty, a tomboy and a resourceful druggie.At times, this seems like a metaphor for misunderstood teen angst and paranoia, but comes off pretty slick due to Rodriguez's direction and good pacing. Lots of great lead performances including Elijah Wood (before his 'Lord of the Rings' fame), gorgeous Jordana Brewster and a menacing Robert Patrick. Some pretty cheesy effects make this a fun throwback to 80's films, and a tight script brings life to the action. This is only dampened by an unneeded high school mean-spiritedness that makes some of the characters unsympathetic and withdrawn. Although, with that aside, this is pretty solid stuff from the director of the equally entertaining 'From Dusk Til Dawn'. All the action is finally wrapped up in a good, reinvigorating ending. Look for appearances by Salma Hayek, Piper Laurie and Usher Raymond.",The Faculty
123,boe_dye,boe_dye sez: and we can we knew them when...,9,2 April 2008,"This is one of those movies that jump started young careers. At the time it has a lot of unknown actors looking to break into the business, and you look at it ten years later going ""oh wow, i didn't know _______ was in this!"" It's really a well done film. Not too anything, and just right in all the right places.My wife and i happened across this the other day, and just couldn't believe for a moment that its already 10 years old. Still, it's a good film.Of course, it's not directly an original tale; aliens taking over human bodies to make the world a better place doesn't exactly scream originality. However, it does sort of have a breakfast club appeal to it. The dynamics of all the people who normally shouldn't hang out ultimately do and wind up saving the world.I even thought the ""criminal"" / closet hot teacher thing between Josh, and Famke was something of little boys dreams coming true.All and all, a good movie. Not campy, but doesn't take itself too seriously at the same time.",The Faculty

I wish more teenage horror movies would do that.  THE FACULTY knows we're fed up with the constant cliches and addresses them and avoids most of them wherever they can.  I especially love the opening sequence which was smart and unpredictable.  Kevin Williamson hit the jackpot with this, creating interesting characters.  They all seemed equally important.  The film also has a good ""Whodunit"" aspect.  Overall, an extremely clever movie with simple and effective special effects.",The Faculty
125,gothicgoblin1334,"Everything was good, except for additional scenes and the ending",5,2 December 2006,"I really liked the first half of the movie, original and complex at the same time. Yet once it reached to the scene when they are in the gym, everything went wrong. The film's plot revolves around kids trying to find out if their teachers are aliens so they can kill them and save the earth from learning, every child's fantasy. Clea Duvall is a dark woman, in person and in cinema-her character was a very positive role to me, so beautiful she was with her style, her knowledge, and yet how some aspects of her left me seeing that Kevin Williamson only wrote that part in the ending to anger Goths like myself off. I would have to say that there is a scene with Laura Harris explaining how she's tired of being 'something she's not.' The camera focuses on Stokely, and I just cannot f****** believe how they depicted us. In such a mainstream society, they should be more LIBERAL and understanding of how alternative lifestyles work. We should be treated with respect and not horrible like they did in this film (though for the first half, she is given a positive appearance to the culture as she is clever, smart and witty) which leaves me still in mourning. However, everything else was fine.",The Faculty

127,quiqueperezsoler,90s teen movies meet 80s B-movie sci-fi. A great homage to old-school Sci-fi and a surprisingly well-crafted classic alien invasion story with a stellar cast.,8,26 April 2020,"The film's nostalgic throwbacks to John Carpenter's alien-related work, specially The Thing(1982), with the influence of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1978)"" and the at the time popular ""Men In Black(1996)""; make for a completely self-aware and entertaining experience enhanced by the great performances of the lead cast and a surprisingly well-crafted mystery plot.Long gone were the times were old school alien invasion movies were the pinnacle of sci-fi movies, and this coming from a today 24 year-old. The 80s and 90s provided amazing pulp-inspired horror and sci-fi movies with over the top plots but engaging characters and a coherent self-contained story. Movies which, while over the top and cliched, provided not only an amusing cinematic experience but also added something new to the genre.The film is aware of how cheesy and campy it is as proven not only by its director Robert Rodriguez who will be known for his astonishing B-inspired horror movies, but also by the personalities of the lead cast and especially the conclusion of the story. While the plot might be at times predictable, the movies of the similar-plot genre stand out by the execution and craftiness of the story and this film is no exception. The story grounds itself in the premise that such a concept can only take place in fiction and thus, like the movie Logan(2017) did with the stories of the X-men, provided a story in which they were proven wrong with the notion that ""fiction is inspired in real life events"".While the movie thrives with its campy sci-fi B-movie aspects, it also provides a well-realised scientific base (for example, the way to kill the aliens) and a premise-deconstructing approach by providing an almost realistic reaction to such an event of ever taking place making both tones clash sometimes. That is, the movie at times might feel over-exaggerated for the sake of amusement but it never fully commits to it as it provides some realistic scenes of handling such an event. However, both tones are perfectly written and therefore provide a deeper value to the movie.IN CONCLUSION, the film is an entertaining, well-written teen sci-fi thriller movie with engaging but at times too-cliche characters. It pays homage to sci-fi B-movies-inspired stories like John Carpenter's The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers; as well as 80s teen horror movies in the backdrop of a classic 90s teen movie setting. It has moments of proper character fleshing out as well as convincing measures to prevent such a fictional event.",The Faculty

A bunch of kids - Elijah Wood, Josh Harnett, Clea DuVall and Jordana Brewster - of various levels of social standing within the social hierarchy (whether they accept it or not) begin to suspect that something is seriously amiss with their teachers and fellow students; whether the general mellowing of personalities is necessarily a bad thing in the jungle of High School politics is open to debate!There's a checklist of classic sci-fi films and 1990s cultural references.

It's difficult to say what's worse, the tiresome Breakfast Club' angst or the blatant rip-off of Body Snatchers'. That the film references the films and books it pays homage' to only make things more irritating.It's a shame, because after the visceral high of From Dusk Till Dawn, I'd assumed something better from Rodriguez, who presumably know how to mix comedy and horror effectively. Without a decent script (Williamson's ironic horror well having already run dry), this is nothing more than a collection of poorly conceived encounters leading up to a predictable ending, which on a plus note is at least reasonably entertaining provided you've disengaged Mr. Brain.Scrabbling for something nice to say, some of the characters (particularly the teachers) are over-the-top enough to raise a smirk, and the effects are effective enough, although hardly groundbreaking. And, of course, it's always nice to see Salma Hayek!",The Faculty

I remember liking movies like ""Westworld"" and ""Alien"" when I was a teen and compared to ""The Faculty"" those films were pure genius. And unlike ""The Faculty"" those films still stand up and will still stand up 20 years from now. Unlike another reviewer's comments, ""The Faculty"" doesn't have an original bone it's decayed body. This hideous hybrid of ""Aliens"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" mixed with ""Scream"" (and even the more obscure ""Class of 1999"") is so dumbed down it makes something like Beverly Hills 90210 seem like high art in comparison. Rodriquez has made only two films worth seeing, the ultra low budget, ""El Mariachi"" and the made for HBO, ""The Roadracers.""

132,ichabod81,Superb!,8,16 January 2003,"Kevin Williamson reinvented the teen-slasher films in mid-nineties. Scream was original, entertaining and funny. But then came movies like Urban Legend and I Know What You Did Last Summer (not to mention the sequels!) and the genre started to repeat itself. In my opinion, there has been only two original outings since Scream: The Faculty and Final Destination. The Faculty borrows material from the body snatcher-films, but it only does so with the parasite thing. By moving that idea to this genre (teen slasher that is, not horror in general) and getting people like Rodriguez and Williamson to work on it, I think they've created a fun and extremely entertaining thrill ride. The excellent cast and brilliant photography stand out. It was very fresh to see something else for a change on a genre that was dominated by masked stalkers. I recommend.**** / *****",The Faculty
133,mathmaniac,Loved this Movie!,10,11 March 2007,"I didn't know a lot about this movie when I taped it - I only knew that it was a thriller and it had Elijah Wood in it. Also, the title was vaguely familiar - hmmm, did it have a good rep but I had never seen it?So I taped it (it was on at 2 a.m. on a network station) and finally got around to watching it. Loved, loved, loved this movie! And that's coming from me, a hater of teen horror flicks. First, there's the distraction, when you don't know what film you are watching, of all the 'Oh, Bebe Neuwirth! Oh, Josh Hartnett! Oh, John Stewart! Oh, Usher! Oh, Salma Hayek!' etc., etc.' when you really aren't expecting much. Then there are no distractions as the movie zoomed along steadily, dropping clues, setting up conflicts only to have alliances shift and new conflicts reveal themselves.One reason I never watch teen horror flicks is the pace is too regular. It's as if the director and writer can't gamble letting 3 minutes go by without someone dying a gory death to some telegraphic music.There wasn't too much of that in this movie. I was surprised when Josh Hartnett's character took off with one of the aliens in the back seat. In a cheesier movie, there would be a cut to some other fast and furious slasher action to sort of bring up the intensity. There was just enough time in the wild car scene to keep your attention while you didn't have enough time to ponder how he was going to dump the alien. I liked the tired looking high school and the ordinary houses the kids lived in. None of that 'we're living in Ohio but the houses came from Sherman Oaks.'This movie did everything a movie is supposed to do - entertain. When I saw that it was a Robert Rodriguez film, there was an 'A HA!' moment because this is just what I thought his film 'El Mariachi' accomplished - it entertained. After the movie ended, you had that satisfied feeling that you had been amused and involved and sat on the edge of your seat sometimes.Good flick! That's high praise for this genre.",The Faculty

Didn't have a ton of scares but had some very neat scenes in it. It has a killer cast in it also and is directed by one of the best directors out there. It may not be a typical Robert ROdriguez movie, but he puts his own touch to it. It tells the story about a high school that is getting invaded by aliens. First the teachers become aliens and then slowly the whole city and school becomes aliens.

It doesn't take itself seriously, nor does it claim to be anything other then what it is. It's a fun film with a mix of action, sci-fi, and some horror thtown in for good measure.I liked the actors in this too Clea Duvall was wonderful as the goth girl Stokely and Elijah Wood as the nerd of the group, but neither overdo their part, nor do they unplay it.

The scene where they are all fighting over who is an alien. Carpenter's was twice as horrifying. The scene where the head sprouts legs is directly stolen from The Thing....cool to see the effects though. I loved the characters and the dialogue. I was totally entertained. Well acted.

141,bhicks56,You know what's weird?,8,30 November 1999,"I actually liked this movie. I mean, really liked it! Which I find strange, since I don't really dig the highschool movies of the late 90s. Not like the more superior ones in the early 80s, anyway.But this is an exception. A contradiction, Zeke might say. The premise of this movie is really cheesy, like INVASION OF THE BREAKFAST CLUB SNATCHERS, but don't let that keep you from checking this out. I'm not a big fan of the SCREAM movies, so if you're not you will probably enjoy this more, it doesn't even feel like Kevin Williamson wrote it.The best thing about this movie, without a doubt, is the cast. No one has a weak part, the students don't overshadow the teachers, in fact the faculty has the most fun, I think. Robert Patrick is sooooo perfect as a football coach, he barks and curses and flips over benches full of Gatorade kegs. Bebe Neuwirth (Lilith on CHEERS & FRASIER) fits perfectly as the principal (and so amazingly sexy!!). Oh and speaking of sexy, Famke Janssen and Salma Hayek also appear in showy roles. Jon Stewart was fun to watch (he had the best lines), and don't miss a quick cameo of internet critic Harry Knowles (if you can even recognize him) and Piper Laurie, queen of the crazy religious mothers!One refreshing thing about the cast of students is none of the actors are from the WB! And they can act too. Not too many movies can successfully have an ensemble of interesting characters, but this movie gets away with it. Zeke, a small-time dealer who's smarter than his grades is played with a slacker smirk by Josh Harret. Stan, the reluctant football character who's sick of the popularity contests of highschool is played by the handsome Shawn Hatosy. Casey, the dweeb who cowers like a turtle from virtually everyone is played by Elijah Wood (remember him? TAKE THAT Macauly Culkin!) Stokely, the pseudo-lesbian outcast who shields herself with black anything is played by Clea Duvall, who is strangley charismatic and beautiful under the raccoon eyeliner. Finally, Delilah is played by Jordanna Brewster, so convincingly bitchy you want to smack the t.v. for a while.If you are a big fan of Robert Rodriguez, you would have to wonder if he really made this movie, there's no cartoonish action sequences or zany camera action. The only hints of him behind the camera is the presence of Salma Hayek and the highschool, which looks like it's in the middle of the desert. Though the kinetic editing is a dead giveaway!I'm not going to lie to you. This is a B-movie, but a very enjoyable one. So don't expect a science fiction masterpiece, but don't pass it up as I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, either.Kudos to Mary Vernieu and Anne McCarthy for their great choices of casting!",The Faculty

The direction is actually very good, and the acting is at least passable. Fortunately it didn't take itself too seriously (at least I hope it didn't).

Stokely even has a line that almost matches a Dana Wynter line from ""..Body Snatchers"", calling out to the other aliens, ""He's here!"" Of course, these days a movie has to have at least brief nudity and lots of censurable language in order to get the coveted ""R"" rating, but if it were edited for network TV, it would have the same charm, I think, as the old teen movies that were actually TV-Ready. Scary stuff to make your girlfriend cling. Happy ending for the attractive cast members.So there you have it. Nostalgia, gore, and a decent music soundtrack (you can't go wrong with a Pink Floyd tune). Too bad I was so many years past teenager when this came out.

First of all, there's nothing new in it at all really, the idea is exactly the same as it's illustrious forebears and the whole 'setting it in a high school for the teen audience' thing is getting a little hackneyed but it was pretty enjoyable all the same. The ever watchable Elijah Wood puts in a decent performance amongst a huge cast of well-known faces, some of which have pathetically little to do. There's Salma Hayek, who really should tell Robert Rodriguez not to bother casting her any more, who has approximately 3 scenes, Famke Janssen, (about 4), Christopher MacDonald (2 minutes), Usher Raymond (less than a music video) and so on and so on. Bebe Neuwirth and Robert Patrick have a bit more to do but the rest is left to the 6 teen leads who basically wander around doing very little except looking at people suspiciously in slow motion. The fact that the faculty itself is nailed in the first couple of scenes and their cover blown just as quickly leads the film into it's climactic showdown a little too early. I would have preferred a slower, less intense takeover by the aliens which would have allowed more room for minor characters and a bit of are they/aren't they thought from the good guys. Instead they're convinced in a couple of minutes of what they see as an invasion and there's no going back from there. One nice surprise was the ending itself though which combined a funny (If violent) football game, some great special effects (So THATS where the budget went) and the revelation of who the 'mother creature' really is which, due to some clever finger pointing throughout the film, comes as something of a surprise (To me anyway). The requisite love stories and final romantic pairings are so pathetically unlikely though that I can only assume that they are a joke in the film. Not only have the couples been less than couply, some of them seemed to be the complete opposites at the start of the film! Anyway, I'd recommend it as a nice way to spend 90 minutes but let someone else pay the rental cost as you may feel a little ripped off by the end otherwise.",The Faculty
150,very_doubtful,Pretty nice,8,7 July 2000,"Well, I don't really feel the need to explain that The Faculty was just another film trying to draw the Scream-audience into the theatres (although it is from the same studio that brought us ""Scream""). But contrary to ""Urban Legend"" or ""I still know..."" The Faculty is quite a nice attempt.The Faculty is not really a horror film, it is a fairly entertaining film about teenagers with just a few elements of the horror genre that should be called a thriller-comedy rather than a horror film. It is therefore nowhere as suspenseful or scary as ""Scream"". It is evident that Kevin Williamson wrote the screenplay because the film shows us many allusions to other horror-films like ""Body Snatchers"" or ""The Thing"", though, again, not in such a clever way as ""Scream"" did.Probably the most interesting thing about this movie is the cast. Young people of the new generation of actors (e.g. Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood) were combined with already well-known people (e.g. Robert Patrick, Famke Janssen, Salma Hayek). It was fun to see these two generations fight each other in the movie.While the film is not very predictable the whodunit-question is not very effective in this movie and so the main interest does not lie within this point. But if you are young this film might entertain you anyway.A harmless but entertaining, nice little film that won't totally disappoint you.My rating: 8/10",The Faculty

In this case they invaders are parasites from a planet where they lived in water.  Initially, it is only the Faculty that are affected but then it spreads.  The FX are adequate.

156,davidhutch007,Through the back door Fun!,7,16 June 2007,"Towards the end of the film one of the characters comments that the aliens are ""walking in through the back door"" and let me tell you this film crept up upon me in the same way! What i was expecting from the pen of Kevin Williamson (Scream, Scream 2) was perhaps self induced teen horror with no sense at all. I knew with his previous two credits he could crack the horror genre but could he crack the sci-fi? The answer is a clear and distinctive YES.What you also might be surprised about when watching this film is that it is a Robert Rodriguez film, it's a film where he was tied down by the studio but never the less he makes a great effort all the way through and his direction is clear and crisp and brings the teen spirit of the nineties quite comfortably to the screen.There are some great actors in this movie, Jordana Brewster, Robert Patrick, Josh Hartnett and Jon Stewart to name a select few. Each brings a unique quality to their role and never really takes themselves seriously, rather portraying the overblown, over the top qualities we might expect. However Elijah Wood must be given special credit for his portrayal in the film. If anyone is believable in this film it's him playing his role with good direction via Rodriguez. I felt strongly and was rooting for this character right the way through the film.The film is well paced and Rodriguez shows his talent as director/editor with his ability to pace the film. The fun build takes us to an hour in while the final fifty minutes are pure action/sci-fi glory.I believe that this film is a great effort and a true effort at bringing a bored and out of tune genre back into fashion, while the film does share those characteristics of its Scream predecessors, such as the characters referencing every sci-fi film possible (even using Invasion of the Body Snatchers to help win the day!) it is a great film to sit down with on a Saturday night and settle back into the couch and forget about life.It's time to remember the days when you thought old Mrs. Neckingbottom was an evil alien from mars or Mr. Sideward is the king alien from Zuton, either way its a great memory filler and a great great ride and much better than a lot of trash being released this summer! Overall a great film, special effects dating but never the less the great characters make for a cool and positive experience! ******* out of **********",The Faculty

We've all seen the ""aliens"" taking over something before (town, city, etc.) where the good guys know something's amiss and have witnessed just enough to fear for their lives but noone will believe them, so they have to save the city, town, world, by themselves.  It doesn't hurt to have a hip cast (sultry Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Patrick, Salma Hayek and Harry Knowles in a cameo - ain't it cool!), and although some of the scenes misfire and don't seem to fit in with the formula at work (for instance, the scene where the good guys test themselves to ensure that none of them are aliens is straight out of ""The Thing""), most of the picture is enjoyable.

It's well-written and well-directed, but it aims at giving you laughs and entertainment rather than scariness. The ending may be predictable, but it's such fun getting there!Aliens are infesting humans, beginning with the faculty of a high school. The film opens at a ""normal"" high school. Kids are bashing each other, teachers are bellowing at the students, students are threatening the teachers, students are throwing things, and the smaller, weaker students are cowering in the toilets, terrified. Everything ""normal"", right?But a small group of students, who are all named in the opening of the film, begin to notice some really odd behaviour of several of the teachers. The teachers are being polite, agreeable, even peaceful! The first student to think that they're being taken over by aliens is scoffed at by the others, but it isn't long before the others get a clear demonstration, as the aliens don't stay completely within their respective human bodies.They reach out with tentacles, replicate, and crawl into human's ears, in order to take over control of their brains and bodies, in much the same way as they did in ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". The students soon work out that the aliens will die and things will return to ""normal"" if only they can work out which one the queen is, and kill her. But which one is she? And how do they kill her?The queen doesn't need to infest a body, she can disguise herself as a human body. She's only got one disguise, but it's a good one!When she does reveal herself, and switches back to her alien body, she's one of the most awesome, amazing monsters you've ever seen in a movie. She's really horrible looking, but in a fascinating way! She'd be worth seeing the whole movie for, just on her own, but the rest of the movie is such great fun as well!Two very fine actors are worth mentioning. Salma Hayek plays the nurse. She normally plays in movies of great depth, so it's interesting to see her in a light-hearted romp like this one. And Robert Patrick, who was so brilliant as the new improved terminator in Terminator II (1991) does a splendid job in this one as well.Will our group of heroes be able to find the queen, kill her, and save the planet from alien infestation? Will they be able to get the school back to its ""normal"" chaos, fighting, and trembling in terror? Who will win, a mere handful of students, or the rapidly multiplying thousands of alien body snatchers? I'm not going to tell you, but it's not because it would be a spoiler.

Aliens slowly take over the bodies of the teachers, and a group of outcast high school students are the only ones who know it. It takes a while for all of them to understand what is happening, but by then it is too late. Now it is them against the entire faculty. How's that for a lame story line. I can only guess that this movie is aimed at teenagers, but I don't know many teens who liked it.The script by Kevin Williamson offers nothing new, it simply tries to repeat the success of ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". There is the lame dialogue from the heroes, the one-liners that don't work, and the usual masturbation and sex jokes (""No more flogging the Bishop, son"").Simply put, I have seen movies like this done a thousand times before, and a thousand times better.

One of the things I liked most is that it starts with several stereotypes and during the development it is shown the real person behind those. There are a lot of surprises although you know some of the persons that are infected from the start. Some may say that the idea was copied partially from an outer limits episodes and it does have some elements in common but the fact that it develops on those ideas makes it a movie on its own and not a copycat.All and all this is a movie full of comedy that in the same time keeps you tense until the final moment.

Sorry, but this film didn't have a chance with that kind of star power pushing against it!Nonetheless, this was an outstanding blend of comedy and sci-fi suspense with an incredible, young cast and a concept so utterly corny that it's brilliant.  Elijah Wood (the next Tom Hanks, in my opinion), Josh Hartnett, Shawn Hatosy, Clea DuVall, Laura Harris, and Jordana Brewster prove that they have more than just a little acting talent as they juggle this silly/scary material (which was, of course, provided by THE Kevin Williamson).  Also worth mentioning among the cast, Robert Patrick and Jon Stewart gave their characters a certain menace and charm that fit perfectly in this vehicle.I'd like to close by saying that a lot of people contend this film isn't good because it isn't another ""Scream.""  Problem is, those same people would be complaining if the film had been a carbon copy of the infamous 1996 sleeper hit that started this new teen revolution.  Guys, don't hope for this to be ANOTHER ""Scream.""  Instead, look at it as being the movie that does to the sci-fi genre what ""Scream"" did to the horror genre.

As for being scary, it's not full of ""jumping out of your seats"" moments, but it does have its fair share of them.The only criticism I have is how the group suddenly decide that aliens have taken over, although there hasn't been any UFO's or abductions or anything.

He pulled out the wonderful SCREAM and SCREAM 2 (which doesn't count as being better because it was part of a triology from the beginning.) Also I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, while not being a horror masterpiece, definitely helped re-define a new era of horror movies.Now, Williamson has tried a sci-fi flick in the FACULTY.

Being preceding by more quality (Scream, Scream 2, H20) flicks than bad (IKWYDLS 1 and 2, Urban Legend) ones, I felt ""The Faculty"" could be a good film.  Kevin Williamson has a way of portraying teenagers in both a realistic and satiric spotlight.After I saw the film, I left feeling fulfilled.  I was thoroughly entertained and had a good time.  I did not understand why people panned the film.  What do they expect?  This isn't Shakespeare, it's the horror genre. Not every horror movie needs to be serious (The Exorcist) or absolutely terrifying (Silence of the Lambs) to be good.  This film had intelligent and appealing characters.  that alone is a feat in this genre.Most notable in the cast is Elijah Wood.  He has showcased his acting abilites over the past ten years and he is making a smooth transition from child to teenager.  Wood, like the rest of the cast, makes the viewer care about each character, rather than having a bunch of dolts running around being killed.  These characters make smart decisions and fight back in every situation.  If you want to see a dumb blond take a shower or fall down while running so the killer can catch her, ""The Faculty"" is not your movie.Robert Rodriguez directs a film that is equally appealing on a visual level. That includes the school set, the wardrobe of the actors (Tommy clothes), and the overall look of the film.  Most notable is the scene early in the film that showcases the typical events before school begins.  Rarely has a film ever showcased a true high school moment as when Rodriguez's camera pans across the schoolyard and the viewer sees Elijah Wood being ""poled."" Let me tell you, that brought back some good memories from high school. It is these moments that make this film, and Williamson's scripts, enjoyable.

The result? A mess, every character is a walking cliché written in a napkin: the nerd, the hottie, the bad boy, goth girl, you name them. If you already watched any version of Body Snatchers you just know what is going to happen.

It's 100% serious about what is doing, and it fails miserable. Those two scenes straight out of the The Thing are embarrassing. Sometimes the best way to pay homage to something is by not doing anything at all.But oh well, the natural movie balance gives movies like this their proper place.

But in this high school, the faculty are turning into real monsters, as their bodies are taken over, one by one, by a strange alien parasite. Six students, who have nothing in common and don't even like one another, must bond together to defeat the alien menace and save the planet.The first time I viewed this movie (I have seen it several times since), I didn't quite know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining, and how well done, the film turned out to be. When I saw the closing credits (I'm one of those who reads them to the last word) and realized that Robert Rodriguez was the director and that Kevin Williamson wrote the screenplay, it all fell into place. A first-rate script, a first-rate director, a first-rate cast. The perfect recipe for a first-rate movie.I cannot praise the acting highly enough. Robert Patrick practically steals the show as The Coach, managing to be menacing and hilariously funny at the same time. Bebe Neuwirth, Piper Laurie, Famke Janssen, and Jon Stewart (yes, that Jon Stewart) also put in excellent performances. The actors playing the students, particularly Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood, also prove fully up to the task. Although this is not a comedy, everything is done with tongue firmly in cheek, and there's little doubt that all will come out right in the end. There are some terrific set pieces, my favorite being the Friday night football game, where the opposing players are turned into aliens as they're tackled, with the cheering crowd completely oblivious to what is really happening.I had a lot of fun watching this movie and will undoubtedly check it out again next time it shows up on cable.",The Faculty

Thats the basic plot of The Faculty, a more mainstream film than what director Robert Rodriguez has usually made (Desperado, El Mariachi). Unfortunately, while The Faculty is very entertaining it is woefully short of any original ideas that really set it apart.With a good group of promising young stars (Elijah Wood, Johs Hartnett, Jordanna Brewster) and a good group of older stars playing the teachers (Robert Patrick, Selma Hayek) the film has a good base for its story to sit on. However, that story has been lifted from a film that is regularly mentioned by the characters in this film, Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers. You can also draw comparisons with The Thing and The Puppet Masters, which is a problem for this film. It has a very recycled feel to it, although Rodriguez does get a lot of wattage out of his younger stars. Josh Hartnett displays promise as outsider Zeke, and he is ably supported by Wood's lovable loser nerd. Jordanna Brewster is suitably bitchy as the cheerleader who hates everyone that isn't thin and attractive, although her role has been better countless times before. Robert Patrick, playing the first teacher to become inhabited by the aliens, seems to be sleepwalking through his role. Otherwise, Clea Duvall adds nothing as the supposed 'butch lesbian', although her romance with Shawn Hatosy's jock seems very contrived.Effects wise, there is nothing to write home about. The aliens themselves are too small to really be considered, although the alien queen that appears at the end is as cheesy and poorly realised as any B-Movie effect you've ever seen. This particular plot device is needlessly added on, as Elijah Wood battles the Queen by running away and hiding, and then squashing it in the stand inside the school sports hall.One major point that needs raising is the continued use of Zeke's mind altering drug. It seems that this is the only weapon that will work against the aliens, and we regularly see it used to defeat those people who have been 'taken over'. However, the constant use of the drug by the students is continually overdone, and in todays society we don't really need to see a bunch of teens using a mind altering drug on such a regular basis.There are of course plot holes. if new girl Marybeth is the queen, why does shy happily kill the school head-teacher, a woman who is already possessed by one of the aliens? Why doesn't she just turn into the giant monster thing when Zeke takes her and the others to his house. She could have simply 'turned' them all there and then. If Jordanna Brewster is an alien, why doesn't she just turn Elijah Wood when they are alone in the toilets together? How do the students even know that there is a queen anyway? There is a strong need for people to watch this movie and leave their minds in neutral. Viewed as cheesy Friday evening cinema this hits all of the right notes. if you're looking for grown up and intelligent sci-fi then you've come to the wrong place.Rent, but don't buy if you have any serious love for your film collection.",The Faculty
180,1001,Skip this school lesson!,3,31 December 1998,"The Faculty is a retread of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers; or to be more specific, it's a combination of The Breakfast Club and The Thing (1982). To its only credit, at least it explicitly acknowledges this. Hollywood's stupidity never ceases to amaze me; the whole reason horror movies died out in the first place was because of exploitative, unimaginative, money-grabbing movies like this one.Here is its fundamental problem. Invasion of the Bodysnatchers' central idea is the sanctity of the individual over repression and conformity (written and made in the '50's, read American democracy over Soviet totalitarianism). Freedom beats central planning and control. Good idea. Except by 1998, this idea is hardly fresh. It needs to be tweaked. So The Faculty should have gone one of two ways - either satire, or ultra-serious, into tragedy. Instead, it plays like a straightforward action movie, with all the requisite cliches. Not only is this boring, its directed in a pedestrian way by Robert Rodriguez, who has done nothing of worth since El Mariachi. Kevin Williamson should also be ashamed, maybe Dawson's Creek is taking up too much of his time. Avoid this stinker.",The Faculty
181,the rock-17,Excellent Kevin Williamson movie (again),9,3 September 1999,"With the success of ""Scream,"" ""Scream 2,"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer,"" which are all movies that I really liked, I really wanted to go out and see ""The Faculty.""  I expected it to be just as good, if not better, than the previous Kevin Williamson scripted films I had seen before. Thankfully, he did not disappoint.This film tells the tale of six totally different high school kids, the new student, the football quarterback and the cheerleader, the class geek, the school druggy, and the school loner.  However, this six students come together after realizing that the Faculty have become extra-terrestrial and are taking over the student body.This film had an excellent teenage cast: Josh Hartnett (Halloween:H20), Elijah Wood (Deep Impact which was bad), Shawn Hatosey (Outside Providence), Clea DuVall (Can't Hardly Wait), Jordana Brewster (""The 60's TV miniseries), and with the star likes of Selma Hayak, Jon Stewert, and Piper Laurie, you couldn't go wrong with this movie.  The film was scripted by the now infamous Kevin Williamson (Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, TV's ""Dawson's Creek"") and directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Til Dawn).  With such a great cast and crew as that, how could you go wrong?Everybody, do yourself a favor and go out and see this movie.  It's not serious or Oscar-worthy, but for purely entertaining purposes, this deserves an Academy Award.  Rent it or buy it.  My grade: A-",The Faculty
182,mwpressley,One of the better Post-Scream teen horror/comedies.,6,17 October 2000,"The Faculty was one of the better movies to come along featuring a teen cast after Scream.  The movie features some proven actors and talented fresh faces. Clea Duvall would later turn in an effective, polished performance in the outstanding movie Girl, Interrupted and Josh Hartnett has a lot of potential.  I loved seeing Famke Jenssen as one of the teachers.  I think she is a great actress in need of a good role. Kind of a gothic Julia Roberts. The plot basically consists of the clique leaders of a typical American high school going against aliens invading members of the faculty. This sounds like a pretty tired plot,and in all honesty it is, but it works because of the fact talent actually exists in this cast. This is definitely a watchable film and it has some fun moments.",The Faculty

Sure they had the jock, the beautiful valedictorian, the new girl, the outcast, the geek, and the dropout...but somehow each of these characters were more complex than just that...

The film was surprisingly gory at times, and there were some very well-done special effects.  The camera work was above average (especially for this genre).  One really good scene involved the students sniffing a powdered caffeine concentrate; Rodriguez handled the camera in such a way that I got a very strong sense of how ""tweaked"" the kids were feeling.Also, there were a good number of suspenseful moments that made me jump.  I also liked that I couldn't tell how it was going to end.The acting was fairly good; Robert Patrick was great.  I've always liked Elijah Wood and he didn't disappoint me here.

The essence of comedy is so good, that you can't stop watching it. Elijiah Wood is great. He really knows how to act. Josh Hartnett and Robert Patrick have done great jobs. Some sequences are so extravagant that you die laughing. The hilarious expressions of the actors at the most tense moments are something that Robert Rodriguez does best. The scene when the students have grass to check if anyone of them is an alien is not to be missed. Don't go for the sci-fi details....its a fun movie, so, just enjoy.",The Faculty

Elijah Wood as Casey had a very good impression at me, as I saw the movie. Great acting from all of the younger generation and a huge plus for Elijah. I´m glad to see that a sci-fi movie once again can bee seen in the theaters, since it was a while back. The movie with it´s school scenery and the young actors/actresses gives us maybee a deja-vu for recent films as ""Scream I & II"" and ""I know what you did last summer I & II"", but I can honestly say that I liked The Faculty more, and I recommend it to everyone.",The Faculty
189,BillZane,Williamson does it again,10,28 December 1998,"Kevin Williamson has made yet another masterpiece with The Faculty.  In the first fifteen minutes, he generates a level of cold sweat and tension to rival the infamous opener to Scream.  The excitement never stops from there out.  There are scenes where I held my breath in excitement and fear (the exodus to the parking lot, for example), and there are scenes where I could not stop laughing, like when the parents search Elijah Wood's room.  Each character is believable and multi-faceted, and the plot twists surprise and impress.  Combine this level of writing with an all-star cast and brilliant direction and editing (every single scene was key), and this movie becomes the best sci-fi flick I've ever seen.",The Faculty
190,shankar,don't stand so close to me,7,28 July 1999,"""The Faculty"" was actually pretty good.  A lot of what I liked about it was because of what it wasn't.  It wasn't terribly full of pop culture ""coolness"" like many young films like this are.  It wasn't full of sickeningly likeable characters - they all had flaws (one sold fake drugs and porn, one was mean to her boyfriend, one hated everybody, etc.).  That was a nice difference.  I also thought the story was relatively interesting and told in a nice, fun-to-watch way.  The effects were appropriately creepy and quite good.  My rating was brought down a point by the stupid, tacked-on, ""One Month Later"" scene at the very end.",The Faculty

Ha-ha! Great actors include: Elijar Wood and Josh Hartnett and many other great actors. This is great to see what happens in the end! Does the cool guy get with the dork? Does the cool girl get with the dork? Does the dork save the world? And does the teacher get what she deserves?! Who knows? I loved to watch this film. I think its a film that you can watch a couple of times but thats it, unlike me who loves it and can watch it again and again. Its great to find out what happens. I enjoyed watching this film. I recommend anyone to watch it at least once! :)",The Faculty
192,Flower_of_the_Lily,A guilty pleasure of a B-movie ...,7,9 April 2006,"Okay, it's obvious from the opening shot that this film isn't going to win any Academy Awards - the script is corny, the characters oh-so-stereotypical (particularly the students on whom the film focuses) and the dialogue veers between quite sharp and rather clunky, but this is still a fun, entertaining romp with some unexpected twists and plenty of excitement and even the odd dash of wit.Life at Herrington High is tough for both the teaching faculty (under-funded and under-appreciated) and the students - unless of course you're a cheerleader or member of the football team. At the top of the pecking order come star quarterback Stan (Shawn Hatosy) and his girlfriend Delilah (Jordana Brewster), head cheerleader and school newspaper editor. At the bottom is bullied geek Casey (Elijah Wood, before he became Lord of the Rings) and somewhere round the edges come school drug dealer Zeke (Josh Hartnett) mean and moody Goth Stokely (Clea DuVall) and new girl Marybeth Louise Hutchinson (Laura Harris). Marybeth's arrival coincides with Casey's discovery of what might be a new species of animal out on the football pitch and the very odd behaviour of several teaching staff, and it isn't long before Casey and company begin suspecting alien involvement ...The film takes a little while to get going, but once it does the thrills come thick and fast. Sadly the alien-possessed faculty get comparatively little screen time which would seem a waste of some true talent (including Salma Hayek and Famke Jassen) and only Robert Patrick gets a chance to ham it up as the sinister football coach (and does so in fine style). The characterisation amongst the teens is as aforementioned stereotypical, but everyone does their best - although Hartnett proves woefully inadequate as a bad boy and comes across more as someone pretending to be a bad boy. Elijah Wood is the only real standout, giving a glimpse of future star power, as he turns from shy victim to a guy who takes on an alien army single-handed over the course of the film (as well as pulling off some potentially terrible lines) - although I was left wistfully wondering what Clea DuVall might have done with a more fleshed-out role.Long story short: a fun way to pass an evening without having to think too much. You could do much worse ...",The Faculty
193,Caine-2,Gory fun...,9,27 December 1998,"After Scream 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer, I was worried that slasher/horror films where going down-hill once again.  Don't get me wrong, I liked both films; I just feel they aren't even remotely comparable with Scream.  And, after seeing The Faculty advertised, I figured my intuition was correct.  I'm tired of the Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legend smart-ass college/high school kids who save the day.  Maybe the teenage set get their kicks from watching this sort of thing, but I certainly don't.  I remember the old Michael Meyers (excluding the boring, trite H20 which had no murders after the opening scene until the climax), Freddy, Jason days where the kids got killed, and the adults saved the day.  I long for them again...but wait. I'm beginning to see a light at the end of this dark tunnel...because The Faculty actually entertained me! Maybe it was the entertainingly goofy script; but I believe I enjoyed this so much because it spoofs what Scream intended to startle us with.  As long as high school kids are going to save the day, adults should be the vilain.  Granted, there are exceptions, like I Know What You Did Last Summer; but even I Know Part 2 had a teenager behind the murders.  (Sorry if it seems like I'm giving away part of it's twist, so if you haven't seen it, don't worry; it stinks!)  Anyway, getting back to my point, I've always enjoyed films where kids outsmart the authority figure, Ferris Bueler, even the first Home Alone, and this one is no exception. Adults will like this because it's a reworking of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Puppet Masters (the latter being the more inferior film of the 3, remember there are 2 Invasion's).  The kids will enjoy its rich sense of humor and gore quotient; which isn't extreme, but enough to satisfy. Overall, the film contains Kevin Williamson's usual plot twists and maintains his sardonic sense of humor, (remember the ending of Scream? ""Are you going to tell my mom?"") but also includes a less grim version of the goins on.  It may not be as clever or original, but its more satisfying. It's 1:40 minute running time helps as well, it's almost 25 minutes shorter and never drags.  The acting is adequate. Surprisingly, I liked Elijah Wood...but I hate that Josh (Harnett, or something like that) from H20; he's a boring mess of an actor.  Robert Patrick adds some fine supporting work as a football coach, he's worth the price of a ticket.  The Faculty delievers good time slasher fun. It should give this now dying genre a jump start. Just a word to the screen writers and studio execs., no more ""witty"" films with kids the star.  I'd like to see some adults in these things again. Blade and Vampires are good examples.  Both were succesful (Vampires, despite a $21 million gross opened at number one, and only cost $12 million) and I think the public would like to see more of these...except, of course, Scream 3.  I can't wait to see Neve finally get it!.Overall, The Faculty proves to be more fun than Scream, but with a more ludicrous script.  It's highly entertaining and I recommend seeing it...I know I will again.",The Faculty
194,toaster-8,Classic Rodriguez,7,27 April 1999,"Making no comparisons between this film and any ""body snatchers"" films is impossible, but unlike the recent remake, this is an enjoyable piece of film making by the genius Robert Rodriguez.  Okay, it's cheesy, but that's it's most endearing feature, you can't help loving it, just little touches like the ever increasing amount of water being taken into the school, and the f*** you boy and girl, who scream at each other throughout the film until they get transformed, and then they walk down the hall, hand in hand. Rodriguez is not a subtle film maker, but if he was, films like this and the wonderful El Mariachi would never have been made, and there would be a great void in our lives (well, mine anyway).  Another great thing about this film is the fact that Kevin Williams's hands are all over it, his distinctive in jokes and knowledge of pop culture flow through it without ruining it like Scream 2 was ruined (plus the fact that that movie sucked anyway).",The Faculty
195,BBD-3,All according to the formula....,4,19 June 2000,"This movie actually had some very interesting/imaginative ideas and kept my attention.  The creature found in the football field and the scene where it was put into the fish tank really got me ready for a good sci fi/horror flick.  Then, I started to see the pattern in this movie--suddenly the high school geek, the star quarterback, the disaffected/withdrawn girl, the local drug dealer and the new girl all fall in together to fight the aliens.  How often have we seen that kind of formula in a supposed high school group of kids? Hmm, the ""Breakfast Club"" comes to mind for one similar kind of situation. There were some outstanding actors in the movie--I think Bebe Neuwirth can't help but be the sexy, sultry gorgeous-legged creature that she played in this movie--problem is, she's more a temptress than a High School Principal. The coach was downright creepy and Zeke had his charms.  Jon Stewart was largely forgettable, but Piper Laurie always plays a good character (remember her in Carrie?).  The ending was according to formula--the geek becomes the hero, kills the monster and they all lived happily ever after.  A notable twist in the plot is who turns out to be the alien Queen/leader.  Had it a better ending it might have been better than a 4 in my book.  They really needed to improve that set too-American High Schools may be a bit ragged around the edges, but that building looked like it had been unused for some years before the making of this movie.",The Faculty

Unfortunately, he seems to do a worse job with each successive rewrite.  This film, a tribute/parody of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, seems to support this descending quality trend; it fails in almost every area.  First of all, the pacing is awful; what was tense the first time this plot was done is simply boring now.  Secondly, the ""clever"" references to the novels of Robert Heinlein and Jack Finney suggest very strongly that Williamson has never read the books...or even the Cliff's notes!

This helps the film, and keeps me in a very good mood throughout. I remember how pleased I was when I exited the theatre after viewing it, and having rewatched it numerous times on VCR, my opinion stays the same. And then there is the cast! Robert Patrick is great as ha gets to poke fun at his T-1000 images, Famke Janssen, Salma Hayek and the rest are really good too. The only thing I dislike is the musical score by Marco Brambilla, who also scored ""Scream"". Why would they keep hiring him when his scores are such CRAP?!

BUT, it is fun and some of the cheesy lines had me cracking up. One moment in particular when Jon Stewart is analyzing what Elijah Wood found is particularly bad dialogue and very funny.It's a slow burn but the second half is definitely worth waiting for.

This is a teen horror movie that gives you everything you'd want from a teen movie and everything you'd want from a creature feature, all in one. But what else is to be expected when you got Robert Rodriguez behind the lens? Any other director and this film would be tossed aside as just a teen body snatcher movie. But Robert Rodriguez shows here that he has the style to make it more than that.Now, I've read the script to this movie before I even saw it and I kept thinking to myself, there has to be another draft of this, no way this could really work and be taken seriously... or as serious as you can take a movie like this. Yet not only was I surprised to see how much of the original script Rodriguez kept in, but I was even more surprised to see how well things actually played out. Sometimes I really love being wrong.This film delivers, just as much as any other Rodriguez picture that calls back to the good old days of the Grindhouse and makes us forget that those movies weren't even close to par with these ""tribute"" films that somehow manage to surpass the movies they're tributing. You get everything you want and leave wishing you could spend more time in high school... or at least at this high school.This film, to me, is the second in Rodriguez's own unofficial Sci-fi Grindhouse trilogy.

Basically, aliens start to infest Herrington High School starting with the faculty, and then spreading into the students. Casey and everyone start to notice the weird behaviour, and realise that a species of alien has infested the school. The unaffected people in alien invasion stick together and set out to kill the 'queen' alien I quite liked the films' typical lighthearted and goofy humour. The film is also basically cover of some films, including the ones referenced (The Puppet Masters and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers).But it's also like The Breakfast Club, because the students left over are the most unlikely mix off characters who don't normally get along at all (A druggie-intellect-waster, a nerd, a goth loner, a jock star-quarterback, a new girl, and the school newsletter chief-editor b****).It's not a special horror film, but a good teen/horror/sci-fi film.

Robert Rodrigues, clearly a huge horror movie buff himself, works from a smart tongue in cheek script by Kevin Williamson, and with the help of inspired cast of actors both young & experienced he does a great job with the film. It's clear that everyone involved with this film had so much fun making it - and I see absolutely no reason why viewers should not have just as much fun watching it. My biggest thanks to Robert Rodrigues for making this film, and for everyone else who played in it, especially Robert Patrick, who was excellent as Coach Willis, and Clea DuVall, who's just perfect.

If not the hippest teenagers in the world are being stalked by psycho-slashers, then they are being hunted down by aliens disguised as their school teachers.While the concept of the film sounds original, and the trailer for it gives that impression, the idea is only a new finish on the same old story.  The fact that the alien creatures live such simple lives (drink water, feed off of other organisms--and their goals are to continue doing just this and only this) is irrelevant to the methods used to victimize their prey.  A simplistic and barbaric creature suddenly has the capability to overtake a human being's body and mimic (wasn't that another similar film by Dimension) and memorize all his or her thoughts and behave just like them to entice the ""person's"" still human friends to infect them as well.  And the whole purpose is to conquer the world so everyone can swim and be free together. In short, the thing the alien creatures despise (human beings) are the only things that make them halfway intelligent--on their own, they're the same slimy tentacle flesh eating aliens we've been seeing popping up on the big screen a little more often than need be.  I'm hoping this will be the last this type of film for awhile (and I'm a huge sci-fi fan myself).

And I probably would consider it one of my favorite horror movies except for the fact that the ending was very predictable.  I was thrown off at one point for maybe a second, but other than that, it was pretty easy to figure it out.  You may think that something like this would make me hate the film, but I can't.  It was really enjoyable even if it was predictable. It was just like watching a film you'd seen before, but still loved it.I also want to add that if you're looking for a grade A film, don't expect to find it here.  This movie is supposed to be fun, which it is!!!  And those of you who don't like films that aren't very serious and/or Oscar worthy, then steer clear of this film.

My forte is Sci-Fi, but aliens never seemed all that believable when portrayed in movies. This one is, of course, an exception.Robert Rodriguez salutes classic horror movies, throws sci-fi in the mix, and adds a touch of teen drama to it all. Together, you get ""The Faculty"".Casting was exceptional. Not one actor in this movie was bad. I speak the truth. I liked it that Mr. Rodriguez used relatively young actors to portraythe teens in this movie. Each actor embraced their role, and became it. Even the adult cast was sensational! My only complaint (may others forgive me for saying it) was that Usher's role was played up quite a bit, despite the fact that his role is a little more than a cameo. Forgive me for saying so, Mr. Raymond. Credit must be given to Mr. Hartnett, Mr. Hatosy, Mr. Wood, Miss DuVall, Miss Harris, Miss Brewster, and the many other cast members who really made this film believable.The alien portrayals were excellent! They were far from what was to be expected from a '90s film. Credit to the design team and director for that. The teen drama (and the imagery of typical high school life) were dead-on. Overall, this film is definitely one for the sci-fi/horror collection.8/10 alien parasites. Great work, Mr. Rodriguez! PARENTS NOTE: This movie is rated R.

216,Emily_Baines,Ordinary plot with amazing characters,6,25 August 2019,"Overall, you've got a typical story. There is a school with a shortage of money, there is a bunch of teenagers, there are some aliens. You would say that it is another cheap and simple teen-horror-aliens movie for a boring Friday evening. There is some truth in it, on the other hand, this movie is so enjoyable it is even difficult to discern why it is so special.
The director managed to make a classical script into something more. A casual mistake of those beasty horror movies is to fully concentrate on action and fill the story with dark rooms and screaming aliens. But this is a whole story, we have characters with their lives, we have a school with a lot of problems and even some slight comedy elements which are here not to make somebody laugh but to give this film a beautiful colour of irony.
But the best part of this movie are characters and actors. All the cast is so good, we have Clea DuVall, Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen, Piper Laurie and even a fetus Elijah Wood in one place and they make the best of their characters. Every student has its personality, which is fully developed - not only the core of some traits but it also changes throughout the movie. Furthermore, all of the extras make a natural background and the school in movie looks sarcasticly realistic.
So, this movie guarantees an amazing evening. It will make you well-entertained, it will make you sometimes laughing, sometimes trembling and satisfied after the end of titles. Go on, hook yourself up.",The Faculty

The plot concerns alien beings invading the staff, with a band of teenagers as the heroes. The teens are, of course, mismatched to represent all of the different social cliques, and we get all of the usual Breakfast-Club characters, but the cast is actually very watchable. Josh Hartnett first made waves in his role as the Burnout, Elijah Wood is excellent as the geek, and Jordanna Brewster is totally sexy as the Miss Popular. Both Williamson and Rodriguez were hot young properties in Hollywood when THE FACULTY was released (and both have since lost some steam); the result is great stuff for sci-fi fans.",The Faculty

Seeing the movie, you can recognize a lot of different inspirations that, in and of themselves, aren't terribly original.  It's the way the film decides to piece together bits of other movies that makes it completely original and refreshing.One of the inspirations is the ""Breakfast Club"" .  Its influence lies in the make-up of the kids (a jock, a nerd, an outsider, a princess, etc.) who bond together over unusual circumstances.Other influences include ""Body Snatchers"" and ""Puppet Masters"".  Their influence lies in the basic plot of the movie- people are being replaced (or influenced) by creatures from another planet.Additional influences include just about every horror movie ever made, with elements of sci-fi thrown in.All the above elements are mixed together in an entertaining, original mix that kept me interested throughout the entire movie.The special effects are quite good.  I was actually taken quite by surprise because the commercials and previews don't really give you any indication that there will be any significant special effects.The casting is also quite good.  Although the majority of the cast was unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed all of their performances.

The car scene where Zeke hurls Ms. Burke or whateverhernameis out the window and her head get torn of, and she PUTS IT BACK ON...that's just plain creepy.

230,Martijn,Ok rip-off of the Body Snatchers,7,16 April 1999,"Actually I never intended to see THE FACULTY: we wanted to see TAXI DRIVER in the Film-museum, but more people had that idea, so it was sold out. The only two films in a theatre within walking distance neither of us had seen were THE FACULTY or SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. When you are in a TAXI DRIVER state of mind SIL doesn't seem like a very good film, so it became THE FACULTY by Robert Rodriguez. No opening credits: bad start. I like big James Bond style opening credits, with a music that sets the atmosphere. But the film turned out to be ok. Not because of the story. Kevin Williamson this time did not ""sample"" elements from several SF films, he just copied THE BODYSNATCHERS. Of course he makes a joke about it, something like: ""This is just like The Bodysnatchers. Maybe the same thing happened at Jack Finney's (the writer of the Bodysnatchers) high school and did he write the book as a warning."" and ""The Bodysnatchers is a rip off of a book by Robert Heinlein, The Puppetmaster"". Seems like Williamson was afraid he might be accused of plagiarism... The main characters are stolen from THE BREAKFAST CLUB and one scene is an exact copy of a scene from John Carpenter's THE THING (which bears less resemblance to the original than THE FACULTY does to THE BODYSNATCHERS). I haven't seen the original BODYSNATCHERS, but both the version with Donald Sutherland and the one by Abel Ferrara create a frightening atmosphere of paranoia. Rodriguez and Williamsom: frightening atmosphere? No way. They do make some half-hearted attempts, but it is never convincing. What actually saves THE FACULTY, and is meanwhile one of the reasons the film fails in creating the right atmosphere, are Rodriguez' qualities as a director of over the top action comedy. The people taken over by the aliens in THE FACULTY have more in common with the Martians from MARS ATTACKS! than with the emotionless robots from BODYSNATCHERS. Especially Robert Patrick and Famke Janssen do some nice unsubtle bad guy acting. The action scenes are good, but Rodriguez is at his best again (just like in DESPERADO and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) when he can combine John Woo style camerawork action scenes with bad taste humor. There is a big football match scene which is in the same league as the scene in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN were they enter the bar and the shootout in DESPERADO with the men with the rocket launcher in the guitar cases. So just like in those films Rodriguez makes an ok film with some great scenes in it. Oh, and about the atmosphere: one time it is there. Someone had the great idea to have Layne Staley sing Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick In The Wall"" (in my impression slightly slower than the original). That does create atmosphere (and gave us a new hobby: trying to sing as depressing as possible ""We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control. No dark sarcasm in the classroom. Teacher leave those kids alone."")",The Faculty

It makes no claims to seriousness or art or enlightenment; it's there just please and help you enjoy a couple of hours.A film, on the other hand, makes claims to all of the above, and if it entertains you too, so much the better.That said, The Faculty is a pretty entertaining movie, providing you don't worry too much about stupid plot tricks. Part send-up, part tribute to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the original, not the awful remake), it shares a lot with director Robert Rodriguez's ""From Dusk till Dawn"" and ""El Mariachi,"" at least insofar as action caroms without transition from slightly wacky calm to mindless, bloody violence.There's humor, some cliched high-school satire, and some decent special effects.

Some actors who play in this movie are, now really known all over the place, for example Elija Wood or even Usher, who doesn't have such a huge contribution but who gives the movie a ""sweeter"" look.

And even though the movie had good special effects, it still relied more on the actors to deliver a good solid movie than it did the special effects.

""The Faculty"" is certainly a great 'mix-'movie--a movie in which contains more than one 'genres': this one includes nearly ALL of them: comedy, action/adventure, [drama], horror/thriller, sci-fi;...and no-matter-what, ""The Faculty"" will shock you. Stars like Elijah Wood {Casey} and Josh Hartnett {Zeke} aid this movie to great success--and the hot actress who plays 'Stokely' {Clea DuVall} does a great job and has a helpful and quite interesting character. The plot and storyline is magnificent--and when everything falls into place--the horrific thrills get you...certainly they do..Though the excessive use of the f*-word is quite plentiful--the High School activity is pretty dang real---and I know. So, overall, ""The Faculty"" is truly an awesome movie, and any ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""-/sci-fi fans should see it.",The Faculty

I was really excited to go see it, because it looked promising, and it really was. The only actor I knew of in the movie was Robert Patrick.The cast is pretty good and if you're a fan of John Hughes, which I am, you will realize that these 5 main characters have certain similarities to the cast of ""The Breakfast Club"". We've got the jock, the goth, the popular girl, the geek and the criminal.This movie has a lot of great soundtracks which are performed by Offspring, Creed, Class of '99 and more.""The Faculty"" is nothing extraordinary, however it is highly enjoyable and it would be great to show to your friends if you're having a party.Rating: 7/10",The Faculty

I was just channel flipping and all of a sudden I heard that voice.This movie probably is pretty lame, but just the fact that Jon was in it makes me give it 8 stars. I watched the parts with Jon in it and that is about it. I don't know why he thinks he is a lousy actor. He's funny as all get out.I did warn that this is prejudiced.Elijah Wood is pretty creepy in everything he does, so, no points there. Selma Hayak!? Wow, what a surprise! I am convinced that the people who are in this movie chose to do so because when they were in high school themselves, they were convinced that their teachers were aliens. That has to be it.But....Jon...with a goatee, no less. Nice.",The Faculty
253,dangerous_mind,The Alien Generation - guaranteed to jack you up,8,1 December 2005,"Let's just begin by saying that the classic concept of body-snatching aliens is something that either works like a charm or fails miserably to ignite your fire. Fortunately for the Faculty, the setting (a rather shabby high school somewhere in Ohio *I think*) and the story (aliens slowly taking over the world, starting with the faculty, then on to the students... a good idea, if you think about it, pretty believable I mean) give this film some credibility and the amusement factor is high. And I say, high. An excellent cast - this goes for the young blood playing the crazy cocktail of highschool stereotypes as well as the veteran actors who portray their teachers - and cleverly used special effects make this movie a must-see. My favourite teachers were Robert Patrick's menacing, creepy coach Willis and two thumbs up for Famke Janssen's awesome transformation as Ms Burke. As for the youngsters; Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett as well as Clea DuVall did a great job.I felt especially sorry for Casey at the beginning of the movie. That pole-bashing thing - ouch! Anyway, you won't regret watching it so hurry to the videostore. Now!",The Faculty
254,Evan Locci,Skip The Faculty and enjoy your recess.,3,12 December 1998,"Basically, a poor concept film.  Think, Breakfast Club meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Like The Breakfast Club, it has all the stock characters of the school's mythologized hierarchy (the jock, the outsider, the brain, the popular one...).  And, like the film it verbally associates itself with, Invasion... or Heinlein's The Puppet Masters; run-of-the-mill Ohio (middle America) is the site of an insidious plan to re-populate the Earth with Alien parasites.  The concept and narrative thrust of the film is re-tread material at best.  There's absolutely nothing new or interesting in this film.  Robert Rodriguez's direction is woefully uninspired and Kevin Williamson's script is his worst yet.It appears that with the release of this film, coupled with the recent and terribly executed remake of Psycho, John Carpenter's Vampires, and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer - that the fairly recent and much talked about ""re-birth"" of the horror genre has come to an abrupt (and welcome) end. Consequently, the wait for a new horror film to come along and breathe new life into this once again tired genre has begun.",The Faculty
255,M.Ray,"Such Trash, it amused me",1,14 January 1999,do they really feel the need to make movies like this? what compels people? i've seen better film on teeth. i'm sick of this teeny-bopper trash.,The Faculty
256,Evil Al,I'm not a bitter person... per say...,1,30 January 1999,"I saw the Faculty a while ago, and let me tell you, I felt sick after walking out of the movie theatre.  I don't get sick often... but this movie did it for me.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good bad movie, but this flick was E-V-I-L what does it spell?  EVIL PURE AND UNADULTERATED EVIL AGGGGHHHHHH!!!!Kill me.Anyway, the concept was a bad re-hash of invasion of the body snatchers, (as I'm sure everybody else already pointed out), the acting was alright... in that bad kinda way, the special effects were good, the storyline made me cry and cry like a little girl for hours and hours.This is basically a trendy new teeny-bopper horror flick which, instead of featuring a knife  wielding psycho in a mask (ala scream), it features a giant alien... that dehydrates easily... I guess it's sweaty. It's like watching Dawson's Creek... with an alien!  I hate UPN
In summation, this is just a bad piece of trash that has a ""teen"" angle, and a sci fi angle, it accomplishes the former in that kind of bastardized way that makes you angry, and doesn't accomplish the latter at all... plot holes... OH GOD THE PLOT HOLES!  As a teen, it offends me that the movie studios are trying to pass this junk off to us as ""hip and scary"", I guess I'm not that hip, the faculty shoulda stayed in the lounge (stupid pun, I know)0/5",The Faculty

Kevin W. does a marvellous job on the script with my only complant being that it's somewhat predictable.All in all I say it's a worthwhile movie and you should at least see it once and form your own opinion.",The Faculty

Okay, I'll have to admit, it does look a bit like 'bodysnatchers' but I think it's supposed to look like it or else the movie wouldn't have a meaning. But the special-effects are SO good! The acting is perfect. And I like the idea of mixing old well-known actors and new, not so well-known actors, in one movie. I also think it's good that the aliens doesn't turn into ugly green monsters (then the movie would be lame) I've seen this movie three or four times know and it just gets better and better.

261,gailbob006,The Faculty,8,30 October 2006,"I watched the film on DVD today and i thought that it was brilliant. My friend liked Josh Hartnett he took a brilliant part as Zeke Tyler. I didn't know this person but he was great. I also reconised simmular faces. Piper Laurie she played Mrs Karen Olson. I have seen her in other films as well.The films that I've seen her in is Tim,Carrie,Return to Oz, Trauma and this one. But i didn't see her in many parts really but she did well. I also reconised a singer Usher Raymonds. He was great too. The beginning was strange because Robert Pactric who played the coach. One minute he was doing something, he turned around and he was talking to somebody. He said ""what do u want""? Then the alien had got him. And i noticed something about it. I didn't see Mrs Olson get turned into an alien then i saw the rest of them get turned. I thought that it was strange but i thought that when the pupils were saying about shot the ringleader and i thought that Mrs Olson was the ringleader but she wasn't it was a blonde bimbo. And i was puzzled after that. But i thought that it was a fantastic film. I like all of the scenes. When two pupils ran into the Faculty office. They hid in the cupboard and they saw the coach and Mrs Olson and another teacher having a glass of water and second minuter i knew they were turning her into an alien and that was a twist. Then Mrs Olson saw somebody in the cupboard and the coach had opened the door and one pupil had something in his hand and smacked the coach. Then the lass shoved Mrs Olson on the floor and that what made me think that she was the ringleader but my friend and i were wrong. The film had so much action and i will definitely watch that film again. I was surprised that Piper wasn't in many scenes but she was great and she will always be a great actress.I didn't know many actors from the film. The film had many special effects what was great. I cant see any criticisms in that film and also i thought that the film was scary because they was a woman who had died. There was a man who just in the shower and then he heard footsteps. He thought that it was his friend messing about but when he had opened his eyes a woman had ran to him. Her face was awful. She had warned him that they are after everybody in the school. Mrs Olson said that she had cancer and thats what she had died of. At the beginning of the film they were gang of teachers sat near table talking. Mrs Olson acted really friendly and that. She had to go and second minute she saw the coach and he was chasing her and Mrs Olson knocked on the door. She said that she had forgotten something and the teacher was begging for her to open the door quick and second minute i knew. Mrs Olson had killed her. I liked Mrs Olsons glasses that she had on. She looked funny in them. i thought that the film was interesting and it was easy to get into. All of the actors were brilliant and i hope that i see Piper Laurie in more films. I thought that it was a change to see something about Aliens because I've seen Piper in films like Carrie. She had to act like a religious freak who hated Carrie. And i thought that it was a change to see a film whats different. Gail",The Faculty

263,Lew-3,"Derivative & Gory, but Good Humor",6,26 December 1998,"At several points in ""The Faculty,"" its derivation from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and Robert Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" is openly acknowledged.  It differs from those earlier works in that:  (1) there are a half dozen high-school-age protagonists, and (2) the aliens initially co-opt the bodies of teachers.The personalities of the teenagers are well-developed, particularly the Elijah Wood and Clea DuVall characters.  Although Wood is the star, Bebe Neuwirth gives a standout performance as the principal.  Although the last half of the film degenerates into a bloodfest, there is a surprising amount of humor for a horror flick.  Of that genre, ""The Faculty"" may be the best film of '98.",The Faculty
264,GTOJudge,definately cool,10,29 December 1998,"This is definitely a cool movie. It is funny, suspenseful, and scary. It represents the teenage life rather well.

265,Athena2,A great sci-fi movie!,9,9 January 1999,"I was expecting a cool slasher movie with aliens.  Instead, I got an excellent, creepy sci-fi story about 6 kids who try to stop aliens invading their school.  It's like The X-Files meets Scream, which isn't surprising considering Kevin Williamson wrote it.  This is one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen.  Don't be fooled by the fact that it's gory, about aliens and is teen-oriented. A must-see for any sci-fi fan!",The Faculty

The tributes to old sci-fi were welcome and well-placed; some were even subtle. Definitely better script-writing this time around. (My inclination is to say that those who disagree probably didn't get all the inside jokes.)Robert Patrick's performance was fantastic, as were those of most of the main characters. Elijah Wood was good as usual, though I'd like to see him play someone besides That Guy.The only thing that annoyed me was the theme of female sexuality as being one's downfall... but I can't really complain, since it's straight out of the Cold War era movies it's drawing from. I didn't find it homophobic at all.Overall, yes, it's the Breakfast Club meets the Body Snatchers. But they've done a great job of it.",The Faculty

Im a fan of Robert Rodriguez movies and how he makes his movies sort-of comical, like the style of the movie is ripped out of a comic book or graphic novel. Nonstop thrills from beginning to end.

Borrows heavily from 'The Thing' and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' among others. Good teen cast, proficient director, excitement, frights...this film is strong all round, and better than most teen movies of recent years. The adult members of the cast including Famke Janssen and Robert Patrick definately seem to be enjoying themselves, while Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett have gone on to bigger (though not necessarily better) things.

271,Beeorn,Best Studio Sell Out Ever! EVER!!,9,24 October 2006,"Robert Rodriguez, best known for the startling dichotomy of the Mariachi trilogy to the Spykids trilogy, makes studio teen horror cool here. With a cast that can't be beat, including my favorite actress of all time Famke Janssen, and a script that holds together despite its far-out premise, this movie has all the makings of a repeat viewing attraction. Most of the young cast, Josh Hartnett, Jordana Brewster, Clea Duvall, have gone on to great careers, and it kind of started here. Add in veterans like Robert Patrick, Bebe Neuwerth, Salma Hayek, and my all time favorite actress Famke Janssen, and it all clicks. The movie has enough thrills and chills to keep most horror fans engaged, and enough of a sci-fi premise to have the nerds drooling. Plus some partial nudity and a lot of sex talk adds a lot. I always enjoy this flick, seeing as its on television every few months. It never gets old, kind of like The One and Drop Dead Gorgeous. As for it being a sell-out, it was Rodriguez's first major studio flick, and had the master of sell-out Kevin Williamson writing it. But it still rocks.",The Faculty
272,neko-1,Cute film and great cast,8,29 August 2001,"After seeing Pearl Harbor I decided to check out another Josh Hartnett film, and eventually I decided on the Faculty. When I first heard about it I already knew that this wasn't going to be an ""Oscar Quality Movie"", but, who cares? I mean I already knew it was going to be full of cliches and was a ""Breakfast Club meets Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"" film but that did not keep me from enjoying it. Actually, it turned out better than I expected it to be. The cast was great and all the actors were really talented, especially Josh Hartnett and Clea DuVall who I really hope will become famous (though I don't think we have to worry about Josh since I think he's pretty famous after Pearl Harbor =) The script was funny and clever, the actors were great, and the story was good too (but that might be because I haven't seen Breakfast Club nor Invasion of the Bodysnatchers).I give this movie 8 out of 10 (u rule Josh!)",The Faculty
273,soerenft,"Watchable, but could have been so much better",3,27 April 2008,"The Faculty fits in squarely with the multitude of teen horror movies released during the late 1990's following the success of Scream, although it adds science fiction to the mix, and not entirely without effect. The plot is basically a rip off of everything from Invasion of the Body Snatchers to The Thing, only relocated to an American high school in 1998: you almost expect someone from Dawson's Creek to suddenly walk onto the set. As such, there is nothing here that most haven't seen before.The strength of the film lies with the cast, and it is particularly the casting of the teachers that I find excellent; I am tempted to say that had it not been for the compelling supporting performances of people such as Bebe Neuwirth, Piper Laurie and Robert Patrick, the film would have been dismal. The teen leads are good as well, though the characters are entirely formulaic, and I cannot help but feel that most of these young actors and actresses could have been replaced by any number of their peers with little noticeable difference. What kills the film is that it is so predictable, with absolutely no attempt to bring anything new to the genre: The script is surely one of Kevin Williamson's weakest efforts, and the direction is uniformly uninspired. The opening sequence is bland and pointless, and by the time we reach the final showdown at the end, I didn't really care.With a stronger script and a more accomplished effort from the director, maybe this film could have been really good. As it is, The Faculty is only really worth watching for the supporting cast.",The Faculty
274,agenericperson,Invasion of the Crappy Snatchers,5,11 October 2015,"Word of advice for writers, if your story idea is unoriginal then referencing that fact can give your story more credibility. However referencing how unoriginal your idea is repeatedly will only hammer home the point that we, the audience, should be watching better films.That brings us to the oddity that is The Faculty. This film is entirely a product of its time. You tell right away this film was conceived in an office somewhere to be popular with the MTV generation. The soundtrack is a hodgepodge of what you'd hear on the radio at the time. The setting the film up as a high school version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, or rather The Puppet Masters as the film is oh so willing to remind us, feels like shameless pandering. You can even see the jock vs outcast sentiment echoing through American youth at the time, the same sort of cultural sentiment which only a year later escalated into the Columbine Massacre. The film's saving grace was the fact it occurred at a time in which R rated films could be marketed to youths, because let's face it the film wouldn't have worked without the gore and the monster effects.The casting is really off here. Sure there are some great actors. There's also a rare on screen appearance by Jon Stewart. But all in all the casting choices give the film a lack of cohesion, like they just threw a bunch of random people in a movie.There are some great moments in the movie. It's probably worth a watch for the curious, but I wouldn't expect much going into it. It's basically a high school version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers where drugs are used to save the day (it sounds more interesting that it is). There is a plot twist near the end that is is predictable only because of how stupid of a twist it is. You'll be saying to yourself, ""I bet... No wait, there's no set up for it.... That's too stupid."" The film could have been saved a little more if it played up it's campy elements more, played more to the underlying humor of the concept. There are moments where it does this, for instance the football game where the team has signs with ""kill"" and the coach is moving with such cartoonishly gleeful gestures. Moments like this are great. Sadly they are few and far between. It's hard to believe Robert Rodriguez directed this.",The Faculty

But what really makes it amazing is the actors, Josh Hartnett gives an unforgettable performance even though that it is his third role. With amazing performances from other actors such as Robert Patrick from the classic Terminator 2 whom plays one of the best villains i have ever seen.This film is an instant classic that brings a story unlike the rest of the film written from Kevin Williamson, he makes us believe that he can actually make a film that is similar only by the way the characters are written and not based on a insane slasher killer like his other film which are still incredible by the way. Robert Rodriguez brings what the film actually needs; action, suspense and evil teachers. It has an excellent soundtrack that actually fits in the film and creates the high school universe. Kevin Williamson also emphasizes on how much teachers can suck and that all teachers could be aliens.You will not find a teenage sci-fi, horror, action, thriller, high school movie like this one in the 21st century. They don't make films like the faculty these days. No actors these days apart from a very small group of actors could ever be even close to the performances in this film.

A most people know, this movie is about these students who believes that their teacher are aliens. One by one, the teachers affect the whole town except for them. It's like the movie ""Alien,"" the few good guys get alienized one by one. There's one scene that I really like where the 6 students left and they begin to suspect each other.The script has it so that YOU begin to suspect the characters one by one. It's a really cool scene. Overall, I liked it a lot, though the previews are completely retarded because they were trying so hard not to give anything away.

279,GabeCruz,The Faculty - A waste of talent,5,29 December 1998,"I knew long before I went to see The Faculty, that it probably would not be a classic.  But I thought, between Dusk til Dawn & Desperado director Robert Rodriguez and Scream/Dawson Creek writer Kevin Williamson, I could count on at least getting my 6 bucks worth.  I was wrong.  Everyone seems to be trying and the performances rank from acceptable to very good, but the material just isn't there.  Williamson has not written another Scream by any means.  I would be fine with that myself.  This movie felt rushed.  Despite its obvious flaws, it could have been so much better.  The entire first hour is almost pure set-up, and the pay off is terribly contrived and lame.  It almost felt like Williamson resents the audience of his films and this was some cruel joke on all of us.  And what of Robert Rodriguez?  His technical flair seems to have diminished.  Or perhaps the material was so lame, it gives him little to do.  I tend to want to believe the latter, because I expect much more from Rodriguez.  Perhaps its worse crime is the complete waste of acting talent.  We have some great actors from numerous generations represented.  Why waste Jon Stewart and Salma Hayek in such throw away rolls?  Robert Patrick repeats his T2 roll effectively and Bebe Neuwirth is pretty good when she gets a little screen time.  Piper Laurie I would have preferred to see in a sympathetic adult role instead of being reduced to roaming around the halls like a zombie.There are a few good points.  There are a few good jokes sprinkled through out, mostly provided by teens snorting some homemade crank-like powder and acting like morons.  The special effects are not painfully digital looking (most of the time).  And a few moments of suspense are to be found. Unfortunately it's just not worth other 90 minutes of complete and utter boredom.  If you must see this, wait til it goes to the bargain theater or video.  I would warn you also not to take a date to this movie.",The Faculty

The tagline ""The Breakfast Club meets The X-Files"" couldn't be further from the truth.  To even mention The Faculty in the same sentence with those two degrades them both.  The Faculty's plot is full of holes and scientific oversights that keep it from being a respectable science fiction film.  Also, it uses the same stereotypes for high school students that were beaten to death in the eighties.  There were several pitiful attempts to raise emotion in the viewer by portraying the poor high school student suffering some grave injustice at the hands of his elders.  Overall it was a poorly made film cashing in on the newly revived teenage market.On the other hand, it did have few cute girls.",The Faculty

The Faculty is good for many reasons. 1) It is not afraid to be dirty, vulgar, or, in some cases, disturbing. Most of the scenes are filled with violence, cursing, and drug abuse, which fit in well with this off-beat story. 2) It's cast, although not the most noticeable cast, is perfect. I didn't see one thing wrong with the cast selections. I'm glad they stuck with Elijah Wood instead of Macaulay Culkin as the nerd. 3) It has an original concept, sort of. Aliens taking over the school by aliens by coming teachers is not a good plot summary, but it comes to some pretty neat and entertaining concepts.

284,B.N.M.,A BRILLIANT MIX OF SCIENCE FICTION AND TEEN HORROR,10,8 March 1999,"This is without a doubt one of the best sci-fi films of the last decade. In a recent trip to the U.S. I had the pleasure of viewing this film(seven times) and loved every minute of it. It is a perfect example of both Kevin Williamson's and Robert Rodriguez's talent. It has a silly-sounding story, aliens taking over a school disguised as teachers, but you don't think about that as you are blown away by brilliant special effects, fast-paced action, smart-worded script and brilliant acting from both the teachers and the students. There is also the sexy Famke Janssen, Jordana Brewster and Laura Harris, and for the girls there's Josh Hartnett(I suppose). As for who the queen alien is, it will be easy for some people to guess, but surprising for others. For those who don't like horror there's the science fiction factor, including a brilliant shot of the alien in the school gym at the end. And for those who don't like science fiction, there's quite a lot of horror(or horrible scenes) like fingers running around on their own, a head crawling around on octopus-like legs, while its body searches for it in the background, and teacher being stabbed in the eye with drugs that affect it, it then begins to splurt white stuff, similar to that of the androids blood in ALIENS But it does take a teens perspective and is aimed at a younger audience(although not that young) and is so not that gory. So there's something for everybody, you should go and see it as soon as you can.",The Faculty

Where there is an episode where parasites take control of some star fleet officers who get super strength and act weird and in the end they have to kill of one guy who is the mother of these things which kills all the parasites and in the end everyone is set free. Sound familiar its exactly like this film. What a complete and utter waste of my time this film was, don't watch it people.

Who will survive? Who is behind all of this? Will the aliens win, or will the humans? Only one way to find out, watch the movie, you may be pleasantly surprised, I know I was. This is my favorite movie of all time. It is actually very funny, and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Elijah Wood does a great acting job, along with the josh hartnett, Clea duvall, Shawn hatosy, Jordana brewster, but not so much laura harris, although she does play the part well. There are many twists, and they are usually so obvious that we do not expect them. I highly recommend this movie. A+++++. This movie is great, especially since it was made in 1998.",The Faculty
291,Damien-3,Theft is still a crime right?,3,6 January 1999,"This isn't a horrible movie.  Bad.....perhaps, but not horrible.  Basically its just Kevin Williamson doing what he does best, taking parts from great movies and smashing them together to form a decent rip-off.  Sure, Scream was good and it ""revitalized"" the horror genre, but look at all the crap that it spawned: I Still Know..., Urban Legend, even the often-mentioned Scream 2 was just a substandard rip-off of the original.I'd just like to take a stand right here and say that if I see one more movie where the big nasty at the end ""just happens"" to look like the xenomorph from ""Alien""'s twin brother, I'm going to demand my money back. The original design by H.R.Geiger was inspired, too bad nobody else seems to be.Besides the the alien design, my biggest problem with the movie has nothing to do with the cut-and-paste plot, but rather with the shotty camera work. If the theatre playing the movie aims it a little low on the screen you'll see that half the shots in the movie have the microphone clearly dipping into them.  The fact that nobody bothered to re-shoot the shots or digitally erase the microphones indicates to me that even the people making the film weren't very interested in it.I'm not going to go into detail about the obvious plot gaps and rip-offs in the film because they've pretty much been covered in other user comments, I'm just going to says that they are every bit as bad as the other commentors say they are.In the end, however, you're not likely to go to a movie like ""The Faculty"" expecting to see art in motion, you're going to go to see things blow up and to have some fun.  To this end ""The Faculty"" does its job, ""From Dusk 'till Dawn"" did it better, but ""The Faculty"" will still satisfy the anarchist lurking in all of us.",The Faculty
292,Dmitry Mogilevsky,"Save your money, let The Faculty quietly die in agony.",1,10 January 1999,"My movie standards aren't too high, but even I agreed that Faculty blowed. It's an evil cross between Alien and a high school movie.  The plot basically revolves around the fact that aliens invade a school somewhere in Ohio.  These aliens have the ability to turn every human they come across into one of them.  A bunch of teenagers discover this and try to kill them off before they take over the world.  A whole bunch of high school movie stigmas and stereotypes are in this picture, ie an academically successful head cheerleader who dates the star quarterback, a nerdy kind of guy who by the end of the movie gets the cheerleader (This is VERY believable.  You practically see it happen every day).  There is also the freaky girl that everyone think is a lesbian, but who in fact has a crush on the quarterback. If you guessed that she hooks up with him at the end, you were right.  And there is the ""dude"" who is a genius who uses his brains for the wrong cause -- selling ""drugs"" and porn on the campus.  So they all team up to beat the aliens, and in the process find out more about themselves, I guess.  This isn't the most thought through part of the movie, in case you can't tell.  I gave this movie a rating of 1 (awful) in the IMDb survey, because the characters are not trustworthy, the plot is overused and unpopular, and the stereotypes were used hundreds of times before.  My advice -- don't bother to see or rent.",The Faculty

I enjoyed a few of the bit parts, but they didn't support the heavy, second rate thriller tactics. However, the scariness of the film is this:  It's a watered down take on modern conformity put on by the clothing brand of the year, Tommy Hilfigger. It's a ninety-minute commercial for the clothing that has taken the nation by an artificial storm.  By presenting teens with a watered-down vision of being independent while wearing the same brand name, Tommy has hit upon a marketing strategy so brilliant and evil that it makes this reviewer look at third world countries with longing.",The Faculty

You've got the geek (Elijah Wood), the outcast (Clea DuVall), the popular girl (Jordana Brewster), the genius/drug dealer (Josh Hartnett), the jock (Shawn Hatosy), and, of course, the new girl (Laura Harris). Throw them in with a bunch of aliens and you've got one fun film.The students of Herrington High have always suspected their teachers were from another planet...what high school students don't? Coach Willis has been unusually calm lately, and seems to have a strong taste for water...not to mention how weird the rest of The Faculty has been acting lately. After Delilah & Casey (Wood & Brewster) unwittingly witness a murder, they realize they are right...that The Faculty has been transformed into aliens, and is intent on taking over the students of Herrington High, not to mention the town, the entire world......and it's up to an unlikely group of students to stop them before it's too late.""The Faculty"" is the latest installment from screenwriter Kevin Williamson, who penned the ""Scream"" films & the hit show ""Dawson's Creek."" The script is smart, though not as brilliant as the ""Scream"" films. The cast...no complaints. Terrific performances from everyone, especially Josh Hartnett (who was also in ""Halloween: H20""), Clea DuVall, Elijah Wood, Robert Patrick, & Famke Janssen. The soundtrack is ear candy...perfectly compliments the film at the perfect times. Give a listen to Class of '99's remake of ""Another Brick in The Wall."" The special effects are done pretty well...when you finally get a look at the alien, you'll be impressed.The cast of students is, as follows: Josh Hartnett as Zeke (the genius/drug dealer), Elijah Wood as Casey (the geek), Clea Duvall as Stokely (the outcast), Jordana Brewster as Delilah (the popular girl), Shawn Hatosy as Stan (the jock), Laura Harris as Marybeth (the new girl)...and as The Faculty: Robert Patrick as Coach Willis, Salma Hayek as Nurse Harper, Famke Janssen as Miss Burke, Piper Laurie as Mrs. Olsen, Bebe Neuwirth as Principal Drake, Jon Stewart as Mr. Furlong, & Daniel von Bargen as Mr. Tate.""The Faculty"" may not be as brilliant as ""Scream,"" but it doesn't fail to deliver with scares, thrills, a few laughs, cool aliens, and creepiness.

Although way too predictable (geek gets hot girl,freaky girl gets football player,timid new girl is not what she seem) The film does however score in the special effects department and the concept is believable (for a sci-fi film).

The stars shine, especially the young Clea DuVall  who should be recognized by more people.  The only reason I even liked ""She's All That"" was for her and Rachael Leigh Cook, who is a good budding young actress herself.  Let's hope Clea is recognized more when ""The Astronaut's Wife"" comes out!  Over all, this movie deserves my recommendation!

You already know that it's in the same vein as'Bodysnatchers,' etc. Anybody who *doesn't* know this but saw and enjoyed the Scream flicks or the ""I Know ..."" movies is likely to enjoy this.No, it doesn't really have the same underlying Red Scare theme of the original Bodysnatchers (or Arthur Miller's Crucible), although it *is* about what every modern high school movie seems to be about: how much their presumed roles imposed on teens makes their lives painful, and how great it is to unleash those strictures. Sure, it's not Bergman, but who really expects haute couture from a sci-fi horror flick? Oh, and any 'homophobia' attributed to the movie (as opposed to some of its high school student characters, just as occurs in real life) is questionable at best.""The Faculty"" is no more and no less than another entry in 'new geek cinema,' slightly more intelligent and self-referential than your standard SCI-FI Network fare.

Although it doesn't even compare with some horror flicks, it was definitely one of the best main stream horror flick of the past few years. Unfortunately, since then a few lame flicks have tried to duplicate that success (only H20 and Scream 2 were half as good). Now, finally, we have a winner. The Faculty is about as entertaining as it gets. Robert is one of the best directors out there and he does a great job with a pretty good script by Williamson. Over all, this is a great flick.

328,pussycat-2,repression,1,18 December 1998,"The Faculty was a well-paced, fun, senselessly entertaining film on the surface until the subtext within the plot reared its ugly head. The film quite blatantly made references to such classics as The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers which can be fun (although one of my favorite homages of the year has to go to the several allusions to The Conversation in Enemy of the State, but that is another story). Many sci-fi or disaster films of the 1950s symbolized the threat of the Red Scare and the containment and destruction of communism. In The Faculty lesbianism (and homosexuality in general) is the threat to social normality that has to be contained and destroyed-- violently destroyed. What on the surface of The Faculty appears to be liberal is actually embedded with extreme conservatism. For young republicans and homophobes in society this should be very refreshing. However,as an example of enforcing surplus repression it is highly disturbing. Here we are approaching the new millennia and people are still as up tight as ever about social ""norms"". I do not want to be totally unfair. This is the first time ever that Elijah Wood did not irritate me. Overall, the acting was good from the students and the faculty. Robert Patrick and Piper Laurie were very refreshing and we were spared from too much Usher as he did not have much screen time. The sound was particulary good and some good cinematography as one should expect from Rodriguez. But shame on you Robert for ruining my experience by throwing in an agressive, mean-spirited homophobic subtext. Well, hell, if you don't want to think and just passively watch the images flash across the screen, then most likely you will have a good time.",The Faculty
329,jsun,analysis of movie,10,28 December 1998,"You start with an amazing writer, add to that a great director, mix in an all star cast, and how can you go wrong??  This is a modern retelling of Invasion of the Body Snatchers with a twist...using Williamson's pop culture references, this movie knows what it is and tells you.  such references like the Shooter McGavin gun shot w/finger from Happy Gilmore done by the coach to Casey's father, aka Shooter McGavin from the movie.  and as for the directing, i still can't forget the scene by the pool when Stokley's being chased...the slowmo shot was awesome.  all in all this movie was well done and very entertaining.  this just proves that when you combine great writing with great directing and fresh new rising stars, u get a great movie...a must see if for no other reason than to enjoy yourself...",The Faculty
330,raindrop-2,great,10,31 December 1998,"I went to see this movie because of Elijah Wood and Kevin Williamson. It was a lot better than I expected. I really liked it.  It was well written, acted and directed. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that it was promoted with Tommy Hilfiger. It was hip, it definitely rocked.",The Faculty
331,DarkDyer,"An entertaining flick, brain candy really.",7,28 December 1998,"The aliens have landed,.,.,again, and a bunch of high school kids are the only ones who can stop them.

332,MovieBuf-18,The Faculty - Teenage Review,8,28 December 1998,"The Faculty was just another one of those decent horror movies which will probably do better on video than in the theaters.  Will it live long in our memories like Nightmare on Elm St?  Or even spawn several sequels?  Probably not. When the theater lights went dark and the credits began to roll, judging by the opening scenes, I could tell I was watching a movie which had potential; Rodriquez's direction was on target and Williamson had written another dark tale of suspense.  But as the film progressed, I realized that like many other horror films this year such as I Still Know, Urban Legend, etc. it was only a reminder to us all that there aren't much original ideas floating around in Hollywood anymore. If you have seen such classics as Invasion of the... and the PuppetMasters, then trust me, Faculty is simply a '90s version to those classics. In IMDB I was debating whether or not to give the film a 7 or 8.  In the end I gave it an 8.  Here's why;  Out of all the crappy horror movies which have been released this year, this one comes out on top.  The characters were believable and the special effects were pretty damn good. Rodriquez keeps the film at a pace where the viewer should never feel bored, especially in the fight scenes where everything from heads to fingers are decapitated with lots of blood. So if you are looking for a movie to see with your friends on the weekend, look no further, the Faculty is sure to please.  Just don't expect too much.",The Faculty
333,mac-65,unpredictable and suspenseful,8,27 December 1998,"I thought it was good up until the end.  It lacked a really suspenseful climax and eliminated any thought of a sequel, but the rest of the movie made up for it.  Can't be ruined with a pathetic sequel, like most other movies of its type.  Good date movie even though mine had to call home during the best part....ha! no kidding",The Faculty
334,PrincssN,"I admit, I liked the movie!",8,27 December 1998,"I was almost positive going in to see this movie that it was going to be this winter's Disturbing Behavior. Instead, within the first few minutes, I was screaming at the screen. I think this is one of Kevin Williamson's best (much better than I Know What You Did Last Summer or even Scream 2), kind of like Scream with a monster instead of a guy in a mask. I had fun at this movie, with all the twists and turns in the plot, even if it was a little on the gory side. It is senseless fun, like a horror movie should be. This is me loving this movie!",The Faculty
335,az24,Great fun!,10,27 December 1998,"So I'm as sick of these hyper-articulate teen movies as everybody else (even though I did really like Scream), but this movie really underplayed the whole hyper-aware talking thing and worked it into the characters and the plot. Instead, you get a really fun ""theater"" movie, i.e. the kind you really connect with the rest of the audience at. I don't scare very easily, but the movie made the Body Snatchers/Puppet Masters stuff feel fresh again. And, as opposed to Robert Rodriguez last film, From Dusk Till Dawn, this actually played down the gore (okay, there's still a lot, but it's more tasteful, if that's possible). The ads don't do this movie justice at ALL. In fact, for the first time in a long time, the trailers don't give away even 5% of the movie. Go see it now!",The Faculty
336,Matty-16,Seen it done before and always better...,1,28 December 1998,"The cut of the film I experienced was horrible with a microphone visible in almost all the scenes that had dialogue, which, given the poor quality of the dialogue... gave me something to focus on...

337,L.WING,All you ever wanted in a High School Horror Film...,9,28 December 1998,"This movie had most of the elements of a pretty good horror film.  All the characters were interesting, if cliche, and like any well done 'group of heroes' film you had your favorites and your friend had his. You get a lot of different points of view that way. Some will say the movie stole 'concepts' from other films, but what it was doing was presenting an homage to the great horror films and stories. (Example - see what Kevin Williamson did with Scream, very similar). It had elements from Heinlein's PuppetMasters, The Thing, They Live and a half dozen others. Throughout the film references are made proving this fact.This movie is the High School, saving the human race, fantasy, and it has most of the elements that your imagination would conceive if you were in the same situation.  See it for what it is.  It's a fun Horror/Sci-Fi High School adventure. It also has some decent special effects, and a wondering on who will come out the hero of our group of friends, kind of like Sigourney in 'Alien'.See ya, LW",The Faculty

It had a compelling plot, some hot actors, frightening and action packed scenes, and some gore, which makes the film all that better.  It definitely should be the bet for the holiday season.",The Faculty

I was absorbed in the movie from start to finish. Very well directed. Very suspenseful. Great special effects.,The Faculty
341,TRACI-3,Not too Shabby,10,30 December 1998,"I thought the movie was fairly good, but it wasn't the greatest. Like others have commented, it is a combo of the breakfast club and the body snatchers. I have to say though, it was refreshing to find a dimension film without a phsychotic guy running around killing everyone with a sharp object. It had the over exaggerated cheerleader captain, the nerd, the slacker, the dark anti-social, jock wanting to be more than just ""a jock"", and the new girl. Overall it wasn't terrible, but I think the age of ""scream"" films are over, for at least a while.  But hey, the flagpole thing was something I never saw before. And one more thing.... The film had those Tommy Hilfiger adds with a lot of Usher in them, and then to find he only had a tiny part, sorry Usher fans.",The Faculty
342,Holly-19,The Faculty,10,31 December 1998,"This,to me, was a very good movie. It might not be ""The Next Titanic"" but it kept my interest. I am NOT a sci-fi fan.

345,introdus,Heathers meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers.,8,2 January 1999,"You know how early on in ""Pulp Fiction"", when Travolta and Jackson are talking about Big Macs in Paris, you say to yourself ""Jeez, have seen a thousand movies about hoods like these and, but of course, this is what these characters must actually be like in real life""?Well, think of how many movies have tried to depict life in High School. What the experience was like.  We all know it, even those of us who lived it many years ago.  But even the best of the High School movies -- ""Heathers"" or ""Clueless"" or ""Ferris Bueler's Day Off"", put on that little sheen of glamour that we all know wasn't present in the real experience.Just after the opening, credit sequence in QT sidekick, Robert Rodriquez's new flick, there is a quickly edited scene in front of a midwestern High School. And Bam, there it is, High School as it really and truly is, in a burst of actuality that makes even the marvelous ""Heathers"" (a movie ""The Faculty"" borrows from rather shamelessly) seem like so much Hollywood fluff.Ah yes, that rare and wonderful feeling; you know you are in competent hands, about to experience a rare and delicious treat.And you are not to be disappointed.  ""The Faculty"" has many, many joys.  To wit:Tense and well paced action that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and has even a jaundiced old cynic like myself, rooting for the good guys.Teenagers that seem, well, like real teenagers, with relationships that have the nasty, cruel, sexually charged edge that, as far as this viewer knows, hasn't changed since the dawn of history.Pungent, painfully funny, misanthropic satire.A thorough lack of the usual pandering to the ever absurd Hollywood motivational system.  There is a particularly telling moment.  The little band of unpossessed kids find themselves temporarily safe.  In Hollywood terms, it is now time for them to bond, to put aside their petty little squabbles and face, together, the task of saving the earth against horrific odds.  But, thoroughly terrified, they continue their very real and bitter sharp-shooting at each other, made all the more intense by the horrid situation they find themselves in.Marvelous performances by relatively unknown young actors and actresses. Particularly fine is Laura Harris II as MaryBeth, utterly convincing as the spunky outsider.So ""The Faculty"" occasionally gets a bit too enamoured of its own cleverness.  So it steals shamelessly from ""Heathers"", from ""Terminator II"", from ""Predator"" and, of course, from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".  The amalgam is uniquely and richly original, funny, nasty, incredibly tense and real.  Real in just that wonderful way that QT sometimes manages. Actuality, in human, motivational terms, inside situations that have no connection whatsoever to the world as we perceive it.Go see it.  Soon.  A movie this good can't last more than a week or two.",The Faculty

353,savini,Nothing New,3,22 June 1999,"I used to like Robert Rodriguez' movies. I liked ""Desperado"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and especially his contribution to ""Four Rooms"". But what Robert delivered with The Faculty is really a shame. Take the characters from ""The Breakfast Club"", add the plot of ""The Body Snatchers"", add some elements from ""The Thing"", ""The Hidden"" and similar movies and what you get is a boring mixture of stuff you have seen many many times before. You know, when I read all the positive reviews I feel I'm getting old. It seems to me that all the positive reviews were written by persons who are that young that they don't know all the movie classics. Of course, a movie containing (stolen) ideas from several good films must seem brillant to them. It's just like listening to the radio - nothing new, just samples of former hits. A young boy told me how much he liked the song ""Once upon a time"" because of the nice theme. He didn't know that it had been ""sampled"" (stolen!) from the soundtrack of ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". Well, to sum up all I can say is that if you are a film buff and have seen several hundreds of movies including all the classics, you really CAN afford to miss ""The Faculty"" and wait for a film that has something new to offer.",The Faculty

357,kazeem,Yet another teenage firm but....,8,24 June 1999,"There have been teenage thriller films in the past and in the present were the kids take the situation quite cool,were you have to figure out the bad guy and which reminds you of how much you miss school if you are out of school and working. What makes The faculty most unique is the fact that each character is very distinct from others and the fact that you really don't have to start working out mysteries. The film has a good story line,a great bunch of characters and of cause thanks to Tommy Hilfiger for adding color to the show but of cause it has a few flaws;the acting was not all that except from cassey's performance,the bad guy here is way too unrealistic(people fear more realistic things) and we never knew the root of the alien invation,we just found out that there were aliens in a high school in Ohio. It's a great film to watch and it's definitely worth renting or buying but not for those who want to see a more serious thriller",The Faculty
358,R2D2-14,Loved it!,10,4 August 1999,"Yes, of course, this film owes, well, itself, to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", but the point is that it's done in a new, cool way.  Kevin Williamson takes basic alienation between teachers and students and makes it real, and he does a damn good job of it.  The horror parts really are scary, the action is set up incredibly well, the dialogue is real and can be extremely funny, and the paranoia stretches right to the end.  If you're a sci-fi or horror freak with a good sense of humor, I suggest you rent this immediately.",The Faculty
359,london_eye,An excellent treatment of a familiar story,8,27 April 2005,"Of course the story told by this film (aliens land in small Mid-West town and start taking over the humans) is very familiar but it is still a great story and this film tells it as well as any of the others (and better than most). There is a lot of humour, many very good action scenes, and some really nail-biting suspense. But what really makes this film special are the main characters: a delightful group of funny and interesting students, who have to cope with the trials of high-school life as well as the demands of defending the Earth against an insidious alien invasion.If you know the other films of Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn) you will find another film which displays the same wit and assured lightness of touch that makes this director's work such a pleasure.Great Stuff!",The Faculty
360,barbaraap,This movie rocks,10,2 August 2001,"This flick was great. I liked the style in the beginning. The main characters get introduced to you when they walk by the screen freezes and you see their names. I was hooked from that point. The actors are pretty good, but Josh Hartnett (Zeke) and Clea DuVall (Stokely) are the best. I never heard from both and was surprised by their acting skills.Clea DuVall is gonna be a big star in future (I hope) and Josh Hartnett probably already is (Pearl Harbor) Go and see The Faculty if you can!",The Faculty

363,bebeoldwurth,The science is real(ish),10,11 August 2021,"This movie came out along with a very similar movie by the title Disturbing Behavior. This was the far better movie, both commercially and critically. The Faculty is highly derivative of the 50's ""Red Scare"" movies, particularly Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It also borrows very heavily--particularly in creature effects--from John Carpenter's The Thing. Nevertheless, it does so more so as an homage, and it in no way feels cheap or a rip off. From this standpoint it does rip off Wes Craven's Scream, with characters directly referencing horror movies as a way to understand the problems they are facing in their own movie. Nonetheless, the movie is great fun and a pretty good horror movie.",The Faculty

365,sonnycorleone,awful teen horror,1,14 November 2001,"of the many things i hate in the world, conformist unoriginal mediocrity is one of the highest on the list. the faculty is not a film it is a product obviously aimed an naive teenagers who have far too much time on their hands. i dont know where to start my criticism (/public health warning) of this film. so i will summarise the plot, with no exagerration: (***** WARNING .....I DONT KNOW IF THIS BIT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SPOILER ??!! BUT DONT READ IT IF YOU ACTUAL INTEND TO SUBJECT YOURSELF TO SUCH A VACUUM) some teachers at some high school turn out to actually be slugs, but not the sort that you find at the bottom of your garden.....oh no, that just wouldnt be scary enough. these are big fat sluggy things that are supposed to be 'aliens' (ok, so you can allow for a bit of 'artistic licence'). so it takes a group of shallow and uninspiring kids about half the film to realise that nature didnt intend that to be normal, and then they get 'chased' by these slugs, except for they lock themselves in the school sports hall or something so that minimal amounts of money had to be spent on set design and they have these completely empty conversations. eventually, after no climax or emotional build up, the director/producer decides that its about time to stop the film (after all, theyve already received the ticket sales income) so one of the emotionless actors has a miraculous epiphany, and realises that the only way to kill these slugs is not with slug repelent....but to take a biro(pen)take the ink funnel out, fill the tube with salt(i think) and stab it in the slugs eye (because these slugs have eyes btw). so you get this hilarious 'dramatic seen' of kids running round stabbing slugs with pens and after some stereotypical, melodramatic dialogue the torture ends. this film left me seriously disillusioned with life!!!! dont let it affect you sorry that my review was so amateurishly written, but i didnt want to waste to much time on this vacuum. hopefully you will see the funny side of the 'film' in that it is just so bad..... so i will conclude with one of the deep paradoxical taglinesThink your teachers are aliens? You could be right.wow, the decisiveness and thought that went into that one.",The Faculty

HECK YES SON.I have seen the Faculty over 30 times(no joke), and i am telling you, every time I see the football scene, with Usher infecting the other team, and the refs not doing donkey about it, that is some creepy stuff, Just the first infection on the football field, im hiding my eyes because it really makes you think, like ""oh man, he just did the whole vein's and white eyes thing, man, maybe the ref's have them and when no one's looking they infect everyone, or maybe..etc"". See this is why Rodriguez is one of my favorite directors, because he is so goddamn good at what he does, he literally makes you believe this is happening in wherever it's happening.Now , iam a little upset, because a few days ago I bought the DVD for 20 bucks, and when i popped it in my player, The only Bonus Features I got where ""Captions"" OH and My personal favorite, ""Recomendations"" WHAT THE HECK IS THIS. I wanted some rad commentary hearing Hartnett,Wood,DuVall,Brewster,Harris and that other Jock guy that just get's infected and no one really cares about him cause he's a pig..anyways, yeah, so now i hear?

Elijah is wonderful as usual, and the way he runs when he's being chased, made me laugh 'til I almost choked.

368,crazy-ass-mike,the teacher is an alien!!!,8,22 December 2007,"Let me just start off by saying that my English language is limited and I am sorry for any grammar mistakes The faculty was one of the first movies that I desperately wanted to give a second view. The thought of teachers turning their students into aliens gets many teenagers thinking that it is inevitable to prevent them from becoming one. I was glued to my seat every second of the movie and I can honestly say that I am a true fan of this movie. There is a student (played by elijah wood) who finds out that the teachers have been taken over by an extra-terrestrial force. Shocked and stunned by that fact, he tries to convince other people to give a last stand in hope for mankind. Nobody believes him at first but eventually he assembles a team to try and stop the alien-teachers from global domination.Based by the story ""invasion of the body-snatchers"" they try to do what the people in that story could not accomplish (I could be wrong about this though).It's actually an amazing movie according to me and one of the only movies in that time that deserved a second view. The characters are different from one another but find out that they have to put their problems aside and team up before they become one of them. Nobody trusts each other and nobody's secure about anyone telling the truth, and that's actually a great concept. They used it in the movie ""the thing"" in which people aren't sure who is an alien or not and also find a way to test everybody, exactly like in ""the faculty"" The movie is somewhat predictable at times but mostly recovers it with another action/suspense scene in which you don't want your favorite character to become one of the aliens. overall I think they did a good job on this movie and every time I get a chance to watch it on TV, i most certainly will I'm not saying that this movie is a classic among the other horror movies or thrillers but it is certainly not the worst movie in your local videostore. You should check it out if you don't have any other movie in mind worth seeing i give it an 8 out of 10",The Faculty

370,kshyhooo,Does anyone ever wanted to kill his teacher?,10,25 October 2002,"I wanted to see it because I was curious what Williamson/Rodriguez connection can come up with. I have to say I was very curious.Kevin Williamson has gained popularity as a writer who has opened a new chapter in ""theory of fear"" - a teen horror. He portrays a generation X - cynical teenagers brought up in a pop culture where chilling stories are no longer mysterious (everybody knows what happens next). But he shows that stereotypes can also be fun - if they are properly mixed up.The movie cleverly bases on assumption that most of us thought once that some of teachers are weird, least to be said. The tagline says: ""What if your teachers really were from another planet?"".Literally.Williamson delightfully juggles with references to classic movies ,almost in every point you find something familiar, even if you're not a movie lover. A group of main characters is version of ""Breakfast Club"" band- at the beginning they barely know each other, but they are forced to stick together. So there is a rebel, a beauty, a newcomer ,etc. The thing which unites them is their alienation, and common danger- everybody around is an enemy...I liked the cast, especially Laura Harris and Shawn Hatosy. Josh Hartnett is a version of Kurt Russell from ""The Thing"". There are also some cheesy supporting parts, like Famke Janssen or Robert Patrick (remember T-1000).As for Robert Rodiguez he did what we like him for- a piece of entertaining slaughtery, where viewer asks for more meat (thanks for Salma Hayek anyway). And my compliments for a special effects staff. Really nice job.To sum up: good horror sci-fi ride with a couple of chilly moments. So If you're planning a saturday night-horror-feast with your friends don't forget to rent this one.P.S. And don't forget to listen to ""Another Brick in the Wall""",The Faculty

It uses teens, which isn't all that uncommon, but the teens they use are. The enemy is hilarious in an ironic sort of way. A great movie and a must see.",The Faculty
373,JonteJak,Fantastic fun sci-fi horror thriller from the late 90s - ENJOY!,10,28 August 2017,"The Faculty is one of my all time favorite movies. From the start I want to let you know that I could be a little biased, it probably isn't the best movie of all time but I have such fond memories from the first time I saw it. I watched it in the cinema on a class trip to Stockholm with a bunch of friends when I was 14-15 years old and I thought it was awesome! Since then every time I watch this I just have the best time.The story could be described as a different and more modern take on ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". It also has some elements from Scream and other horror/thrillers from the same era.This movie captures so many things that I enjoy. It nails the late 90s feel with the music and how people dress. It doesn't take it self too serious. It has some twist and turns. The visuals are really great even by today's standard.It has some great established actors such as Salma Hayek, Robert Patrick, Jon Stewart and Famke Janssen. And it also have a lot of actors who were in the beginning of their career like Jordana Brewster, Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood.From what I understand this movie is fairly unknown to most people. I have never met a person in real life who have seen it or even heard of it. I really want people to see this movie and just have fun. Don't take it to seriously. Just dim the lights, pump up the volume, sit back and enjoy this fun sci-fi horror/thriller! :)",The Faculty
374,kjmiller-327-79840,Hilarious,4,16 December 2012,"Lets get this out of the way; the acting in this movie is terrible. The plot is absurd, and the dialog is ridiculous. This movie is really entertaining to watch, however. I have no idea whether or not this movie is intentionally funny. I don't see it billed as a satire or a comedy, so I gave it 4 for being unintentionally (supposedly) funny. Josh Hartnett's face literally can't show emotion. I've seen like 7 of his movies, and I'm convinced now of this. Prepare for that dead-eyed look on his face the entire movie YET AGAIN.Elijah Wood is trying. But he just doesn't look his part. He looks like a dork but he doesn't play one that would rise to the occasion as much as his part calls for. Jon Stewart's goatee. Shooter McGavin is in this movie. Hyde is in this movie. Salma Hayek and Jordana Brewster are crazy hot and bad in this movie.If you're like me and enjoy well-known people in bad movies, this is your movie. If you want a competent horror or thriller movie, this is literally the worst choice you can make.",The Faculty
375,wparker2,'The Faculty'... More Like 'The Facade',5,2 March 2008,"Science Fiction films are truly unique in regards to their unbridled potential to comment on, and question the world in which we live. Due to their ""other worldly"" elements, truly powerful and subversive ideas can be embedded in a well-executed Science Fiction film. 1998's ""The Faculty"" is not one of those films. In fact this Sceam-If you Know What I did Last Varsity Blues of a movie not only does not question authority, as it's trailer would have you believe it does, but rather it plays an active role in reinforcing the dominant ideology. On the surface level this film seems to be advocating against conformity. The ""outsiders"", in this case very thirsty slug/squid/alien/parasites take over the minds and bodies of their human hosts. Starting with the high school's teaching staff, the aliens begin turning everyone into fairly emotionless drones, all acting in unison with the common goal of infecting everyone in the school, then the town, then the world? It's then up to our out-cast heroes, who for one reason or another figured out that something just wasn't right to save the world. So this seems like some pretty counter culture stuff right? Clearly the authoritative conformists are presented as the enemy, and the ""free-thinkers"" are the ones we're meant to root for. Unfortunately this is not as a result of the film maker's illicit intentions. In fact the only subversion that seeps into this film comes from the fact that it is more or less a watered down version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a film that actually was saying something at the time it was made. The fact of the matter is that this film in many ways is endorsing conformity. One example arises when we learn that Clea DuVall's character 'Stokely' has lead the school to believe that she is a lesbian, so that people would leave her to herself. Many of the main characters, including those whom we're meant to identify with, treat this subject with toxicity. Their treatment of this guise is homophobic at best, and when we learn that she is not in fact a lesbian, and actually really likes the star quarterback, we're presented with a cinematic sigh of relief that this character wasn't actually that far from the status quo. Further dominant socialization steps in when we examine the ending of this film. Our pretend lesbian Stokely, who in the beginning of the film dressed in dark makeup and black clothing, now is dressed up in her Tommy Hilfiger clothing and is dating the quarterback. Little Elisha Wood has stopped looking like the nerd he was at the beginning of the film and is now looking like everyone else, cool also wearing his Tommy Hilfiger clothing. But wait now that you mention it they all seem to be wearing Tommy Hilfiger clothing. Everyone the same",The Faculty
376,diablo1444,"Stupid, and funny because of it",8,27 April 2005,"This movie was absolutely hilarious. The plot was inane, the movie knew it, and made use of it to make it funny. This movie does not have to work to make you laugh, its simply spontaneous. It's like the Scary Movie series in this respect. The fact that it stared many contemporary and future stars such as Elijah Wood and John Stewart makes the whole thing even funnier. Josh Hartnet manages an excellent portrayal of the character he is playing even if his later attempts have been less than stellar. Even the overdone special effects combine with the ridiculousness of the plot to make this movie a thoroughly entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.",The Faculty
377,jacobbrown2003,Decent Movie,8,20 December 2005,"The movie is of an alien invasion which infects a high school. This summary makes it sound like a teen movie and to some degree it is but they don't stretch it as some movies do - Such as in Without A Paddle. Overall I like the movie and found it well worth watching. The movie is nothing awesome but still enjoyable. The movie is marked as a comedy but I would definitely not consider it to be in the comedy genre. For a '98 movie and a low budget the effects are not bad at all. As for the acting I didn't notice any corny parts. I thought the ""faculty"" did a nice job acting for most of the movie. The ending was well done with the twist and I was delighted to see everyone living ""happily ever after"" for a change. The plot is a nice balance and makes it simple to follow and yet deep enough to enjoy. I have seen many movies lately that get rated a 7+ and you are left sitting there wondering what happen because the movie was either incredibly complex or cuts off without explaining anything. This movie was a nice break from such movies. Simple and enjoyable.",The Faculty
