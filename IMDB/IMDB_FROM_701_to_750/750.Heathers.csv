0,MartinHafer,"Like so many teen movies, it's NOT a film I would let teens watch.",7,25 July 2015,"""Heathers"" is a clever film that I recommend you see...provided you are not young. While making teen-targeted movies with lots of sexual innuendos, nasty language and adult content is often the norm (a great example is the recent film ""The DUFF""), I resent how the films are targeted to younger audiences. But for an adult audience, I heartily recommend the film. It will likely strike a few resounding chords from our own teen years and will appeal to most of our repressed fantasies about nasty folks we were forced to grow up with...unless you, too, were a Heather.Winona Rider plays Veronica, a pretty and popular girl who has it all...except for a sense of responsibility for herself and her own actions. She's a member of a vicious clique--three nasty and self- absorbed girls named Heather and herself. While Veronica doesn't like the Heathers or what they do to others, she excuses away her own conduct and fantasizes about doing away with these stuck-up creeps. However, when she meets a new student (Christian Slater), he encourages her to take action--and soon they are killing off these and other vile high school students. For much of the film, Veronica protests...yet goes along with the new friend's sick revenge fantasies. However, by the end of the film, Veronica realizes it must stop...and she must be the one to stop it.This is a darkly funny film about revenge and, like it or not, you'll likely enjoy seeing her killing these jerks. This is the main problem with letting teens see the film. While I doubt if it will make anyone go on a killing spree, it IS material that just seems inappropriate for young ones...along with all the very rough language and content. A well made but unsavory film that I enjoyed but which made me question who should be watching it.",Heathers
1,bkoganbing,High school is one wicked place,6,17 January 2017,"I think that if any film ever established Christian Slater's reputation for taking on quirky roles it has to be Heathers. As a psychotic kid with a chip on his shoulder he's got one devilish way of leveling the playing field so to speak of the ruling class.Which in this case the female social set is headed in this small town Ohio is headed by a trio of girls all named Heather. Newly arrived Winona Ryder would like to make it to the top, but Heather 1 Pauline Walker pulls some nasty stuff on her.But Ryder does make a friend of Christian Slater who has a mission in life to eliminate those that stand out from the top and bottom. He's nuts, but he's charming. His Jason Dean set his typecasting permanently. My favorite bit in the whole film is him setting up the two dumb senior jocks as a double gay suicide, ruining the memory of these two macho lunkheads forever. This film seemed to be cursed with two deaths of people in major roles. Both Pauline Walker and Jeremy Applegate who plays a scholastic overachiever both died quite young.Even today in middle age Christian Slater still plays variations on Jason Dean. Because he does them so well.",Heathers
2,Leofwine_draca,Intellectual exercise,6,2 January 2020,"There are plenty of high school satires out there, but HEATHERS is one of the most famous and also one of the most controversial. It's a darker-than-dark exploration of love and infatuation, an expose of high school cliques and bullying, of teen suicide and bloody vengeance. It's not a film you really see much anywhere these days, which is no surprise given the subject matter, but as an intellectual exercise it's very interesting indeed. As far as entertainment goes, the direction suffers from being pedestrian which spoils the fun somewhat, although the strong performances from Winona Ryder and in particular Christian Slater help to counter that.",Heathers
3,SnoopyStyle,Darkest of dark comedies,8,6 November 2013,"Veronica (Winona Ryder) is a hanger-on to the three Heathers (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk, Shannen Doherty). Veronica is a reluctant participant to the Heathers' bullying. She finally had it with Heather (Kim Walker) and kills her with the help of J.D. (Christian Slater).This is the blackest of black comedies. The dialog is deliberately cool. It helps that Christian Slater and Winona Ryder are the ones saying it. They make the words snap.While the story is dark and the performance is great, I wish they had better cooler music. That's the one minor deficiency in an otherwise groundbreaking unique teen movie. The lines are just so delicious.",Heathers
4,claudio_carvalho,A Very Black Humor and Weird Comedy About American Teenagers,7,12 October 2003,"***MILD SPOILERS*** Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) is a teenager trying to be popular in her school  through a fake friendship with the three Heathers: Duke (Shannon Doherty), McNamara (Lisanne Falk) and Chandler (Kim Walker). She supports their nasty and shallow behavior just aiming to become a popular student. One day, Jason Dean (Christian Slater) , a new comer in town, goes to her class and starts dating with Veronica. He questions her relationship with the Heathers and one day they accidentally kill one of the Heathers. They forge a suicide note of her and even dead, she becomes more popular among the students. Other students becomes also tempted to commit suicide. In order to avoid a spoiler, nothing else can be written about this weird plot. American teenager students are always presented to the world like imbeciles. This movie makes no exception and goes further and further, showing them very shallow, trying to be popular at any price and without questioning life. The behavior of their fathers and mothers is also stupid and the most intelligent ones are presented like a bunch of morons. This original dark film has a great potential of a cult movie. In Brazil, it is not popular or known, and I just bought it because of its low price, considering Winona Ryder and Christian Slater in the cast. It was worthwhile. One of the best American teen movie. My vote is seven.",Heathers
5,claudio_carvalho,Dark Comedy to the Best,7,16 April 2019,"In Ohio, Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) is a teenager trying to participate in the clique at the Westerburg High School of her schoolmates Heathers: Duke (Shannon Doherty), McNamara (Lisanne Falk) and Chandler (Kim Walker). She supports their nasty and shallow behavior just aiming to be a popular student. One day, the newcomer in town Jason Dean (Christian Slater) starts dating Veronica and he questions her relationship with the Heathers. When they accidentally kill one of the Heathers, they forge a suicide note and even dead, she becomes more popular among the students. Other students become also tempted to commit suicide while Veronica learns that Jason Dean is a psychopath.Most American high school students are usually presented to the world in comedies as imbecile. ""Heathers"" makes no exception and goes further and further in the critic, showing them very shallow, trying to be popular at any price and without questioning life. The behavior of their fathers and mothers is also stupid. This original dark comedy has a great potential of a cult movie. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater in the beginning of career shine in the cast performing cynical roles. ""Heathers"" is one of the best American teen movie and worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Atração Mortal"" (""Mortal Attraction"")",Heathers
6,kosmasp,Killing time,8,28 January 2019,"As in if you are bored, what to do to pass time ... then again maybe even literally. This is a comedy, but it is quite dark. In some respects it was ahead of its time, in others it might feel a bit off pacing wise. Overall though the movie works. That is if you don't mind the outcasts and the cliches (that are being taken apart as they are also cherished in other moments).The acting is really good, but there is an underlying evil theme going around, which might make you feel uneasy. Now that shouldn't worry you, it only means you're human. On the other hand ""enjoying"" it, does not mean you're bad. Enjoy to a certain degree that is - because we realize this is a movie and can understand and see the difference between good and evil (well even those words can be interpreted differently, especially from time period to time period) - socially speaking this is quite something. And there is a lot to decipher, if you care. Or you just lean back and enjoy the wicked ride ...",Heathers
7,classicsoncall,"""Are we going to the prom or to hell?""",6,7 July 2018,"Interestingly, there are some films that were wildly popular at the time they were released, but today seem like they should never have been made in the first place. Such a movie is ""Heathers"", when viewed within the context of massive school shootings and rampant suicide by disaffected members of society. I really couldn't get into the spirit of this picture, if spirit is even the right word. Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) seemed like the only responsible girl in her clique of multiple Heathers, yet succumbed to the fake charm of outsider Jason Dean (Christian Slater). That J.D.'s last name was Dean ought to give one an indication that in matters of high school decorum, he truly was a rebel without a cause.As a satire and parody of teenage disaffection the story has some merit, but when the principal characters take it to it's ultimate extreme, it ceases to be funny. So much so, that it's easy to come away with the impression that J.D. and Veronica wound up killing all three Heathers when in fact it was only Heather Red (Kim Walker) that got the Drano treatment. Heather Green (Shannen Doherty) surfaced to take her place as Westerburg High's resident queen bee, while Heather Yellow (Lisanne Falk) was ignominiously dumped from the script following her bathroom meltdown attended by a supportive Veronica.Besides the understated James Dean connection, I also had to do a quick double take when the story line introduced Veronica's former best friend. Taking place in the fictional town of Sherwood, Ohio, I was quite expecting Archie, Reggie and Jughead to show up from nearby Riverdale, because when all was said and done, why else would you introduce a couple of your principal characters as Betty and Veronica?",Heathers
8,gavin6942,"Good, But Not the Classic It's Made Out to Be",6,8 November 2008,"Veronica associates herself with a group known as the Heathers, three girls named Heather who maintain what is or isn't popular in school. But rather than become a member herself, she turns in the other direction and begins dating the outsider, a boy who will stop at nothing to eliminate the popular kids from the school. Vernonica will be forced to choose... popular or not? Or is there a third way? I had known about the existence of ""Heathers"" for a long time. Along with ""Empire Records"", it was a film that captured the 1990s in a way few films had. The film achieved legendary status since then, and when I rented it the movie was to be found in the video store's ""favorites"" section. Apparently, many people had held the movie in high regard. Sadly, I found it lacking.Winona Ryder was fine as herself, playing similar outcast roles that we saw her playing in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Beetlejuice""... only now she was free of Tim Burton's direction. Her weird boyfriend was no longer Johnny Depp but Christian Slater, certainly weird enough in his own right (""Pump Up the Volume"" came out around this same time and these films together really present him in an anti-authority light). According to the IMDb, Christian Slater's performance was heavily inspired by Jack Nicholson. This is no surprise, as I find Slater's career as a whole to be a Nicholson homage.I wasn't sure what to think. Popularity was mocked, but so was anti-popularity. There was a distinct attempt at humor, but I think it failed... so much of it missed the mark and the subject matter was often presented in too serious a fashion. I like dark humor, I like tongue-in-cheek, but I just didn't feel this captured the spirit, and the angst that a true outcast feels wasn't even addressed. Slater's character is more anti-popularity than the popular kids are against him. The real hero should have been the fat girl with the Big Fun shirt, but she was little more than a bad joke.I'm not advising against seeing ""Heathers"", but it didn't strike me as a strong film and it may be becoming increasingly dated. If you came of age in the early 1990s, this might hit home with you. I came of age in the mid to late 1990s and it seems to have missed me. Presumably, those younger than myself will be even more distant. This is not a timeless film.",Heathers
9,jboothmillard,Heathers,8,19 November 2015,"I had heard about this film, mainly because of the leading actress in it, and I knew it was something about death or whatever, so with high critic ratings I was hoping for something good, directed by Michael Lehmann (40 Days and 40 Nights). Basically at Westerburg High School, Veronica (Winona Ryder) is part of the most dominant and popular clique, the Heathers, made up of three wealthy and beautiful girls named Heather: leader Heather Chandler (Kim Walker), bookish bulimic Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty) and weak-willed cheerleader Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk). Veronica has become tired that Heather Chandler can bully and control everyone, she wishes her dead so she can do whatever she wants and not what Heather Chandler wants. Veronica meets dark rebel J.D. (Christian Slater) who is willing to help her, they work together to teach Heather Chandler a lesson, making her drink drain cleaner, she does so and dies instantly from chemical poisoning. Veronica and J.D. cover up the murder forge Heather Chandler's handwriting to write a suicide note, however the bullying and cruelty does not stop, as Heather Duke replaces Heather Chandler as leader, the assumed suicide is seen as glamorous and cool. Veronica is next tricked into shooting football players Kurt Kelly (Lance Fenton) and Ram Sweeney (Patrick Labyorteaux), who had been spreading a rumour about Veronica giving them oral sex, these murders are covered up by suicide notes saying that they were secretly gay. Veronica comes to realise that, while she just wanted to scare the victims of the murders, J.D. intended to kill them, she becomes scared of him. J.D. next plans to kill Heather Duke, but Veronica wants no part of it, so instead J.D. has everyone sign a ""petition"", this is in fact a group suicide note as part of his plan to blow up the school. Veronica tries to put a stop to J.D. and his murderous plot, shooting him and forcing him to leave the bomb in the school, but outside he straps the bomb to himself, Veronica watches as J.D. blows himself up, comforting Heather Duke, and suggesting to the school nerd that she will become the new school leader. Also starring Penelope Milford as Pauline Fleming, Glenn Shadix as Father Ripper and Jeremy Applegate as Peter Dawson. Ryder is fantastic as usual being the young innocent teenager, and Slater is great as the demented young man wanting to murder fellow students, the story is essentially two teenagers wanting to kill the popular kids, with snappy dialogue, deaths both fun and freaky to watch, and a script is full of darkly funny and satirical, a great cult movie black comedy. Very good!",Heathers
10,rmax304823,Critique of Pure Shallowness,6,23 September 2005,"Hard to understand why some people become leaders if they have no more in the way of personal qualities than the rest of us. No -- I mean high school, not politics. In a way, high school status spheres seem to echo those of the society around them. The men compete for power and the women for popularity.In ""Heathers"" the most powerful boys are on the football team and the most popular girls are the best groomed and prettiest, in this case the three girls named Heather. Veronica (Ryder), not a Heather, is an acolyte. The lower rungs on the status ladder are represented by a tall girl named Betty with thick glasses and an ordinary pony tail instead of an elaborate coif. (Betty and Veronica? Is this a literary allusion?) On the lowest rung of all is ""Dumptruck"" Dunnstock, an overweight reject. Christian Slater is Dean, the new boy in school, whose mother committed suicide and whose father rejoices in destroying wetlands and endangered species and historic landmarks through his demolition company. How Slater's dad chuckles as he watches the collapse of a big hotel on VHS.Basically, the story is this. Slater and Ryder kill the chief Heather by accident and fix the death up to look like a suicide. The other Heathers follow, not by accident. Slater then finagles Ryder into shooting and killing two stars of the football team, leaving a suicide note claiming the deaths were the result of a lovers' pact. Teen suicide acquires a kind of cachet because, after all, people come to your funeral and laud you and your picture appears on TV and all, so other innocent teens begin to attempt suicide. Slater gets swept up in the destruction until by the end he has an apparatus in place to take out the entire high school, but Ryder has come to her senses and prevents him, after which Slater blows himself up. Lots of laughs here.Actually it's a pretty acid comment on being a teenager today. And let's face facts. It does give you ontological pause to discover that you have every material thing you need and therefore nothing to live for except 15 minutes of fame.None of these kids experiences anything remotely resembling a Calvinist ""calling."" Whatever they're studying is never brought up. Nobody has ambitions that go beyond acceptance to ""an Ivy League college, and please let it be Harvard."" I can believe their anxiety. I can believe their shallowness and spitefulness and cruelty and narcissism. Heather #1 is defined by a sticker in her locker -- ""I Shop, Therefore I am."" What's harder to believe is that Heather #2 has read ""Moby Dick"" and has even underlined passages in it. As it appears in this movie, this is a generation that has lost touch with its cultural data base. A joke about ""Moby Dick, Part Two: Ahab's Revenge"", would be lost on them. They wouldn't get a reference to King Kong.The dialog is pretty snappy, the acting generally okay, and the gradually revealed bitterness in the script makes it different from most movies about teens. Yet the subject of middle-class high-school cliques has been so overdone that it's a little tedious to watch still another spiel, along the lines of ""Clueless"" and ""Pretty in Pink"" and the rest of them. Ho hum.It's interesting to note though that the farther removed in years I am from my high school days the more interesting high school cheerleaders in those tiny-skirted carnival-bright outfits become. Not just because they're attractive. All young girls are willy nilly attractive and sexy. It's their innocence that's captivating. Imagine being so willing to lend your allegiance to an organization that you are willing to dress up that way and jump around on a wooden floor, shaking your pom poms in front of hundreds of strangers. The film makers kind of missed the boat there. The school can't be all THAT dead with such a naked affirmation of devotion on the basketball court. Fewer movies about suicide and more movies about high school cheerleaders, I say.",Heathers
11,Tweekums,A great dark comedy,9,17 June 2010,"During the late eighties comedy-dramas set in American high schools were all the rage and 'Heathers' is amongst the best of these. Winona Ryder plays Veronica, a girl who doesn't really like her friends; three girls all called Heather who form the most popular/feared clique in their school. When she befriends JD, a student recently transferred to her school played by Christian Slater, she has no idea just how much it will change her life and that of her fellow students. After a visit to a college party with Heather Chandler goes horribly wrong and her reputation at school is threatened she tells JD that she wishes her friend was dead... She may not have been serious but he thinks it is a great idea and in the morning gives her a wake up drink that leaves her dead. Not wanting to go to gaol JD and Veronica write a suicide note. Veronica briefly hopes that the death of the lead Heather will have a positive effect on the school but nothing changes. After being persuaded to go on a double date with another Heather and two of the school football team Veronica finds herself victim of a rumour, spread by the boys, that she had performed sexual acts on them. The next morning she invites them to meet her in the woods to do it for real... by the time school starts two more students are dead in what looks like a suicide pact caused by their inability to admit their homosexuality to the world. Till this point Veronica goes along with JD but when she learns he plans to destroy the school along with everybody in it she decides it is time to stop him.This is a great example of the high school film; it is very funny and very dark. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater to well in the two lead roles and are supported by a great cast including Shannen Doherty as Heather Duke and Glenn Shadix who is memorable despite his limited screen time as Father Ripper, the priest who performs some very different funeral services. The idea of a comedy about school children killing each other might not sound very funny but here it is handled in a way that works. There are of course some minor flaws, for example the coroner seemed very quick to accept that the deaths were suicide and nobody who knew the victims doubted it either, this is easy to over look though as the story stayed interesting and a degree of unbelievability is better than getting bogged down in explaining every detail of how they could have got away with murder. If you've enjoyed other '80s high school films and are looking for another which is both funny and dark then this is the film for you.",Heathers
12,moonspinner55,Dead-pan comic cynicism bites off more than it can chew...,5,28 September 2002,"""Heathers"" delights in shocking viewers with un-PC humor; that's fine, yet the picture is a mess from a filmmaker's stand-point, and Daniel Waters' script takes a dive with twenty minutes left to go. This is a movie that never goes in any particular direction, so Waters left himself an 'out': he could end it anywhere he wanted and figure he was safe. However the acting by leads Winona Ryder and Christian Slater (as high schoolers who murder members of the popular clique) is so strong that the audience is let down by where the writing takes them. This screenplay could be something conjured up in a high school writing class. It has pungent, dead-on scenes of satire and fantasy, but it flags too early and just doesn't have the smarts to realize that--in the end--it's dealing with characters who have become recognizable to us, and throwing them a cartoon bone is as insulting as a croquet ball to the forehead. ** from ****",Heathers
13,Quinoa1984,"one of the more scathing high-school comedies of its time, though it falters in the last twenty minutes",7,13 August 2007,"I enjoyed watching Heathers when it came on again the other night on TV. I hadn't seen it in quite a number of years, and my memory of it wasn't too impressionable either way. But seeing it now, years after finishing high school myself, it is definitely one of those funny films that is most effective playing against the conventions of the high school movie of the period. This isn't John Hughes here, but something that is attempting to get at rougher terrain - chiefly the dicey subject of teenage suicide - and at the jaded point of view of the modern adolescent. Winona Ryder has one of her better performances as Veronica, looking on at the 'Heathers', a clique of girls, with total contempt. What about her love life? There's the dangerous and strange kid JD (Christian Slater, at his youngest and, dare I say it, hippest), who has some crazy ideas in his head- one of which may result in lots of destruction of public property. It's when the skewering goes right against the hypocrisies of teenage vanity, the value of life and living, and what it is to be mentally stable that Heathers is sharpest; one funeral scene, I might add, is a classic satirical piece. But the only flaws end up coming out of an instability in getting a grip between the dark comedy and the real dramatic elements, which start to lean towards melodrama towards the last section where JD goes off the map (the very end, especially, is a major letdown). But for at least 3/4 of the way, Heathers makes its mark as one of the coolest films of 1989.",Heathers

15,Theo Robertson,Thought Provoking ...,5,30 April 2003,"... It provoked me into thinking I was watching an off beat TVM ! Well apart from the F word cropping up every five minutes , but everything else reminded me of the dreaded phrase "" Made for television "" . HEATHERS is lit and shot like a TVM , the incidental music resembles that of THE EQUALIZER and the film even features TVM queen Shannen Doherty in a major role.Being a black comedy I wasn`t keen on the script either . Strangely if HEATHERS was made in 1991 or 1992 when grunge was kicking in big time it would have been a more cynical and nihilistic and therefore more sucessfull but to set it around the Debbie Gibson / ripped jeans era seems anachronistic . That said I did find it amusing that the two anti heroes were worried about going to jail since they were played by Wyona Rider and Christian Slater . Yup sometimes life can`t help imitating art",Heathers
16,jotix100,Mean girls,8,21 December 2005,"""Heathers"" was released way ahead of the disturbing school killings that have been at the front of the news in recent years. The film is an eye opener about what typical teen agers in high school face on a daily basis. Peer pressure, cliques, drugs, and other things make the lives of young students hell, when in reality it should be a happy time where they are prepared to face life later on.Director Michael Lehmann, who seems to work mainly on television, showed tremendous courage to bring Daniel Walters' screen play into this black comedy about high schoolers. Mr. Lehmann shows an understanding for what makes people in high school be the way they are, what bothers them, and the rituals of passage they must experience in their young lives.The three Heathers are found in lots of places. These misguided young women are basically control freaks as they demonstrate by dragging Veronica Sawyer to be the instrument of their meanness. Veronica, who is not as strong as her three friends, mainly goes along, although she hates them. These girls show a cruelty for those that are not into the same things they are. They hate everything and everybody; they are miserable and want to make everyone feel the same. In a way, the three Heathers are just cowards who find strength in numbers, as usually is the case with these type of people.Veronica rebels from her three best friends when the psychotic J.D. enters her life. Little does Veronica know she leaves one situation to get into deeper waters with the menacing young creep who resolves everything with a gun. Veronica is made to go along with the punk J.D. in spite of knowing he has deeply rooted problems.The young Wynona Ryder gave a great performance as Veronica. Together with Christian Slater, who is seen as J.D., she had one of the best opportunities of her career that got derailed recently because of her problems with the law. Shannen Doherty, Lianne Falk and Kim Walker are fine as the three Heathers.The film serves as a reminder about what is basically wrong in our society.",Heathers
17,Hey_Sweden,One of the best teen-oriented movies of the 1980s.,8,9 May 2012,"""Heathers"" definitely stands out from the pack of teen comedies that proliferated in the decade, no mean feat considering how many there were. Its wickedly dark sense of humour and biting comments on the way the world, not just high school society, works, makes it something special. Working from a sharp screenplay by Daniel Waters, debuting director Michael Lehmann crafts an intriguing movie certain to hit many kids where they live, especially if they ever at any point felt uncomfortable about the seeming need for students to fit into designated groups, or if they in any way ever felt like an outsider.Lehmann gets excellent performances from his young cast, who occupy a world where the adults have little meaning. A radiant Winona Ryder plays Veronica, a girl who's a reluctant pal to a trio of girls all named Heather (Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk, Kim Walker), a snooty little clique that enjoys the position of power they occupy in Westerburg High School. Veronica thinks of how everybody would be better off without their influence, and seizing upon this attitude is new rebel in town Jason Dean (Christian Slater, in his entertaining Jack Nicholson-style performance). With Jason coming into the picture, the popular kids soon start becoming an endangered species as he encourages Veronica to act out her darkest fantasies.In a great twist, the resulting ""suicides"" soon take on some kind of ""cool"" factor, capturing the attention and interest of the outside world. Veronica realizes she's become part of something she needs to finish, and that ultimately this kind of thing doesn't solve much in the long run; eliminate one reigning bitch-queen and another can easily take her place.""Heathers"" really keeps you watching, never clearly indicating where it's going next, and maintaining one's interest for its entire 103 minute running time. It's not afraid to cross the line in terms of what people might consider good taste; its black comedy is indeed delicious and it's, in the end, the kind of thing that may force viewers to take a good, hard look at themselves and see just how close to home the themes hit. It's a strong antidote to the other high school comedies of the time, and literally ends with a big bang; it's exactly the kind of thing one would expect to develop a loyal following.Eight out of 10.",Heathers

19,zardoz-13,The Darker Side of Those John Hughes's High School Movies,10,10 April 2008,"Watching ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" director Michael Lehmann's audaciously abrasive comedy ""Heathers"" with Winona Ryder and Christian Slater is like spiking your morning orange juice with Drano. Although the unsavory shenanigans of Ryder and Slater are rather morbid and mean-spirited, the victims of their pranks fully deserve the consequences. No, audiences who adored John Hughes' delightful teen angst comedies would probably find it a supreme challenge to sit through this trenchant, traumatic tale. The same applies for uptight religious fanatics and self-conscious prudes without a sick sense of humor. Anybody that has ever suffered at the hands of snobbish people or bullies will relish this film thoroughly and ultimately want to add it to their film collection. Generally, most critics cite the Leonardo DiCaprio drama ""The Basketball Diaries"" as the stimulus for the dreadful Columbine high school massacre. In retrospect, ""Heathers"" surpasses ""The Basketball Diaries"" as a most likely candidate for the movie that triggered the shooting rampage that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold launched back in April 1999 as a result of the social cliques, subcultures, and bullying that pervaded their Colorado-based high school.""Heathers"" takes place at Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio, where fashion-minded Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder of ""Lost Souls"") tries to fit in with three vain and vicious vixens all of whom share the same first name Heather: Heather Chandler (Kim Walker of ""Say Anything""), Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty of ""Mall Rats"") and Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk of ""Suicide Kings""), that reserve nothing but venom for all that cross their paths. Veronica comes from a well-to-do but rather dysfunctional family, too. When her father (William Cort) wonders aloud why he reads spy novels and smokes cigarettes, Veronica reminds him that he is an ""idiot."" Strangely, while she lacks the cruelty that drives the Heathers, Veronica has a conscience and a kind word for most people, so she seems rather out-of-place with this terrible triumvirate. Indeed, she seems like a considerate Nazi that follows orders. The Heathers are grooming her and they use her uncanny ability to forge letters. For their first prank, Chandler coerces Veronica into forging a note from a jock to a Martha 'Dumptruck' Dunnstock (Carrie Lynn of ""Disturbed""), a short, fat, ugly girl. While the Heathers and Veronica are up to these antics, Jason J.D. Dean (Christian Slater of ""True Romance"") watches this spectacle from the corner of the lunchroom. Dressed in a long, black coat, J.D. wears a squinty-eyed expression and delivers each line with a Jack Nicholson-esquire accent. Not only does J.D. attract Veronica's interest, but he also draws the attention of two letter-jacketed jocks, Ram Sweeney (Patrick Labyorteaux of ""Ghoulies III"") and Peter Dawson (Jeremy Applegate of ""The Cable Guy""), who try to harass him. J.D. rises and pulls a pistol and shoots them. Later, we learn that he had loaded blanks in his gun.""Heathers"" was scenarist Daniel Waters' first screenplay. He went on to write ""Hudson Hawk,"" ""Demolition Man,"" and ""Batman Returns."" Waters' script drips with sarcasm galore. Look at the ""Heathers"" home page on IMDb.COM for these memorable barbs. Anyway, Lehmann and he skewer themes like teen suicide and peer pressure without a qualm. Audiences that cringe at the frequent usage of the F-word and the S-word are hereby warned. Eventually, Veronica joins forces with J.D., a loner who has spent his life moving around wherever his father's jobs take him in the construction industry. Like Veronica, J.D. enjoys a witty, irreverent relationship with his dad. Revealing anything else about this absolutely brilliant but politically incorrect chronicle would dilute its impact. Prepare yourself to be entertained and enlightened by one of the more clever example of the 1980s. Sadly, the careers of both Winona Ryder and Christian Slater lost them impact in the late 1999s. She got into trouble for shoplifting, while Slater repeatedly chose bad movies and eventually found himself in straight-to-video schlock with occasional exceptions like John Woo's ""Windtalkers."" Director Michael Lehmann helmed a couple of winners like ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs"" and the goofy ""Airheads,"" but he has confined himself since to television.

She hates them and the things they do to assert their dominance at school but realises that they control her life, so just goes along with their bullying, pranks and powerplays. Then she meets and falls for the cool, dark JD, a boy who shares her dislike for the Heathers. They would like to be rid of the Heathers, but how far would they be willing to go?Great movie. Starts with a wry look at school life and the kids who make it unbearable for everyone else. However, the tone gets darker and darker as the movie goes on. The humour is still there though, just the tone of it changes.The plot is also quite intriguing, starting very innocently but then developing into something more sinister and more tension-filled.Not perfect though. Due to the comedy element, it is a bit difficult to take the movie too seriously. Even in the darkest of moments the edge is taken off by the comedic tone and the generic 80s synth score. The conclusion is also not as powerful and profound as it could be.Can't fault the performances though. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater are great in the lead roles.

24,Wuchakk,Quirky black comedy high school flick with Christian Slater and Winona Ryder,6,15 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 1989 and directed by Michael Lehmann, ""Heathers"" stars Winona Ryder as Veronica, a high school student in Ohio who has sold herself out to join the popular clique of three girls, all coincidently named Heather (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk & Shannen Doherty). The more she spends time with them, however, the more she discovers she can't stand them. Enter mysterious new kid, JD (Christian Slater), who has a macabre solution to Veronica's conundrum. This is an oddball teen movie that tries to be edgy and amusing with its black humor and overt cussing. Future movies were influenced by it, like ""Jawbreaker"" (1999) and maybe even ""Mean Girls"" (2004). The commentary on peer pressure, teen suicide and the maiming destructiveness of cliques is potent. Teens can be misled by the ""popular"" students, yes, but they can also be misled by the outcasts. Slater stands out as a sorta dark Fonz of the late 80s, easily one of his best roles ever. Ryder is surprisingly good as the protagonist. I say ""surprisingly"" because I was never big on her (although I didn't dislike her either). The first act is quite good, but the story gets humdrum in the middle; thankfully, the last 20 minutes perk up. The late 80's ambiance is to die for.I'm not going to give it away, but the original ending was way more morbid. They had an alternative ending that they didn't go with either. Apparently the studio pressured the writer/director to go with the theatrical ending, which I approve. It's a story of redemption. Being misled by corrupt people for a season doesn't define a person forever.

25,The_Void,A true American classic,10,15 May 2005,"Heathers has a big advantage over most teen comedies hailing from the eighties, and that is that it obviously has a brain behind it's over the top and largely hilarious antics. The film, while bowing to many staples of the common eighties teen comedy, has enough of it's own to be original and even thought provoking. Heathers gives a thorough depiction of a society, in this case a school; Westerbegh High. It's politics, interesting characters and sharp dialogue combine to create a truly stunning piece of work, which is just as funny as it is dark and intriguing. The story really takes off when the outsider of the school's most popular clique, 'the Heathers', meets a cool youth known as J.D. She gets pulled into killing off certain members of the group along with other popular members of the school, only to find the fickleness of popularity being exposed. While Heathers' comment on society may be slightly muddled, it's clear enough and it's nice to be able to enjoy a film and then take something from it when the credits role.It isn't the social commentary that was the main highlight for me, however, as the deliciously surreal atmosphere takes that honour. The film jumps from one odd event to another, and it does this with a sharp tongue, a lighting style borrowed from Italian master Dario Argento and a maliciously dark atmosphere, which helps to hype up the tension and ensures that Heathers is always exciting. Despite being made in a time when 'b' flicks were king and not so many 'a' class films were being produced, Heathers take its 'b' plot and turns it into an a-class movie. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that Heather echoes the true American classics such as The Apartment and Sunset Blvd in that it has a very strong script, and the reliance of the film to work is aimed squarely at the cast, which are successful in their bid to make this film work to say the least. Both Winona Ryder and Christian Slater never bettered their performances in this movie, and that's saying something as both have had long and rich careers.Another thing about Heathers that is an integral part of it's success is the way it builds up it's central society by way of a great array of offbeat characters that populate the school at the centre of the story. It's amazing just how well the film comes together, and writer Daniel Waters can take huge credit for balancing the central theme, the two central characters and an entire body of different characters and making sure that the result is a success. The black humour is scintillating, and at times so absurd that all you can do as you watch is laugh out loud. There isn't a lot of murder in the movie, but the two death scenes that the film does give us are superb to say the least, with the latter being one of the most amazing funny and inventive things I've ever seen on film. All of the cast and crew can pat themselves on the back for making this movie, as everything about it is excellent. Well, almost everything; the ending could use a little work. Still, the ending not withstanding; Heathers is pure brilliance!",Heathers
26,zetes,Near-masterpiece; one of the all-time best high school movies,10,24 January 2010,"This is a movie I thought I had seen previously all the way through. I was wrong. I had only ever seen, it turns out, about the final twenty minutes or so. I'm glad I finally corrected this mistake. Heathers is, without a doubt, a classic, one of the very best in its genre (high school films). Winona Ryder stars as a smart girl moving up in social standing by becoming best friends with the Heathers, three chicks with that name who rule the school (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk and Shannon Doherty). Popularity can be a bitch, and Ryder's getting worn out by the shallowness and cruelty of the Heathers. One day, a mysterious new boy (Christian Slater) arrives in the school and promises Ryder an escape from the doldrums of high school society. Unfortunately, that escape eventually involves murder, as Ryder and Slater ""accidentally"" dispose of Walker, the lead Heather. This film plays out in clever and absolutely hilarious ways. It's downright ballsy in its use of abhorrent violence as comedy. Nowadays, it looks less like an absurd satire and more like real life. Which makes it even more impressive that the comic aspects hold up so well. This is Ryder's best work ever, and Slater, while channeling Jack Nicholson more than a little too much, works well as a guy who looks more and more like a psychopath as the film moves on. Heathers is very nearly a masterpiece, but I thought it fizzled out a bit at the end. The filmmakers wanted a different ending that they thought was far more powerful, but their descriptions make it sound just as weak to me.",Heathers

On second viewing I see the satire, but suicides', and school violence has became more real life and not fiction anymore so Heather.s loses it's humor. Teenage angst about school life, being liked and accepted fuels the movie. The viewer sees popularity is a lot of work, phony, and conniving! In the end of Heathers the message is popularity is just not worth it, as I found out personally. The mother explains social games perfectly fit in with being human and as an adult the games just march on!. Sometimes even worse! Heathers was acted and directed in a off beat way.

30,siderite,Deliciously wicked,8,31 March 2015,"I got reminded of Christian Slater a few days ago and I was thinking: wait a minute, I like this guy, what happened to him, so I decided to see one of his overlooked movies.Heathers is a dark satire on human society set, where else but, in an American high school. What starts as yet another high school movie quickly turns weird when Slater and Ryder start killing off insufferable people and staging them as teen angst suicides. The effect on the people, the fake reactions of all involved, the realization that even the rebels are part of this stale type of world, it all makes the film worthwhile, but stranger still, the dark comedy that just sprouts off the script is just delicious.Slater does a great impression of the psychotic rebel, foreshadowing the talent he will later show in stuff like Pump of the Volume and Julian Po.Some of the direction of the film was kind of heavy handed and it shows. That is probably a reason why it has never reached a lot of popularity. Also the tongue in cheek attitude towards subjects like murder, teen suicide and the general opaque idiocy of the caretakers probably did not make it very loved by parents. But hey, the story is interesting and the film has some of the best quotes I ever met in cinema, stuff like a teacher saying ""Whether to kill yourself or not is one of the most important decisions a teenager can make"", or JD saying ""The only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven"" as an egalitarian argument for blowing the school up.Bottom line: you should watch it before it becomes *really* dated. Just kidding, really fun stuff, but deep too. You should see it.",Heathers
31,JamesHitchcock,"Does for the high school movie what ""Blazing Saddles"" did for the Western",8,18 September 2009,"American films and television programmes set in high schools seem to revolve around a few stock characters. There is always a ""popular girl"" whose popularity derives from her beauty and her family's wealth rather from her personality, which is generally an obnoxious one. (The characters played by Charisma Carpenter in ""Buffy"", Sarah Michelle Gellar in ""Cruel Intentions"" and Megan Fox in ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" are all good examples). The male equivalent is the jock, whose popularity derives from his good looks and sporting prowess and from his total lack of academic prowess, an intellect being a positive disadvantage in the popularity stakes. Those who possess the unwanted distinction of a high IQ are all bespectacled, physically unattractive nerds. There may also be a farouche, rebellious male outsider, cut off from the school mainstream but often attractive to a certain type of girl. ""Heathers"" is a black comedy which makes satirical use of all these clichés. It is set in Westerburg High School in the fictional town of Sherwood, Ohio, and features a clique of four ""popular girls"" known as ""The Heathers"" because three of them share this particular Christian name. (The fourth is named Veronica). Although the girls are notoriously arrogant, bitchy and snobbish, their beauty and their families' wealth means that the rest of the school look up to them. As their leader Heather Chandler puts it ""everyone in this school wants me either as a friend or as a sexual partner"". (I bowdlerise somewhat).The clique's hold on the school is shaken by the arrival of a new boy, Jason Dean. Jason, who wears a leather jacket and drives a powerful motorbike, is the archetypal rebel, modelled on Marlon Brando's character in ""The Wild One"" (or perhaps on Aidan Quinn in ""Reckless""). His name is an obvious reference to James Dean, the original rebel without a cause. Veronica, who is marginally more sensitive than the three Heathers, and from a slightly less elevated social background, finds herself powerfully drawn to the newcomer, and they begin a relationship.Unfortunately for Veronica, Jason turns out to be not just a rebel but also a psychopath, whose goal it is to murder all the most popular students in the school, making their deaths look like suicide. He starts with Heather Chandler and moves on to Kurt and Ram, two thoroughly unpleasant jocks, who are supposed to have died in a gay suicide pact. These deaths, however, have an unexpected side effect. Because it is associated with popular students, suicide becomes seen as cool and hip, and there are a number of copycat suicide attempts. Veronica now has to prevent Jason from pulling off his greatest coup- blowing up the entire school and making it look lie a mass suicide.There is something of a convention in American films of this type that the teenage characters are played by actors in their twenties or even thirties, but in ""Heathers"" most of the actors are around the same age as the characters they are playing. Perhaps this explains why the acting is rather more convincing than in a number of high school films; in ""Reckless"", for example, I could never bring myself to accept Quinn as a schoolboy. This is the first film which revealed to me what a great actress Winona Ryder can be, and there are also splendidly over-the-top performances from Christian Slater as Jason and from Shannen Doherty, Kim Walker and Lisanne Falk as the three Heathers.Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right; there are too many films which set out to be tasteless but hilarious but end up as simply tasteless. ""Heathers"", however, which is funny, fast-moving and with a witty script, is one of those which gets the balance right, managing to deal with topics like teen suicide without ever seeming too crude. It reminded me of some of John Waters' films such as ""Serial Mom"", another satirical black comedy about affluent American suburbia. (I note that the scriptwriter for ""Heathers"" is named Daniel Waters; are they by any chance related?) Another link between the two films is that both feature sermons in dubious taste given by manic preachers.""Heathers"" does for the traditional high school movie what ""Blazing Saddles"" did for the traditional Western, and satirises the stereotypical way in which teenage life is portrayed by the American entertainment industry. It satire, however, is also aimed at wider targets. Westerburg High School is, to coin a cliché, a ""microcosm of society"", and the Heathers can be seen as symbolic of all those who are admired not for what they are or for what they have achieved but for what they appear to be or for what they represent. When I saw this film again recently, for the first time in many years, I was surprised by just how fresh and relevant it still seems; it is hard to credit that it was made while Ronald Reagan was still President. With the empty-headed cult of celebrity even stronger now than it was twenty years ago, in fact, the film looks even more relevant now than it did then. If the likes of Heather Duke and Heather Chandler were real individuals they would today be featuring in glossy articles in ""Hello!"" magazine or appearing on ""Celebrity Big Brother"". 8/10",Heathers
32,StevePulaski,So lonesome you could kill,9,27 June 2011,"Heathers defines the eighties, teen comedy craze in the eighties and also proves mixing two seemingly distant genres like comedy and horror can be done if the material has a certain amount of each. Heathers has a ton of comedy, and a ton of very dark elements that almost make it a soft thriller. Its mix makes the whole film enjoyable and entertaining.Winona Ryder plays Veronica, a very intelligent girl who is among one of the most popular girls in her high school Westerburg High. She is accompanied by three other girls, all with the same name ""Heather"" and form the ""Heathers."" They rule the high school. The jocks want them, other girls would kill to be like them, and even teachers look up to them.Veronica is soon acquainted by motorcyclist J.D. (Slater) who understands Veronica's current frustration with the ""if-you're-not-in-my-clique-you're-not-worth-my-time"" phase her school is going through. J.D. and Veronica soon accidentally murder one of the Heathers and make it look as if it was a suicide with Veronica writing a fake suicide note. They soon become fake-suicide crazy, doing it to many other people until the pressure and sick joy of doing this gets to their head.The film almost never sports a dull moment, and has a beautiful lead actress in her hay-day. While Slater's performance is reminiscent of a young Jack Nicholson with his out there personality and thick overcoat as if he were crazy, it doesn't drag this down into the level of a dumb teenager movie like one could easily mistake it of.It sort of reminds me of a film I reviewed months ago called Jawbreaker. That film was almost Heathers and Mean Girls combined into one movie. The outcome was favorable, but like I opened my review of Jawbreaker, saying ""Jawbreaker is a copy of a copy,"" I meant what I said. It's a fun movie, but brings nothing new to the table of genius movie-making.Heathers, while given the same star rating as Jawbreaker, is far superior, but both stand as very well done pieces of entertainment. Of course, in this movie, the teenagers were all young and believable. In Jawbreaker, Rose McGowan and Rebecca Gayheart were pushing thirty trying to portray high schoolers. It didn't work so well.The satirical elements in Heathers work, but the murder acts are done maturely. They aren't like some eighties films that are done on a level of corny, so bad it's good quality. In Heathers, it's so good it's good. Everything about this is enjoyable, and just when you thought no teenage movie can depict stress without being immature, Heathers sticks its head out.Starring: Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, Shannon Doherty, Lisanne Falk, Kim Walker, Penelope Milford, and Glenn Shadix.

35,Red-Barracuda,A teen comedy that has properly survived the test of time,8,13 December 2016,"Heathers is a decidedly unusual teen movie. While it covers some territory familiar to other films aimed at the same demographic, it does so in a manner that is less obvious and darker. It's essentially a black comedy about two types of malign influences that teenagers find themselves prone to, namely peer pressure from the popular and the appeal of the charismatic outsider. Both types of influence are shown here to have potentially horrendous consequences. Set in the American Midwest in and around a high school, there is a clique compromising of the four most popular girls in school. They are the (three) Heathers and Veronica; they revel in cruelty to those less fortunate than themselves. Things begin to change when Veronica develops a conscience and begins to see the Heathers for what they really are, a situation which is exacerbated by the influence of her new boyfriend, who has a psychotic side to him. Things are about to turn deadly.Heathers is an unusual film in that it doesn't lay out its intentions very clearly and it takes a bit of thought to try and work out the direction it is coming from. In many ways this is one of its strengths in that it is quite original and relatively unpredictable. It's probably also true that its content and tone don't always exactly match up, with the dark undercurrents being somewhat at odds with the pure comedy moments that compromise a large part of the proceedings. For the most part this weird combination essentially works, although I thought it did finally go off the rails by the final act which seemed out of place and a bit banal. Still, on the whole, it was an engagingly odd teen comedy which had the good grace to be actually laugh-out-loud funny on occasions such as the funeral with the football helmets, what a bottle of mineral water signifies in Ohio and a lot of funny dialogue sprinkled throughout. Much of the humour is of a dark kind though with much of it coming from the subject of teenage suicide and its aftermath. The film does explore this issue plus the different kinds of bad influences teenagers encounter very effectively. Also key to the success of the film is a winningly charismatic central performance from Wynona Ryder which helped propel her in to the front rank. Christian Slater also rose to prominence here with what is essentially a Jack Nicholson impersonation; it's a thoroughly punchable-face performance from start to finish. All-in-all, this unusual and somewhat transgressive teen comedy can fairly be considered a cult movie. Its combination of an appealingly colourful look, combined with smart comedy and dark undercurrents makes it one of the more interesting films of its type for sure.",Heathers

After all, most of the humour comes from the response to the supposed suicides rather than the act of suicide itself. The fact that the audience knows that it's murder being committed puts even more distance between the potentially uncomfortable concept and its generally well-achieved execution. 'Heathers (1988)' isn't funny, per se, but it does have its share of humorous moments and its satire is relatively 'on the money', too. The picture's drama aspects also work well, feeling cohesive with the heightened - almost absurdist, even - tone. It's dark at times, sure, but it's never dour and it balances its heavier stuff with its comedy rather well.

Between that and Slater obnoxiously sounding like Jack Nicholson-lite, I have to say, he wasn't that much fun to watch.Ryder's character and her performance, on the other hand, are both wonderfully strong, and the film gets in lots of satire of the hell that is high school. Along the way it touches on materialism, homophobia, and how out of touch adults are to it all, to varying degrees of effectiveness. The dialogue is clever with lots of little jokes slipped in and humorous slang as well (""How very."", ""What's your damage?"" etc). Some of it spirals and doesn't work quite as well, and tonally it sometimes seems to want things both ways.

The themes covered are appealing and the way the script does it is interesting and becomes really good if we take into account the quality of the cast, although it is not a particularly remarkable film for any of those involved. Nowadays, I think, it is a film that has fallen by the wayside, victim of the controversial theme that it decided to address.I liked Winona Ryder's performance, still very young and beautiful. Christian Slater is also very good and they both do an excellent job together. I read that they were dating at the time and I personally believe that. I also really liked the performance of Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker, who brought the three Heather's to life.From a technical point of view it seemed to me a discreet film, betting more strongly on its plot, the story told and the performance of the actors.

42,TheMovieDiorama,Heathers subversively tackles American establishmentarianism through the conventions of a high school hierarchy.,6,20 January 2020,"""All we want is to be treated like human beings, not to be experimented on like guinea pigs or patronised like bunny rabbits"". The 80s American lifestyle was in the midst of capitalism. Democratic values were diminishing and the social brutality of consumerism was on the rise. Westerburg High School was the microcosm of that lifestyle, where its students were enveloped in potential and opportunities. Veronica was one of those students, sacrificing her old life of ""nerdy"" peers to become popular and intimidating. But the clique of Heathers she had adopted was a ruthless social structure, encapsulating the competitive principles of individualism. Bullying the weak mercilessly and controlling the cafeteria. ""I wish Heather would just die"" craved Veronica jokingly. New student James, representing anarchy and chaos, may had taken that inclination as a literal desire. And so Heathers transforms itself from a generic high school flick to a dark comedy demonstrating the ideology of ending tyranny.Waters' offbeat dialogue often sent a timid shiver down my spine. Addressing peer pressured situations by allowing admired pupils to popularise suicide pacts. Battling against homophobia, depression and the pressures of popularity. Creating an irony that these students became more worshipped in death than in life. The bullied then started catching onto this trend, sacrificing themselves to end days of torment. Illustrating the power and responsibility one has when at the top of a school hierarchy. The impressionable follow, and Waters' unorthodox script certainly conveyed that darkness.However, despite his fashionable cynicism and youthful narratives, Heathers failed to function as a cohesive story. On a thematic level, Waters was able to produce metaphors in almost every action Veronica and J.D. took. Yet Lehmann's inability to direct, although his debut, prevented the characters and their own journeys from being naturally developed arcs as opposed to a means to convey anarchy. A high school film requires quirky students and memorable characters to mimic reality. Sure, cliques are in attendance and are presented heavy-handedly through the introductory cafeteria sequence, but that's not enough to establish a connection with them. Everyone is unlikeable, even Veronica to an extent, diminishing our emotional capabilities to the characters and Waters' story. Spouting lines like ""*insert expletive* me gently with a chainsaw!"" ensues a mild case of hilarity, but without foundational character development, it's disposable dialogue at best.Ryder and Slater produced engaging performances with a fiery chemistry together, especially the latter who clearly was a snack back in '88, as do the rest of the supporting cast. The transition from high school comedy to dark thriller was almost seamless if it wasn't for the psychotic splurge of philosophy during the boiler room confrontation.Yet, there's something about Heathers that doesn't sit well with me. Call me old fashioned, but it's as if it glamorises suicide. On a personal note, suicide is a sensitive topic, as I'm sure it is with millions of individuals globally. To integrate this act of self-destruction into a school comedy and disguise it as an implication of social association, it felt wrong. And I understand, that's the entire purpose of Heathers. To exploit anarchy against the establishment. And, for what it's worth, remains enjoyable throughout. The thematic message was prevalent. However its complacent morbidity resembled an abuse of power that failed to resonate with me. Another viewing is required to solidify my personal conflict.",Heathers
43,damianphelps,Chaos Indeed,8,6 March 2021,"This film has a lot going for it, great styling, clever idea, nice piece of social commentary and a good cast.What makes the film work and makes the film special is the chemistry of Ryder and Slater. They capture something on screen that expands throughout the movie making the whole thing seem so 'real' because you can believe they have such an energetic connection to each other.
Slater (in my opinion) has found it hard to equal or best this movie throughout his career, not because of a lack of ability or role selection (although he has selected some real crap), but because he came out swinging for the fences with Heathers and hit the sweet spot.This film should not be forgotten.",Heathers
44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A deadly take on the teen movie that makes a unique point,7,28 October 2009,"High school is vicious, everyone knows that. And although stereotypes have run high school movies ragged, there's still a ring of truth to them even when they're blown out of proportion. ""Heathers,"" however, stands apart. This '80s cult favorite black comedy is the counter-culture version of the high school flick, the very definition of teen angst in the form of a laughable revenge fantasy.Altogether the film is quite ridiculous: Veronica (Winona Ryder) has an in with the Heathers, the three most popular girls in school, but when she ends up betrayed by their contrived social hierarchies and sleazy attitudes, she and her new boyfriend, the rebellious J.D. (Christian Slater), end up on a spree of setting up the murders of popular kids to look like suicides. The reactions of those in the community are comical though sadly, so are the way the two killers deal with their actions. But there's something about the sharpness of its satirical wit that makes ""Heathers"" so incredibly laudable despite the lackluster drama and muddled character motivation. We all kind of wish those popular jerk-offs from high school would just roll over, but ""Heathers"" takes it one step further, willing to do whatever it takes -- even throw away its plot credibility -- to make its point. High school is full of these delusions and they extend from the kids all the way up through the administration. Nobody gets that there are actually serious underlying issues and everyone gets caught up in one thing or another, which is usually image. Veronica and J.D. create these false suicides and everyone buys them and turns them into martyrs when they were awful people. It's some wonderful irony. For the feature film debuts of director Michael Lehmann and writer Daniel Waters, ""Heathers"" is pretty impressive. How two high school kids suddenly become murderers is kind of slopped together, but they manage to illustrate the film's point with ease. Man, I'm glad I'm not in high school anymore. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Heathers

An oriiginal, that sadly had to spawn a t.v series, etc. Why I say this, is that spawning a series off of such a one and original, devalues it, from being a standalone, cult classic, which it is, if you just see as a cult film, that didn't spawn an unnecessary series, etc. As only seeing this for the first time today. Where I should of watched it 32 years ago, another 80's film. I'm glad I did service to, by watching it, and enjoying it whole heartedly, thanks to the great
performances, some die laughing scenes, and some great lines. Christian Slater was born to play the role. As a naturalistic up and coming actor (and you see his naturalism in other roles around the same time) he's not gonna be known for being a great actor, but he sails straight into this role, as a pyschopathic, anarchic, rebelious, loner. And enigmatic stranger, JD, and he has his reasons for being the way he is, you can give em that. More impressive, was the other up coming superstar, Winoya Ryder, who's great too, as additional drip, or hanger on to a trio of Heathers, 3 prissy, squeaky clean, keep up standard, elite b*tches. She does so much with her role- greate motional range. Doherty as one of the Heathers, was the other performance that stood out against Slaters, before her 90120 days. A bit sad to think, as Doherty, a real talented and versatile actress, is currently dealing with cancer. Is the 90210 address a curse, for young promising future actors, after losing Luke Perry 2 years back. Heathers is a blacker than black comedy, about standards, murder, dead humiliating jocks, parties, attempted murder, right and wrong, and some thought provoking dialogue, and features an instrumental tune, I love, played in other movies. There are some hall, cafeteria scenes that mirror others, but there's a smarter original play here, and irreverant humour, and one great line about 'dinosaurs'. For some, who are not really into death, watch at your risk. For others, revel in this one of a kind tale of originality.",Heathers

48,dee.reid,"After ""The Breakfast Club"" and John Hughes, and before ""Clueless"" and ""Mean Girls,"" there was ""Heathers""",9,12 September 2016,"""The extreme always seems to make an impression.""^ How very true.In the post-Columbine, post-grunge rock era of 2016, I'm actually quite certain that a film like this could not be made in today's time. The 1988 black comedy ""Heathers"" (which was released theatrically one year later in 1989) is by far one of the funniest, most vicious satires ever made. I just turned 31 today, and decided to watch the film again as a birthday treat to myself; I first came across ""Heathers"" when I was in high school, and I remember thinking at the time that it was one of the strangest teen comedies I had ever come across in my life. It was unlike any teen film I'd seen before it. Back then, I did not fully understand the purpose of satire or possess a full grasp of the meaning behind ""black comedy"" - but I do now.In other words, I love satire, and ""Heathers"" has plenty of it (and much, much more).""Heathers"" came out at the tail-end of the '80s, after nearly a full decade of the likes of the late John Hughes (1950-2009), his imitators, and stupid teen gross-out/sex comedies; Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything..."" (1989) would finish out the '80s on a good note. But, put simply, the decade was a wasteland of teen comedies; Hughes obviously made the best - and sappiest - of them all. But between ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) and ""Say Anything..."", there was ""Heathers.""""Heathers"" has its origins in the mind of its screenwriter, Daniel Waters, a former video-store clerk - much like a certain hip indie director who would gain fame in 1992 and who went by the name of Quentin Tarantino - who had written a massive 200-page screenplay that he wanted Stanley Kubrick to direct. Wishful thinking at its best, perhaps, but the then-26-year-old Waters had caught on to something with his script: it was excessive, it was cynical and subversive, it was outrageous (and sure to generate plenty of controversy upon its theatrical release), it didn't take itself all that seriously, it mocked teen conventions (including the hope and idealism that often drives youth-centered social movements), and it was simply unlike anything else that was out there at the time.Hollywood usually runs away from scripts like this; ""Heathers"" is very much the definition of a pitch-black comedy that manages to elicit laughs one moment, and then audience members will be kicking themselves the next for doing so. Much like later teen comedies produced in the '90s and 2000s - like ""Clueless"" (1995) and ""Mean Girls"" (2004) - and typically centered around teenage girls, the film, in its own unique hipness, invents its own lingo, culture, and style that was bound to be followed by its many like-minded imitators over the next two decades.Directed by Micheal Lehmann in his directorial debut, ""Heathers"" centers around a clique of four very wealthy, very popular high school girls at the fictional Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio; all are named Heather - their cruel, vicious leader/""queen bee"" Heather Chandler (Kim Walker); the stylish but weak-willed cheerleader Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk); and the bookish follower Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty). There is a fourth ""Heather,"" except that her name is actually Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder, also the story's narrator). Veronica was somehow plucked from relative obscurity and joined their ranks, and she loathes every minute of it. Sick of her ""best friend"" Heather Chandler's cruelty to their classmates, she's looking for a way out and fortunately - or unfortunately? - she finds her savior in the newly transplanted, self-styled rebel-with-a-cause Jason ""J.D."" Dean (the always-cocky Christian Slater, whose character's name is quite possibly a reference to Hollywood icon James Dean, or the late author J.D. Salinger).From there, Veronica and J.D. carry on something resembling a fling, but get way in over their heads when a prank they play on Heather Chandler goes terribly awry and results in her death - thereby turning her into a martyr of sorts - J.D. conspires to up the ante by launching his own personal crusade against the school's popular elites. Veronica, meanwhile, has to find a way to stop him before it's too late.If Molly Ringwald was the ""teen queen"" of the '80s, then Winona Ryder represented the darker underbelly of teen angst; I remember the first time I saw her in ""Beetlejuice"" (1988) and she probably became my first celebrity crush. I loved her character here and the growing realization of just how far her actions have gone as she also begins to realize how sick and deranged J.D. truly is, and her desperate attempts to try to stop him. I also loved Slater's portrayal of J.D., a self-styled outsider who also hides a dark sociopathy and would arguably become the archetype for troubled teenage outsiders and loners everywhere in the '90s and early 21st century.""Heathers"" is a film that satirizes - viciously so - teen suicide, murder, bullying, cliques, and youth-centered/-driven social activism; but while it treats its subject matter with (dark) humor, it does so with a certain degree of maturity and morality - maybe even a detached sensitivity - that can be very easy to miss by some people. Regardless, in the post-Columbine world of 2016, a film like this simply could not be made in today's time, because it would be considered to be in ""bad taste."" But ""Heathers"" is a movie that was made for teenagers. In the words of producer Denise Di Novi, ""(Teenagers) see in it what they hate about high school - the tyranny of social groups... They get very clearly that these are their dark fantasies."" And that's what ""Heathers"" is, a black comedy/high school satire that plays out as the perfect realization of their darkest fantasies about the high school experience.^ In that regard, The Extreme Always Does Seem To Make An Impression.9/10",Heathers
49,mjneu59,unique teenage comedy goes off the rails,5,26 November 2010,"Winona Ryder is an aspiring member to the most powerful teen clique in Sherwood, Ohio, acting out perhaps the ultimate High School fantasy: murdering the most popular kids in class and disguising the crimes as suicides. But what begins as a morbid game of retribution against the eponymous trio of sophisticated bitches goes on too far, and then some. The same might be said about the film itself: a teen comedy no less glossy and cynical than its own characters, and likewise unafraid to take some big risks, although the trendy, up-to-the-minute aesthetics (circa 1989) would be dated in two years time. Big screen teenagers never used to behave like this, but because the story and style are so obviously facetious the final nod to morality is a serious misjudgment, and the contrived climax (defuse the time bomb before it obliterates the school!) nearly spoils the vicious pleasures of the earlier scenes. But no one can say it isn't original, although as usual the script takes a dim view of adult authority: parents, teachers, policemen, priests and so forth.",Heathers
50,MBunge,A landmark in movies about high school,7,10 July 2011,"Heathers certainly isn't the first movie about the ecosystem of popularity and loathing in American high schools, but it may the one responsible for the satirical tinge such films have had ever since.The story focuses on the most popular clique at mythical Westerburg High School. Three girls named Heather (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk and Shannen Doherty) and a brainy fourth named Veronica (Winona Ryder) dominate the school's social hierarchy in their suit jackets and short skirts. Veronica used to be an ordinary nerd and somehow worked her way up into the Heathers' company but a life of all-consuming bitchiness is wearing her out. That's when she meets a new student in school named Jason Dean (Christian Slater) who looks like a male model, talks like Jack Nicholson and dresses like one of the kids who shot up Columbine. Under J.D.'s bitter, rebel-without-a-cause influence, Veronica turns to murder as the ultimate answer to high school injustice. They kill off one of the Heathers and two abusive jocks and make them look like suicides, discovering that death gives the vapid teens a depth they never had in life. But when Veronica sees an even more awful Heather rise up to take the dead one's place, she loses her faith in J.D. and his fantasies of redemptive slaughter and finds herself the only one ready to stop J.D.'s plan to blow up the entire student body.This is a biting satire of high school existence. Your school may not have had every character featured in this story, but every school had some of these types, you were probably one of them and Heathers doesn't romanticize any of them. That's where the film gets its satirical edge, by staying grounded in reality and not simply going for the easy laugh. For example, Kim Walker plays the lead Heather at the start of the movie. She's a horrid girl who delights in tormenting the friendless fat girl in class. But when Heather #1 finds herself being groped and pressured into sex by a guy at a college party, she's clearly disgusted with herself and what she's doing but thinks it's what the most popular girl in high school is supposed to do. Likewise, Heather #3 is played by Shannen Doherty and she starts out the film and the sweet, harmless little puppy of the group that gets kicked around by Heather #1. But when Heather #3 gets her chance to be the most popular girl in school, she becomes an even more heartless, soulless monster than Heather #1. The abused becomes the abuser and wants to hurt others even more than she was hurt. It's those bits of emotional and psychological truth that set this film apart from the rest of the high school comedy genre.Heathers is a pretty funny film, though the humor is more about highlighting the absurdity of teenage behavior and less about firing off punch lines. Winona Ryder gives a magnificent performance as Veronica. She's not a terribly likable character becausewell, let's face it. Most teenagers aren't that likable and this movie doesn't pretend otherwise. But playing the sort of Sylvia Plath-in-training who always wears a monocle when she writes in her diary, Ryder makes you want to like Veronica because you can see her trying to be a better person. Ryder is also still well within that phase of transcendental cuteness at the beginning of her film career and is wonderful to look at on screen.This film was A LOT darker than most of the high school comedies of its day and remains fairly bleak by today's standards. So, if you're looking for wholesome fun, you won't find it here. For the more wicked among us, Heathers will make you laugh and make you think. Since most high school comedies don't do either, I definitely recommend you watch this one.",Heathers
51,davispittman,Well made teen 80s film,8,25 September 2016,"Heathers (1988) is a pretty dark 80s movie. The acting is great. Winona Ryder, Shannon Doherty, and Christian Slater. Winona Ryder really does do very well with the role of Veronica Sawyer, and Christian is perfect for the starring psychotic role of J.D. I also really enjoyed Shannon Doherty here, she plays a supporting role, heather duke, but she still is great, and her role becomes pretty important to the plot at one point. This movie is rather dark, just because of the subject matter and plot summary. The movie handles this dark material well with great acting by the cast and with well written dialogue. There was one thing that I really didn't care for in this movie and that was the homophobic tone of some of the scenes and the dialogue. F** is used probably 5/6 times in the movie, given it was used by jerkish jock characters, but still the movie didn't seem to condemn the action, and there is some mocking/joking of the gay community at another point, so that was kinda disappointing. But other than that, Hearhers is a well made movie that is never boring and is layered with heavy material.

53,Jonny_Numb,John Hughes on crystal meth (and that's not a compliment)...,2,9 February 2006,"""Heathers"" is one of those overly proud 'cult' items that, like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" has amassed some sort of sick, twisted band of followers that apparently reside at the shallow end of the Petri Dish. This would-be satire, would-be dark comedy, would-be misfit teen romance is riddled with Hughes-ian dialog speckled with would-be shocking F-words and epithets that would-be 'outta style' the following year. A young Winona Ryder plays Veronica, a hanger-on to an elite trio of girls (all named 'Heather') who practically run their ""Anytown, USA"" high school; in enters J.D. (a pre-deep-voiced Christian Slater), who enlists Veronica as a pawn in his quest to annihilate the pond scum walking the halls. The script trots out every cliché imaginable: the sexist, homophobic football jocks; the gawky nerds; the requisite Fat Girl; the bitch-princess elite; chain-smoking teachers; the mysterious loner; and parents who are either apathetic or psychotic. I wouldn't take issue with these stereotypes--heck, Mr. Hughes exploits them to no end in his films--if they had been used in a unique or funny way, which they aren't. The presentation of high school is so absurdly and self-consciously exaggerated that all attempts at humor and satire come off as contrived...and when the film finally abandons 'humor' in the third act for some very divergent, half-assed 'surrealistic symbolism,' you wonder what director Michael Lehmann and writer Daniel Waters had in mind to begin with. Whatever it was, it certainly wasn't anywhere near 'funny' or 'profound.' (My advice: seek out ""Massacre at Central High"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" to see this material done properly.)",Heathers

A very different kind of movie that most people I know tend to either really really like or not like at all.I loved Heathers growing up and thought it was an excellent movie. First were the Performers. Everyone was great in it. I'm not a strong fan of Christian Slater but have to say he was positively CREEPY and very effective though there's a lot of Jack Nicholson going on there.Then there's the subject matter. The movie is as twisted as they come but thought provoking too and so different from most of the teen flicks around at that time, it really leaves a mark.Many years later I have to note a bit of similarity to ""Cruel intentions""(which came out later of coarse) not so much in subject matter, but they both have that dark twisted quality although Heathers has more humor in it and is honestly, personal preferences aside, a better movie overall. In Fact, Heathers, while really a very serious movie, has some very funny moments, though the movie is pretty dark as a whole. This seems to be a little known classic but I think anyone who's a fan of a movie like Cruel Intentions or who like their teen movies a bit on the darker side, or who like movies about the pressures of fitting in at school, cliques, and peer pressure would definitely like Heathers.It really stands out from other teen movies and is somewhat frightening in a very serious way, as well as containing some great performances.I'd rate it an easy 8 of 10.

Well, what we have here are three Heathers (last names: Duke, Chandler and McNamara, if anybody cares) who reign as upper crust sosh queens at Westerberg High, home of the Rottweilers. One of the Heather Rottweilers is Shannen Doherty of TV infamy who seems perfectly cast except for the fact that if she's still in high school, I can play opposite Barbie Doll.Trying to work her way into their circle is a one-time study-freak with a talent for forging handwriting named Veronica (would that we had Archie and Jughead as well). I mention her penmanship because it's part of the plot, although why they bothered with the fancy foreshadowing I don't know since most of the story is beside the point anyway.This is a black comedy that takes off on the usual high school teen angst clichés: suicide, rigid social stratification, dumb jocks, dumb parents, dumb administrators, and even dumber teachers. And there are some very funny bits to be had along the way. Unfortunately playing Veronica is Winona Ryder who, although she is as pretty as pretty can be, even sporting a monocle--yes, somebody must have pointed out to director Michael Lehmann that putting nerd-girl glasses on a pretty girl has been done to death, so he had an Inspiration. Ryder has moments--some of them unintentional--but there is no way she can be seen as a comedic actress. We really needed Rene Zellweger or Reese Witherspoon.Playing opposite Ryder with some finesse is Christian Slater as J.D. Dean, teen psycho, son of Psycho Dad, who explains that he is blowing up the school ""because nobody loves me."" What really cracked me up about Christian Slater is that ""Columbo"" voice he sometimes uses. And what I found funny about Winona Ryder were all those outfits with the cutesy hats and leggings.If only they had let her keep them she might have missed her day in court.Best bit: the two jocks getting their just deserts and the two cops ""investigating"" the scene.So bad it was almost good: Veronica getting her cigarette lit by a dynamite explosion.Like, this could happen: Veronica and Martha ""Dumptruck"" Dunnstock doing popcorn and old movies together on prom night.I want to see her do it again, slowly: the Rottweiler cheerleader doing a twirling handstand.Bottom line: ignore the implausible and send your parents to bed.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

The basic premise of the girl who tries to fit in with the popular clique while hating herself for what that entails is hardly novel but screenwriter Daniel Waters took the story into some pretty dark places. Playing teen suicide for black comedy, the movie has a satiric bite that most teen comedies lack.The story revolves around Winona Ryder's character Veronica, the lackey of the school's dominant female clique - the Heathers. Disenchanted with her cohorts' selfish & vindictive ways, she falls for eccentric bad-boy J.D. (Christian Slater). However, when his influence leads to her complicity in multiple murders staged as suicides she begins to rebel against his increasingly psychotic ways.As you can imagine, the story is much darker than contemporary movies by John Hughes and the like. Yet, the script's sense of humour prevents the movie from becoming a drag. Daniel Waters' inventive use of slang also gave the film a unique flavour. I'm not sure that the end result is quite as profound as it could have been but Waters deserves praise for trying something different.The acting is in pretty decent hands with Ryder & Slater ably filling the lead roles. Ryder, 16 at the time of filming, is particularly impressive but Slater's Jack Nicholson-ish performance has an endearing quality as well. The three Heathers (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk & Shannen Doherty) are also memorable while the rest of the cast is mostly unremarkable.Michael Lehmann's direction is capably handled if not especially noteworthy. Musically, the movie has a distinct eighties feel that I'm not really a fan of, though the use of a pair of versions of ""Que Sera, Sera"" is intriguing.Ultimately, ""Heathers"" is a fascinating time capsule of late eighties teen angst that still resonates today. To see its influence, look no further than ""Mean Girls"", co-incidentally directed by Daniel Waters' brother Mark. Clearly, the movie's sharp wit and gleeful satire have aged better than the eighties fashions featured therein.",Heathers
62,Howlin Wolf,"""The only place different social types can genuinely get along is in Heaven"".",8,28 July 2007,"... and anyone who remembers high school will know instantly that it was hardly an idyllic place to be!Working from an incisive and acidic script by Daniel Waters, talented director Lehmann does well, although he's since failed to capture lightning in a bottle so effectively as here (the closest he came being 1996's pleasant but lightweight ""The Truth About Cats & Dogs""). This is a satire that skewers brilliantly the lengths some teenagers will find themselves going to just to fit in. There is a certain code that must be followed when you're amongst your peers, and if you don't adhere to that, then it can almost feel like you're dead - given that you'll be frozen out of the social scene. Is it worth teaming up with the school rebel to exact your revenge? As the movie plays out, it shows you where going through with that daydream will get you...Aside from the sizzling chemistry between Ryder and Slater, almost every line of dialogue is clever in some way. From ""Ich Luge"" bullets to how distant parents cope with grief - ""I love my dead gay son!"" - ""Heathers"" is a film that has you laughing at subject matter which could easily have been queasy in the wrong hands. It seems that no adolescent taboo is left undiscussed. Everything you could immediately think of is examined thoroughly. I only wish that all involved had stuck with the ending as it was originally planned, since it would have carried the nihilistic attitude adopted throughout right to its limits. Alas it was not to be, but happily there is still plenty of scorn to go around. Possibly my favourite example occurs when Veronica is approached by the school counselor: ""Get a job"", she scathingly admonishes!School prepares you for the real world, which also sucks... Never has that statement been more aptly proved than in ""Heathers"".",Heathers
63,Screen_Blitz,"Dark, but witty high school comedy",7,16 January 2016,"From director Michael Lehmann and writer Daniel Waters comes a cult classic 80s black comedy based on the Broadway play that is both funny and unexpectedly dark, a comedy that tackles themes of social pressure and high school cliques through the use of macabre humor and cynical social commentary. Micheal Lehmann proves the capability of executing the not-so-typical concept with effectiveness and intelligence, though doesn't go without its flaws. This film follows 17-year old Veronica Sawyer (played by Winona Ryder), a high school girl who is part of a clique known as ""Heathers"", three of the girls are all named Heather including the bulimic Heather Duke (played by Shannon Daughtry), the emotionally fragile cheerleader Heather McNamara (played by Lisanne Falk), and the cruel, stuck-up leader of the group Heather Chandler (played by Kim Walker). Veronica has grown despised of the group as these girls as they continue to run her reputation down the hole with their snobbish behavior and attitude towards individuals of lower value. She meets a sociopathic young man named J.D (played by Christian Slater) who shares equal dislike for the ""Heathers"" and volunteers to help Veronica settle the score with three girls, only to pull her in a dangerous game of murder and suicide.This is not your average teen comedy like the John Hughes fare (The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles), popular during the 80s. As the matter of fact, it is quite dark as the plot deals with murder and teens committing murder and disguising them as suicide in attempts to refresh the social politics of their high school. But at the same time, it boasts a very clever and witty story with just enough humor to drag it out of the thriller territory. With an enthralling screenplay by Daniel Waters and a smart, but imperfect direction by Michael Lehmann, the film allows for a darker exploration of teen social life with something new other than slasher horror flicks following teens stalked by a serial killer in a mask. The plot tackles on themes of social satire, anti-social behavior,vengeance, and juvenile delinquency; and the themes work surprisingly well, especially for a movie centered on high school teens. Though it falls a little inconsistent at times, it is decently written. The characters, complete with clever and occasionally humorous dialogue and solid performances, are quite interesting, and at times, very funny in the midst of the film's dark nature. And how the story allows these characters to develop is also another treat. The main character Veronica serves as a mostly likable protagonist, a young girl stuck in an unusual world of teen cruelty and must battle against her sinister reputation when she gets involved with violent schemes by his the sociopathic antagonist J.D. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater are both charismatic in their roles, and the interaction between this duo really keeps the plot stable in the midst of its flaws. As the story progresses, the film gets darker scene by scene, but it never strays away from the darkly funny atmosphere that defines its cynical- themed plot.Heathers may not be one of the best teen comedies out there, but it is truly something memorable as well as clever. It is a solid and entertaining portrayal of social satire and teen cruelty that high schoolers and adults alike can certainly enjoy.",Heathers
64,punishmentpark,"""Tomorrow, I'll be kissing her aerobicized ass, but tonight, let me dream of a world without Heather, a world where I am free.""",7,9 August 2015,"A weird one, but also a nice one, with a lot of fun foul language. It reminded me somewhat of 'Serial mom' (1994), but that one worked better as a (black) comedy. Here, at times, I thought I was watching a David Lynch movie - which isn't really a bad thing, though.I hadn't expected things getting as moralizing as they did, but luckily things didn't go too far in that respect. The ending was pretty good, even if the studios (who were thinking more of how to sell or rent this) denied the film a darker ending (all typed out here on IMDb's trivia).'The catcher in the rye' did enter my mind several times throughout the film, but J.D. Salinger didn't want his book mentioned, so that became 'Moby Dick' (Christian Slater's character is still called J.D. though).The subject of suicide was seemingly becoming (even more than usual) a big issue in the States, and the film does feel a bit like an over the top after school special, but it doesn't surprise me at all that this became a true cult movie.Acting-wise, Christian Slater and Wynona Ryder do a decent job, but that's about it. Finally, it's worth checking the trivia list on IMDb for all sorts of fun facts, such as the ones concerning Brad Pitt, Heather Graham and Jennifer Connelly.

65,pyrocitor,Lüge meets loogie,8,13 April 2017,"Roger Ebert's 1988 review for Heathers prefaced his bewilderment at its corrosive social politics as feeling like ""a traveller in an unknown country"" – but for most audiences who have survived high school to follow, Heathers will feel all too much like coming home. Certainly, for those who normally take their high school comedies with a healthy helping of the Beach Boys or Zac Efron, the film will be a slap in the face, but still leave them thankful it wasn't a slap of Draino or an 'Ich Lüge' bullet. Still, almost 30 years down the line, with its original high school audience now old enough to have high schoolers of their own (oh God...), in a culture sadly more entrenched in teen suicide and school shootings than ever, Heathers remains as eerily prescient as ever. The mountain of shoulder pads, synths and perms may conjure a blast from the past, but a film this razor-sharp couldn't feel more scarily topical, so scathingly audacious you have to laugh, if only in incredulity.If you're one of the precious few who enjoyed high school congratulations. Heathers will make you pay for it. If you're one of the many who saw high school as a battleground, kill-or-be-killed Heathers will literalize that maxim to an uncomfortable extent, with a score of nervous titters to follow. Running by the seat of its pantsuit with snappy, uncompromisingly jet-black satire, the film is hazily shot with that airy synth soundtrack cultivating an air of heightened delirium, as if a gossamer dream, or someone about to keel over, blackout drunk. The disjuncture is appropriate, as Heathers' navigation of the border between sweet and sour in corrosive high school cliques is on point, a savage middle finger to the conventions of high school movies – even predecessor cautionary tales a-la Rebel Without a Cause and Carrie aren't safe from its scorn. The humour is less laugh-out-loud funny, more 'smirk and occasionally bray in incredulity because it's uncomfortably true,' with even many sheepish laughs turning into uncomfortably guilty reversals that pull the rug out from under you and leave you lying there, aching for those who have ever been jeered at by a bully, been the bully jeering, or worse: been one of the multitudes who stood by and did nothing to stop it. Protagonist Veronica's ""Life Sucks!"" platitude may start as a joke, but it doesn't stay one for long. But, M.A.S.H. be damned, suicide isn't painless. And it's here where Heathers, good conversation piece with its heart in the right place as it is, raises some eyebrows, and not always in the cheerfully controversy-baiting way that it wants. Let me preface this by saying that I strongly disagree that any text navigating the mine field of teen suicide, bullying, or attempted mass killings need tiptoe, its face a somber mask. Nonetheless, Heathers, trailblazing the debate, is almost too groundbreaking to make its points effectively, or ethically. The titular bullies, cartoon characters that they are, are almost too unforgettably quotable for their acidity not to soak into generations of wannabe popular kids too self-servingly cruel to get the satire (now doubly reinforced by a generation reared on Tina Fey's Mean Girls, which owes a massive debt to Heathers' snark, but pointedly inserted a hefty 'moral of the story' third act as a get- out-of-jail-free card, the likes of which are unseen here). Then there's Christian Slater's (aptly named) J.D. - a remix of Dean and baby-Nicholson too impossibly slick and cool not to cement his nihilistic ideology into the hearts of a disenfranchised generation... which gets problematic when his sliminess, subtle multiplicities of abuse, escalating serial killing, and cheerfully detailed attempt to bomb the school don't quite stick in our bad books the way they're meant to. Check the film's poster - a cutesy, wholesome, quirky romance for the whole family this ain't. It's a cruelly ironic and perplexingly glib outcome for a film that so intelligently unpacks the rationale of copycat suicides, particularly amidst the aforementioned epidemic of school shootings. But, as Veronica's blistering journal gradually comes to terms with, we - each individual one of us, and culture as a whole - are all ultimately more to blame than we'd ever like to be. Better come to terms with it. Life's very much worth living, but it still... sucks. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of Veronica's slide from toxic, abusive friend group to toxic, (differently) abusive relationship to taking agency of her own social standing is less attributable to the film's screenplay, and more chalked up to Winona Ryder's doggedly charismatic performance. Articulate, ballsy, unbearably cool and pungently endearing, Ryder is a rock of reason in a revolving maelstrom of nonsense (and if anything perfectly captures the essence of high school, it's this). Pair this with the triple-threat of Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, and it's no wonder her 'eccentric cynic with a heart' archetype almost singularly carved out the voice (and middle finger) of Generation-X angst. Still, we should really talk about that monocle, though...Sauntering into the cultural unconsciousness like a snappy, hip, and truthful John Hughes movie stubbing out its cigarette on the school flag, Heathers' social politics may not always be quite as razor-sharp as its witticisms, but it's unquestionably more big-hearted than black hearted, even as the bodies hit the floor. Whether spawning spin off off-Broadway musicals, reminding viewers that pre-Mean Girls teen movies had teeth, or shocking generations anew with its funny, scary, omnipotence, Heathers' cultural power and presence continues to thwack us like a croquet ball to the collective forehead. In short, it's very... very.-8/10",Heathers
66,napierslogs,Realistically dark and unabashedly candid about the comedy and horrors of high school,8,13 February 2011,"Popular girls are so annoying, especially when they are all named Heather. Veronica (Winona Ryder) is like them, except she isn't a Heather and wishes she could be popular without being friends with them. Enter J.D. (Christian Slater), he's one of those bad guys with whispers about the kind of trouble he has gotten into. You know the kind of guy from other films, with rumours about what he did to get kicked out of school. Those rumours are always so exaggerated, except in this case, J.D. may actually be worse than the rumours about him.After introducing Veronica and J.D., ""Heathers"" takes some very shocking, disturbing, pitch-black turns. And that's why this film is so brilliant. They took an unflinching look at the maliciousness of high school students and then presented it to us as a comedy. Today, the high school comedies have the popular kids take a girl in a ponytail and glasses and turn her into a hot chick and then the cliques live happily ever after with each other, but ""Heathers"" has realistically superficial girls and there's a good chance that nobody will be living happily ever after.The only place this film fails is in their catchy dialogue pretending to be trendy and cool, like ""Did you have a brain tumour for breakfast?"" It's better written than that. It also teaches a lesson on what happens when you pretend to be trendy and cool. Trust me, it's not pretty. I wouldn't recommend watching ""Heathers"" before you enter high school, but if you manage to get out of it alive, then this film will show you one of the more fascinating tales.",Heathers
67,lambiepie-2,"I'll admit it, I was a Veronica!",10,17 May 2003,"When this film came out, I didn't see it in the theater. I caught it in the video store. I walked into the video store and the funeral for the Football player was running. I stopped, watched, and laughed my head off. I immediately rented ""Heathers"" and fell in love with it.""Heathers"" is the realization of what almost every kid in high school was exposed to at one time or another. You were either a ""Heather"" or a ""Veronica"" or the spooky/mysterious new kid, or the jock, or the undesirable, or the cheerleader, or the kid who wanted ""in"" as a ""Heather"" or..or..or. The only thing is that ""Heathers"" goes on to show you what happens ""if""...If you could get away with some of the things you were thinking of at the time! The actions of the parents and teachers are to die for. When you're young you think you can figure out just about anything, or figure out what the adults are thinking and try to get around it. ""Heathers"" gets into it all, very darkly, and carries it off well. Although I thought the ending was a bit too...tidy.If you're in High School, (over 17 of course) or in College looking back at High School, you'll identify with this film. If you're an adult, this may remind you of those days, but this is a nicely done dark humored film. Go rent it today, see it uncut.",Heathers
68,film-critic,"Chaos was what killed the dinosaurs, darling.",10,28 August 2005,"After I finished watching Heathers for the first time, I couldn't help but look over my body to make sure that I wasn't bleeding from any cuts. This was literally the sharpest written film that I have ever experienced arriving from the 1980s. From the dialogue to the story to the underlying symbolism that hits you right in the face, it is hard to believe that this film isn't on the top list of everyone out there. It reminded me of the first time that I watched Fight Club. The darkness surrounding Tyler Durden was nearly the same as what followed Slater around as he forced Ryder into these situations. In fact, the similarities between the two films are outstanding. I would love to take these two movies and watch them back to back to see what else could be connected. For those that liken Heathers to Mean Girls, I would say ""yes"", but Fight Club has more relevance. Even the film The Suicide Club seemed to ooze a bit of Heathers the first time I watched it. Either way, this movie stands out above anything else that I have witnessed. The dark characters, the lines spoken by the actors and the story just seeped ""cult classic"" and should be watched by everyone interested in film.I have to applaud the actors in this film. I realize that this was one of Christian Slater's first films and he was phenomenal. The speeches that he delivered spoke to me and really defined him as a better actor than what he eventually became. Ryder was exceptional as well. The chemistry that these two had together should go down in film books as one of the quirkiest romances Hollywood has ever contrived. Their ability to make us believe in their plight as well feel their frustration and anguish is tough to find in today's Hollywood. Combined with some great performances by (gaspshould I say it?) Shannon Doherty, Lisanne Falk, and Kim Walker as the three ""Heathers"", you cannot help but find yourself lost in these rich, devoted characters. While the story carries itself, these actors brought the words of the screenplay to life. They spoke of more than just high school drama, but instead the status of our society and the absurdity of suicide. They changed themes, destroyed stagnant decisions, and opened the door to so many possibilities, both dark and comical, that I am shocked that more isn't explored with this film. If I were to grab three films about our society to show to a race of aliens, I would take Fight Club, The Suicide Club, and Heathers. These are the films that are not afraid to speak the truth about our world.I need to go ahead and say ""WOW"" to the story. Not just ""WOW"" in a state of shock, but also a ""WOW"" in the style of excitement. I did not see this film coming. I knew that it had been promoted as this ""dark comedy"", but I have seen plenty of those and was concerned that it just wouldn't hit the buttons that it needed to. Again, and I love to say this, but I was wrong. Daniel Waters dove deep into the world of High School and exposed some of the darkest corners that other Hollywood films were afraid to touch. Even Mean Girls never quite hit the buttons that it should have. This movie talked about sex, parties, drugs, clicks, and the harshness of being an outcast. It did this in such a ""real"" way that you could not't help but think back to your own High School days while watching this movie. The language is so intense that after you watch it for the first time, certain quotes are just embedded in your mind. What other film can you say creates that impression? I know of only a handful that I walked away from still quoting the movie. Heathers is a success and should never be ignored.Finally, I would like to give credit to director Michael Lehmann for exposing such a brutal topic and not going too commercial with it. There were some moments where you could tell that there was a Hollywood path that Lehmann could have followed and made viewers probably happier, but instead he completely turned and went a new direction. There were scenes that I was shocked to see, like the scene in the bathroom with Heather and her pills, because it was as if Lehmann was creating more than just a story, but an entire world. His attention to detail and obvious hand on the pulse of the young adult world was obvious in this film. Lehmann successfully created a lasting dark comedy that is both thought provoking and exciting at the same time. I would even go so far as to say that this might have been the best movie to come out of the 80s, but I don't want to jump too soon  but it is close.Overall, I suggest Heathers to everyone and anyone. I also suggest skipping any version that comes on television and go straight to getting it on DVD. The R-rating gives you the full effect of this film, while I think anything less would diminish the quality of this Grade ""A"" work. For those that passionately loved Fight Club and want to see the issues expressed in that film on a high school level, than this is the film for you! Amazing from beginning to end with some of the greatest quotes any singular film has created! I cannot wait to watch this film again  and again  and again  and again  and again!

70,hall895,"Whatever will be, will be",7,19 September 2013,"Three girls, all named Heather, form the most popular and powerful clique at Ohio's Westerburg High School. But in that weird high school way the most popular girls are also the most hated and feared. Nobody actually likes the Heathers. Veronica certainly doesn't like them. She's sort of an auxiliary Heather, a onetime nerd whom the Heathers have brought under their wing. This makes Veronica cool and popular by association. But seeing the Heathers up close allows Veronica to see them for who they really are. They're mean-spirited, cruel and unlikeable. The queen Heather so to speak, the leader of the group, is Heather Chandler. Veronica has definitely had it with this particular Heather. Veronica wants to disassociate herself from Heather Chandler. The new guy in school, rebellious loner J.D., thinks Veronica can do more than just that. And thus we, and Veronica, go down the blackest of black comedy paths.Heathers is great satire, often hilarious and always smart. It's a terrific script from Daniel Waters. After watching this film it's hard to believe his followup was the execrable The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Here his plot is fascinating, his dialogue is brilliant. The film is rather cynical but it absolutely revels in its cynicism. The lead characters do some reprehensible things but we love them anyway. Well, we love Veronica. J.D. is a little harder to embrace, Veronica never seems to get a handle on him and neither do we. But that just makes him all the more fascinating. J.D. takes the film to some dark places but the laughs still keep coming. This is one morbidly amusing film.The film made stars of Winona Ryder and Christian Slater and rightly so. They're both fabulous. Ryder is a very unique performer, there's just something a little different about her. And in this film that works so well for her. She's got great personality, great charm. She delivers the film's exceedingly witty dialogue perfectly and creates a truly memorable character. And Ryder is matched every step of the way by Slater, who plays rebel with a cause J.D. with great aplomb. The comparisons to a young Jack Nicholson are obvious and fitting. Some supporting players are also excellent. Kim Walker is terrific as the ultra-snobby Heather Chandler, a girl who revels in being queen of her little world. Shannen Doherty and Lisanne Falk play the other Heathers. Doherty gets more to do and thus stands out more but Falk is fine as well. Lance Fenton and Patrick Labyorteaux play a couple of obnoxious football jocks to whom J.D. takes great pleasure in meting out his unique brand of justice. The adults in the movie make less of an impression. The film is much better when the focus is on the kids and their weird, messed-up high school life. It's a daring film, one which allows you to laugh at things which should not be particularly funny. This is satire with a sharp, biting edge to it. All the elements are there to make a cult classic. So many high school movies come and go, forgotten almost as soon as they are released. Heathers endures. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.",Heathers
71,gftbiloxi,The Extreme Always Seems To Make An Impression,10,30 September 2005,"Released in 1989, HEATHERS received sharply mixed reviews. The film was popular in a few major metro markets, but it proved a box office disappointment overall. Although many regarded it as a failed take-off on such ""high school angst"" films as THE BREAKFAST CLUB, more than a few critics saw it as a film too much ahead of its time and predicted that it would have more of an impact down the road. They were right. When the film began to reach the home market it exploded in popularity, and given such later high school horrors as Columbine today the film seems less take-off than downright prophetic.It is also one of the most wickedly funny movies to hit the screen since Stanley Kubrik's DR. STRANGELOVE. The story starts off normally enough: extremely bright, extremely attractive Veronica (Winona Ryder) is a high school junior who has fallen in with the high school clique to end all high school cliques, three young women each named Heather (Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk, and Shannen Doherty.) The Heathers are pretty, smart, rich... and intent on shoring up their own social positions by crushing every one around them with a degree of vindictiveness that only the teenagers can successfully carry.When Veronica meets new student J.D. Dean (Christian Slater) her interest in the Heathers begins to wane and they turn on her. J.D. has his own plan to help Veronica get even. It involves a cup of Liquid Drano--and before Veronica can think she finds herself making a murder look like suicide. The result is, as Veronica puts it, teen-age angst with a body count, and quite suddenly suicide seems the ""in thing"" at Westerberg High.If you recall high school fondly, you were probably one of the popular kids. For the rest of us, HEATHERS is so accurate that it will make you wince in its portrait of unthinking cruelty: the meanness of the up-scale cliques and brainless jocks, the ridiculed good kids, the savage assaults on the unpopular ones. it is bitter, bitter stuff.It is also extremely funny. Much of this is due to a truly brilliant script by Daniel Waters, who recognizes that teens rarely speak to adults in the same way that they speak to each other--and he not only brings forth the casually used profanity, he essentially creates a truly believable and hilariously funny mode of slang that characterizes the ""in crowd."" And Waters' plot is even more disconcerting and outrageously funny as it runs, with unexpected logic, to a truly deadly conclusion.The performances are knockouts. Ryder has given quite a few memorable performances, but she has never been more remarkable than she is here as Veronica, the good girl turned unintentional killer; Christian Slater has never topped the performance he gives here as J.D. The ""Heathers"" are perfectly, flawless cast, as is every one from the weary principal to Veronica's vacuous parents. As for direction, Michael Lehmann moves the film at a rapid clip, hitting more high points than you can imagine. Indeed, everything about the film is first-rate.The DVD package is very nice, including an interesting audio commentary, an interesting documentary featuring interviews with director, writer, and major cast members (Kim Walker, who died in 2001, sadly excepted), and a script of the ending as originally planned by writer Waters. I recommend the film as a ""must have""--but a word of warning. If you were one of the very popular during your high school years, you won't find it in the least enjoyable. Yes: that's really how the rest of us saw you.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Heathers
72,CitizenCaine,Outrageous Teen Satire Foreshadowed The Future,8,18 October 2008,"Heathers has become a cult classic of the high school life genre and rightfully so. Unlike a great majority of films, which previously depicted teenage life, Heathers does not assume that the majority of teenagers are victims or victimized by a select group of nasty peers, parents, or teachers. Sure, the film displays the various stereotyped groups: Queen Bees, Wanna Bees, Stupid Jocks, Bookish Rule-Followers, Geeks, Social Outcasts, and the Lone Mysterious Avenger. However, Heathers utilizes the stereotypes in unique ways, some equally hilarious, sad, and sick to make serious points about real teenage life, peer pressure, teen suicide, do-good faculty, and (most bitingly) clueless parents.What must have seemed shockingly outrageous in 1989 actually echos the times we live in now. Anyone who has worked with teenagers for any length of time, such as teachers, coaches, mentors, or parents realizes that today's teenagers are much like some of those portrayed in the film: Amoral, disrespectful, extremely cruel, foul-mouthed, lacking in character, self-absorbed, undisciplined, and unfeeling. Most of them possess several of these traits and are clueless about so-doing. Christian Slater gives a perfect performance as the Jack Nicholson-like J.D. who captures all of the aforementioned traits, as well as Winona Ryder who captures them to a lesser degree. Together they explode on screen as a teenage couple intellectually justifying amorality through their twisted reasoning (reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb case) that somehow their collective, morally bankrupt actions improve their school. The catalysts for their actions may be the bitchiest queen bees ever seen on screen: The three girls named Heather: Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk, and a Pre-90210 Shannen Doherty.At first, the audience identifies with the odd couples' actions and finds them hilarious and off-beat. As the stakes get higher, an emotional void develops between Slater's J.D. and Ryder's Veronica. Ryder discovers that non-conformity is not and should not be an end unto itself, and she has to choose between what she knows is right and Slater. Along the way, the film highlights the parenting anomaly that was already underway at the time of the film's production as a result of the misguided self-esteem movement which devoured the public school system across the country. In both Slater's and Ryder's parents, we see elements of childlike parents who either have no control or who allow their kids control of their households. With Veronica's parents, it's a little subtle, but it's clearly the case between Slater's J.D. and his dad (where their banter indicates almost complete role reversal). Parents are merely like friends. Scenes like this may have seemed comical and satirical at the film's release, but the reality is they're all too commonplace in real life today. I've witnessed dozens of such exchanges between teenagers and parents myself. Perhaps the scariest message of the film is how it handles the subject of teen suicide; the teenagers' reactions to their classmates' deaths are simultaneously hilarious and outrageous. Their indifference is especially chilling and strangely realistic. The faculty and parents' reactions are similar. The film ends on a more upbeat note, which seems antithetical to the rest of the film. I think the planned original ending would have been more consistent with the film's tone. Kudos to writer Daniel Waters, the real star of this film. The film's dialog created a world of its own. *** of 4 stars.",Heathers

74,itamarscomix,Not Another Teen Comedy,8,21 August 2012,"Heathers isn't just a black comedy; it's blacker than black. It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none (Ten points to whoever gets that reference). It's a comedy so dark that it's almost impossible to enjoy it and not feel bad about it afterwords. It's a film that looks so much like a run-of-the-mill high school comedy that the very subtle satire may go over many viewers' heads. What's worse, teenagers, who are likely to enjoy it more than anybody, may easily misunderstand it completely and idolize the villain, talking it in a very dangerous direction.For all these reasons, Heathers was doomed from day one to fall between the cracks - the ones who would have appreciated it the most just didn't see it, and the ones who saw it didn't understand it. Today, in those post-Columbine times, it's more difficult than ever to appreciate its sharp satire without feeling a tinge of guilt. But it would be a real shame if it was forgotten; because it really is a unique film, one that deconstructed and pillaged the entire high-school comedy genre that was so popular in the 80's, and because it inspired Clueless, Mean Girls and so many other films that were so much tamer and more simplistic. It's a movie that stands out in a genre filled with mediocrity, and it's still very much worth watching, even if it's hard to enjoy it as a comedy anymore.",Heathers

Anyhow, I really can't talk about this movie without revealing some spoilers. If you want the film to be a total surprise than I'll just tell you to see the movie. Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) is part of a clique of three beautiful popular girls all conveniently named Heather; stereotypical mean girl Heather Chandler (Kim Walker), pushover Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk), and bookish Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty). The Heathers spend most of their time bullying the overweight Martha ""Dumptruck"" Dunnstock (Carrie Lynn) while Veronica has her eye for the loner new kid Jason ""JD"" Dean (Christian Slater). When Veronica brings JD along in a plan to get back at Chandler by making her a drink mix that will make her throw up, JD discreetly pours drain cleaner in it. Needless to say she dies.

When faced with retaliation and even more pressure after trying to break free from the Heathers, Veronica turns to J.D. for help. A prank would be a good way to get back at the Heathers? Perhaps. But J.D. has other plans Definitely meets the definition of black-comedy, but the audience has to suspend a little too much disbelief. Not to mention, much of the main character's conflicts could be easily resolved by simply dialing 9-1-1.

84,Horror-yo,"Very dark comedy: good for an hour, then drops",6,12 August 2017,"So it really is actually funny. Its completely caricatured representation of particular profiles, how it escalates blatantly fast and how complacently it gets out of hand... it's really funny stuff for an hour. Ryder, constantly criticized for her 'terrible acting', does very well here. Slater is good too as the totally icy sociopath.The film actually does well in giving body to its characters, we get to see why they are a particular way, they're not just randomly insane. But past that hour mark, it becomes too self-indulgent and when the laughs no longer happen we're left with an ending a bit too cute.The social commentary on the late 80's teenager condition can be appreciated, but this film seems to not pick a side: if you're giving the public an outrageous, very dark humored comedy for the whole two thirds of a film, you can't just stick that with a pseudo-deep final act in the end, especially when it's only half-convincing at all.",Heathers

86,doctorsmoothlove,This is Winona Ryder before Edward Scissorhands,7,16 March 2008,"There are some really great films available that for some reason aren't popular with audiences. Heathers is one of those films. It is a very entertaining film that is surprisingly violent given its high school backdrop. I had seen a lot of references to this film in the literature and other films that I'd read and seen.As for plot, the film has no significant problems. I only wish that the introduction to the three Heathers and Veronica hadn't been so awkward. I was thrown into it and had no idea what was happening. However, the film did later introduce the characters properly and all was forgiven. Something I found ironic was Heather Chandler's ""Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?"" quote. Kim Walker, who plays Heather Chandler, died of a malignant brain tumor. I also was pleased with how original the plot is. How frequently do we see high school films concerning the destruction of the school via a bomb? Now after 9/11 and Virginia Tech, I doubt we'll see films like this (at least in the United States). The film also makes good use of its ""R"" rating. There is a surprising amount of violence and sex, but it isn't graphic. Also, there is a lot of situational humor and a small amount of juvenile humor but it isn't the focus. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not but I found that the film had a strong individualist message. Veronica tries to be the most popular girl and learns how meaningless it is. As the Heathers all died, someone else replaced her. The cycle continues indefinitely. Veronica also develops into a three-dimensional character by the film's end. I wish J.D. had the same level of development but it doesn't hurt the film significantly.I've seen many comparisons between this film and Mean Girls and this confuses me. The two films have little in common other than their high school backdrop. Heathers is an intelligent and adult film with dark themes. Mean Girls is a film primarily for teenagers with comical themes. I like Mean Girls but it is not as much as I enjoy Heathers.Heathers is a rare film that combines two very different genres: black comedy and high school. In addition, it also proposes a philosophical question: can anyone escape from the social cycle in which they partake? You should watch this influential high school film that rivals Donnie Darko in its legacy. I assure you, it isn't a ""hardcore"" version of Mean Girls.",Heathers
87,JakeBrinkman,"Very well made, but unrelatable characters",6,9 December 2019,"Beautiful cinematography is the most catching aspect of this satire, though it's expertly written as well. The color themes are critical to the plot, highlighting major developments without ever explicitly stating or showing the change. The juxtaposed identical sentences with entirely different meanings was very clever. All of the adult characters' dialogue fueled the absurdity to emphasize the satire, which contrarily made it easier to maintain immersion by giving us reason to overlook the numerous minor illogical moments in the plot. My biggest complaint is that I didn't have any emotional connection with any of the characters aside from Veronica's (Ryder) sparse but relatable mercy/pity scenes.Heathers was expertly designed to keep me giddily entertained throughout, but ultimately the lack of personal connection holds the movie back just enough to fall short of my list of favorite movies.",Heathers

91,Flagrant-Baronessa,Anyone for colour-coded croquet?,7,7 December 2006,"I thought not.'Heathers' offers a sprawling surge of contemporary 1980's high school culture but with timeless issues like peer pressure, cliques and identity. As a dark comedy, it navigates the unspeakable cruelty of the popular crowd in making other people's lives a living hell and exerting dominance on the entire high school body. It is a staple in its genre but whatever it once did for the teen comedy scene, tons of subsequent high school flicks have done better, more subtly and more enjoyably in recent years.Nevertheless, you will be pressed to find something noticeably sub-par in the film. The ending, if anything, is quite cheesy but the meticulous crafting up to this point is tended well to by director Michael Lehmann. Veronica (Winona Ryder) has infiltrated the notoriously popular 'Heathers' group with all its elaborate network of catchphrases, colour coding and cruel stares, but when she meets the resident bad-boy J.D. (Christian Slater) she begins to question if the school may just be a better place without the existence of the three heartless Heathers. Thus a morbid offing of the popular hierarchy begins in the form of staged suicide hysteria  unfortunately for Veronica and J.D. (or ""Bonnie & Clyde"") it appears as though if you cut off a cheerleader's head, another one will grow back.The story may not be the most perfectly-sketched template in modern cinema (although Ryder has said its script is up there with her favourite book 'The Catcher in the Rye' in terms of quality) but there are some hilariously engrossing detours and diversions, like the incessant croquet playing. This game  the rules you play by, the strategies you use and the colours that you have been assigned  is highly symbolic and significant in the story. Will you strike to hits or knock someone out? To sew it all together, the film is puffed full of teen atmosphere, peppered with quotable lines and strongly supported by an otherwise lightweight cast.Certainly the performances generally hold up fairly well with Christian Slater's effortless appeal as the bad-boy heartthrob (and arguably the Jack Nicholson of high school flicks) at the forefront. Yet most credit is undoubtedly due to Heathers' unlikely heroine: Winona Ryder. With a natural leading woman presence with appropriate dramatic weight for a teen comedy, as well as interjecting narration through diary entries, she easily inhabits the protagonist slot. But she is not your innocent little lamb who gets seduced by the popular crowd, but a dark heroine who resorts to increasingly dark ways to deal with the injustices of a modern high school.It is nearly impossible to deduce how many teen comedies and dramas that have been influenced by 'Heathers' over the years (Jawbreakers and Mean Girls are two that immediately spring to mind). As a 1989 entry to the scene, in many ways it marked the end of the cutesy brat pack 1980's era with Molly Ringwald films. This is much darker, has more things to say and attempts a different level of humour. As a result, sure, you could perhaps find more to pick apart and analyze  but 'Heathers' sadly does not hold up against the crème de la crème of its genre  such as Clueless, Porky's, The Breakfast Club and Ten Things I Hate About You. 7 out of 10",Heathers

Screenwriter Daniel Waters and writer-director Michael Lehmann took audiences by surprise with smart, telling dialogue and a diabolical plot. Playing the only member of an Ohio high school's ruling clique not named Heather, Winona Ryder did much to launch herself into stardom.

93,avik-basu1889,Much more complex than the average 80s High School film !!!,8,4 March 2016,"I generally am not a big fan of the Hollywood movies from the 1980s which explored the life of teenagers in high school. This is because on most occasions with these films I have encountered over- glamorisation and cheesiness in the style of storytelling barring a few exceptions. 'Heathers' is one film that I will categorise in those exceptions. It is about teenagers in high school in the 1980s, but the content is very complex, sophisticated and layered.The direction and the screenplay of 'Heathers' is absolutely meticulous. The best way to describe this film I think will be to call this the lovechild of 'The Breakfast Club' and Alexander Payne's 'Election'. It has the concept of exploring the class distinctions in an high school environment like Breakfast Club but it does so in the most sarcastic and darkly comic fashion like 'Election'. The screenplay written by Daniel Waters is very artful in its way it portrays the different class distinctions in high school, how each group treats the other, how every individual does his/her level best to maintain his/her image. There is even a brilliant shot of the character Heather Chandler who is supposed to be this unlikable snobbish person looking at herself in the mirror after doing something she didn't want to do just for maintaining her popularity and the self hate that comes out in that scene is a shot of precious humanity. The character of Veronica who is our protagonist is a very relateable one. She finds herself in a similar position like the others where she has to do all she can to be with the popular group in school. She does everything that she is asked to until she gets fed up and develops a rebellious spirit. This is where a 'Fight Club' connection can come into the equation. Just like the 'Narrator' in 'Fight Club', Veronica spends her time in high school kissing asses of the Heathers clique to maintain her position and image. Christian Slater as Jason Dean as the archetypal James Dean rebel-esque character can be seen to be similar to the character of Tyler Durden in 'Fight Club'. Like Durden, Dean brings out the disturbing and dark inner rebel inside Veronica and both the story lines also end in a similar way with the protagonist finding out about the dangers of extremism. The theme of teenage suicide is also beautifully explored. Another very important aspect is the ambivalence of the elders and the teachers in the film to the problems of the youth and the 'suicides'. The director and the writer certainly take a dig at the elder generation for not trying to understand the younger generation and their mechanical behaviour.Michael Lehmann very efficiently conveys the dark comedy in the script on screen. The characters are a bit over-the-top at times, but as this is a bit of a satire it is understandable. Winona Ryder as Veronica is great. She perfectly conveys the inner struggles and distress that her character goes through. Christian Slater at times is a bit theatrical, but he still does well overall and depicts the craziness that his character is prone to very well.",Heathers

If you every felt annoyed by any person, or part of school, I urge you to watch Heathers. In the words of Homer- it's funny because it's true!

98,jayjaycee,Dark yet effective high school comedy,8,18 January 2021,"""Heathers"" is a 1989 crime comedy directed by Michael Lehmann starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater.
⚪
All in all, this late eighties flick bizarrely swings a croquet mallet to radically smash high school movie stereotypes with extreme destructive energy and very dark humour, satirizing school popularity and teenage suicide in an equally tasteless and ingenious way, and thanks to charismatic performances by Ryder and Slater, an unusual yet chaotically insightful writing and an unpredictably drastic plot, it becomes a weirdly fascinating and unconventionally surreal teenage flick that's as poisonous as a cup of drain cleaner.
⚪
I went into this film with a completely open mind, without expectations at all, except for one - that it is going to be yet another of those stereotypical high school flicks, and oh my god, how wrong I was. In the beginning, I had the strange feeling that it turns out to be a spiritual predecessor of ""Mean Girls"" that I famously disliked, and honestly, there were many hints that it might go into the same direction. Like, you have got a famous clique of toxic, spoiled girls (three girls called Heather, hence the title), an outsider girl given the opportunity to join them, lots of high school clichés and a subsequent act of betrayal. Sounds familiar? Well, to this point, it surely does, but when protagonist Veronica plans to kill her former friend/enemy, and accidentally goes through with it with the help of her mysterious boyfriend J.D., I knew that it was going to be nothing like Tina Fey's attempt to making a satirical high school comedy. After an admittedly sudden and confusing beginning, it becomes increasingly clearer to me what the film tries to tell, and the way it does this is both weird and brilliant. The two main aspects the film focusses on are the popularity issues in school and, well, teenage suicide. Wait, what? Exactly, this comedy deals with this undeniably delicate topic, because after the accidental murder, the two protagonists decide to use their special skills (forging handwritings and plans) to make it look like that their first victim, Heather Chandler, has killed herself, and after that, they both try to do this to other popular students as well, until Veronica becomes gradually disgusted by the actions of her partner. Let me say beforehand: suicide is absolutely no laughing matter, and it is still a serious issue affecting many people's lives, and I think everyone comes in contact with this topic at least once in their lifetimes (me included), but as inappropriate as it might sound, the film uses this delicate issue to drastically prove its point. Popularity, bullying, cliques and mental health issues are relevant problems affecting the high school experience of many students, and this film depicts the severity of it in an exaggerated yet effective way. All adults, parents and teachers alike, are depicted in a caricatural manner, because all of them seemingly deliberately misunderstand what the teenaged characters in this film are going through. After the first apparent suicide, the teachers are seen discussing the incident, and they all visibly couldn't care less and rather discuss how amazed they are that the dead girl used a word in her not she previously failed to use correctly in a vocab test. Later on, when it became more prominent, they then decide to make some happiness dance instead of enlightening the students about the severity of this issue. You know what I mean? Furthermore, Veronica's parents are also an overstatement for parents in general, as they, like the teachers, are so preoccupied with their own lives that they don't take their kids' issues seriously. Like, in one scene a rumour states that their daughter might be suicidal, and all they do is put on a solemn face and half-heartedly ask superficial questions, not really making the effort of looking actually concerned. The entire side-swiping continues when an unpopular, bullied student, Martha, tries to kill herself after being humiliated in many scenes before. Like, when the admired Heather Chandler died, her death was glorified and everyone pretended to have liked her, but when Martha decides to do the same thing and fortunately survives the attempt, one might think that they care about her more. No way! Instead, she is even more teased by her schoolmates, saying she only tried it too because it was a trendy thing to do. I admit, the film performs a tightrope walk between being ingenious and just distasteful, but as horrible as it sounds, if the film were too tame, the social criticism it expresses wouldn't have the same vehemence it does now. It is utterly dark humour I didn't expect in the slightest to see in a film from that era. Many other things happen in the background or indirectly, like the fact that J.D. is a total psychopath and a toxic boyfriend, but since he is handsome, those obvious facts are shrouded, and in another scene one of the Heathers is simply raped by a jock in the background, and only those who see it will see it - and that is the quintessence of the entire film. This film does everything the works of John Hughes never could have done, simply because it isn't appropriate for children. But is it appropriate for children that suffer from such issues? Mental health problems know no age, and this flick managed to hit the bullseye in that matter. At times it will make you laugh for how ridiculous some things are. Like J.D. perfectly points out, the extreme always seems to make an impression. It is villainous, toxic, vicious, drastic, and (especially in the end), extremely dark - but so are the high school experiences of some. Despite having something surreal to it and feeling silly, it depicts a part of reality many other films never would have dared to show, and this bold move deserves my respect. In the end, this movie is everything ""Mean Girls"" desperately tried to be. Oh, and before I forget: If you are struggling with the issues mentioned above, just know one thing: You are loved and never alone. Even if it at times feels like you are alone and hopeless, you are not. Life is worth living, trust me. I love you, and so do many others. If you are struggling and want to get help, swipe to see where you can get help. Don't give up, it will be better someday.",Heathers

This leads to bizarre and darkly funny situation for Veronica and Jason Dean.Released in 1989,Heathers was an hilarious Black Teen Comedy and one of the last great Teen films of the 1980s before teen films were few and far between in the late 80s to the mid 1990s because Teen Movie master John Hughes had stopped making Teen Films,the Brat Pack had gotten older and Teen films were failing at the Box Office. But then Heathers came along and gave audiences a new and different kind of Teen flick that was more dark and cynical than the teenage films that came before it and became a Cult Classic that paved the way for films such as Mean Girls and Jawbreaker. Heathers is an excellent film and the Dr. Strangelove and Network of Teen films because with Heathers we as the viewers are given the dark flip side of the John Hughes films because where as in Hughes' film High School was more optimistic and light,High School in Heathers is pessimistic and dark but in a hilarious and surreal way. If Hell looked like High School than the High School in Heathers would be a frightening representation. The Comedy and Humor in the film is funny and dark with a weird and surrealistic sarcastic oddball delivery because in the world of Heathers none of the main characters have their head on straight and their minds and thought process is on backwards and the characters act is downright funny and absurd. Some of the best Dark or Black Comedies tackle tough taboo subjects and Heathers is no different taking on the dangerous subject like suicide. The way Heathers talks about suicide is disturbing but at the same time weird and funny because in reality it not about the suicides themselves but the way the characters act when a suicide happens the teachers are thinking about when school should be let out or have half days,students are confused about how to feel some are sadden while other students are apathetic in a nihilistic way. Heathers was a bold and gusty movie to make and there probably never be anything like it and while the film did spawn many imitators and copycats but Heathers still holds up because thanks to it's originality and creative wit. The characters Veronica and J.D are really wonderful and memorable characters because with Veronica you see that she is smart and intelligent and hates being with the Heathers voicing her thoughts in her diary wanting to do things her way and no one else's. But with J.D it's a different story where as Veronica can voice and think her thoughts J.D acts on them in a dark and psychotic way that is wild and dangerous. Veronica and J.D are classic and memorable Teen film characters and are a couple made in Heaven(or Hell). The screenplay by Daniel Waters is amazing and stylish,with Waters giving the film's main characters surreal and darkly funny dialog that is memorable and quotable as well as profane and sarcastic on a twisted level. The ending of the film is great and truly unforgettable because it mixes suspense,tension laughs and optimism making you feel like that everything will be alright but at the same time the ending adds to the surreal tone of the film and is one of the things that makes Heathers a classic.The whole cast is excellent. Winona Ryder is excellent,beautiful and at her best as Veronica,with Ryder bringing humor,sarcasm,smarts and depth to the role. Christian Slater is brilliant and funny as J.D,with Slater going over the top with his hilarious Jack Nicholson impression and having great chemistry with Ryder. Shannen Doherty is amazing in her role as Heather Duke,the second evil Heather. Lisanne Falk is wonderful as Heather McNamara,a cheerleader who's not as bad as the other two Heathers. Kim Walker is fantastic as Heather Chandler the leader of the Heathers,with Walker just being dark and pure evil. Lance Fenton(Kurt Kelly)and Patrick Labyorteaux(Ram)are funny and over the top as bullying Football jocks. Penelope Milford(Pauline Fleming),Carrie Lynn(Martha Dunnstock aka Dumptruck),Renee Estevez(Betty Finn),John Ingle(Principal Gowan),Jennifer Rhodes(Veronica's Mom),Bill Cort(Veronica's Dad)and Glenn Shadix(Father Ripper)give good performances as well.The direction by Michael Lehmann is brilliant and stylish,with Lehmann always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a surrealistic style and dark atmosphere. Wonderful direction,Lehmann.The score by David Newman is fantastic,dark,haunting and eerie and definitely fit in with the style and dark tone of the film. A great score by Newman. There are also songs from Syd Straw(Que Sera Sera),Sly And The Family Stone(also singing Que Sera Sera),Big Fun(Teenage Suicide Don't Do It)and Stewart Levin(You're The Only One For Me). Great songs on the soundtrack.In final word,if you love Teen Films,Comedies,Dark and Black Comedies,Cult films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Heathers,an hilarious and unforgettable classic that you'll never forget when you watch it and will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Heathers
100,annevejb,"Ritual suicide: Christian slater, but win on a ryder, version 1.15",10,13 October 2008,"Trampling the heather of the mores. When I first purchased this, as a follow on to liking Girls Just Want To Have Fun, I found some aspects to be way too scary but others to be in the forefront of entertainment. Now I understand that split to be due to Heathers being rooted in art ways, for me a downer, but I get to like it despite that. In 2006 I interpreted it as talking about how situational ethics could backfire in a Catholic secondary school. But that said in too problematic a way. The DVD versions are a bit low on definition and interlaced. The full version, with commentary is a bit better on definition, but still interlaced. The Cinema Club version I have is like the full 2005 version for quality but without the extras. I do not know the region 1 version from 2008. I have not seen any reviews that mention image quality so the fuzziness has maybe not as much fuzz as seems to me. My disk of American Pie 2 is starting to look a bit fuzzy too, if less so. Heathers Blu-ray is nice. A modern software player with an equivalent to Yadif type de-interlace should improve the DVD quality a lot. * The commentary and behind the scenes video, which I only saw the once as I was trying to get a 2006 full version, made me re-evaluate my views. They are also on the blu-ray, in HD quality. I now understand the writer to be an ex Catholic who wanted to blow off steam. Not an uncommon thing in any religion, particularly one that has been around for more than a thousand years. I have several disks of features that feel to be by ex Catholics, I assume some also by practicing Catholics. The more recent Donnie Darko is a whole lot less scary and Lindsay's Confessions a bit less. I do not know how real the Catholic angle is with these, for me it is there. Heathers has bits of detail that I noticed in 1960's school reality, occasionally and in the background, before situational ethics became well known. This being made a playful feature in comedies, yes. That happens. The writer goes a lot further than that, though. It is as if some devil is deliberately bringing things out of a low key personal funeral context in the most offensive way? That is far from normal among ex Catholics unless they consider that they are facing real evil? Murder understood as suicide or other inversions of the deeper realities, it is not just Catholics that dive into that sort of thing were Big Babies are concerned. In the name of big good, in the name of big fun. But more likely by the way of putting to the test and icebergs and misdirection and frame and smear than by the way of the gun. Tipping cows. There is some stuff that feels to be symbolic, not intended to be interpreted as literal. Apparent unreality abounds. Spiritual overtones? * I get the impression that the writer and the production house were actually performing a form of ritual suicide by how they approached the script. It certainly looks like it. I would not know how others were drawn into this. Or the extent that serendipity acted in drawing the cast and crew together? Some appeared to survive? I assume that most involved in the making of this feature will not have been church going Christians of any flavour that could be offended by this. That they will likely have thought it an okay Boo genre story and not felt it in the way that the writer did? They could go into the production without qualms from this aspect, qualms coming from other aspects instead. The background notes showed that to me by the mention of Winona having qualms, her someone who faced that well. Just them not being the same qualms as a churchgoer. * Buffy solved one early problem by burning down a school gym. She later solved a problem that a visitor posed by blowing up a school, with the school library as the centre of the bang. Veronica starts by giving up, throwing in the towel. The story ends with what background notes talk of as a sugar coated ending. Situational ethics, how does one grow a healthy approach that heads towards sugar? This is so unlike stuff I know by other ex or active Catholics. Secret Of The Andes has my ideal, it gently shows all to be victims. For me, this feature poses questions about just how come it got made in this way. * Veronica as a Dotty in her Oz. I am from a different Oz. Writing this helped me to move closer to being comfortable with the fullness of Heathers. Move away from a puritan rulebook in iffy ways or in healthy ways then what will be will be. Modern world feels to get a similar thing via a different route, the revolutions from the 80's and later, Tit For Tat. If situational ethics has these as a heart then there is obvious trouble. Heathers subtly hints at belief system variations that rip out the heart in the name of good. Proverb: Until I have sense I have no free will, what I have is pressure towards being further and further from sense. A fool does not benefit from heart attacks, but what will be will be. No prophesy needed. This is not a nice world for those who grew up in a way that makes it difficult to stand up properly on one's own feet.",Heathers
101,aramis-112-804880,Top 3 1980s High School Movie,8,14 August 2015,"The 1980s high school movie craze, with actors about my age (I'm a few months older than Matthew Broderick) produced three comedy classics. In order of appearance they are ""Better off Dead"" with John Cusack; feel good ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" with Matthew Broderick; and feel bad ""Heathers."" ""Bueller"" is too famous to discuss. Whereas ""Better off Dead"" is about an unstable youth (Cusack) who wants to off himself over woman troubles, it is really a light and frothy movie about teen suicide; dark-toned ""Heathers,"" on the other hand, satirizes the ""teen suicide"" movement of the late 1980s by showing a school that thinks it has an epidemic of ""teen suicide"" when in fact it has an epidemic of teen murder caused by weirdo J. D. (Christian Slater--like me and Broaderick and Cusack another 1960s baby) and his erstwhile girlfriend Veronica (Winona Ryder).Veronica, you see, finally broke into the school's most exclusive clique, consisting of three girls named Heather (a popular name at the time). But now she thinks they're all superficial and catty and she craves something new. J.D. is new, all right. In fact, he's off his rocker.The body count starts accidentally, when J. D. gives one of the Heathers a hangover cure containing drain cleaner (producing a blue muck no one in their right mind would ever really drink; the color running out of Heather's mouth is gorgeous). It cures her hangover right to the cemetery. But thanks to quick thinking on J. D.'s part everyone accepts the idea that this beautiful, rich girl with everything to live for killed herself. Go figure.J.D. and Veronica take their ""suicide"" epidemic further afield, to two jocks whose idea of a good time is cow-tipping(the urban legend--truly urban,only city people would think it was possible--of pushing a cow over so it can't get up; this is based on a number of fallacies, including the weight of cattle and the rather idiotic notion to anyone brought up outside an urban area that cattle, once down, can't get up). Though Veronica expresses qualms, deep down she seems to enjoy murdering her schoolmates and getting away with it.The whole idea was subversive in 1989, and even more so today when kids get expelled from school for carrying Tweety Bird keychains or biting their pop tarts in the shape of firearms or who draw pictures of gun (talk about censorship!--schools are nuts these days; when I went to high school boys drove in trucks with rifle racks ... but in my cultural milieu, they knew how to use firearms responsibly).So, three hilarious movies (not to be watched back to back, but perhaps on successive nights). My only regret was that I missed them on their release. Though I was almost the same age as Broderick and only slightly younger than Slater and Cusack, I was hardly interested in movies about ""high school"" when I was not ten years out of it myself. I saw them all in a row in 2011, 25 years after ""Bueller"" was made; and as a fully qualified adult I thought they were all wonderfully funny and subversive. Perhaps we need some filmmakers with a pair to make something like this these days, to satirize the ""lockdown"" craze of schools these days, and the ridiculously overprotective mothers. I wonder what studio would ever greenlight a comedy called ""Lockdown!""?And, of course, the students who would rather text than live. And therein lies the rub with ""Heathers"" these days. Forget the teens murdering each other, that's just fine. But I suppose it does make all these movies look like dinosaurs, since none of the students have cell phones or ipads. Veronica Sawyer of ""Heathers"" writes in a diary--rather than a web blog! Today, instead of meeting J. D. in the lunchroom, she would meet him in a chatroom. This is real dark ages stuff.But ""Heathers"" (like the other two movies mentioned above) still holds up, if you can stomach a movie that has high school students who don't have phones or web devices. Watch ""Heathers"" for a dark comedy laugh of kids killing each other. If you dare!Hey, Veronica! Love the monocle!",Heathers
102,D_Burke,Good Film If Not Taken For Face Value,7,1 January 2008,"This film was definitely original, and cleverly avoided clichés that bogged down a lot of teen movies (not just in the 80's, but even teen movies made this decade so far). It also ended unexpectedly, and it had a killer climax that really kept you glued to the screen to find out what happens next. Aside from it being a dark teen comedy, it's good because it really makes you think.That being said, I'm pretty amazed that the cult followers of this movie have successfully seen this movie as a farce and not one to be taken literally. I'm glad, too, because the climactic events in this movie, particularly the killings, are highly unrealistic. Every mature viewer can tell that if these events happen in real life, police would not just walk into the room, look around, and jump to conclusions and assume the killings were suicides. That's just not the way law enforcement works, especially in the suburbs. A CSI unit could easily take some fingerprints (particularly on the botched suicide notes written by the Veronica character) and have a list of suspects ready by the end of the day.I'm particularly surprised at how well this movie has stood the test of time, particularly after the Columbine shootings when the killing of high school classmates went from a fantasy (like in this movie) to a grim and harsh reality. After Columbine, the media went after violent video games, flexible gun laws, and Marilyn Manson as motives for the shootings. They could have easily gone after this movie as well given the subject matter, but it's surprising they didn't.The reason they didn't was probably because this movie is not only a farce, but also a cautionary tale. One lesson to extract from this movie would be that violence and homicide, even in the rare instances when it is well covered up, only worsens the usual high school problems. An even deeper moral would be that if we wiped out one particularly annoying high school classmate, someone else would take their place.I'm happy that people young and old who see this movie actually understand these messages, and that no reports have come out about some kid shooting up their school because they saw this movie. Potential violence in high schools, as this movie shows, is rooted a lot deeper than violence in the media. People get that, and that's why this movie has successfully stood the test of time so far.",Heathers
103,Darkest_Rose,A Great Dark Teen Comedy,9,11 January 2003,"Heathers is the most popular group in highschool. The group consists of Heather Chandler(Kim Walker), who is like a leader and the most popular one, Heather Duke(Shannen Doherty) and Heather McNamara(Lisanne Falk). There is also Veronica Sawyer(Winona Ryder) who isn't really a heather but still hangs out with them. Suddenly there is this new guy in school named Jason Dean(Christian Slater) and he and Veronica become a couple. Veronica slowly starts hating her friends and becomes annoyed with them more and more. Jason has this idea that they should kill all the heathers and make it look like suicide. Veronica first doesn't agree with him but then by accident she kills Heather Chandler and makes it look like suicide. Now Veronica and Jason are about to kill anyone that annoys them and gets in their way. This was a very great dark comedy. Winona Ryder was great. I would give Heathers 9/10",Heathers
104,Aly200,One of the Greatest Teen Movies Ever,10,26 August 2016,"High school can be hell and for Veronica Sawyer, being a member of her school's most popular clique is like the ninth circle of hell. She is desperate to escape and will do anything to do so...including murder.In this dark comedy, Winona Ryder shines as Veronica, playing her as a misunderstood teenager who seems to have it all; upper class family, a member of the title clique and the possibility of attending the best colleges due to her pedigree. However she tells the viewer right away that her seemingly perfect exterior is only a front for a girl feeling the pressures of teen angst. When she meets Christian Slater's J.D., their union is destined to induce chaos and once the first Heather is bumped off, Veronica's world is tossed upside-down. At first she is willing to go along with her crimes, but when her conscious starts to catch up with her, Ryder brilliantly amps up her intensity level to strengthen her character's reserve against further debauchery. However Ryder's Veronica knows it's up to her to end the madness for good by the end of the film when J.D.'s plans descend into suicidal lunacy, but it takes extra talent (that Ryder possesses perfectly throughout) to keep Veronica from being a true villain.As Winona Ryder's more insane yang is a brilliantly cast Christian Slater as the charming, but dangerous J.D. Slater immediately pours on the charm the minute he opens his mouth and pulls us in innocently enough. However our comfort level with J.D. drastically changes when he causes Heather Chandler's (Lisa Falk) demise early on in the film. Slater manages to keep a hold on the viewer as his schemes become even more horrifying, refusing to let us go. His charm permeates even as the character descends further into a rabbit hole of danger and death; a testament to the depth of Christian Slater's talent during the peak of his career. Even the character's inevitable demise is thrilling to watch, but is sad in its own fashion. The film's script is so crisp with its wit and dark elements blending seamlessly together. All sorts of pop culture references are strewn into the script from the time period. The film's darker moments are split at times with an edge of humor to ease the tension. Give this movie a view if you want the opposite of a traditional teen movie.",Heathers
105,happyendingrocks,"You're probably not supposed to laugh at mass murder, but it's hard not to when it's this much fun",8,29 June 2009,"This deserving cult classic is still as crisp and contemporary 20 years later as it was when it came out (actually, I can only guess how much impact it had upon its release; I was only 10 at the time and probably wouldn't have understood the high school dichotomy even if I had seen the film then). The blood-black humor is still as biting and sharp as ever, and the best lines still induce morbid laughter (""I love my dead gay son"" is a personal favorite). And a top-notch cast of 80's actors who really deserved to end up doing more with their careers (except the ones who actually DID do more, most of whom should have stopped right here) carried this material with such grace, the film really hasn't aged at all.There is a timeless feel to Heathers, and it's something that definitely struck me watching this film today. Here's the confession: I am writing this review after watching Heathers for the first time. Of course, I had heard about this film for years, but somehow it stayed out of my DVD library until just recently. After finally taking in this much lauded classic, I'm sorry I waited so long.But, perhaps approaching this film with today's eyes lends a useful gauge of its true effectiveness. After all, I watched the film simply to watch it, and I had no historical or sentimental ties to it to cloud my judgment of exactly how much I enjoyed it. The fact that Heathers is so great, despite the fact that it came out of an era during which high school films were made in a very specific mode, thus have mostly aged very poorly, speaks volumes about its quality.Let me explain... Picture teen films made in the 90's during that dark period where pagers, not cell phones, were the apex of communications. Of course, all the hip kids at the time would have a pager, so naturally, references to this ultra-modern form of technology would enter into the plot, or at least the peripheral. Someone watching a film from this period today would immediately notice this antiquated device, and the film would then date itself. Heathers has no such attachments to its era, and in fact, it looks very little like any high school film made in the 80's (or ever, actually). The use of almost no music in the film adds to this mystique, and since there's no Simple Minds song guiding the action, we can't quite place the Heathers' link to popular culture there. Ditto with the fashion, which, aside from some pretty intense hair-dos, doesn't place our characters into any historical context. The teens in this film don't strut around in legwarmers or Member's Only jackets, and even if they did, this would have an ironic coolness about it in today's retro culture.I only point this out to demonstrate that Heathers seemed to have much more on its mind than entertaining teens for a couple of hours. It takes significant forethought to omit anything that places significance on the time and place the story unfolds and focus all of the elements on the darkly delightful story instead. Heathers wouldn't work nearly as well, or apply so encompassingly, if it tied itself to a singular post of time. One of the reasons the film holds up so well today is that it looks like it could have very well been made today. This fact makes the rumors I've heard of a remake in the works one of the worst ideas of all time... and that's really saying a lot considering how many classic films have been tainted by a wretched modern make-over/cash-in (oh, that's right... we're supposed to call them ""re-imaginings"").You can easily find the plot and any other pertinent information on the very listing you browsed to come to this review, and certainly Heathers is a film that has been discussed so much that I won't be able to add any significant perspective to it. Rest assured, I won't try.I'm only here to say that I finally watched Heathers, and found it deserving off all the hype that I've encountered in the decades this film has existed. The satire is cutting and brilliant and the themes are universal, and will remain universal as long as there are millions of insecure teenagers on this planet vying for the ever-present enigma of ""acceptance"". Hell, most adults are still searching for that themselves, which would sort of make Heathers a film that grows up with you. That's no simple feat, and the very fact that 20 year-old jokes about mass murder are still funny today says as much about humanity as the film does about the dynamics of popularity.I'll admit I arrived to the party late, but I can assure you this: it won't take another 20 years for me to watch this again.",Heathers

107,Jared_Andrews,A disturbingly dark comedy,8,16 June 2016,"I can recall only a few times that movies have genuinely shocked me, not with a plot twist in a mystery or thriller, but with pure audacious, in-your-face moments. Those moments make an impact. They don't bruise; they scar. They brand an image or a quote into my memory that rests there forever. Heathers delivers a handful of these moments within its first 20 minutes. You can attempt to describe this movie anyway that you like, be it satirical, provocative, hilarious, wild, etc. One thing is certain about Heathers, you will not forget it. Heathers is a disturbingly dark comedy dripping with hyperbolic satire about high school life. Every character is exaggerated. The kids are either sadistic or secretly psychotic or both. All the adults are clueless, so of course they handle each conflict with incompetence. Yet somehow the plot makes the characters appear by comparison, which is say that things get pretty crazy. This drastically sensationalized world of high school (littered with great quotes) makes Heathers a genre-defying classic.Boldly exploring the world of teen social life in a way for more daring and original than ""16 Candles"" or ""The Breakfast Club"" (oh, these kids are more than just their stereotypes? I never knew), Heathers takes us behind the scenes of the most popular clique in school, called the Heathers. The three founding members, all named Heather, insist on referring to each other by first name only which creates some cute confusion in the opening minutes. The film takes an abrupt dark turn shortly afterward. The leader, Heather Chandler, needs only to utter a few sentences to reveal herself as one of the most shockingly cruel and timelessly quotable teen characters in cinema history. So shocking are her lines that they still drop jaws in 2016. I wouldn't dare spoil the great quotes from Heather or the ones from Heather or any quotes for that matter, but suffice it to say that you will never think about mineral water, brain tumors or chainsaws the same way again. As we witness the appalling ways of Heather as she mentally mutilates the less popular, we also observe the apathy with which her actions are met. Only Veronica seems phased by how her best friend (who she hates) treats people. Since she's the only sensible character in the movie, Veronica comes up with the only sensible way to solve the Heather problem: kill her. ""Accidents"" ensue leading to a perceived suicide epidemic throughout the city. In death, the tormentors become martyrs celebrated for the giving lives they did not actually lead. Despite the phony praise passed onto the dead, virtually everyone's reactions to the suicides are laughably deadpan or selfish. Some seek attention by accepting blame. Others worry only about canceling school. The school's lower class students notice the glorification of suicide and view it as their best chance at popularity. The comical take on murder/suicide is dicey. But viewers should understand it as an attempt to mock the allure some bestow on suicide. Even if this bold effort ruffles some feathers, the film presents a moral statement: all people should be treated with decency.",Heathers
108,ThomasColquith,trash,1,23 September 2021,"I just saw ""Heathers"" for the first time as it was available to stream for free, but now I see why I never saw it until now -- It's trash, skip this one. I feel bad wasting my time watching it even though it was free because it is such a dour negative film that it leaves you with a negative vibe. So don't bother, I would not recommend.

At first, I thought that this movie is a lot like mean girls, however, I soon learnt that there was so much more to the film.Seeing as how a guy can just one day be absolutely done with the whole social class systems and be like, screw them, screw life. It really seems to be one of those passing thoughts that one may really have had once in their life when the going gets tough.

114,chucknorrisfacts,Awful!,1,2 December 2011,"I just watched ""Heathers"" for the first time tonight. I've heard people talk about it before in the past and they seemed to like it, so I figured I'd go ahead and give it a shot...Well, now I'm sorry I did. This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I really don't understand how anyone can like this. It's just stupid. I don't know how else to explain it. Personally, I feel that fact should be painfully obvious to anyone who tries watching this piece of crap.Every time I watch a movie, I usually find myself going to the internet to try to learn a little bit more about it. One thing of interest I found was that the screenwriter supposedly tried sending this script to Stanley Kubrick in the hopes he'd be interested in making the film. Seriously?! Give me a friggin' break! Did he honestly believe Kubrick would touch this? If so, he seriously needs to check into a mental health facility.I also learned that apparently Christian Slater sent Jack Nicholson a message asking him to watch the movie and tell him what he thought...Nicholson never responded. Now, I can't say for sure what Nicholson's reasons for not responding were, but I'd assume that he either: A.) Thought the movie looked ridiculously stupid and had the good sense to avoid it.or B.) Saw the movie, but was appalled that Christian Slater would so blatantly attempt to copy him that he didn't want to ""encourage"" any further contact from Slater by even responding to let him know the movie sucked.I seriously doubt Nicholson even saw the movie, but if he did, I think it's fairly safe to say he didn't like it if he wasn't willing to respond to Slater.Maybe I veered off course on my review, but I think the main point I'm trying to make is that this movie blows and everyone who thinks otherwise is obviously a little off their nut. I'm sure some will say ""I missed the point of the movie"" or that ""it's a satire"", but I say it's still garbage.",Heathers

Slater is hot and the plot is great.. im a 70s child so l9ve getting to re watch these classics that nothing in this day in age can compete too.. story, substance, acting or visually wise. I remember about 4 years ago trying to get1 my daughters to watch it but because of its simple title she just plain refused and looked away until all of a sudden ""The 3 heathers"" sample was doing a Tiktok round then it was all young prays self absorbed as though it was the coolest thing without ever seeing it.. I was so annoyed.. this movie is brilliant. And watching winona ryder best Slater in a fight off at the end is epic without being over the top.. the beginning chemistry between them is beautiful also.. Christian Slater was such a mega actor 80s/90s as were a lot this time frame. All came with style substance and artistic value rather than juverderm lips.. .. Slater is brilliant as the psychopathic/bad boy versus the high iq dimwit Veronica

116,pekinman,"Corn nut chaser, anyone?",7,21 September 2009,"Michael Lehmann's film 'Heathers' is a hard one to rate. It is a very dark comedy that wouldn't be funny at all if it weren't for little moments and certain characters. Much of the humor, as seen by the writers, is geared towards older teen-agers but there are moments that are very much for the adults; like the cynical teachers smoking in the meeting room and the sinister minister at the various funerals, Heather No. 3 dabbing her forehead from water at the holy fount in the church, and the quarterback's father who says ""I love my dead gay son."" I remember when this film was released in 1989 and it caused a sensation with the industry cognoscenti in West Hollywood and became an instant cult movie. Whether it is now a classic cult film is questionable. Certainly Winona Ryder and Christian Slater went on to great careers and it's good to see them here so young and fresh and, especially in Slater's case, uninhibited in his acting and very impressive as such.Shannen Doherty, as Heather No. 2, was very new on the scene as well and she is probably the funniest of the leads, coming into her own after Heather No. 1 is murdered and Doherty takes over the mantel of the most popular girl at Westerberg High School.The parents are all portrayed as near idiots which fits the view of most 16 year olds. Every clichéd group of students is on display here. The Heathers and Veronica, the beautiful girls who rule the roost, the nerds (who are very funny), the dumpy and dull girls and the jocks.The film takes aim at all of these entities and sets out to destroy the popular students and the jocks. Christian Slater, the outsider, has come to town and like Jehovah sets off on a killing spree of Biblical proportions, using the disgruntled Veronica (Ryder) to innocently, at first, help him.The movie basically is mocking the over-emotionalism of young people, the phony hypocrisy of the teachers and the comatose indifference of parents. It hits bull's eyes in all three of these intentions. But the whole leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, even with the strangely happy and surreal ending with the change of order coming about as Veronica takes over the mantel of most popular girl and befriends the overweight and friendless Martha, a nice bit of understated comedy played by Carrie Lynn who doesn't speak a single line until the very end, when she gets the last words in the movie.'Heathers' not as clever as it once seemed and I can't rate it all that high as comedy, and as satire it really is too dark and disturbing to be really funny. It has a bitterness and cynicism that was rather a new thing in teen films at the time, and has spawned a number of copycat movies and TV shows.But the movie has a strange impact, like a spiked date-rape drink, followed by a corn nut chaser to blow all the poison out of the system. And it certainly lingers in the memory, especially the opening and closing versions of the song 'Che sera sera'.It's a good solid entertainment for younger adults and older teens but it's not one of the great dark comedies or cult classics that the promoters told us it was when it was released.",Heathers
117,ihrtfilms,Another gem from the 80's,8,13 September 2010,"What ever happened to Winona Ryder and Christian Slater? No, really, what ever happened to them? I know they've done work since this film, but it's hard to remember. Still, maybe that's the way it should be as Heathers is a hugely enjoyable film.Made way back in the 80's, it's been a long time since I watched this but what fun I had revisiting it. The story is brilliant, if not a little stupid, but darkly humorous and full of satire, doped up cops and parents who ask 'How was the first day of school after the suicide?' before offering pate.The film is laced with some superb lines: 'I love my dead gay son' or the use of 'very' as in 'That is so VERY'. It is twisted in it's humour and I can see the influence it potentially has had on twisted TV series Strangers With Candy. The characters are full of wonderful prime stereotypes, but unlike similar modern high school films, they all work brilliantly and are played by an excellent cast.Having said that the one down side to the cast is Slater who seems to think he's Jack Nicholson, which after a few lines became intensely annoying. That aside there is so much to enjoy, the dark humour and satire is there from start to finish and whilst 80's fashions were pretty shocking, Heathers is another wonderful example of the brilliance of film making of that era. It is so VERY.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",Heathers
118,IamROCKAS,A high school satire with a dark twist,9,5 August 2020,"""If you were happy every day of your life you wouldn't be a human being. You'd be a game-show host.""Dear diary...Wow, I didn't expect this level of satire from this movie. The comedy is dark enough for me to enjoy it without being disturbed. Bulimia, suicide and gun violence - at first glance, the movie makes a joke out of these very serious topics but the twisted humor actually pokes fun at the way society reacts to certain situations and has a way of romanticizing suicide. ""Heathers"" makes fun of society every chance it gets.I loved Christian Slater's and Winona Ryder's performance in this movie. Christian Slater's crazy persona with homicidal tendencies is also evident with his performance in Mr. Robot and Winona Ryder's crazy acting powers were put to great use in Stranger things over 20 years later. I love how these actors from two of my favorite shows were working together all this time ago.",Heathers
119,joshuafagan-64214,Black Comedy at Its Finest,10,17 May 2016,"This is the rare movie that both feels modern and like it couldn't be made today.The dark comedy, the wit, the snarl, the creativity, the satire, the twisting of conventional roles, the social commentary; it has all those things that teen movies today try desperately to have. I would even go so far as to call this the first modern teen movie. It may not have been seen a lot when it first came out, but it is one of the most influential movies of the decade.I certainly would have gone to see it back in the 80's. The 80's were a decade of formulaic, soulless, glibness. They steered my country away from the course it was going and ripped its soul out of its body. A movie like this, released in '88, would have made me feel like better times are ahead. It's an antidote to years upon years of biteless teen movies. I think I respect this movie more than I like it, and I like it a lot.As for the whole part about it not being able to be made today: this is a black comedy about high schoolers murdering other high schoolers and almost blowing up their entire school. In a post-Columbine world, something like this could barely be made in America as a drama. It feels like an aberration, like a secret Sonic the Hedgehog game for the SNES. I'm not quite sure how it came to exist, but I'm so glad it does.Starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater, it's about a high school where the popular kids- who run everything, or at least seem to, given how horrifically inept the staff is- are all named Heather. Veronica, played by Ryder in one of her many stellar late 80's performances, tags along with them in an attempt to be popular. None of this is played straight. The first time we see them, they're playing croquet of all things, something this film has a weird but not unwelcome obsession with. I love croquet.The first major sign at what kind of movie this is comes when a couple of jocks go after the 'cool, loner' kid in the corner. They throw a couple of homophobic slurs at him. He zings 'em back. They get angry and get ready to beat him up. He pulls out a gun and fires at them. Now, he was only firing blanks, but the tone of the film was set right there, right then.Veronica gets invited to a party at a college. She does not have a good time. The Heathers basically hold her there captive. She ends up throwing up, and Heather #1 throws her out. She writes in her diary about wanting to kill her. Early the next morning. she and that loner kid, who have gotten together, decide to give her a sort of terrible 'hangover cure'. She decides to go with orange juice and milk. The loner kid, JD, pours some drain cleaner in a cup. He tries to get Veronica to give to Heather, but she refuses. However, she messes up and ends up taking the drain cleaner to Heather #1, who dies shortly after.JD and Vernoica casually chat for a bit about what happened before deciding to frame it as a suicide, and it goes from there.Intelligent, aware, dark movies that revel in breaking convention are my favorite 'genre'. They're the kinds of films that inspire me, the kind I never forget. While this won't top the 'king' of the 'genre', Leon, it's still arguably the best high school movie ever. It's a high school movie for people who don't like high school movies. They play on those high school movie stereotypes, but instead of embracing them, they tear them to shreds. It's hilarious and fantastic.The 80's were great for comedy movies, but this is one of the greatest, though it's more like an 00's comedy than anything else.Though the soulless dreck that came out in the decade may tell you otherwise, the 80's is a great time to set movies. Recent movies and everyone who was my age back then seems to remember the 80's being awesome, but they were not. It was the time of extravagant wealth, yes, but it was also the time of vast inequality and ignorance. The 80's were basically like a room full of rich people in a locked room on a boat as everyone around them gets shot by a serial killer. And unlike the 50's, which also this problem, there was a certain level of 'we're choosing to ignore this' in the 80's. It was the ultimate era of haves and have-nots, and unlike what cheap college movies from that decade may lead you to believe, that is a fascinating topic to discuss, and it's played very well in this movie.Heathers is so many things at once. It's comedic, it's farcical, it's deep, it's beautiful, it's artistic, it's unique, it's cathartic, it's depressing, and it's one of the greatest films of the decade.",Heathers
120,copperncherrio,Dark and Strange,4,13 March 2011,"I'm been on this Wionna Ryder streak, but it was all unintentional. Mermaids, this among various other things. I also happen to like Christian Slater. This movie is a satire where teen suicide is funny, as in they go around killing all the jerk offs of the school. Then it gets super crazy. Hey, I'm all about crazy, unique, and weird but the execution wasn't there. Well, it was there several times, but it just wasn't working for me.The dark just got boring and strange beyond anything else. The first 20 minutes of the movie was wonderful but then it went down the hill of disappointment. And that's the greatest let down of all: high expectation build and then ripped from your hands. Disappointment has no bounds, no limitations on the effects of life.I guess I was just not in the mood for a dark comedy. But I do like that there are Heathers out there.",Heathers
121,nixskits,Teen she devils or misunderstood?,10,4 December 2009,"I watched ""Heathers"" so many times between ages 16 and 19, it's surprising I've only seen it once in the last decade. Now that we have digital discs and the awful spectre of ""rewind or else"" videotape is behind most of us, this film is kind of like an ex-lover you still have feelings for but can't really be intimate with on nearly the same level.I loved Winona Ryder as a younger man (and consequently hated Johnny Depp for a long time, but now that he's a top notch actor, I can forgive him for almost marrying my teen dream queen). She is an actress who plays mean on occasion, even though you know the heart that beats inside is pure gold. Her Veronica Sawyer might have been better off home schooled or come to think of it, enrolled in an alternative school, far away from the title named trio who make almost all their fellow pupils at Westerberg High wish they were someplace less stressful, like the front lines of a battlefield!Looking at it now you can see how prescient all the female energy is, directed at malls and note passing, due to the fact no-bleeping-body had cell phones and the internet in their precious little neck of the woods. ""Heathers"" really laid the track down for virtually everything about young women that came after it (with the kooky exception of that Shannen Doherty lunatic asylum, ""Beverly Hills 90210"". I haven't seen any episodes of the remade version to compare!). Imagine what the Heathers would have done with Andy Warhol's dire prophecy, ""You Tube""? Nothing short of streamed murder probably.The script is one of the gems of the 80's, Christian Slater was so much more than the mini Jack Nicholson he was pegged as and Ryder can still remain in my mind as a salt of the earth goddess in a business full of phonies with nowhere near her talent and spirit.",Heathers
122,Ben-Hibburd,Heathers Review,8,12 July 2017,"Heathers is directed by Michael Lehmann, and stars Winona Ryder as Veronica and Christian Slater as J.D. They're two school pupils that begin dating. Veronica is part of an elitist clique of friends and in order to break free, her and J.D joke about conjuring up the murder of the leader of the group. Only for J.D to go ahead and actually do It. After Veronica's initial shock they decide to make it look like a suicide. Only to go down a slippery slope of bumping more students off, as they try and restore a social equilibrium that goes to the extreme. The best way too describe this film would be, John Hughes with an added flavour of murder.Christian Slater steals the show every time he's in the frame, as the always alluring and unhinged rouge. Winona Ryder plays well of him, and they both great on screen chemistry together. Their relationship feels very real during all phases of the film.Heathers is a sharply written cynical satire on eighties high school sociology. Whilst also being a metaphor about the development from adolescence to adulthood, and that there isn't a whole lot of difference between the two. The films themes are also well thought out, it's a teen comedy that carries Important messages. The only downside I had with the film, was it did feel at times a bit too cynical and heavy handed for it's own good. This approach at times left me feeling cold and uncaring towards certain character resolutions.Overall Heathers is one of the best teen comedies to have come out of the eighties. Despite the craziness and ludicrous plot developments the film takes in the third act. It still remains a fascinating critique of the misanthropic structure of adolescent behaviour and high school sociology.",Heathers
123,stebird,"May I ask, could your name possibly be Heather?",5,22 July 2017,"Controversial and a mixed bag of lunacy, Heathers is a story about Veronica, a somewhat socially awkward ""good-girl"" who desperate for some semblance of affection, teams up with the schools snobby clique headed up by three girls all called Heather.Veronica, fed up of the pressures of teenage life and fitting in being cool at all times, meets a dangerous sociopath named JD, this guy JD has an awesome idea, why not just kill off all the cool kids, including the Heathers.A young Christian Slater portrays JD in one of his earlier roles, immediately through his performance you knew this young lad had some serious talent, personally I could see shades of Jack Nicholson in his acting style, always got to be a winner.Winona Ryder played Veronica, at this point in her fledgling career the actress still carried potential, she could've been one of Hollywood's greats, and this performance in Heathers did her no harm at all in pushing her in that direction.Okay, I don't quite know what to think of Heathers, it contains all the elements needed to be a cult classic, but for me it just wasn't hitting the right notes, I could compare it to a pristine classic car that is so beautiful, but you keep trying and keep trying, but the car just won't start up, and it's not going anywhere.Confusing is another word, and choppy, the editing seemed to be clunky, and the plot was like a spiders web, capable of following as long as you held onto the thin thread, but loose the thread and you lose control of the film and will become somewhat lost. I couldn't understand what croquet had to do with it, the girls were playing croquet in the back garden, is this to demonstrate style and sophistication, it certainly fit well with the girls snobby characters.And one thing that totally bemused me, the opening and end song, Que Sera Sera, made famous by Doris Day..., the usage of this song illustrates how confusing and mashed up Heathers really is, but alas, it worked because it evoked the right emotions, some serene happiness through a calming song to start and end the sheer madness in the middle.Avant-garde anyone? Hmm...? It certainly must be borderline.So I leave Heathers with mixed emotions, the murders hidden under the guise of teenage suicides has left a mark on me, my best advice would be to watch it at least twice, it's absolutely vital you watch it that second time, because it will answer the questions the first viewing asked you.",Heathers

126,cadfile,The definition of satire on film,10,15 April 2004,"I first saw ""Heathers"" when it was first released in 1989 and to this day I remember most of the lines and scenes which cause me to laugh at all the wrong times.I went to see the film because the hot actor of the time was Winona Ryder and I was in love with her after seeing her in ""Lucas"" and ""Beetlejuice"" and ""1969"". In each movie she played a version of a Goth chick - very smart, very pretty, but with a monotone delivery and moody attitude.I also wanted to catch Christian Slater. I remembered him from his role as Binx in ""The Legend of Billie Jean"" and in the film ""Tucker: The Man and His Dream""""Heathers"" is great satire of teen life back in the 1980's. It picks apart every teen angst and cliche and spins it in a goofy plot of rebellion and revenge gone amuck.Ryder, playing Veronica, is on the fringe of the popular clic run by 3 girls names Heather. Each Heather is abusive, dumb, and pretty. For any teen who wanted to fit in the popular crowd but couldn't make it completely will identify with Veronica.She meets a new student, J.D., played by Slater who is the complete opposite of the popular crowd. He wants nothing to do with them or the school. Veronica finds this interesting and soon she falls under the expert manipulation of J.D. Due to what starts as an accidental death, the two start a chain of events that looks like a teen suicide epidemic that was the common fear of adults back then.Slater steals the movie from Ryder with his sly Jack Nicholson line delivery and James Dean attitude. Ryder is good but she can't stop Slater from chewing up the scenes.The adults in the movie are classic clueless parental units that teen movies seem to always need. The best one is the guidance counselor that says ""Whether or not a teenager decides to kill themselves is the biggest decision of their life. ""Watching this movie I kept saying to myself ""They just did not do that?"" or ""They just did not say that?"" I never laughed so hard in my life at that time.A special treat was the Heather played by Shannen Doherty. Besides Ryder and Slater, she was the only other actor that I knew (except for Patrick Labyorteaux, who played the jock ""Ram"" who can now be seen on JAG as Ens. Roberts). Before Heathers, Shannen had played good girl roles and had just ended a series called ""Our House"" where she wanted to become a pilot. Her role became more interesting after finding out she turned out like her ""Heather"" character in real life.The only thing that bothers me about this film today is that it could never be made today. The suicide epidemics (that still happen from time to time) has been replaced by killing one's classmates at school. I just don't think the studios would have the guts to film a satire like ""Heathers"" today.As a side note: I read some of the previous comments from users who have only seen this movie on TV. All I can say is see the uncut version either on a movie channel or rent the DVD. The language and satire will only work in its uncensored format.",Heathers
127,marimbadaddy,An acrid teen comedy,9,7 August 2006,"This is one of my favorite films. Featuring Wynnona Rider (mega babe) and Christian Slayter, the film is irreverent, sarcastic, and thought provoking. It does some of the things we always wanted to do to all of the 'popular' kids in school like humiliate and eliminate. The film is blatantly sarcastic, and just viciously pokes fun around the subject of teenage suicide. Slayter's portrayal of his character is almost as cool as Travolta can be, but with the instability that Nicholson often shows.This is a very anti-politically correct film so if you are easily offended, you probably want to avoid it. If you're sense of humor is slightly twisted and in somewhat bad taste, you'll really enjoy this piece.",Heathers

Heathers had a mix of humor and drama. Martha Dumptruck - now that's a real name! Pretty clean for a rated R movie. No real sex scenes and little violence. Some swearing on occasion though. Slater and Rider played their parts well. I liked the part when Jason and Veronica simply start mixing up some poisonous stuff at Heather's home. Was the door unlocked and they just slip in? Heather wakes up, goes to the kitchen and see those two in there like business as usual!My only other question about the movie is if Jason hated the world so much, why didn't he blow himself up inside the gym instead?

129,bhicks56,QUEEN OF HIGH SCHOOL BLACK COMEDIES,10,29 November 1999,"It's funny how this movie can be so over-the-top, yet hit right marks of high school portrayal so precisely.Dan Waters's dialogue is priceless. ""What's your damage, Heather?""  ""Corn Nuts!""  ""I'm worshipped here and I'm only a junior.""  ""You're beautiful."" ""Grow up, Heather. Bulimia is so '87!""  These are just a few. The movie is almost like an encyclopedia of catch phrases, and so much more.It's the little things that make this comedy lethal. Like the oblivious parents who love pate (played outstandingly by Jennifer Rhodes and Bill Cort) and the tennybopper band Big Fun with its one-hit wonder ""Teen Suicide (Don't Do It)"" as the movie's theme song.The casting is ingenious. Christian Slater has never been better than his role as JD, the charismatic sociopath rebel who steals the heart of Veronica (Winona Ryder, don't miss Slater light his cigarette from her freshly burned palm!!) who hates being in the ""Heathers"" clique. Once murder of the leading Heather in red occurs, the school takes it as some sort of fad.Though the movie uses the serious issue of suicide as a joke, the themes that are very understated makes the movie work. Popularity, authority, the disillusionment the media has on real life, the masks we wear in high school, the strains we go through to fit in. Drama, comedy and violence is all beautifully photographed and staged by director Michael Lehman, who also made, strangely enough, HUDSON HAWK and THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS!!!All hail the Queen.",Heathers

131,TYLERdurden74,Cult Movies 50,10,4 January 1999,"50. HEATHERS (comedy, 1989) High school wannabe-Veronica (Winona Ryder) just wants to be accepted. That's why she hangs out with Westerburg High's glamorously elite 'Heathers', a group of 3 prepped-up fashion minded teens. The sort of gals every school has but everybody hates. Sick of always following their lead she desperately seeks her own individuality. She meets the not-so-normal J.D.(Christian Slater) the kind of kid who spends most of his days in the principal's office. His ideas on getting rid of the 'Heathers' problem, while effective, turn out to be a little bit deadly.Critique: The tag line for this film is: 'a killer comedy'. A better one would've been: 'don't try this at school kids!'. Black (bordering on the insane) comedy was supposed to be a serious statement against youth suicide. It's anybody's guess how it turned out the way it did. A sort of 'slapstick-death comedy' similar in tune to the 'horror/comedies'. It shares the same wickedly absurd touches of the surreal, funny and weird. Critics responded positively to this one, admiring its many one-liners and sharp social commentary. I like it most for Christian Slater's star-making role as J.D. A Jack Nicholson/Bruce Dern/Dennis Hopper inspired crossbreed of characters that instantly made him into a bona fide presence. He would follow this with the equally enjoyable (Generation X) cult ""Pump Up the Volume"" (1990). 'Heathers' is the true sleeper film, creating its own unique style that will remain through celluloid ages.QUOTES: Veronica: ""Dear Diary, my teen angst bulls#!t has a body count.""",Heathers
132,mrtimlarabee,Grows more relevant with age..and all by accident,9,31 October 2010,"I don't think Heathers ever intended to be an important movie. It's a dark comedy probably meant to take a stab at high school rom coms of the 1980s more than anything else, with a hint of social satire for good measure. Yet it's one of those films that repeat viewings scream irony after watching the news.For the uninitiated, Heathers is a subversive black comedy that pokes fun at high school cliques and the faux ""coming together"" that sometimes results from a tragedy at a school, particularly in regards to teenage suicide. It was a career starter for Christian Slater and Wynona Ryder, while being laced with enough great dialogue to influence an array of writers - well, if not, at least Diablo Cody.The film takes particularly aim at the elitist clique of girls, while taking a brief jab at jocks. JD and Veronica are that voice in the heads of so many, doing to these groups what many only imagine. JD creepily wears black clothing and at one point in the film, is carrying a bag full of something we only dread hearing about on the news.Heathers was funny initially. Over time, it's become a cautionary tale, yet never rising to the level of significance that it should. Heathers successfully gets into the head of would be school bombers and the danger of cliques and exclusive groups. In a time where teen suicides are making news again due to these exclusive groups' persecution of others, the film takes on a whole new relevance.The writing is sharp and dares to speak uncomfortable truths that resonate with the youth not only of the 80s, but also of today. Whether accidental or on purpose, the film is still important. It doesn't really offer a hero or even hope at the end. While the ending seems a little uncertain about how to handle any of our problems, the mere airing of our own dirty laundry provides topic for discussion. Despite the dated music and fashion, this film deserves a repeated viewing or two in this day and age.",Heathers

She has traces of guilt for abandoning her old best friend Betty Finn (Renee Estevez), a nerdy , geeky, sweet girl with glasses who (surprise!!) is still a virgin! Meanwhile a new student called Jason Dean (Christian Slater) comes to town. J.D. has changed about 5 schools in 3 different states because he can't fit in anywhere and as he says...""the only difference in these schools was the combination in my locker"". J.D. and Veronica soon hit the sheets. J.D. is a rebel and convinces Veronica to acknowledge her hate for her ""friends."" After a fight with Heather Chandler, Veronica and J.D. set a prank for her but Heather accidentally ends up dead. The couple manages to cover it up as a suicide and gets away. But this is only the beginning for a chain of unusual and surrealistic events which lead to an explosive finale!! Slater and Ryder give arguably the best performances of their careers and this helps. Ryder has a sweet face which is perfect. She is convincing as the disorientated teenager who is searching for her identity and although she has aristocratic looks she finds it hard to fit in with the snobbish manners her friends impose. Slater was also perfect playing his psychotic character with the proper innocence to make him look normal enough. The social subjects the film deals with are tremendous. First of all everyone of us has faced cliques in our schools and not necessarily snobbish rich girls. There are always teams of people who form a mafia-like group, are annoying to the bone, do nothing more than serve and protect their own interests and are on a constant conflict to pull the others down. They are so irritating and antipathetic that all of us have fantasies and dreams of them dying (sometimes preferably by our very own bare hands, namely STRANGLING them). Of course these people don't even remotely like each other but keep coiled up for their common interest. Shannen Doherty (playing an other member of the trio) at Heather's funeral thinks ""Dear God, I had prayed for Heather to die many times, and although I know it was wrong, I kept doing it. And now that finally Heather is dead I know that...you understood...Pray Jesus! Alleluia!!! "" This is a prime example of how rotten these cliques are. After Heather is buried Heather Duke (Doherty) pursues her chief status and becomes even bitchier!!Veronica is an average girl which confronts the psychological dilemmas all of us have. What is the cost of being acceptable in your social environment? What does it take to be popular? Is it worth it when you end up not liking yourself and have to stick with friends you dislike? Actually the allegory is even deeper. Many times we don't show our real face to our friends and have to adopt another attitude. We never want to show our compassionate and sensitive side so our friends don't find us weak. We sometimes don't want to confide our unhappiness in order not to expose our vulnerable traits .This bold satire dares to depict with real power and not pretentious provocation what happens when a teenager's life and behavior is treated with silly Freudian terms and is put under the microscope instead of giving him / her what is really necessary; self-esteem and self acceptance.The movie is filled with tragic yet simultaneously hilarious scenes (like the funerals) or lines. One example is after Heather's ""suicide."" The teachers council in her school tries to psychoanalyze her and the most interesting element they find in her suicide note (forged by Veronica) is the word ""myriads."" She failed to write it in a recent dictation test therefore this led her to self-destruction! In one class the teacher asks from her fellow mates to express their feelings over this sad departure. One guy easily says ""I used to date Heather very briefly once. She left me because she said I was boring. But now...I know it wasn't my fault ...She just wasn't happy from her life."" How convenient! Not only can a fact can be interpreted with various silly ways from various silly persons, but the tragic demise of a young individual made another one esteem himself more and overcome his rejection!! There are many other examples but I don't want to give away more spoilers. I will have to warn you that the last 15 minutes are quite lame and disappointing. The plot breaks new limits of over-the-top campiness and we end up with an unnecessary duel scene. It doesn't matter. Heathers is a masterpiece that can be viewed over and over. If you like you may fast forward the last 15 minutes and go to the final ironic line of Veronica to Heather Duke. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!  Heathers      9 /10",Heathers
136,Hysteria28,Teen flick with black comedy,7,20 May 2010,"This is truly one of my favourite teen movies. I watched it so many times when I was at school. The characters, atmosphere and humour that was evident in the movie was very realistic. The movie intended to present a picture of high school student rivalries and how peer pressures can lead to ones isolation from others. In the second half the subject of 'teenage suicide' is explored as the students of Westerburg High are under the misunderstanding regarding deaths of fellow students. However I don't think the theme was explored in a mature manner. Treating it with a houmouristic tone was not suitable. It is a serious issue and to present it in this manner was totally absurd. Keeping that to aside the director Micheal Lehman has done a good job as a director. His camera angles and style of direction seem straight out of a horror movie. His understanding of the theme is modern. Many comedy moments are integrated in to the scenes which assist in character development.Winona Ryder and Christian Slater steal the show as the modern day Bonnie and Clyde pair that take on the method of murder to make their high school a better place. They decide to kill a few students and make it look like suicide to hide the truth. This eventually leads to negative vibes occurring all across the high school.This movie really was the source of inspiration for 'pump up the volume' Which also happened to be a Slater movie too. The movie attempted to address the issues that affect students in present times however that was as far as the similarities were concerned.The movie has a moderate pace but progresses with the plot at quick pace. Unfortunately the mid point segment seemed to run out of ideas but regained its momentum towards the end. Overall a movie recommended to those who admire teen flicks.",Heathers

This film is gross in that school clik's do form and kids feel alienated if there the geeks or uncool kids. Then there is the popular partying jocks and there all too hot girlfriends who are too cool for anyone unless there super cool jocks. Then there is the rich kids who are so preppy it hurts. The punks, goths, ravers. The dark mysterious kid who keeps to himself who is rumored to have parents who sexually molested the kid. The drug addicts and street kids. High school can be a cruel place or the best time of your life. I remember after the Columbine massacre our school was evacuated one day for a false bomb threat. I remember one girl the entire time I was in high school who committed suicide and everyone was so surprised because it was unexpected. This film was a bit hard for me to watch. Overall I thought it was as good as the hype that makes this film notorious for it's time. I thought Winona Ryder was excellent as she always is but I have never honestly been a fan of Christian Slater and hate his nasily voice.",Heathers

I can't recommend this for everyone but if you like dark comedies this is the king. Great, dark, satirical look at high school. Christian slater does a dead on young Jack Nicholson impression, and the rest of the cast follows with outstanding performances. One of my all time favorite movies. I could go on and on about this one, but that would hold you up from going out and seeing it NOW! Truly the greatest dark comedy ever.",Heathers
139,Nothinggrandproductions,Dark in the best way possible,9,10 October 2013,"Heathers is a movie I could see being made only in the 80s if this movie had been made now, it wouldn't surprise me if it got banned and that's part of the reason this movie is great. Westerburg High School is a stereotypical high school filled with cliques, especially the most dominant one including three girls all named Heather (Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk, and Kim Walker). Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) has begun to hang out with the three Heathers which she hates how they are right from the start of the film. She just wants to have her old life and old friends back. The movie is loaded with irony and dark comedy. And when I mean dark, I mean really dark. From crazy aspects like pulling guns out in school, murder in general, amongst other things. Veronica eventually meets J.D. (Christian Slater), a rebel who is an outsider and doesn't like the way the social cliques are and wants it to change. They begin dating and this eventually leads to a bit of murder here and there to the hierarchy of school social cliques. The entire thing rarely takes itself seriously, it's meant to be completely comical but the last 30 minutes are interesting. It gets more serious and to my surprise, it worked. It actually had some decent social commentary towards the end and had much more to say than just being a really hilarious dark comedy which was nice to see. Everyone in the cast performances the comedy with perfection, it seems to be have done with care. From the completely ironic lines, witty sarcasm, and the WTF moments in the movie, it has no boundaries with its performances and writings. This movie decided to do what it wanted and essentially had no rules at all. More movies like this need to exist because they don't care. They don't care what will offend people or not offend them, it does what it wants and it's done oh so tastefully. Overall, if you like your comedy as dark as possible, you'll love this movie, it will shock you with its humor but be hilarious as you question why you are laughing at the same time, and then it will surprise you again with a slightly more serious turn.",Heathers
140,Degree7,"A little less conversation, a little more action please.",3,1 August 2013,"What happens when your socialite best friends start driving you up the wall? Why you start knocking them off one by one of course! With the help of your Nietzchian boyfriend, who soon has bigger and much more destructive plans than you expected.Heathers could have worked as a delicious black comedy, but it eventually bungles itself headlong into utmost fantasy and self consciously twee rhetoric between some truly amateur acting from the supporting cast. Much worse is a sleezy Christian Slater as JD, the aforementioned nasal pitched rebel without much cause. Winona Ryder is a good lead, but has trouble pulling off the more comedic elements.Eventually the last third of the film makes an attempt for more serious territory, and any of its previously sardonic attitude is lost amid a sea of self aware, pseudo-analytic babble on the failure of certain social groups to get along. Whatever statement it was trying to make was lost as soon as the contrived climax came about, and even the script refuses to allow to have its characters take these ravings completely seriously (""that's deep, huh?""). That's when you know something's wrong.Once the bodies start piling up, you realize that it's nothing more than a slightly goofier, more pretentious version of your average 80s slasher. This one works as a guilty pleasure and a nice time capsule of those late 80s shoulder pads and big hair, but not much more. Just watch ''The Breakfast Club' instead for a more poignant and believable commentary on high school society.",Heathers

145,Adrian-32,"Biting, Brilliant",9,31 March 1999,"""Heathers"" should be considered as a classic. This very uncommon film is a delicious blend of a hilarious black comedy and a biting, cruel satire on adolescents. Enough with the John Hughe`s ""sunny, gooey, optimistic teen flick"", ""Heathers"" is a more like cynical but sadly realistic film on the dark side of adolescence. The film takes a look inside an Idaho high school called Westerberg High. It is ruled by a party of pate-eating, polo-playing b*tches who ruthlessly torment others to get their kicks. But an ""outside"" member of their clique, Veronica,(Winona Ryder)starts to feel sickened by their ways, and with the help of a mysterious but insane rebel, JD,she decides to teach the Heathers a lesson. Unfortunately, the ""lesson"" turns into an accidental murder, making Veronica and JD, the Bonnie and Clyde of the 80`s. In the tradition of the horror flim, ""Carrie"", ""Heathers"" depicts high school as a torture chamber for some, and a domain for others. ""Heathers"" itself is a total mocking of teenagers today, from the amazingly original and incisive dialogue, to the extreme but honest characters. On the surface, ""Heathers"" may seem colourful, but the plot gets blacker and blacker as the film unravels, it is hysterically funny too. The main message of this film is that today`s teenage society is dangerously edging extreme violence and destruction. I found the message to be expressed clearly, through the slits of this startling original and brilliant movie.",Heathers
146,Adrian-32,A ruthless satire,9,5 July 1999,"Sardonic, innovative and engaging, ""Heathers"" is a film that you can thoroughly enjoy no matter how many times you see it. Amidst the clutter of the conventional, sentimentality-oozing John Hughes flicks, an escape was finally made when ""Heathers"" was released, fearlessly and ruthlessly giving high school films a kick in the @$$. One thing that makes this film stand above the rest is it`s razor-sharp humour, with a script abundant with brilliant slang and insults (""F**k me gently with a chainsaw!""), delivered by ingeniously created characters ranging from vicious hellcats to repressed-homosexual jocks. High school has never been so pessimistically portrayed than it is here, it is shown as a society where sadism, murder, suicide and media frenzies all seem to be the latest in trend. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater deliver excellent performances as the Bonnie and Clyde couple of the 80`s. But there is a lot more than black comedy going on here, at the heart of ""Heathers"" lies a scathing satire on adolescence, one that mercilessly displays just what might happen if extreme cruelty and violence continues to flourish in high schools, and just exactly how the American media will exploit it. Now that`s what I call provocative.",Heathers
147,Elain-ee,'Heathers' teaches you stuff that no high school can,10,23 April 2017,"Heathers had a really, really well-timed appearance in my life. It came out when I was halfway through my first year of junior high at the end of the 1980s, and feeling utterly bewildered by these outlandish creatures around me: the eighties trendsetters. Their alien styles and feral egotism was captured perfectly in Heathers, depicting the way high school seems when seen through the eyes of a meek, unpretentious beginner. Veronica Sawyer (played by Ryder) is a girl like you, me and pretty much anyone that was ever a junior student, desperate to fit in. But not THAT desperate!The garish style of the characters in Heathers was never meant to be realistic... a fact that seems to have been lost on almost all viewers that were born after 1985. It was a brutal and massive send-up of everything that was hateful about the 1980s - and there was loads! But despite all the exaggeration, Heathers served up a very accurate reflection of way that the secondary school environment really seemed to my dazed, adolescent eyes. And yet shoulder pads were never *that* big, hippies were never THAT f*cked up in class and the bad boy never carried a gun (this was back in the days before the real high school shootings began). We all knew that Heathers wasn't meant to be realistic, at least not on a factual level. It was meant to be realistic on an emotional one, though, and it fully succeeded at that. It was a revenge fantasy flick with a heart: a satirical and strangely sensitive depiction of the awe and shame that all teens feel about their high school experience. Just when Heathers starts to seem like it's turning into a cartoonish, late-night stoner special, the murders begin. And then it gets dark... and awesome. Anyone who's been to a high school where they met their own 'Heathers' will feel alternately euphoric and disturbed about the events that follow. And that's what they should feel: it's a tale that's meant to make you reflect, and question your easy assumptions about the way 'everybody else' is. Even the ""Heathers"" in your life. It's a shame that Americans have stopped making films that really delve into the ugliest, funniest parts of being a teen the way that Heathers did. Subsequent generations of juniors could have really benefited from seeing more stuff like this. Teens generally have very few chances to really reflect upon their attitudes, and maybe even change them before setting off on a destructive (or self-destructive) warpath. Heathers gave me that chance and I was glad that I had it. Whatever your age, watch this film and you'll learn something that no school can ever teach you about being a teen... and have a laugh doing it.",Heathers

149,Movieman-133,I didn't like this film.,5,23 June 1999,"The film was barely funny,    the acting was overall mediocre,  and the films themes were ridiculously unrealistic to be treated as either a horror, thriller,  or comedy. I don't understand why people are giving an unstylish film like this such rave reviews but I must say the jokes on homosexuality, the unpopular,  the getting revenge on the popular just didn't make me smile.   The main highlight of the film is the chemistry between Slater and Ryder,  but everything else and the tragic/comedy ending(however you want to take it) just makes the whole film seem stupid.  The 80's picture and style also seemed dated and I'd rather watch a 90's class picture opposed to this waste of time.   I'd suggest The Craft(which has plenty of resemblances) anyday with it's class, FX, and actors.   Heathers just seems cheap.",Heathers

151,yduric,"A real delight to watch, joyfully blowing up the 'teenage-film' codes",8,14 October 2006,"I was really pleased to the extreme to watch this intelligent, venomous and brilliant dark comedy: I thought: yes, finally I'm watching a film in which everybody gets what he/she deserves and which is depicting the characters in a much more appropriate way than the great majority of American teenagers films. Because what we do have in more than 90% of this teenager films is the following, and finally extremely boring code : on the one side, you have the so-called 'school-stars',who are of course, always depicted as an example, and which are free to do everything they want, and on the other side, you have the so-called 'outsiders', whose DUTY is to keep their mouth shut, and not, oh my God,please not to disturb the good order established at school by its 'stars', with the following, insidiously disgusting message: if you belong to the first category, you can bully, spit upon, despise, in short make everything you want to anybody and get away with it, simply because you're popular. What is so delicious to watch in 'Heathers' (by the way, even the title is funny, I have always considered Heather a ridiculous and ugly first name...)is that the situation is actually reversed, and, in my opinion, much closer to the truth: the school-stars are all depicted as stupid, extremely self-centered and brainless, and this time, THEY pay the high price for their stupidity.What is even more funny is that this stupidity is very carefully dissected, depicted and analyzed, to the point that the director does not give the impression to shoot the film from a great distance, but like an infiltrated 'enemy within'. Now, for those who might think that the message of the film is that the solution is to start killing, I think that they entirely missed the point: it has to be taken in the second degree, it is after all a dark comedy, and the killings are much more a symbol, a call to end with that stupid order, a message of freedom: what you should kill is not people, but actually a narrow-minded, boring and intolerant behaviour and way of thinking. I wish there were more similar funny and intelligently subversive alternatives to scum (in its British meaning of 'garbage', I insist)like for instance 'Dude, Where Is My Car?' or others of the genre nowadays.",Heathers

155,ryansassy1,"The Original (and still the Better) ""Mean Girls""",9,17 September 2012,"Heathers has to be one of the darkest, most sharply written films of the 20th Century. The fact that its humor and horror holds up so well today is astonishing, and perhaps an indictment to how gutless Hollywood has become in the years since it was made. There will never be another teen satire so bold, so mean, and so dang funny.So we have this smart teen girl who's depressed, trying to break into the popular clique at her school known as the Heathers. Veronica hates her so-called best friends but submits to being treated like a lackey to do their bidding--we never really find out why exactly, or what she is getting in return. She seethes in her diary about murder fantasies but of course, as the protagonist, she would never...oh wait, what's that? A handsome and mysterious new guy who looks like a young Jack Nicholson? It takes about 20 minutes of film time to turn her around so that we the audience now question if there ARE any ""good guys"" left here.The buildup of horror mirrors the buildup of quotable hilarity as the body count for the ""suicides"" at Westerberg High climbs.Much has been written about the cultural satire of Heathers: writer Daniel Waters takes aim at John Hughes-type teen films, life in high school, political correctness invading the teaching system (via aging hippies), religious hypocrisy, clichés of detached parenting, and homophobia. It's a deadly and accurate aim, and the slaughter of pop culture is widespread.Each lead actor is right on target. Winona Rider plays Veronica to the hilt as the witty and likable anti-hero, and there could have been no better actress for the role. Christian Slater is the wry and charming Bad Boy, J.D.--the agent of chaos you can't help but agree with even as you have a nagging feeling that you shouldn't. Kim Walker is an amazing Heather #1, Shannen Doherty knocks it out of the park with her power-hungry performance as the next Heather who yearns to be the alpha of the pack. They all turned in what I consider to be the best performances of their careers in Heathers.It's not for the faint of heart, nonetheless; I urge you to see this movie. Look past the '80s fashions and you have a film that could have been made about high schoolers today, or in any era...except that it isn't going to happen, ever again. We've grown into such wimps we don't dare like this anymore, for fear of offending perhaps, or for fear of (gasp) making people uncomfortable about some of the truths of our own hypocrisy.

Veronica is about to go back to kissing Heather's ass until J.D. crawls through her window and convinces her that instead she can get revenge. Little does Veronica know that J.D. isn't really playing with a full deck of cards, and his idea of revenge is more violent than hers.

158,grayner-2,"A funny, genre-busting movie with some flaws",6,6 August 2018,"I finally got around to seeing Heathers after all of these years. It is kind of funny seeing the parallels between Chrstian Slater's J.D. and his character on Mr. Robot.The good: It very much captures the teenage angst of the late 80's in pre-Internet world. Slater and Ryder do excellent jobs with their characters. There are many quotable lines and funny moments. This is a very dark comedy and you can tell that tongues or often planted firmly in cheek.The bad: This movie could never be made today with the epidemic of school schootings and teen suicides etc. Slater's character was very prescient in forseeings what would be coming a decade later. One can even argue that poplularization of a film like this spread the message of the anguished, outsider teen who gets glory by attacking a school and killing people. but obviously the filmmakers cannot be held responsible for what happens later.The other thing that bothers me about the film is that it often falls into as many cliches as it avoids. 80's teen films were very homophobic. Here we see the typical set-up: Football players call the protagonist/villain a f*g, he then reciprocates in framing this elaborate scheme in which the boys die allegedly as gay lovers. It is often not clear where the satire ends and genuine homophobia so prevalent in the 1980's comes into play. Yes, it is clearly a joke that the fact they have mineral water, a Joan Crawford postcard etc., which they just carry around, is a sure sign they are gay. It is less clear that the way their day is presented is supposed to be a joke - the town seems to all ridicule the dead boys for being gay and share a common disgust and the audience gets the impression that the gay frame-up is the just reward for having called Slater a f*g in the beginning.Moreover, the film really ends on a bit of a cliched note. Ryder has participated in several murders but just walks away from the attempted mass-murder of the school like nothing happened. This time, she will be nice to the overweight student with zero social life - who was really just a prop for ridicule in this world, so that makes it all ok. Again, this is a black comedy and parody but, again, it is not always clear what cliches of the teen genre they are avoiding and which ones, some greatly unacceptable by today's standards, they fall right into.",Heathers
159,EllisDee,"Good satire of various teenager issues, full of dark humor...",8,3 October 1998,"Heathers does a fairly good job satirizing the whole high school scene, but the best moments come from the dark humor with Christian Slater and Winona Ryder trying to humiliate a couple of obnoxious jocks by making them appear to have committed suicide over their repressed homosexuality.  The funeral scene is the icing on the cake, where one of the jock's father (who is struggling to accept his son's apparent gaiety) laments ""I LOVE MY DEAD, GAY SON!""  I'm pretty sure that Heathers would offend some members of the gay community, but I can appreciate how the movie boldly pokes fun at something that is taken SO seriously. My biggest gripe with the movie is that the climax pales in comparison to some of the earlier scenes.  If they wrapped it up with something as funny as the jock's funeral, then I'd give it a higher rating.

It felt like a Burton movie honestly. Like they just wiped Winona's face and curled her hair right after she was done on the Beetlejuice set. Maybe even the director stepped out more often than he stepped in.
Everything was over the top but not necessarily in a good way. Music was grating, all other acting sucked, plot was meandering and unimportant.I get that it's a satire but does that have to mean that there is no plot and it's just Slater and Ryder playing God for an hour and a half?",Heathers

She is sick of their wicked ways and when she meets a dangerous, mysterious boy who assists her in murdering a few people she doesn't like...but one murder leads to another...until she can't take it any more. Heathers bucks all the tropes of the other teen movies out in the 80s and it's executed so well with its dark humour and amazing performances from Winona Ryder(playing angsty Veronica) and Christian Slater( playing her depraved, murderous boyfriend) among other. Apparently it didn't have box office success, which I can't understand why, but has now developed a cult following. A must-see if you have a dark sense of humour and you enjoyed ""Mean Girls"".

Whoever wrote this movie probably never attended a single class of proper script writing... and probably never watched a proper movie in their life. The opening of the film is... abrupt, to say the least, as is almost every transition in the film. Character relationships make no sense, the motivations of the characters make no sense, and it all falls apart a little too easily. I heard the songs from the musical and was intrigued by the characters and story so I decided to watch the movie. Big mistake. It's not compelling and by the end of it I found that there were no good characters, no ""moral lesson"", and I was bored. I think the only reason this has a cult following is because of the actors who were considered ""sexy"" at the time (and not gonna lie, Slater is hot in this, so it does get a little boost, but not enough to save the movie). Overall the film suffers from extremely poor writing choices. It could have been great if they'd just added in a bit more to give the story context.

The message isn't good: commit murder and blame it on the external influences of others.The plot is somewhat inspired, but rough around the edges. ""Heathers"" breaks conventions, but doesn't adhere to any rules, so it's not heavy on substance. It attempts to be high camp and succeeds on those merits: its the unrestrained bitchiness-of-it-all that makes this film so watchable.Heathers creates its own style of dialogue without seeming put-upon, like, let's say ""Swingers."" The language is trashy and lewd, but it finds its voice in Heather Chandler, played by Kim Walker (may she rest in peace), so effortlessly ferocious in her ability to cut people down, and the jeamous, unfaithful disciples who surround her.Many of the performances can be annoying and/or unmemorable, with the exception of parts that really matter, namely, Veronica and Heather #1 -3. Country Club Courtney and Betty Finn are also fun in smaller roles and most of the adult roles deliver. Some of the guys are appropriately oafish and cocksure (like Kurt and Ram), and I felt very indifferent to Christian Slater's Jack Nicholson/James Dean.This is a film that I watched over and over again on the HBO we got free somehow in the late 80's after our neighbor's started subscribing to it. (!?) Perhaps it appealed to my queer nature. I can't think of any other reason, because I wasn't any of those characters. I was somewhere between Peter Dawson (sans wealthy background), played by Jermey Applegate (may he rest in peace) and the geek who accidentally sneezes the milk out of his nose, although a friend enjoyed teasing me that I was Betty Finn. (while he self-appointed himself Heather Duke!) Maybe. It just had this cult-trash glimmer and came out when I was still a teenager.

This is all from what I read on this website, which I've posted several other comments on in the past. This isn't comedy, this is just plain stupid!

170,BraveHawk,"""F*#k Me Gently With A Chainsaw"" A Worthy Predecessor To Mean Girls.",7,1 February 2005,"Heathers is a movie about a powerful clique in high school. There are 3 Heathers (hence, the name of the movie), and Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder). Although Veronica is part of the clique, she does not like her friends. Heather Chandler (Kim Walker) tries to move Veronica up in social status by bringing her to parties she does not want to go to, among other various and sometimes cruel tasks. Along the way, Veronica meets a boy named Jason Dean (Christian Slater), or J.D. for short. They fall for each other despite Heather Chandler's feelings on the subject. Eventually, Veronica and Heather C. have a falling out, in which J.D. helps Veronica gain a bit of revenge. Veronica really does not want to go through with killing people, in fact, I do not think she thought J.D. was serious about doing it in the first place but, once it was done, they covered the murder by writing a suicide note in her handwriting (a skill Sawyer just happens to be good at). After a few suicides, it becomes the cool thing to do at Westerberg High. Meanwhile, Heather Duke (Shannon Doherty) takes over the reigns as the leader of the Heathers. This leaves Veronica up against Heather D. and ultimately, J.D. as well.This movie is pretty much an 80's version of Mean Girls (although Jawbreaker probably draws a little inspiration from this movie as well). The Heathers are The Plastics. Veronica Sawyer is Cady Heron. The plots are the same, although a little more tame in Mean Girls. After watching this movie for the first time here in 2005, I think it holds up and is a fun watch. I recommend this movie with 7 of 10 stars.",Heathers

The last minute of the film is probably the funniest ending to a movie I've ever seen.  The idea is so imaginative and original.  There are offensive moments in this film, but it also makes you think especially after the Columbine tragedy.  I was shocked to find out that Kim Walker, the young actress who played Heather #1, died a couple years ago.  Talk about strange coincidences and sad irony.  If you watch the film, enjoy it and don't try to take it seriously...it's a satire not a slice-of-life.

We gay kids got either the dumb abusive jocks who will beat us up or the serial killer who will appear to defend us just so he can get lucky with a girl. Fun! As usual, the only possibly gay people are laughable and weak. But, more importantly — in this film gayness is just a punchline, without actual gay people anywhere to really be found.It's supposed to be sophisticated satire but it's not. Walking on geraniums and hitting a person in the head with a croquet ball is not sophisticated satire.It's not always sophisticated satire with the suicide theme, either. It does better in that regard, though — such as by lampooning the self-promoting social justice warrior Pauline and the unconcerned conventional blowhards around her.The feel-good conventional morality of Veronica at the end is cute but very Hollywood-fake.Ryder is an incredible actress and this film is definitely a vehicle for her, bad as it is. Fans of her beauty and incredible acting will like this film.Slater's father is not at all believable, nor is he all that funny. And, unsurprisingly, the Hollywood view of high school life is not much at all like what high school is actually like. If the writer had wanted something realistic to make the jocks look bad it would have had a scene where they sodomize a weaker guy in the locker room with on object. That sort of thing happens all the time in the US. By contrast, arranged threesomes (with or without cow-tipping) are the sort of things that happen in scripts. Instead of just being sappy and stupid bullies, the film could have showed the level of barbarism actual high school bullies will stoop to. But, this is light humor, where making fun of invisible gay people is easier.And no, outside of a Hollywood film, no woman with a functional IQ would have drunk that concoction.The best scene in the film is when Veronica drops the photo of her with Betty Finn, as Heather drags her away. That sort of thing is what the film could have done more of. Instead, it drowns itself, and us, in cheesy camp.There are some good camp lines here, though, like when she suggests to Slater that he stay home and shoot a few toasters. Bulimia is so '87 is a favorite, as well as a true friend's work is never done. So, it has its moments here and there.",Heathers

Having some of the best one liners in movie history (""F**k me gently with a chainsaw"", ""Did you eat a brain tumor for breakfast?"", ""Bulimia is so '87""), and the best cast of talented unkowns (forgetting of course its two stars), it is also the most intelligent teen angst film with it's second being The Breakfast Club.  It is impossible for me to recommend this movie enough.  All you have to know is, if you're my friend, you've seen this movie.  If you're destined to become my friend, you will see this movie.  I share it like Mormon's share The Book of Mormon.  It holds the secret to life in between its biting sarcasm.  The key to happiness rests inside the lockers and in the boiler room of Westerberg High School.

I didn't really like the movie the first time I saw it, but I was very young and didn't understand half of the humor.

175,senorjuez,Still Great After All These Years,10,6 January 2006,"I recently saw ""Heathers"" after having not seen it for several years, and immediately remembered why I like it. This film so perfectly portrayed the high school social scene of its era. Anybody who was in high school in the late 80's can say that they recall people who were like the characters in this film. The members of this core clique, especially its merciless leader and the sex-crazed football players who thought the world revolved around them still linger today in most schools. Most of us who were not as popular in high school want some kind of karmic justice and this film is a visual gratification of that desire. Even though it goes to the extreme that it does, It is still worth watching. Unlike other teen films of the 80's, ""Heathers"" does not try to pleasantly resolve its conflict toward a happy ending. As for the casting, Winona Ryder became a star for her portrayal of Veronica, the new clique member who is trying to get back what she lost in order to be part of the crowd, her own identity. Christian Slater was the driving force of the film, and he will never duplicate this terrific performance. The two of them had great chemistry. I'm sure many guys could relate to J.D. and his demons. Kim Walker played the power bitch Heather Chandler to perfection. Her performance from the opening shot to her sudden demise will live on even though she is no longer with us. Shannon Doherty was great as the bitch-in-training Heather Duke. I strongly recommend that today's youth who has seen ""Mean Girls"" also see this film which more fully lived up to that name.",Heathers
176,spikethebloody,The best teen movie ever made.,10,16 April 2005,"It is rare to see a teen movie explore anything outside of the tragedy of not finding the right pair of shoes at the mall or the other trials and tribulations in the life of some suburbanite white kid. Heathers is that rare one that actually gets it right. It satirizes the superficial nature of teens and their ignorant self importance. It actually asks the audience to think and has a point other than some star crossed nerd and popular kid getting together. Yes, Heathers actually has a point! Something that is still revolutionary in the world of teen movies.One of the first things you will find is the funny and inventive use of vulgarity. This movie is actually hip instead of trying to be hip. It is vulgarity that borders on Tarantino or Kevin Smith style dialogs. It also has Winona Ryder does a great job and the use of narrator voice over is well done and written. The true heart of the movie is still Slater though. He plays a ignored troubled teen who isn't abused or even an angry minority. That's right. No big reason behind his madness other than parents that just didn't love him. The quickness of everyone to embrace the easiest illusion around is just typical americana. If it isn't ""outsourcing is good"" it is ""They hate us for our freedoms"". The movie works so well because as a satire it has liberty to wonder out of reality but still be more real than most ""serious"" teen dramas. I'll tell you this much. Heathers is more realistic than ""A Walk to Remember"" or ""She's All That"".As the movie progresses and JD reveals his murderous insane side most movies would instantly demonize him. They would have the female lead repelled and disgusted. Not Heathers. Keeping with the unconventional feel Winona's character just can't keep her hands off of JD even though she knows their murder spree is wrong and JD is never put into unlikable territory. In fact the terrible people surrounding him make the viewer sympathize with anyone that wants to slaughter them. The ending is just so brutally uncompromising that you have to applaud. We see the end of JD when he detonates bombs strapped to his body while the school is having a pep rally not a 100 yards away. No one cares and you know they won't care when they find out that he is dead. They'll just explain it away in a way that saves them from blame. Bitter, cynical, and always depressing?

Only the most deserving d*ckheads were killed by an incredibly unbelievable Christian Slater (doing a lame Jack Nicholson impression, meaning that Slater was playing himself). Shrill and intentionally campy without an ounce of actual danger, ""Heathers"" moves from one dumb inside joke to the next, torpedoing the ""messages"" it thinks so highly of itself for thinking it's making. Only in its last scene does it even have the ability to offend.That scene, by the way, is when Ryder is dancing with the girl in the wheelchair who (from what I recall) she'd been a total b*tch to through the entire movie. It's as if we're about to hear Sarah Connor's narration a la T2 - ""If a highschooler can learn the value of befriending the disabled... Maybe we can too!""

180,mikefox-04778,Over-hyped,6,1 June 2017,"So it's a cult movie that seems to strike a nerve with everyone having gone to an American high school. Not being American, I have some trouble relating to the characters, even taking into account their obvious caricature. There are some bumpy p(l)ot holes along the way, like Heather number one gulping down the drink without even sniffing it just because she was 'dared', the second footballer/victim running directly back to where he knows the first one was killed (even as brainless as he is, that's a reach), J.D. speaking out loud (not even psychopaths regularly do that unless is furthers the story) to a faceless hanged Veronica so obviously not hanging from her neck, Veronica turning up at school without a plan or an attempt to warn the other people, randomly looking for J.D. who could be blowing up the school at every moment. Just because it's satire doesn't mean you should just give a free pass to every terribly constructed story turn.I like both lead actors, had a crush on Winona Ryder like every teenage boy with eyes in the nineties. But even though there is gushing praise for their acting in many people's reviews here, my experience was different. Making a caricature out of a character is easy, playing the caricature in a believable way is hard. I didn't feel they were able to pull the latter off.The 6/10 is a measure of enjoying the challenge the movie presents, to homicide and suicide portrayal ethics, to your ability to digest the first unexpected murder, to rule violations in general like the compassionate protagonist clinically witnessing her former boyfriend's gory suicide.The movie is different, unconstrained and is bound to tumble around in your thoughts for a while.",Heathers

I've liked this movie since I was a kid and then, of course, I adored it once in highschool, and now in my mid-twenties it still remains a movie I never grow tired of. It's fun and witty and charming and Jason Dean is probably one of thee best characters ever to hit the screen. Anyone who reads this review, I would like to ask them to do something. Rent Very Bad Things (or buy it..it's a great flick) and Heathers. Watch them back to back and look for how Slater uses subtle changes of style, tone, stance, poise, and mannuerisms to portray the different psychology of these characters. If almost anyone else had been playing both roles these subtle but, oh so significant, demeanor changes would be absent. Never will you be watching VBT and think to yourself your seeing traits of JD, and likewise you'll never watch Heathers and see traits of Robert Boyd.

Yeah, i said it.Filled to the brim with satire, black humor and melodrama, this movie is teen angst at it's over-dramatic best. The dialogue is clever yet ridiculously quotable (there is strong language, for those who are sensitive to that kind of thing - used in interesting ways, for those who like that sort of thing). The plot plays on the heightened emotions of  an ""i'll just die if they don't like me,"" social pecking order. And heck, it's just funny.Daniel Waters, the screenwriter, is John Hughes' evil twin and this is the anti-breakfast club. Those who are looking for a 'can't the jock, the princess, the geek and the misfit get along' feel good kinda flick look elsewhere (though all the major teen stereotypes are there). Christian Slater is great as the James Dean/Jack Nicholson-bad-boy-who-makes-us-feel-so-good, this is probably Winona Ryder's best role (besides in court w/ the whole arm bit), and  Shannon Doherty is perfect in one of her first roles where she plays the character she plays best - a B****!

186,Two_Pieces_of_Christina,Lick it up viewer; Lick. It. Up.,9,15 May 2006,"Ahhh... the late 80's. When shoulder pads were still in fashion, Winona Ryder hadn't yet been arrested for shoplifting and teen movies didn't solely feature recycled actors.When teen genius Veronica Sawyer (Ryder) gets bored with the shallow and cliquey lifestyle of the three Heathers; her new-found high school chums, she wishes them dead. She never expects it to happen, but this all changes when she meets Jason 'JD' Dean (Christian Slater), a cool, darkly-dressed rebel who moves around the US randomly with his distant tycoon father.From the iconic opening sequence to the explosive ending, every scene is darkly comic and dripping with irony. It almost looks over-rehearsed as nearly every actor's performance is flawless. Ryder in particular shines with her angst-ridden 'Dear Diary' entries, and Slater I don't believe has ever again encapsulated such a perfect role in his career to date.The queen Heather (Kim Walker) really deserved more screen-time. She perfectly represents the bitchy, sneering, self-obsessed High School teen. She even manages to convey vulnerability after uttering the immortal line 'Well f/ck me gently with a chainsaw.' Shannen Doherty starts off with what seems a minor part which gradually builds and lets her have fun with the role. The only disappointing Heather is Lisanne Falk, with whom we don't really connect or care about. It's hard to find anything to pick on with this movie, but it could have used some smoother editing. The scenes cut to actors in different lighting and obvious passages of time to deliver major lines, and correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think corpses should breathe.The humour is dark and the plot unbelievable at times, but this only adds to the surreal atmosphere and unforgettable lines. A sexy cast, a great script and director Michael Lehmann's vision makes this a must-see film and a worthy addition to any DVD collection.

191,boiler-1,Excellent Black Comedy with a Moral,9,3 February 2003,"I just love this movie.  Christian Slater does an excellent Jack Nicholson imitation.  Winona Ryder does a wonderful job portraying a confused teenager who is trying to figure out who she wants to be.  Does she want to fall in love with the twisted, attractive Slater which will certainly offend her upper-class, cutthroat group of girlfriends (all named ""Heather"")?  Does she want to be in the ""in-crowd"" with all of the fun parties and fine boyfriends or does she want to continue old friendships with girlfriends which will certainly lower her social status.  These are realistic situations and portray how cruel high school can be when you are on the bottom rung of the ladder.The humor is very dark but in places it is wickedly funny.  It is an excellent movie for mature teenagers, confronting issues of social status creating barriers in high school and the cruelty which can have devastating effects.  I think this and ""The Breakfast Club"" are the two best movies about high school.",Heathers
192,peter-856,I used to think this film was cool,5,17 February 2005,"One of my girlfriends at university in the early nineties had a VHS of this film lying around her flat and I thought at the time that it was a masterpiece. Watching it tonight, for the first time in a decade, it seems a little clunky, desperately contrived, utterly tasteless and, well, incredibly 1980s.The 1980s had a really unpleasant sterile Nietzchian undercurrent bubbling through them, and this film is a product of that. The Christian Slater character, with his Jack Nicholson voice and Peter Falk posture, spouts inconclusive Reader's Digest/Mein Kampf aphorisms as if they seal the argument and then kills people. The satire rests upon the adults all being idiots and the children all being competitive vampiric brutes, except for the former best friend and the ostracised victim of body fascism, who wait around to prove that Winona Ryder's character has a soul by being implausibly forgiving to her.The script's clumsiness even leads it into the same homophobia which it wants to satirise. It really is a poor effort.So why did it look so cool when it was new? Well, Christian Slater certainly had an impact, although I seem to remember my girlfriend commenting that anyone who said ""Greetings and salutations"" was advertising himself as a dick-head. The colour coding, and stylization, instead of looking random, speed freaky and anally retentive, looked ""Very"" when MTV still seemed like a good idea, and...oh yes: this is the main reason...There had been high school shootings before then; of course there had; Boomtown Rats wrote a song about one that was a huge hit in the 80s. However, they'd managed to sweep the idea under the carpet to an extent that became impossible pretty soon after this film was made. So, when Heathers was released, the idea of pulling out a huge gun and pointing it in the face of people who annoyed you still seemed pretty cool: ""Radical"", but cool.That's what this film is really: the adolescent dream we all have of employing violence to wipe away our teen angst. Thank God, most of us grow up, accept that problem solving is a complex but rewarding part of life and look back on Heathers as a nasty, self-congratulating piece of nihilistic smugness. Most of us.",Heathers
193,zacharywalker-09793,The musical is better,6,29 June 2021,"I'm a HUGE fan of the musical theatre version of Heathers... so I was expecting a lot from this movie. Unfortunately, the musical is MUCH better than this film, so I was a bit disappointed. However, if you like this movie I'd highly recommend listening to the musical!",Heathers
194,newjerseymoviefanrob,When MTV killed more than the radio star,10,12 February 2006,"In the 1980s, many in the music industry feared that MTV would kill the radio star and music videos would be the output for hot new musicians, they were wrong. MTV didn't kill the radio star, but it also didn't help teenager's minds along with views on life. Heathers show's teens in the midst of the MTVera in high school. It focuses on a young girl, Veronica who is in the most popular group called the Heathers. However, she is also the outcast of the group.She doesn't really like her friends or her life very much despite having everything a teenage girl can desire. But she is forced to fit in anyway; she really has no solution to her popularity. Why should she, isn't popularity the Holy Grail of High School? Suddenly everything changed when an outsider by the name of J.D.(played by a young, extremely versatile Christian Slater) moves to town catching Veronica's eye across the CAF. Unlike Veronica, J.D. doesn't fear the importance of current high school popularity He represents everything Veronica aspires for but won't do on account of her reputation as a Heather.They both form a relationship becoming very close ""friends"" sharing their views on the whole high school scene and the contemporary social issues. It's all fine until J.D. puts poison in Heathers drink, the leader of the Heathers and Veronica's enemy leading to Heathers death. To get away with it, they fake a suicide note written by Veronica forging Heather's name on it forcing an uproar baffling the whole School. How can a girl so popular be so unhappy, and why would she commit suicide? Suddenly the media and the school get in to it; suicide suddenly becomes the hot new topic at school from the media, to the classmates, to the staff. J.D. tricks Veronica into killing the two biggest jocks at school. The whole scene is dark satire at its best. ""Is that mineral water?"" Suddenly many popular kids start attempting suicide simply to fit in escaping the hell's of 80s High School. If the most popular girl and two most guys do it, shouldn't the average kid's? The whole thing turns into a huge issue inspiring some of the best satire ever put to screen. Heathers show's the satire like no High School movie has every attempted.The 80s was a great decade for teen comedies. John Hughes was, of course, the king creating the brat pack. Cameron Crowe had a few of them too, but there is no teen comedy as daring and satirical as Heathers. The whole film gave me Goosebumps compelling me like no teen movie I have ever seen in my life. Winona Ryder is amazing. She's the closest thing to Holden in Catcher in the rye that I've seen.I just wanted to kiss her the whole time. I'm in High School, I know how tough it can be to fit in with kids constantly trying to be popular with everyone being classified by their looks, wealth, where they sit in the Cafeteria. It's very petty and short but to many kids, it's the most important time of their lives and it can also be the worst. Fortunately, my generation has become a bit more accepting.Bullying usually stops by High School today, but still occurs ruing many kid's lives. Heathers shows how popularity plus fitting in can affect everyone from the popular to the average and it does it in such a dark and intriguing way. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Mean Girls but wanted more. Rachael McAdam's in Mean Girls is a pale comparison to Heather Chandler's pure shallow, vain, bitchy attitude and she enjoys every second. You won't believe where Heahter's takes you. The 80s was a tough time to fit in. Growing up with MTV making kids more shallow with materialism becoming their pride possession. Heathers show's exactly what it all can lead to. 10-10!!!",Heathers

196,revell,very funny black comedy,9,31 July 1999,"this movie is a great black comedy. Its about the most popular and powerful clique in school and how their new addition, Veronica, becomes increasingly disenchanted with them.

Then,you get the first glimmerings somethings wrong when he keeps telling the same old joke over and over again,laughing harder each time he tells it. After awhile,He's forgot the original point he was trying to make. He realizes you're rapidly losing interest. So he throws everything he can into coming up with a slam-bang finish he's sure you'll love. You don't,but that doesn't keep him from trying it all again,until he gets it right. Or,loud.",Heathers

199,talkhard818,Moment of silence please...this movie is the absolute BEST,10,31 December 2002,"OK, there are no words to describe how great this movie is. Christian Slater and Winona Ryder are absolutely amazing and perfectly cast in Heathers. This is a must see for everyone who loves a revolutionary teen movie, or any of the actors in this in general.The writers and directors of this movie had set out to make THE definitive teen angst movie, and they did just that. Heathers is a holy grail that will remain in the hearts of those who truly love it forever.*SPOILERS HEREIN*Winona Ryder is excellent as the movie's heroine, Veronica Sawyer. Her thoughts and feelings about what's going on in her life are raw and real. Teens seeing it can connect with her. The plot is basically about teen suicide, and many were worried that after seeing this movie, there would be an outbreak of copycat suicides, but it did just the opposite of that. Heathers shows teens that suicide isn't a cool thing. The film's rather garish approach to it is necessary for this message to be conveyed.Now, the real spotlight in this film shines on Christian Slater as J.D. He is extremely sexy in his psychotic nature, and he gives the film a dangerous edge. Mr. Slater makes this movie what it is. No other actor could possibly have carried this role out as well as he did. He seems to be psychotic yet apologetic all at the same time. It's a strange web of emotion, and he weaves it flawlessly. Slater has been critisized for his imitation of Jack Nicholson in this role, but the mimicry fits J.D.'s mold perfectly. Congratulations, Mr. Slater. You won my heart with this role.Bottom line, see this movie, 6 out of 5 stars, it is truly amazing.",Heathers
200,2cents,So Very.,10,8 May 2003,"Greetings and Salutations,If you can imagine Jack Nicholsons 'Joker' at high school, he's cool, he's a loner, has a dark mysterious quality . . . oh and he is insane and likes to kill people. Still with me?Meet J.D, this is Christian Slaters character in Heathers, Slater gives the kind of performance that makes you wish he got cast in 'dark' roles more often. J.D has spawned numerous fan websites and is arguably the greatest teen movie character ever. His lines are spot on and the one scene right at the start of the film where he pulls a gun on the two main school bully's/jocks still brings a smile to my face.Heathers takes the teen flick concept and ads a new twist. The school characters are perfect right down to the cool kids inventing a new way of speaking just so they stand out even more. You have the nerds, the jocks, the rich kids, the popular kids, the fat victim etc all your standard teen groups are here and happily bouncing along to the beat that life has given them no matter how shallow or cr*p it is.This is where most movies just continue, and where Heathers excels. Enter J.D, J.D represents everything that every kid ever wanted to do or say and didn't. Not so much a spanner in the works more a bomb!
This film has pages and pages of great quotes and the acting from it's 2 stars is exceptional, Winona Ryder has not made a better film (neither has Shannen Doherty)and the supporting cast play their small but oh so important roles to perfection.The only pre 25's who will not get this movie are the rich spoilt teens who are oblivious to real life because daddy has always bailed them out or given them everything that they ever wanted (much like the 'rich kid' social group in the film). And as in the film they are largely irrelevant anyway.Everyone else you must see this movie at least once, it is a classic. You may not love it but you will definitely have an opinion on it.One quote for the road . . .In Prayer ""Hi, I'm sorry.

201,haikus753,One of my favorite black comedy films!,9,11 July 2013,"I had never heard of this wonderful and hilarious film until recently. I saw that it had received really good scores on all the movie websites I visited, this one included, and so I decided to watch this film and see what it was about. My goodness, I laughed so hard throughout this film! It's such a dark yet hilarious film; it's extremely dark humor done right.The plot was quite unique yet made sense, and was interesting. Plus, all the characters were very fascinating, too. The cast was wonderfully chosen, and each actor/actress played their role quite nicely. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater both suited their roles perfectly, and were very believable. The dialogue is excellent, too, and there are some quotes that particularly stand out throughout this movie. I love the all of the music/songs used here, too; they all have that 80's feel, yet communicate the atmosphere of the scene they were used in effectively.Plus, there are some interesting things going on in this film; there is much symbolism and color-coding. In the recurring croquet games, Heather Chandler is the red ball, Heather Duke is the green ball, and Heather McNamara is the yellow ball, while Veronica (Ryder) is the blue ball. Each color describes the character well: red for dominance, green for jealousy, yellow for weakness/cowardice, and blue for trueness. The ending for the film was bittersweet, might I add.Overall, Heathers is not your average teen movie; it is very funny and intelligent, and (in my opinion) very memorable. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite comedy films. 9/10 stars",Heathers

203,WRyder,I love this movie!,10,22 January 1999,"It's a black, cynical parody of high school life.  I love it.  Being a high schooler, I can say safely say I relate.  The first time I saw this film, I really didn't like it, but it has meaning.  The cult-like cliques of school are captured amazingly, and so is the deeply-embedded hatred for them; hatred from the outsiders, and even the insiders.  Winona Ryder gives, as usual, an excellent portrayal of her character, Veronica Sawyer.  She and Christian Slater (J.D.) play very well off each other.  I love it... so quotable.",Heathers

It combines black comedy and great acting to make for a disturbing, yet watchable film.  One thing I recently wondered is if this movie would be blackballed with all the recent high school violence (I know there is talk about a sequel).  Granted, this takes a very cynical look at violence by teens, but when it was made, I am sure the writers had no clue what was to come when it came to senseless violence in our schools.Ryder and Slader are amazing and the chemistry is perfect.  Some of the lines in this film are pure brilliance.  It is a twisted look at the ""Unpopular"" kid's view and solution to high school cliques and the ""perfect people"".I love this movie.",Heathers

He plays the dark, psychotic teenage boy perfectly and I can see why he was being tipped as the new Jack Nicholson when this movie came out.Winona Ryder was exceptional in her role as well, she hasn't really topped, or equaled for that matter, this role since (apart from maybe Girl, Interrupted, but that film was stolen by the lovely Ms Jolie).Most of the lines in the movie are fantastic as well, very dark and comedic.

208,msaz12,A spectacular dark comedy,8,10 June 2012,"A shocking film of unapologetic candor, Heathers would have struck fear into the hearts of parents and elders all over the world in the 1980s. This film expressed the inner workings of the mind of a high school student through the words of a sharp-witted writer devoid of any form of censorship. Tackling all the important and at times, taboo issues, such as homosexuality, vulgar language and juvenile delinquency it is a spectacle for the viewer who would much rather think than see.Indifference is at the heart of this film and it forces the viewer to think objectively and even laugh at the most inappropriate moments, only to find that they laugh because they understand the film.This is not a typical high school movie you would take your children to see nowadays, as most subject matter tackled are mature in content. A movie dripping with societal undertones, it is a dark comedy. The equivalent of a writer's dirty-mind.",Heathers

There aren't enough sexy Christian Slater and Winona Ryder scenes together at all. There aren't enough sexy Christian Slater scenes at all.

211,djheroinchic,75% Perfect,7,7 April 2006,"As the film started, I wasn't entirely sure if it was one I was going to like. Fifteen minutes into it, I seriously wanted to turn it off. In retrospect, I'm very happy to have given it a chance. The first quarter of the film seems to be a bit uninspired. Its the same characters and plot points as almost any teen movie ever made.But once it makes its transition into a darker movie, I could not stop from watching. It has great atmosphere that adds to the creepiness factor.The acting is good, with a few actors/actresses standing out. Winona Ryder is becoming one of my favorite 80's girls, and this movie is a big reason why. She brings a solid all around performance. Shannen Doherty does well playing a bitch, and this is probably when she got type-casted as one. I have not been really impressed with any Christian Slater movie, except for maybe True Romance, but this is the greatest performance of his career. He hit every cue with his character's transformation.This film will make a great rental, and if you enjoy it, it would be fitting for any fan's movie collection.",Heathers

213,shinsou-17619,"""Our love is God""",10,11 May 2020,"10/10 one of my favorite movies of all time. It's so hard to make a movie like this, fake suicides with humor. The antagonist isn't just psychotic, he actually has character, and that's something most movies forget to do. Veronica is one of the best protagonists I've seen in a while. She's trying to stop JD of course, but she's not some goody two shoes who wants to save the world with kindness. No, she gets wrapped up in Jason's schemes and is actually in touch with reality. Heather Duke's ""funeral"" was a little strange to me the first time around (and of course it's still a little odd), but it makes more sense now. Heather Chandler, the infamous mythic b-tch, doesn't seem like she's just a b-tch. Even though she's not alive for long and within the time she's alive, she's pretty much just a b-tch, she seems like more than that. She got Veronica into the Remington party when she could've gone alone. I could keep going on and I know my review is all over the place but if you like dark humor and the popular kids getting what they deserve, you should definitely watch this",Heathers

216,omophagia-2,As vicious as they come...,10,24 March 2000,"*Possibly contains mild plot spoilers. You have been warned!*The most ingenious of the so-called ""dark comedies"" are successful for the way that they manage to take a most unpleasant aspect of human society and lambast said sociological flaw as shrewdly as possible. _Fargo_, for example, tackles middle class complacency, while _Election_ celebrates the triumph of human greed._Heathers_, undoubtedly one of the most vicious, relentlessly cynical films in a genre that thrives on its use of satire, focuses on the pettiness and ill-conceived social mores upon which the uniquely American construct of ""upward social mobility"" are based. Certainly no one who views this film will ever look at the game of croquet in quite the same way again.And therein lies the greatest strength of _Heathers_ as a film-- its uncanny ability to remove the commonplace from the reality that the viewer knows and to reconstruct the symbols it chooses-- including croquet; funerals; pep rallies; and, in one of the film's most memorable scenes, mineral water-- within the context of the fictional Westerburg High in such a way that, although greatly distorted, an uncomfortable familiarity is retained. The effective use of all of these reconstructions is a vicious cariacature of a power struggle that is based upon little more than which of the involved individuals can exhibit the most grossly deviant behavior without getting caught.And those individuals are characters fully developed to a truly rare extent, as the motives of even the minor players such as Heather McNamara (as opposed to Heather Chandler or Heather Duke...) are explored. Winona Rider gives one of the very best performances of her accomplished career as Veronica Sawyer, the member of ""The Heathers"" who dares to challenge the status quo. The results, of course, are gloriously disastrous, as her involvement with Christian Slater's-- also in peak form-- mysterious, murderous Jason Dean nearly results in the destruction of Westerburg in its entirety. As is, Veronica says it best when she writes, ""Our love has a body count.""The most satisfying complexity of _Heathers_ is that, at the ultimate, explosive resolution of the struggle for supreme popularity and control of Westerburg, the most overtly corrupt character actually _does_ ascend to authority. Though she does maintain a certain strength of character that permits her to promise some important changes by film's end, Veronica's method for attaining the power that allows her to make such a decree could not be called noble, not even by the most unflinching cynic.As far as films go, _Heathers_ is brilliantly crafted. The dialogue is hilarious, with vicious one-liners coming at a rapid-fire pace. All of the performances, particularly those of the perfectly-matched Rider and Slater, are first rate, and they convey a self-awareness and complexity that might seem to belie individuals who so thoroughly revel in their own shallowness. Interesting murder sequences and satisfying plot twists keep _Heathers_ engaging for the duration of Veronica's tale of redemption.RATING: 10 out of 10. One of just a handful of near-perfect films out there. Never taking itself too seriously, _Heathers_ carries shrewd social criticism without ever being obvious. A should-be classic film that, for now, must settle for ""cult"" status. A gleefully vicious satire of adult society packaged into an intelligent film that should appeal to anyone who has ever attended high school.",Heathers

I've never been really popular, and so in certain ways I could identify with Slater's role, J.D. (though I'm not planning on killing anybody anytime soon). This movie was hilarious, especially if you have a cynical sense of humor, and I think most teenagers could relate to it, either the ones like Veronica who are stuck with friends they can't stand but can't pull away from, or the ones like J.D. and me, the outcasted.

What so funny about school killings and suicide bombers in 2002? Teenagers killing each other may have been funnier in 1989. Now it's just gross and disturbing and depressing. Even though it had Winona Ryder, it still stunk. Don't know why it was considered a comedy.",Heathers
221,marnie_rutland,one of the best,9,16 July 2007,"In the IMDb poll, I had to choose the Veronica Sawyer option as the character Winona Ryder will always be for me. It is also pretty much the only badge of respect I have for Shannon Dohrety. Too bad Kim Walker died so young. In this and Say Anything she pretty much plays high-school-evil characters.I'd like to see Daniel Waters knuckle down and write the sequel. Ryder is into it. He said it would take place in the political arena, and there is a lot of Heathers sensibility to be found there.I think this movie co-exists easily alongside The Breakfast Club even though some see it as a reaction to it. There is truth in both.My only quibble is that on some wicked level I wish the movie did not end up judging Slater. I kinda condoned a lot of his actions, and it's too bad he stepped over the line. We need psychos once in a while.",Heathers
222,jamiko-1,"great, original, refreshing",10,11 January 2005,"One of the most amazing and strong movies that I have ever seen. Winona Ryder, Christian Slater and especially Shannen Doherty showed their enormous talent and gave a performance that really touch you. The direction is wonderful but above all things the script. The script is so clever and unique that there is a moment where you feel really connected with the characters and even you know that what they are doping is completely unacceptable you agree and support them because the story is so well written that you are transported to that tremendous high school. This is a strong movie and for days it really shocked me. I saw it when I was 14 and it really made a big impact in me. Highly recommended.",Heathers
223,dejiaw,This movie is so great,10,27 September 2017,"Honestly, out of all the movies I've ever watched, this movie has easily grown to be my favorite. The smaller things add to the plot, such as the colors of the Heather's choice of clothing, as well as the climax of the movie, and it's overall a great film. (*Slight* spoiler here) ""Chaos is what killed the dinosaurs, Darling."" That line itself would easily make the list of most memorable/significant lines of the movie, especially since it leads to the climax, and also shows great character development. Rambling aside, this movie is more than 10/10, and I'd recommend you set aside a day for the movie.",Heathers

225,tiggr3,MY own personal cult classic.,10,28 June 1999,"In my own personal perfect world I would consider Heathers to be a cult classic.  In high school I could watch this movie every day, recite every line, and enjoy Jason Dean's character more and more.  I love how it portrays high school life dealing with cliques, jocks, parents of the rich, and those cast aside as if they weren't really people.  Perhaps today if people would watch this movie they would understand how some of us are treated so poorly. Then we could do something before someone blows away their fellow jock or classmate.  Of course you can't take the film too seriously.  Veronica (thanks to Winona Ryder) is just so cool, you have to love the way she deals with her so called ""friends"".  It's a shame Jason had to be so psychotic. . . I thought they made a great pair.

For god's sakes, people, this movie is essentially a stupid little teenage version of ""How to Kill Someone without any Reason and Get Away With it"".The fact that it has three cute girls on the cover deceives the fact that beside being quite stupid and boring it also bears a quite unacceptable message to its target audience, i.e., teenagers.'Heathers' almost makes me wish there was something like censorship in Blockbuster....",Heathers
228,scarlettpentagrams,"Continues to stay relevant, smart and quite very!",10,10 October 2019,"""Heathers"" is the perfect example of a teen drama having an everlasting impact holding clever themes of A parents worse nightmare, the suicide of a child, and how the media twists it to appeal to themselves, teenage toxicity and even the touchy subjects of school shooters (bombers in this case). ""Heathers"" continues to be relevant into the very real dangers of high school, from the little things to bullying, the moderate things like suicide and the heavy subject of school shooters that unfortunately, teenagers can still relate to. The balancing of the dark themes with the dark humour and the clever aesthetics, and I haven't even gotten to the technical aspects! Speaking of, the movie obviously doesn't believe in subtlety and wants to get straight to the point and not be blunt at all and it works by allowing you to follow it and get invested without it being repetitive, with the colour motif being carried throughout, the symbolism of the red scrunchie and how how power is passed to the prettiest and cruelest student which I'm sure we've all known and been tortured by. What's the best thing about ""Heathers"" is it's historical significance, in the 80s, the bad boy was heavily romanticised, every girl wanted to cigarette smoking, wise cracking badass and it was being shown in a myriad of romantic movies at the time, ""Heathers"" subverted this. It started off like that before making JD, the bad boy, borderline abusive and definitely sociopathic, killing the somewhat toxic trope of the romantic bad boy for good and reinventing the films of the time (except you, wattpad, you're hopeless). ""Heathers"" continues to be referenced, continues to be adapted and continues to stay significant. It's boils down to purely being a perfect piece of writing and a perfect piece of cinema and will never die! A definite must watch!",Heathers

The plot is so beautifully written and the characters are so perfectly cast. Winona Ryder is on amazing form to be honest, so is the rest of the cast. In my opinion, this movie is an essential watch. Whenever I feel down, Heathers always seems to cheer me up. JD is a great character and Mr Slater effortlessly switches between heart throb and psychopath in a flash. Heathers, heartwarming as it is, takes some more heartwrenching turns. An example of this is Kurt and Ram's funeral. The late Kim Walker also shines as Heather Chandler, the demon queen of high school whom we love to hate. Seriously, if you never watch this movie then, ""What's your damage?""",Heathers

232,athiete69,Brilliant Film,10,22 December 2003,"There is hardly a doubt in my mind that Heathers is one of the best films of the 1980s, if not included in a list that names all the essential films of movidedom. The movie is about Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder) who is fed up with her role and association with the cruelest and most popular clique in Remington High. The three other members (appropriatley named Heather and identified by their last names 'Duke', hobbies 'Cheerleader', and position '#1') are the dominant members of the school and take pride and joy in other's suffering. It isn't until Veronica meets a loner named Jason Dean (Christian Slater) that she finally has an outlet to vent her frustration about her life. Eventually JD and Veronica murder the leader of the clique and are forced to cover it up with a suicide. This leads to a horrificly dark satire of the teenage suicide epidemic of the eighties. After JD's rage continues Veronica must ask herself the question: Is she on the way to the prom or to hell? The movie is brilliant acted by Ryder, but the show is stolen by Slater. His Nicholson-esque performance is eerie and he gets my vote as one of the top villains of all time. The supporting roles are done well enough with the standouts being Dean's creepy father and Paula Fleming, the guidance counselour. Lehman directs the movie with a brilliant mix of colors that range from lighter at the beginning of the movie to darker at the end, as the tone changes. Although both Lehman and Waters would never match their previous success (they were actually quite bad after Heathers) this film proves that they did at one time have something to offer the world of cinema. While the story may seem like an ordinary black comedy and satire of the 1980s teen films it has a very simple message underneath: Be your own person. We have always been told in our lives to ""not do something just because it's cool"". So many teens reflect that, but there is also the other side of the coin ""don't do something just because it's uncool"" which Veronica tries with JD. So many teens conform to unconformity which doesn't make them individuals at all, this was really the first film to satire that other side of the argument. Be your own person does not mean rebel against the popular people or to join them, it just means be yourself and I think by the end of the film the viewer shares with Veronica's journey.",Heathers

I had not seen the movie before and from only seeing the cover art and hearing the name I feared the worst. A coming of age movie telling the tale of a distressed highschool girl looking for love, friendship, and the other side of the rainbow. Essentially crap. But dear lord in heaven this knocked me off my feet. With their clever back and forth between J.D. and Veronica I assumed it would just be a funny part in the movie setting the base for the stereotypical bad boy J.D. would be. Then they killed Heather. I got a bit skeptical and thought maybe they're in for a little more hyjinx than expected. As the movie progressed I found myself paying more and more attention to it. Eventually I was glued to the screen. For a movie I thought was going to be a steaming pile of stereotypes, this was a pleasant surprise.",Heathers

Luckily, I got to see the whole thing and I simply fell in love with it...and Jason Dean(aka Christian Slater!). Veronica(Winona Ryder) was great. I felt that I could relate to her(not just that our names are the same). This movie is so creative! It truley is the most classic and unbeatable teen movie. But this isn't the average ""teen movie."" There is quite a big morbid twist added into every scene which makes it all the more interesting. Not to mention, the cast is amazing. Honestly, is there an existing guy who is finer and sexier than Christian Slater? I didn't think so. Personally, I think his dark, scary, and eery personality makes him soooooo attractive and sexy. I dunno, but this kinda crossed my mind...Are all these school shootings a take-off from Heathers? I wouldn't be surprised. Michael Lehmann is such a genius! I heard about a sequel of Heathers. I think it was something like...Veronica waking up from that movie(the whole movie happens to be a dream) and she goes to her high school reunion after 10 years. There was something about JD being in her dream/nightmare but I think that's just a rumor. Anyhow, I hope that the sequel doesn't ruin the whole Heathers idea. It better be good!",Heathers

238,dbruck1,Test of times...love the casting (MILD SPOILERS),8,6 May 2006,"Let me start with I am certainly outside the target demographic for this movie. I was 35 when it came out and am male.Heathers, as far as I am concerned, is not about high schools or society in general, in 1989. I first saw it on cable, a couple of few years or so after it came out. I thought I was watching a mockumentary of my 1969-72 high school class.Today I have two kids in HS. The cliques are the same, the issues, the attitudes, the feelings of entitlement, the parents who don't (fully)understand what goes on.My then-15yo son, who has an appreciation of dark humor, loved this movie when I rented it. My then-13yo daughter prefers Mean Girls. Maybe it hit too close to home for her.In short, Heathers reflects cultural steadiness in the US (at least the midwest) and not a short-term phenomena.CASTING and PORTRAYALS First off, I was floored when I saw Glenn Shadix as Father Ripper. After seeing him in Beetlejuice my first impression was this was another of Otho's careers...color analyst, psychic, priest.PORTRAYALS I'm going to skip some of the obvious because I have nothing to add to the other kudos: the oblivious parents, Wynonna Ryder, ""serious"" young cops and ""caring"" teachers.The Heathers were wonderful in their interchangeability. It was like watching a take-off on multiple personalities all fighting for dominance. It took more than a few viewings before I took time to try to differentiate them.***MILD SPOILER follows*** Then there was the pairing of Kirk Scott, as Big Bud Dean (JD's father), with Christian Slater. The cold heat between them was perfectly portrayed. Big Bud had alienated JD by focusing on himself. JD rebels by acting like his father.Finally there was Christian Slater's intentional over-the-top Jack Nicholson imitation. It's a great portrayal of a teen looking for an appropriate life M.O. by imitating celebrity personnae. At least we didn't get hit over the head with this by ""subtleties"" like Nicholson movies or a poster of Jack Nicholson in the background (at least I didn't see any).",Heathers
239,davedimmer,80's teen genre turned upside down!,10,2 May 2001,"A masterpiece without any doubt. How popular those 80's teen flics were, and for good reason, a new genre explored and through the likes of John Hughes, delivered masterfully, Heathers changed all that. It is in this context that the film must be viewed, see the likes of The Breakfast Club, Some Kind Of Wonderful, St. Elmos Fire, and you may start to realise the huge impact this film had (and still does!) Here the genre is torn apart and reshaped entirely the wrong way up. Where before, this type of film was a real feelgood factor genre, Heathers flips this into a dark (yet comical still?) shocker. Winona Ryder and Cristian Slater are perfectly cast and allows the film to evolve beyond the simple teen flic.If you havn't seen it, do so. If you have, then get and watch some of those other 80's classics and admire further it's geniusDave",Heathers
240,wolljv,I loved this satirical look at high school.,9,29 May 2001,"Heathers is a great satirical look at high school life in the late 1980's.It focuses at first on the popular girls, the ""Heathers"", who are also mean to everybody, but turns when an interesting new kid enters school played by Christian Slater.  This is my favorite work of his as he plays the creepy, yet seductive Jason Dean.  Winona Ryder is also great as Veronica one of the popular girls who is starting to question how mean the ""Heathers"" can be to other kids in school.  Jason helps Veronica to question the ""Heathers"" attitudes.  When a practical joke of Jason and Veronica's takes an unexpected turn is when this film really gets rolling and leads to some unexpected scenes which are both frightening and hilarious.For all of the high school movies that come along every year this is definitely one of the best of all time which I would include in the company of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Risky Business, The Breakfast Club and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Daniel Waters screenplay is wonderful and the dialogue between the characters is very interesting.  Michael Lehmann's direction is also very good as he chooses some interesting camera angles at times, but is not overbearing in his direction.Heathers is a rare movie in that you both feel sympathetic for the characters while also disliking them sometimes.  It shows how easy it is to become involved in something wrong in high school without really trying to. Christian Slater and Winona Ryder have never been better and I wish they would get together on screen again.  Heather is a movie that should be enjoyed and provoking thought for a long time.",Heathers

248,grrrl_interrupted,Ryder proves herself..dark comedy at its best,10,28 October 2002,"There's no point denying that Heathers is a cult classic.  Its dark and disturbing, yet hilarious in places, and the dialogue used is spot on. Veronica Sawyer (Ryder) comes out with some splendid one-liners, and it is in this film that I feel Winona truly proves herself as an A-list celebrity. Her work prior to this (Lucas, Beetlejuice etc) is also excellent, but in Heathers she really comes into her own.  Christian Slater and Shannen Doherty both perform really well; Christian as the rebel-without-a-cause Jason Dean, and Doherty as the bitchy Heather Duke.  Kim Walker (RIP) makes a truly memorable performance as Heather Chandler - the first student to fall victim to JD's evil ways.Heathers teaches that cliches ""ain't all that"" and they are also a prime example of the nature of high school life, especially state-side.  I am maddened by the negative reviews of this film, as it truly is a classic and should not be missed! Although I am not denying that the script is a little weak and patchy in places, it truly is a masterpiece.  Many people dislike it because it is definitely ""dark"", but that is its appeal.  Too many films fall into the stereotypical ""teen movie"" mould these days, and Heathers breaks the mould and pushes at the boundaries - and succeeds!  I think people can recognise the characters in Heathers from those at their own high schools - and that is another appeal of the film.It truly is one of the best films I have ever seen. Excellent. Deserves 10/10.",Heathers

Back when it came out, I was in my early 20's with my high school years not so far behind me. I enjoyed this movie a lot! I recently watched it again and enjoyed it just as much as before. School is a difficult place in a difficult time in life. This movie is for those of us who weren't part of the ""in"" crowd at school and those passing not-so-nice thoughts we had about people like that.

Winona Ryder,Shannen Doherty and Christian Slater are all flawless. I do, however wonder what happened to the other Heathers?Actually, the movie isn't too far off the reality most people experience in High School...of course, in a Reader's Digest condensed version.If I'm feeling cynical and down...I just put my DVD in and have a good laugh!Enjoy!",Heathers
251,kevingamin,Where did Christian Slater go???,8,12 January 2004,"It's hard to believe that Christian Slater's breakout role as Jason ""J.D."" Dean in Heathers was almost 15 years ago.  It's also amazing how well he pulled off his take on Jack Nicholson and psycho characters.  Of course, when you look around, Christian Slater has all but fallen off the face of the earth.  I haven't seen him since his two-minute cameo as a Starfleet officer reporting to George Takei's Captain Sulu in Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country, and that was in the early 90's.  I can't remember if Murder in the First was before or after that little spot.As to the movie itself, it definitely falls under the category of cult classic.  Very 80's, very much a cross between social commentary and satire about that commentary with plenty of comedy and surrealism thrown in for good measure.  An interesting feature from the DVD of Heathers is a screenplay of the original ending where Winona Ryder's Veronica kills J.D. in the boiler room, then takes his bomb and blows herself up outside the school.  The original ending finishes with what seems like a dream-like school prom where all the cliques of the school break out of their molds and dance and mingle with each other.  This includes all the characters who died during the movie.  Apparently, the powers that be felt this ending would have been too dark for the teen audience of the time.  I'd actually have to agree, although it would have fit in with the strangeness of the movie in general.Another little tidbit:  Shannon Doherty as one of the Heather characters BEFORE she hit it big with 90210.",Heathers
252,aleavellx,A teen murder spree in small town Ohio is more than what it seems,8,1 October 2012,"Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio is the setting for the majority of the movie, but represents so much more than the average school. In many ways, it represents the rest of the world and the type of society that fills it. The social hierarchy in the school is ever-present, such as it is in the real world. The cliques and varying types of people that occupy the school could be considered a fairly accurate representation of the population. The message that the setting delivers is that no matter what tragedy may occur, life goes on and only the people filling the hierarchy change, not the hierarchy itself.Jason Dean seems to be the embodiment of chaos, doing whatever it takes to wake ""society"" up from the everyday, mundane routine. On the opposite side of that comparison, his name indicates an obvious similarity to James Dean, and even tries to portray himself as the stereotypical rebel, complete with black jacket and motorcycle. Even during an altercation with Veronica, she states that although he considers himself a rebel, he's purely psychotic. JD also shows the traits of his father, who appears to be half crazed and obsessed with destruction. A parallel seen is the story of JD's mother, who may have killed herself in an attempt to escape her husband, and the way Veronica stages her own suicide to ""escape"" from JD's threats. The cigarette stands as an important object for Veronica. In the beginning of the movie, she seems fairly innocent, even to the point of being unable to hold her liquor. The first instance we see is when she and JD meet at the Snack Stop, she sticks a Twizzler in her mouth as they begin to talk, signifying the potential change in character that's about to occur. After they commit the second murder, Veronica attempts to smoke a cigarette but instead drops it from her mouth and burns her hand instead. Finally, at the end of the movie, when she has finally come to terms with killing someone voluntarily, she smokes a cigarette fully. Her inability to actually smoke is an indication that she isn't entirely ready, or more so able, to commit an act. When she is ready to kill JD, she smokes the cigarette with satisfaction, as if she is finally content with the way things have become.Winona Ryder portrays Veronica in a fairly realistic way, even when the rest of the characters around her seem to be taken to extremes. She shows a fairly wide range of emotions and inner conflicts to the action taking place, rather than diving head first into a murder spree as JD would prefer to do. We see her remorse, her shock, and her anger. Even more importantly, we see her slow transition into coming to terms with murdering. As the murders progress, each time she becomes slowly accustomed to it, and shows the appropriate mix of conflicting emotions. By the final murder, she is able to justify it to herself as necessary, whereas the others were not. Once she is able to do this, she is finally able to stand up for herself against Heather Duke and do what she really wishes, signaling a character breakthrough. In today's society,where constant communication, reality television, video games and social media prevail, it can easily affect the meaning taken away from this movie. The violence seen was graphic and fairly explicit for someone who doesn't usual view material that contains such subjects. Although it was enjoyable, it affected me more than it may others since I have chosen not to be exposed to similar content, therefore not being desensitized to it. In addition, this movie was different than anything I have ever seen before, with the dysfunctional humor and sudden action keeping me on the edge of my seat and thoroughly entertained. Past the entertainment factor, it was harder for me to find meanings in the small details since I haven't become accustomed to similar movie styles. I began getting caught up in the action of the movie rather than the meaning, so a second viewing was required. I had to look closer for trends between the dialogue and character traits, but had a small amount of success finding the overall themes and symbols of the film the first time through. Made in 1988, most popular movies of the era were the opposite of ""Heathers."" With John Hughes prevailing on the movie scene, it is easy to fool the younger generation, including myself, into thinking that all movies from the 1980's are similar to that of ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Pretty in Pink,"" or even ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" These movies are all filled with lighter themes and satirical humor that crosses the lines and bleeds into the other movies, blending them into one monochrome esque genre. Next to these films, ""Heathers"" is a drastic switch to the extreme reality that can be found in teens; complete with grotesque violence and unprecedented angst. If all 80's movies are stereotyped into those like ""Weird Science,"" where everything is wrapped up neatly at the end of the day, ""Heathers"" leaves a smoking trail of destruction that is a warning of what not only teenagers, but society is capable of. Overall, ""Heathers"" isn't just about a teen murder spree, but it is a representation of the social hierarchy in life and the difference between the strong and weak.",Heathers
253,Magenta_Antoid,Not at all impressed,3,6 January 2019,"First off, I thought the acting by Slater (who played JD) was poor. His poor acting was one of the first things I noticed actually.Some people say the movie is corny on purpose but to me it just came off as corny in a bad way, and not convincing. Yes, there were lines (quite a few, in fact) that were funny and I laughed, but I struggled to understand what the movie was really trying to say or why the things that were happening were happening. Is the point of the movie really to make fun of teens who kill themselves, as if it's something funny and not to be taken seriously? I think it's very bad taste to make a satire out of that. It's like the movie is saying if someone commits suicide, they were just stupid and seeking attention and you can ignore them! I think that's actually very cruel.The caricatured ""hippy"" teacher was also in bad taste and not realistic. One of my main problems with the movie might actually just be how unrealistic everything is. No one would ever be so unaffected (like the main character) by realizing they've just killed someone, it doesn't make sense that a guy (JD) would go around killing people for no particular reason, or that no one would find the deaths suspicious, and I could go on and on. I would add that the idea that teen suicides and ""angst"" in general are inexplicable and funny is a bad message.To me this movie was almost as bad as ""Natural Born Killers"", which I disliked for similar reasons (suggesting that people commit murder just for fun rather than looking at what some of the actual explanations might be). Yes, I laughed at ""eskimo"" and a few other parts, but overall this movie left me confused and unimpressed. I find it genuinely hard to believe that it gets such almost universally positive reviews.Also, I don't just have a general aversion to black comedy. I liked The Voices for example. For me the message in ""Heathers"" is either very badly portrayed or just mean and harmful. I gave it a three out of ten because it wasn't so bad that I got bored or had to stop watching, and there were some enjoyable moments, despite the overall cringiness and lack of direction.",Heathers
254,lebeker,Unfortunate template,10,17 October 2018,"I writing this on a day of another tragedy. When a some another one depressed youngster blowed up & shoot dozens of his classmates and then himself.All such stories remind something like this film. The trivia almost perfectly match: Nobody loves me, The world is wrong, I'll show them!The film 20y old, and still hit the points of modern problems in society, and especially if it's about teens.
Film perfectly underscores existing issues, without any veils, straight and directly. And some cites of the heroes can be put as a clean example.
For instance when you try to think about teens teasing and being easy to manipulate, check a scene phrase, when it's talked about cup of bleach:
""Think I'll drink a cup just because you called me a chicken?! Oh,.. just give me a cup.""
Or the point about overall indifference. When person so overweighted with personal problems that tragedies became not more than a newspaper title:
""I must say I was impressed to see that she made proper use of the word 'myriad' in a suicide note"".And unfortunately words of one of the main characters really sounds like true:
""Nobody loves me... Let's face the truth, the only place where everyone can genuinely get along with each other is heaven!""It's not the first, and sure not the last film on this thematics (school violence), but I honestly think, that it's the best.

This movie made me laugh so hard that I thought I couldn't breath! I am a huge fan of Winona Ryder and when I saw this movie I thought this was her best performance ever. Her character just hated her snobby friends and how they treated other people. The person I loved the most was Christian Slater's character. He was so mysterious and hilarious. I thought he was so cute playing J.D. My favorite part in the film is in the end after J.D kills himself. Winona's character confronts Heather Duke, I thought what she said was smart and brave.

But as the film progresses, I liked how the dark humor and violence was employed to build up the tension in the plotline. In addition, Winona Ryder looked gorgeous as Veronica Sawyer.

I'm not even sure what parts were meant to be funny? This is definitely an 80's movie that did not age well.

Then, there was Heather Duke (Shannen Doherty), runner-up head-of-Heathers. Heather Duke was the sweet, quiet girl who's one flaw was her bulimia. And then, the cheerleader, Heather McNamara (Lisanne Falk). Veronica absolutely hated life as a Heather. Playing mean jokes on innocent people, having sex with practical strangers, and acting like a total bitch, just wasn't Veronica.But when Jason Dean (Christian Slater), the new kid who was a bit rebellious entered her life, things perked up a bit. When he pulls a gun out on two guys in school, Veronica doesn't really think he's too harmless. When J.D. is around, Veronica has no mind of her own, which is pretty dangerous.

I love this film so much I could watch it every day. Entertainment Weekly have placed it on # 5 in their list of best HighSchool Movies. It should be at # 1 in my opinion because teenagers and their problems have never been portrayed any better than in this movie. I own the Soundtrack CD, the Limited Tin Edition and a VHS-Copy.

Both films have an unhappy ""new guy"" who deals with bullies and vows to get revenge. After doing so and seeing others spring up in the bullies places, he decides to blow up the whole school with a bomb in the boiler room. Also, in both films, the main character decides to remove the bomb and blows himself up in front of the school. As with all remakes, a few things have been changed, but when compared, it's more than obvious that Heathers is a remake.Heathers is one of those rare films where the remake is better than the original.

JD is a bit of a bad boy and we all know that us girls love a bit of a bad boy, he takes guns to school and is a little crazy shall we say. Christian Slater plays the role perfectly, oh and by the way, I thought the start was a little slow probably cos Christian Slater wasn't in it for the first five minutes but believe me it gets a lot better as the story develops.

So Heathers is a satirical black comedy that deals with teen suicides, popularity in high schools, and ignorance of parents. Far from my favorite movie themes, but potentially the most relatable ones. Winona Ryder gives a very convincing performance as a member of the clique ""Heathers"" who possesses all the stereotypical popular girl qualities on the outside but is actually of very intelligent and contemplative nature. She gets involved with a badass new kid in school, played even more impressively by Christian Slater, who teaches her his ways of, well, ""getting rid"" of people he considers as scums of the teenage society: bullies, shallow girls, and just bitches and assholes, really. It's very interesting, but just a heads up, it's easily the most bizarre thing I've ever seen and very incoherent, though probably intentional.",Heathers

Then pretty J D suggests them simply to kill. That in vain were not go down on the transitory ground. From film carries healthy cynicism and black sense of fun. A blue plastic bottle as a hint, the cut up veins, the shot fingers, explosions, household chemical goods in ""cocktail"" — simply orgy of absurdity. From this film you do not neigh, but the unhealthy grin from time to time flies. All occurring death seriously are not perceived neither the spectator, nor students (who saw a stage of funeral in white and bespectacled 3D, that will understand). Proceeding from the name, it is logically possible to think, what exactly three girls-Heathers invented itself local queens, unless officially not crowned. But the actual stinker from them is only one which have killed the very first, Heather McNamara is almost imperceptible in the staff, thirty times will see — and will not remember. Veronica throws, being afraid to state what wants actually, (it bears out the rage on a paper) and smiling bad boy J D simply realizes its desires, let is a little original. About actors it is possible to tell at once — ball correct Christian Slater and Winona Ryder. This charisma a couple holds all film on herself. And are simply not bad looked together. Christian Slater it is characteristic enough plays cranky J Dee, and Winona Ryder represents us hammered, but yet not broken Veronica. Shannen Doherty plays a little damply and it is rough, the same Kim Walker has surpassed it in all respects. And as a whole it is more anybody to allocate it is impossible.Sneers at death and murders in the youth environment here are finished almost to Absurdity. Above one have decided to be pinned, and that take and die on seat. Others have hanged out long languages and as a result lay in a wood as two gay persons-suicides. But the most interesting, that all school chews an event, them not excites, that ringleaders were lost, as, in fact after their death all have learned about their original dignity And the unfortunate Veronica, hoped to revenge for their jeers, stirs legs for a rage and again rushes to the unhealthy knight. However, one step at a time itself understands, that the event runs away. The girl that not understanding, crosses treasured feature and in a critical instant tries to give I tear up back. And here the end of film dynamical, even very much. To whom it was necessary — those have survived, someone has rejected skates, well and Veronica has learned to make of the decision and hardly will allow someone to break itself. It still will allow to light to this world.

It is the most intelligent, well-written, sarcastic and witty commentary on American high school-aged youth to date.  I pull this film out of my collection every 6 months or so and watch it again.  The dialog is memorable and the situations, though hyperbolized, show just how cruel teenagers can be. Winona Ryder and Christian Slater especially shine.

277,rarguijoiii,Heathers Morbid Yet Playful,8,1 October 2012,"Remember back in high school those girls that everyone loved to hate? Remember how attractive, stylish, and seemingly perfect they were? If you had a chance to change anything, or say something to them, or even exact revenge on them, would you? Michael Lehmann's Heathers successfully captures all of that teen angst in a suburban Ohio high school ridden with cliques, social anarchist, and of course, that typical 1980's triad of beautiful, but wicked, teenage girls.Tapping into the social tensions and following in the footsteps of other 1980's teen comedies such as Sixteen Candles, Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire, Heathers triumphantly marks the end of the, ""Pop-culture obsessed, big haired, and clique driven,"" 1980's. Offering classic one-liners like, ""Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?"" and, ""She was my best friend and worst enemy,"" Heathers, while not being a box office smash, successfully established itself as a cult classic within the era. In surprising contrast with the other 1980's film, Heathers opted out of the overdone and predictable happy ending. The film breaks that mold by offering what I loving refer to as a ""Crazy psychotic ending."" There was no movie-ending kiss, riding off into the sunset, or the good guy ends up with the girl here. Director Lehhman instead decides to take Heathers out in a blaze of glory, literally. Not only does Veronica kill her friends, she ends up killing her boyfriend while saving the whole school. My favorite parts of the movie are the scenes of the girls playing a ""friendly"" game of croquet. The director's metaphor about croquet is genius. The metaphor is simple; cliques of high school girls' crash together constantly, just like the balls in a croquet game. It is up to the leader of the clique to ruin other competition clique's lives, or simply forgive them, much like how a player can choose to knock their competition off the course, or take a second shot. While not immediately apparent, this is the most iconic scene that is often recreated in movies. For example, the film Mean Girls, which could be the younger cousin of Heathers, has the, ""plastics."" Much like Heathers, Mean Girls has three popular girls that talk very similarly like the Heathers did. In addition, the main Heather normally wore a bow to distinguish herself from the other two. While the bow was pretty, the Heather was vicious. This also occurs in Mean Girls by their use of wearing pink, which represents a more feminine and cute color, but in reality the girls were also vicious.Lastly, what would a 1980's Teen movie be without the dreamy man? Thus cues our love interest J.D. Equipped with mystery, dark hair, and an irresistible smirk, this suave character makes all of Veronica's imaginations a frightening reality. Running his hands through his hair, subtly tilting his head, and flashing his pearly white smile are all it takes for Veronica to swoon into homicidal acts. Then again, what teenage girl would ever imagine turning down Christian Slater? Heathers is one of the darkest comedies that I have watched. It made me look inside myself and wonder,"" Have I ever had those thought? Could I kill my friends?"" Maybe, we all have a little Veronica, J.D., and Heather in us after all.",Heathers
278,kinglear18,Veronica was really the one in second command after Heather Chandler,10,10 May 2006,"I was thinking about how when Veronica says someone will move in and take Heather Duke's place, just like Heather Duke took Heather Chandler's place. But technically, wouldn't Veronica have been the next in line to replace Heather Chandler, because Veronica is stronger than Heather Duke and Heather McNamara, and the one that Heather Chandler confided in the most. For instance, when Veronica comforts Heather Duke when she was throwing up in the bathroom, this scene shows that Heather Duke's weaker than Veronica. And in the later scene when Heather McNamara tries to overdose on pills, Veronica stops her. This shows that Heather McNamara is weaker than Veronica. So this brings to mind the question: did Heather Duke immediately take Heather Chandler's place because the position was open, and Heather Duke wanted the position so badly? And that being so, is it true that Heather Chandler's position was clearly open to Veronica, but Veronica had no desire to take Heather Chandler's position. The fact that Heather Duke pounces on the chance to be Heather Chandler shows how much Heather Duke lacks her own personality. Heather McNamara seemed to have hope and that's why she and Veronica were the truest of friends. Heather McNamara seemed to be Veronica's truest friend next to Betty Finn.",Heathers

281,nick-848,Best teen comedy ever.,10,5 April 2005,"Daniel Waters wrote one of the best satires ever in ""Heathers"", a dark comedy that ranks right up there with ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Network"". Certainly it's the best teen comedy ever made. Why? Because in spite of its highly stylized depiction of teenagers, it caught the truest essence of what high school is actually like in America. Not only that, it trashed the entire genre and-- in a feat of sheer genius-- even the *reaction* to the genre by outside observers (namely parents). Terry Southern could have done no better.""Westerburg high school self-destructed not *because* of society but because Westerburg High School *was* society"" was restated, to near-universal praise, by Michael Moore in ""Bowling For Columbine"", but Waters said it before him, said it better, and frankly he's got a lot more credibility (""Hudson Hawk"" notwithstanding). The cast is brilliant, even if, strangely, some of them don't seem to get what the whole movie was about. You half expect that most of the cast and crew, like the kids who sign a petition to bring Big Fun to the school for a gig, made a movie they didn't know they were making. But the key figures nailed it-- Ryder and Slater were never better.""Heathers"" is one of the best films of the Eighties-- put the lid on the Eighties, as it were. It has suffered criminal neglect, probably because it may have required an ""indie auteur"" to really knock the cinematic elements out of the park. The direction is competent but unspectacular. Still, the star is the writing, and Waters deserved an Oscar for this script. Unsentimental, vicious, and above all hilariously funny, he drove a stake through the heart of those oh-so-precious John Hughes films and, at the same time, set the stage for Kevin Williamson and all the rest. He did it with a perfect ear for dialogue combined with a Swiftian vision of social structures, and did it all as an argument *against* ironic detachment, for which this film and its messages needs to be revisited now more than ever.

Director Michael Lehmann revels in Daniel Waters' script, contrasting spectacular use of vivid colour with a real darkness to the story. Unlike other teen movies, which generally patronise and classify their subject matter, this movie celebrates them and displays their intelligence and the harshness of the realities of high school.

286,monadorinabruno,"Croquet, Pâté, and Teen Suicide??",7,10 November 2016,"If high school hierarchies with a dash of pyromania sounds like your kind of movie, look no further than ""Heathers"" (Michael Lehmann, 1988): a classic 80s movie with a murderous twist. Not to be fooled by the title, the film centers on Winona Ryder who is most enchanting as Veronica, a witty member of the popular social group nick-named The Heathers. Veronica's high IQ is wasted on finding keggers, that is until she meets darkhorse JD (Christian Slater) who teaches her a different way to survive the social perils of high school. Stylistically, ""Heathers"" feels like watching a John Hughes film on cough syrup. There is a hazy, dreamlike quality to the film, particularly notable in the opening sequence where the ""the Heathers"" are playing croquet and Veronica is depicted as the ball getting pounded on. For an evening eerie of high school drama, be sure to watch ""Heathers""- it will not disappoint.",Heathers
287,cherrylipsbrunette,Heathers is awesome!!!!,10,24 February 2006,"I've seen this movie a million times and i cant get enough of it!!!The lines are absolutely hilarious covered by a veil of sarcasm and black humor all the way through.The use of language is really something unforgettable.Christian Slater is fantastic as JD and Wynona Ryder is made for the part.Shannen Doherty who later on became famous as ""Brenda"" in Beverley Hills makes one of her first notable appearances here as well ...I should also mention that this film was regular on Greek TV -a few years ago-after midnight of course...By the way ""did u have a brain tumor for breakfast?""...Absolutely hilarious... Don't miss it!!!",Heathers
288,opacidk,How Very,10,7 January 2019,"A biting satire of the John Hughes movies of 80d teenagers and how high schoolers mimic adult society in the form of cliques. I know not everyone will like this movie, but if you're going to criticize it, understand what you're criticizing.",Heathers
289,bex_erika89,Fantastic,10,26 June 2006,"I absolutely love Heathers it is the best black comedy I've ever seen, its truly dark and hilariously funny. The innocently wild talents of Winona Ryder combined with the rugged yet to die for Christian Slater corroborate to paint an embarrassingly realistic picture of the threats and angst of teenage life and erupt in the gloriousness of a masterpiece. A film that reaches beyond the limits of accepted cinema custom that pulses with the true horror of what it means to be a teenage girl trapped in the school environment plagued by peer pressure and the inevitable twisting of the sweet nature when one encounters one who will change the world, flip it upside down and alter reality to 'rock your world'. Heathers rages with emotion which will touch unveiled emotions for a very long time. A must see for anyone who likes any films in general",Heathers
290,jbaker232,"Unique, thought-provoking, but ultimately in poor taste",4,20 February 2018,"I was drawn to this movie after watching Wynona Ryder's role in Stranger Things. I knew nothing about it before watching, assuming it was some sort of John Hughes-ish teen comedy. A few minutes in, I realized it was actually a surprisingly dark, surreal, violent movie. The comical approach to violence and suicide is jarring and a bit weird. I appreciated how it explored the parallels between high school and society at large. I understood that the deaths were symbolic of societal breakdowns representing what it means to be a good human being.Ultimately, taken in the context of recent school shootings, I feel the film has not aged well. It comes across as insensitive, homophobic, and vulgar. The way it seemingly normalized violence left me disgusted. Aside from the acting and cinematography, which I think were subpar, the plot and vibe of the film are just wrong. It straddles the line of comedy and social commentary, never leaning enough to one side and leaving the audience wondering, ""are they serious?""",Heathers
