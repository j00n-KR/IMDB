0,Leofwine_draca,"Not bad, but could have been so much more",6,10 February 2014,"Originally conceived as THE SHINING in space, by the end I think EVENT HORIZON has become more like HELLRAISER in space, although of course one of the later HELLRAISER movies was just that. This is an intriguing and interesting sci-fi/horror movie that initially feels like an ALIEN clone before becoming something else quite different.The problem is that the story is sadly flawed, spending too much time on all-too-familiar situations and not enough time on the true horror envisaged by the screenwriter. It seems to take the crew an age to get to their destination, and even when stuff is finally happening, the ending is quite choppy. Apparently, 20 minutes of violent footage were excised after a poor reaction from the test audience, which I think is a real shame.Another problem lies in the choice of director Paul W. S. Anderson, who is and has been one of the worst directors working in Hollywood in recent years. This and DEATH RACE are the only films I truly like of his, and even in these two movies his direction is poor and over the top. The laboured comic relief is particularly noticeable here.It's a pity, because the story has real potential, with undertones of Clive Barker and H. P. Lovecraft on occasion. The cast is decent too, with nice performances from the reliable Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, as well as turns from the underrated Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs. I hope that an extended director's cut may surface one day and add more to the experience.",Event Horizon
1,SnoopyStyle,sci-fi haunted ship horror had potential,6,8 August 2015,"The first permanent moon base is established in 2015 and commercial mining on Mars begins in 2032. In 2040, research vessel Event Horizon is launched. It disappears past Neptune. In 2047, spaceship Lewis and Clark is sent to investigate. The crew consists of Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), Medical Technician Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Engineer Ensign Justin (Jack Noseworthy), Rescue Technician Cooper (Richard T. Jones), and Trauma Doctor D.J. (Jason Isaacs). Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) joins them and tells the crew about its innovative gravity drive.The design is interesting and this has the potential to be a pretty good sci-fi horror. This is essentially a haunted house but the chaos overwhelms the movie. Sam Neill doesn't really fit as the mad scientist type. That role needs somebody creepier. Captain Miller is too clueless. In fact, Starck is a smarter character and in a better movie, she would be revealed as the lead. This movie has a great cast, an interesting look and great potential. It's too bad that it's not actually that good.",Event Horizon
2,kosmasp,"Bad, bad, bad ... or in one word: Bad!",5,23 April 2006,"Now for this ""special"" movie, that I watched theatrically, I will specify in various paragraphs, what I didn't like about the movie. When I went to watch the movie, I didn't thought it would be a classic. But boy if I knew how bad it was/is I wouldn't bothered to go in at all.Let's start from the actors. And if I didn't knew the actors I'd be wondering where they had found those people (maybe they dragged someone in from the street?). But there is an explanation: Sam Neill & Co are humans too and they need the money. To pay bills and stuff. But even they must be ashamed of this. And they didn't even bother to act at all! Not that it would have elevated this movie to much better ranking place, but it might have been a little more pleasant to watch. Or at least they could have tried to have while shooting the movie, but even that wasn't possible (it seems that way if you watch the movie).But the actors are not the ones responsible for this mess. First of all you have to ask yourself if the scriptwriter had anything in mind except ""a cool idea""! Because the outline did sound quite good. But when you have so much plot holes in a movie ... you just wish it is over. For the movie and the characters! You just don't care for people who act irrational and only just about compete who'll say the worst line in the movie. Irrational ""acting"" is something that you are used to in horror movies (most of the thrill will happen, just because of that behavior), but what happens here is just about every bad cliché thrown in. And mixed together, they don't taste any good, and they also smell bad too! But a bad script can be helped by a good director. If there was one here at hand ... If if if ... but there was none. Quite the contrary, this one (director) isn't good, but he's bad! So he let all of the above happen and more. When people have a bad thing happening and then just jump out the next moment as if nothing happened, you're not only confused, but more than a bit angry. Mass delusion anyone? It must've been something in the tea or coffee!Talking about something, like you don't believe it exists, just to be afraid of the same thing that doesn't ""exist"" the next second ... at least that's what the script lines were that came out the actors mouth ... (you didn't get it? Neither did I while watching the movie!) It's just so f**'d up ... I get mad thinking about it ... The movie touched a nerve. And one things for sure, if I ever do something bad again, something real bad, I shall be punished with watching this movie along ""Kinetta"" ... But if you're a masochist, you can do that in your free time too ... I warned you! But if you don't want to waste your time, just don't watch this ""classic""! (and yes I knew that some people will be offended by this, those same people who think this movie is good. Can't believe it, but some people just seem to enjoy the formula bad acting/bad director/bad script ... knock yourself out!)Edit: Wow. I really went to town on this one. This really hit a nerve as I say above. But since I was convinced I should give this another chance, I did just that. First thing I realized is the CGI. It did not age well at all. I'm saying this especially for those embarking on this journey for the first time! Be aware of it! That's all.I don't want to censor or redact my above statement or change it, but I want to elaborate. I really do like all the actors involved, I just think the script did not do anything to help them. This sounds already more mellow and more in tune with what I usually do when reviewing a movie I reckon. And that's I went up on the rating a bit. I still don't think this is anywhere near something like Alien or other movies that do earn the term classic. But I've seen way worse movies. Technically speaking and from other standpoints too.So overall I did not change my opinion on this being overrated and unfortunately having a better central idea than what we get served. One thing I do want to apologize for, is how I spoke to and about fans of this movie. Guessing I was a bit angry about bad responses I got to my review, but I should never shame anyone for their taste or opinion. It's a film after all, if you were able to enjoy it, good for you and I mean it",Event Horizon
3,Sleepin_Dragon,A very atmospheric space horror.,8,17 October 2017,"The crew of a small ship set off into deep space to recapture the Event Horizon, a ship that's been to some dark places in Space. On that ship is Event Horizon creator Doctor Weir, and when the crew get trapped on board the Event Horizon they face some horrific events.The movie is incredibly atmospheric, even after all these years it holds up very well, the ship looks great, well designed with strong production values. The music is particularly good, again adding to the sense of fear. Soon good special effects, sure it rattles a little around the edges, but it was made back in 1997. There isn't a reliance on gore, as there are with so many current films, although it does contain some rather grim scenes.I'm a big fan of Joseph Richardson, but she somehow looks and feels a little out of place in a sci-fi movie, I don't buy into her. Definite star of the show is Sam Neill who is definitely a cut above, he's cool and menacing.I'm surprised at just how much I enjoyed watching it once again. 8/10",Event Horizon
4,gavin6942,Not Your Typical Space Horror Movie,7,11 March 2007,"A doctor who designed the ship and a crew of rescuers are sent to pick up the crew from the space vessel Event Horizon, off the orbit of Neptune. What the rescuers don't know, however, is that the ship is powered by a black hole and is capable of opening portals to other planets or maybe even dimensions. What might have come through?It seems appropriate I chose to watch this after ""Snow White"", the OTHER 1997 Sam Neill horror film (but he's more like the Neill from ""In the Mouth of Madness"" here than the Neill from ""Snow White""). Never a bad time to catch two connected movies back to back.I can't help but compare this film to other Paul Anderson films such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Mortal Kombat"". There is a distinct look he is good at with technology and particularly the costumes. While I doubt Anderson designed the costumes, you get a sense he likes characters with jumpsuits. If I had to guess who directed this film without knowing, Anderson would be my first guess based on his scenery alone.Paul Anderson also loves the techno-industrial music in his films (Orbital, The Prodigy, KMFDM) -- he's like a more lighthearted David Fincher in this way. I grew up on industrial music, so this really works for me. But also, I see metal or more specifically industrial crucial to good horror -- to really make the point, see Charlie Clouser's contributions to ""Saw II"". The whole violence and alienation vibe that is given off by industrial is very appropriate to horror.The film in general is very likable. Sam Neill is an amazing actor, Laurence Fishbourne (after being Cowboy Curtis but before being Morpheus) is wonderful. And there's a sense of gore that is more hinted at than shown (most of the gore scenes are very quick, leaving an impression on your mind for you to create your own imagery). Many horror space movies are just really stupid (do I need to mention ""Leprechaun in Space""?) or follow the same paths, but this one really stands out as unique. It needed both the horror and space aspects to work.I could compare this to ""Doom"" (the game or the movie) with the portal to Hell in space... but I won't. Or how about comparing it to ""Solaris"" (George Clooney's only bad film) with the images of dead friends coming back to life? This is vastly superior, by far. Really, I can't stress enough how awful ""Solaris"" is. The inclusion of the tesseract is really great. I don't think they used the word ""tesseract"", but they used the idea. I grew up with ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and another book about tesseracts (or, more precisely, wormholes since ""tesseract"" just illustrates extra dimensions and not so much how to travel through them) and this always gets me pumped. If such things are really possible, the future will be awesome.Well, anyway, if you're looking for a horror film that's unlike all others you've seen -- but good -- this is a wise choice. Sam Neill cannot steer you wrong, and the elements needed for a good movie are in place here. It's not like the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror, but maybe the ""Jurassic Park"" of horror. Check it out.",Event Horizon
5,lee_eisenberg,makes no sense,4,18 April 2006,"""Event Horizon"" is the sort of movie that could have come out very neat. Granted, there have been a number of movies about a mission in outer space finding something unusual, but they still could have done something interesting with it.Well, guess what? They tried to do something interesting with it, and the movie ended up making little sense. For starters, the whole part about bending space was clearly ripped off from Madeline L'Engle's novel ""A Wrinkle in Time"". But even beyond that, there was so much that they could have done that they didn't do.All in all, we can affirm that although the director has a name similar to the director of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", it's clearly a different person. And it goes without saying that Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill and Kathleen Quinlan have all done much better than this. Jason Isaacs would later do better as Lucius Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" movies.",Event Horizon
6,jboothmillard,Event Horizon,5,21 July 2015,"Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Pompeii), I had heard about this film many times, I knew it was sc-fi horror, and I knew one or two names in the cast, so I was hoping it would be something I'd like. Basically in the year 2047, humanity has successfully colonised on the Moon and other planets, and starships have managed to travel and venture deeper into space than ever before, one such ship was the ""Event Horizon"", an experimental government starship, but it mysteriously disappeared seven years ago going beyond the planet Neptune, this loss was considered the worst space disaster on record. However a distress signal was picked up that appeared to come from the Event Horizon, so an astronaut crew on the rescue vessel ""Lewis and Clark"" has been dispatched to investigate, salvage and rescue any living survivors on the ship, they are led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), and guided by the Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). The Lewis and Clark crew consists of Executive Officer Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), Medical Technician Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Engineer Ensign Justin (Jack Noseworthy), Rescue Technician Cooper (Richard T. Jones) and Trauma Doctor D.J. (Jason Isaacs). The ship is found in deep space, the crew manage to dock with it, but with limited supply of oxygen and increasing carbon dioxide they do not have long to find out what happened to the ship and its crew, it is not long though until the rescuing crew members realise the unimaginable and terrifying secrets lie within the ship. One by one each crew member experiences what is either a hallucination or an apparition that messes with their minds and causes them to panic or go mad, and it is all caused by a gateway, created on the ship to reach other places in space and time, but something was opened that has caused chaos for anyone that dares to venture in. Also starring Peter Marinker as Captain John Kilpack, Holley Chant as Claire and Barclay Wright as Denny Peters. This is obviously a B-movie, full of big names in the cast, but produced with a moderate budget, there are some good special effects and gory moments to satisfy the fans of things nasty, but the dialogue and storyline is rather hammy, and it is often predictable, but if you like to see things going wrong in space and many people going mad thinking they are seeing things, then I suppose it's not a bad science-fiction horror. Worth watching!",Event Horizon
7,ccthemovieman-1,Looked Slick But Turned Out To Be No 'Alien',5,7 January 2007,"Once I started watching, In some respects, this film started to remind me of ""Alien,"" except it obviously wound up quite a bit inferior to that famous sci-fi-horror thriller.Since it was made about 18 years after ""Alien,"" this movie features more special-effects and some high-tech visuals but it doesn't have the suspense nor the overall cinematography nor the cohesive storyline of the latter. Both movies have the same crude, profane, low-class astronauts that you would never see in real life. In this film, the characters are not quite as hard-edged.Slick-looking as this in spots, it still succumbs to a problem prevalent in modern-day action movies: too much action, especially at the end of the film. Also, there is too much gore and too many unbelievable escapes. In the end, this is another of those movies that ""should have been better.""",Event Horizon
8,Tweekums,A disturbing sci-fi horror,8,13 November 2012,"The Spaceship 'Event Horizon' disappeared near Neptune while on a classified mission to test a new drive system that could make interstellar travel a possibility; seven years later a broadcast was received and the rescue ship 'Lewis and Clark'. This ship's regular crew has been joined by Dr. Weir; the designer of the 'Event Horizon' and the only person to know the nature of the ship's revolutionary drive system; it uses a singularity to fold space enabling it to pass between two points almost instantly. Strange things start to happen once they arrive; scanners show lifeforms everywhere on the 'Event Horizon' and once aboard the crew start having strange visions of people they once knew; dead people! It would appear that that when the gateway opened for its test flight to Proxima Centauri it went somewhere on the way; a place of pure chaos and evil; for want of a better word Hell itself! By the time the crew realises something is wrong; it isn't a question of whether they whether get away alive it is a question of whether any of them will survive.This sci-fi horror deserves to be better known; there may not be an alien aboard the ship but the strange presence is just as frightening; especially when the crew have visions that involve eyeless loved ones. For a film that isn't that well known it has a surprisingly strong cast of well known actors including Lawrence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee amongst the crew; they all put in solid performances although it is Sam Neill who puts in the most memorable performance as Dr. Weir; a character that becomes more dangerous as time passes; whether he is going insane or becoming possessed by the evil controlling the ship is hard to say. They is a lot of disturbing imagery here; both when we see what happened to the old crew of the 'Event Horizon' and when things start going bad for the rescue team; if you don't like the sight of blood you'd best give this a miss but if you want a genuinely creepy sci-fi horror you could do a lot worse.",Event Horizon
9,ma-cortes,Sci-Fi/horror film with creepy images and eerie events when a motley crew investigates a rare aircraft,6,1 April 2012,"A rescue team investigates a spaceship called ¨Event Horizon¨ that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned , re-establishing contact after 25 years lost in cosmos , but now , 2047 , with someone or something new on-board . The vessel has been sent to salvage and pick up survivors and discover strange deeds . This frightening Sci-Fi movie concerns about some crack astronauts being trapped into a claustrophobic space aircraft . This is a spectacular and moving story full of twists and turns ; however being pretty claustrophobic , though this is never tiring . It starts with some astronauts wake up from pods , they are captained by Laurence Fishburne and accompanied by scientific Sam Neill . One of them goes to explore the zone and encounters an extraordinary surprise . Meanwhile , they meet new mysteries hidden throughout the aircraft and attempting to survive . They then encounter themselves chased by bloodthirsty , predatory visions which have haunted them . They must confront some of the most horrifying spectres ever seen and some has been decimating the crew . The survivor group is surrounded , as they encounter horrible visions that are waiting for them , facing their destruction and exposed to cruel dangers . They undertake a desperate fighting to survive and confronting each other .This exciting picture contains thrills , chills , plot twists, action-filled and lots of gore and guts . The terror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized enhanced by excellent special effects by the expert Richard Yuricich . The film turns out to be a crossover between old-fashioned ghost terror yarn and modern horror/Sci-Fi film taking ideas here and there , resulting in a fine movie . And of course the theme of people being stranded in a hostile, perilous space environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of Alien . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames that creates horror piles on horror . It's predictable but also its predictability is redeemed for some extraordinary surprises and in part by the charismatic acting from the main protagonists as Fishburne , Sam Neill and large support cast as Richard T Jones , Jason Isaacs , Sean Pertwee , Kathleen Quinlan , Joely Richardson and Noseworthy . The shapeless evil hovers , phantoms appearance deliver the goods , plenty of screams, shocks and tension . The make-up artist as Rob Bottin and assistants create the truly terrible images . Horrifying and astonishing frames about eerie events with deserted and threatening corridors , walls drips blood , Gothic halls as well as the creepy scenarios in the large spacial craft without barely people and covered of metal and iron . Cool , dark cinematography by Adran Biddle who creates a perfect atmosphere and haunting musical score fitting to action and horror by Michael Kamen .The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Brit filmmaker Paul W. S. Anderson in his third film , his first was ¨Shopping¨ . He is a notorious producer , writer and director of Sci-Fi , some super-productions as ¨Resident Evil¨ saga, ¨Alien Vs Predator¨ , ¨Soldier¨ , ¨Mortal combat¨ and recently a fantastic ¨Three musketeers¨.",Event Horizon
10,BA_Harrison,A haunted house in space.,7,16 February 2012,"Event Horizon is set in the near future aboard a massive spacecraft in low-level orbit above Neptune, but at its heart, the film is nothing more than a haunted house movie given a sci-fi twist: the creepy spaceship is the film's Gothic mansion, the echoey walkways and ducts are its dusty rooms and wood-panelled corridors, the search and rescue team are its travellers seeking shelter for the night, Neptune's turbulent atmosphere is its raging thunderstorm, and rather than being built over a gateway to hell, the craft itself is the gateway, its high-tech drive capable of punching a hole into another dimension where chaos and evil reigns.So, obvious sci-fi trappings such as zero gravity and suspended animation aside, it's tried and tested scares all the way, with hellish visions and supernatural shocks aplenty as director Paul W.S. Anderson skillfully lays on the atmosphere and gory horror. Anderson spoils matters somewhat in the film's closing minutes with an ill-considered finalé that sees one character blown into space by a huge explosion, but somehow surviving the blast to navigate his way back to the spaceship and intervene at a crucial moment, thus saving the day for token spunky female Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson). This rather daft ending almost saw me reducing my rating for Event Horizon from a 7 down to a 6, but the build up was so good that I am prepared to be forgiving.",Event Horizon
11,paul_haakonsen,An atmospheric sci-fi horror with a punch...,6,22 April 2021,"I just sat down to watch the 1997 horror sci-fi movie ""Event Horizon"" from writer Philip Eisner for the third time. It had been years since last I watched it, and as I had the chance again, of course I delved back into the depths of space in some really good company.This movie's cast ensemble is just spectacular. It has the likes of Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne, Richard T. Jones, Jack Noseworthy, Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee on the cast list; to mention a handful of these actors and actresses. They were nicely cast for their individual roles and characters, and they put on great performances, which really helped to carry the story.Director Paul W. S. Anderson did a good job at bringing the storyline and script to life on the big screen.The storyline told in ""Event Horizon"" is one that definitely makes for an entertaining and enjoyable movie experience. The movie starts out slow, but director Paul W. S. Anderson quickly brings things into gear and manages to build on layer upon layer of suspense. There is a very distinct feel to the movie; one that captures the loneliness and desolation of outer space. And at the same time, the ever-building and slowly amassing sense of dread and general creepiness definitely also added so much atmosphere to the movie.The downside to ""Event Horizon"" is the character gallery. I feel that the characters in the movie were a bit too superficial and felt a bit like cardboard cut-outs. I was missing a more in-depth background and motivation for the characters, as it would have added just more of a dimension to the movie. When people die in the storyline, it is merely met with a shrug from me as an audience, as I haven't really connected or bonded with the characters. And I also would have liked a bit more hesitation and struggle to give into the illusions that they experience aboard the derelict vessel; because highly trained space personnel here seems to just buckle and cave in to their own needs and desires on a mere whim.Visually then ""Event Horizon"" is still passable, though the effects are starting to show signs of aging. But they are still good enough, and actually still surpasses the effects in some newer sci-fi movies, however scary that fact may be.Now, ""Event Horizon"" is a movie that actually have enough contents to it and meat on its bones to support more than a single viewing. I've seen it three times so far since 1997, and the movie is still an enjoyable one to watch.My rating of ""Event Horizon"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Event Horizon
12,Quinoa1984,so good at points that it's a shame when it isn't near the end,6,29 October 2016,"This is another of those movies I saw in pieces on TV, which frankly isn't giving Event Horizon enough of its due. It's probably the only Paul WS Anderson movie I can think of that truly deserves your attention to be WATCHED from start to finish, not looking away, not distracted, because it is aiming to be a serious science fiction movie, with some horror elements. And finally seeing it from start to finish I came to the conclusion that, yes, it is Anderson's best... and at the same time it also has derivative aspects, not inherently negative against the movie per-say, and a clever concept (a space ship that takes the emotional readings of its occupants and proceeds to f***-up and/or kill its inhabitants), but near the end it falls apart not so much in script but in execution.So, this is good. At times, it's very good. The set-up is a mixture of, to me, Alien AND Aliens, to varying degrees (and maybe, as Roger Ebert reminded me of in his review, Solaris): Doctor Sam Neill is on a mission to go back to a vessel he had a major part in shaping, the Event Horizon, which has gone past the reach of central space command or whatnot in the orbit of Neptune, and he has made the crew of the Lewis & Clark, led by Captain Laurence Fishburne and including crew such as Jason Isaacs and Joely Richardson, to go with him to find it and what happened to the crew of the ship (there's a recording that sounds extremely distressing). I like sci-fi like this, where the characters talk salty to one another, and you get the chemistry between the characters (and actors most especially) in these early scenes. I genuinely cared what would happen to them, which is a credit to Anderson in the casting.And this has that moment that explains how to bend/travel through space with the paper that you can poke a hole through one end to another, which is so neat! Things like that always spark my attention, and for the first half of this, as derivative as it is in some of its look and the fact that, in its way, this time the alien/aliens ARE the ship itself, it's different and compelling in how it traces the inner fears and phobias of the characters, reaql traumas (i.e. Kathleen Quinlan's disabled son), and manipulates them literally to death. That's all fine, and there's even one genuinely great, masterfully done scene where Sam Neill's doctor has a ""meeting"" with his dead naked wife in a bathroom. That is creepy, if not outright scary, and it ends in a cinematically satisfying shot.But there's also a feeling that the movie could go into more, like what really *is* in that other dimension or other place the Event Horizon has been to, what it means to go into that ""other"" side that Sam Neill seems to know about but is cagey in revealing. More than that though is how Anderson slips the tone in the final stretch, this is what made me realize it wasn't *as* good as I was hoping for: when it finally comes to bringing some action and gore, where Fishburne has to preserve his (dwindling) crew and ship, he goes into filmmaking pyrotechnics of a sort that's distracting and moments and lines even from Neill, who is so good here, that becomes funny in an unintentional way. I found myself stifling laughter in a packed theater seeing parts of this ending (some parts are more intentionally funny, with the black astronaut who has to use his boosters to get back to the ship and says 'motherf***er' every other word, and... it feels organic to him!) and could predict so much of what was about to happen. After a set up and partial pay-off that was working and for Anderson to not have all the follow through I hoped for was a let-down.All the same, Event Horizon represents the sort of sci-fi spectacle we don't get in theaters as much as we used to back in the 90's, and in that sense it's easy to take it for granted, how it does dig into ideas of identity and fears and what obsessions draw out of people when traumas are put to full throttle. To put it another way, this is a brainy-dumb thriller, or a dumb-brainy thriller, and it's good. Mostly. When it's trying. 6.5/10",Event Horizon
13,hitchcockthelegend,"You know nothing. Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse.",7,2 October 2019,"Event Horizon is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and written by Philip Eisner. It stars Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, Jason Isaacs and Jack Noseworthy. Music is by Michael Kamen and orbital and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle.2047 and a group of astronauts are sent to investigate the 'Event Horizon' which disappeared mysteriously 7 years ago. It has returned minus its crew and now the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' become exposed to horrifying secrets of the ghost ship...It is what it is, a haunted house chiller set on a space ship. It's derivative within the genre but it does the genre staples with no little amount of quality. The tone is set from the opening credits being accompanied by a ferociously foreboding musical score, and from there the pic delivers a ""who is going to get killed and in what order"" process - and why? Just what is the mystery at the core of it all?.A great cast has been assembled, which lifts it above its ""B"" movie roots, so with some thoughtful ideas within the narrative, it's easy to buy into the characterisations. Naturally the blood will flow, devilishly so, but the makers here put a different slant on the sci-fi/horror assailant thread. Of course it gets a bit by the numbers come the final quarter, arguably a bit hokey in fact, but it's very effective and perfect for a lights off viewing experience.Smart production design helps keeps up the chilly feel to proceedings, whilst the bleak tonal flows that director Anderson goes for really draws the engaged observer in. It's neither ground breaking or a top line film of its type, but holding up on repeat viewings it proves to be a sturdy and unsettling space based chiller. 7/10",Event Horizon
14,Theo Robertson,Disappointing,5,6 July 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 1997 was a great year for British films ( And I won`t get into an argument with what constitutes a "" British "" film ) with THE FULL MONTY , BEAN and SPICE WORLD all being massive hits in the US . Strangely the British made film EVENT HORIZON probably had a bigger budget than its three compatriots put together but made little impact on the American box office
If I was to point out the cause for its failure then I would say it`s with Philip Eisner`s script. It lacks a lot in both characterisation and story development , things happen without much explanation and at times it`s all slightly confusing . Of course if there`s been as much as 20 minutes cut out of the final print then that`s hardly Eisner`s fault , but he should take the blame for the unoriginal script ***** MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS ***** The whole concept of a haunted space craft is no different to that of a haunted house ,the start of EVENT HORIZON  reminded me of both 2001 and ALIEN .  , people being confronted by their worst fears is straight out of 1984, a space ship that`s alive is a reference to QUATERMASS AND THE PIT , and the villain`s appearance resembles Pinhead being converted to cenobite at the start of HELLRAISER 2: HELLBOUND. Even the context of the dialogue is borrowed from other sources "" Be with me "" is from  LIFEFORCE , and "" I have such sights to show you "" is HELLRAISER  again . But luckily no one comes out with the cliche "" It`s all right , there`s nothing to worry about , everything is under control "" because that would be too self referential ***** END SPOILERS ****Paul Anderson does a fairly good job as director ( Has anyone noticed that Anderson wouldn`t know a good script if he saw one. Maybe someone plucked his eyes out too ? ) and it`s on the technical areas the film works best , there`s plenty of scenes that will make you jump out of your seat due to the sound mix . If Anderson has a problem with EVENT HORIZON then it`s that he seems unable to get the best out of his cast , only Sean Pertwee gives a good performance as a rough and ready space pilot , everyone else on the ship seems to be half asleep .So if you like sci-fi or horror films then you may like EVENT HORIZON , but it`s not a film you`re likely to watch over and over again which is a shame.

15,Scarecrow-88,Event Horizon,8,11 March 2007,"The crew of the Lewis and Clark, a search and rescue vessel, are told to seek out the science space ship, Event Horizon, which has been missing for seven years. Event Horizon was spotted near Neptune and this is where they find the ship. Led by Captain Miller(Laurence Fishburne)the crew are to find out what happened to the crew on board and bring any information which might explain why such a ship could remain missing for so long. Once on board, however, the crew realizes that this ship has been to an uncharted dimension..a kind of evil that has taken over the ship and, in time, the crew. The former scientists on the previous mission, thanks to the creative genius of Dr. William Weir(Sam Neill), were on a mission to guide the Event Horizon on a special experiment in the ""folding of space""..in other words, the ship would travel from one destination to another through a created black hole/gateway. What the crew did travel to, and died from, is for the Lewis and Clark to find out. But, what occurred to that crew(a horror that is recorded on a disc)seven years ago is starting to effect the crew of Lois and Clark. It seems that the heart of Event Horizon, the core that operates the ship, opens on it's own releasing ""the dark"" some evil force that opens up the inner iniquity of those on board who harbor guilt regarding past mistakes. The evil attacks it's prey by tapping into their fear and exposing it through manipulation. Med Tech, Peters(Kathleen Quinlan)sees the diseased son for whom the job keeps her away from. Miller is plagued by the burning victim he had to leave behind on a mission to save his crew. Weir sees the wife who committed suicide. The ship seems to want Weir as it's tool for disrupting the crew's escape. The Lewis and Clark was badly damaged when the core opens pulling crewman Justin(Jack Noseworthy)inside and then spitting him out. A ripple effect/surge from within the core causes major damage. With limited air supply on the Event Horizon, they must repair hull damage or die. But, the evil on board Event Horizon doesn't want them to leave anyway.In theory, most believe the Event Horizon ""visited"" Hell during the folding of space. Fooling with such things as creating a black hole is risky even if you wish to travel faster from destination to another. We do know that Justin mentions after being thrown out of where ever it was he was taken, that ""the dark"" is coming. The dark could mean anything. What appears on the disc shows the former crew having a violent sex orgy, killing each other. You know from this that the evil that permeates on Event Horizon can change individuals into something quite deviant. The film can be really scary and graphic which is right up my alley. One of the great examples of what you can do with the blending of science fiction and horror. This film has incredible set-design and visual effects..the best money can buy. But, without that fascinating and disturbing plot, this would be just another rehash. The cast is fun to watch and the terror is genuine. A winner for Paul WS Anderson, if you ask me.",Event Horizon
16,Hey_Sweden,Creepy at times.,7,14 September 2013,"Right from the beginning, it may be clear that ""Event Horizon"" owes a pretty big debt to ""Alien"" (but then, so do many other post-1979 films) but it does have a fairly interesting story and it does live up to the word ""horror"". It gets substantially unnerving and creates some wonderfully horrific imagery. In fact, as films of this type go, it's a pleasure in terms of the visuals - special effects, sets, cinematography. Devotees of these genres should find it to be solid if not exceptional entertainment. They may find the ""science"" ludicrous, but still be amused.In the year 2047, an exploratory spaceship, the ""Event Horizon"" of the title, has reappeared after having been lost for seven years. A U.S.A.C. team is launched to find out what happened, and rescue any possible survivors. They do this in the company of the ships' designer, William Weir (Sam Neill), who has a tragedy in his past, and members of the team bring their own baggage to the situation, with no-nonsense Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) in charge of the mission. What they learn is that the ship now seems to be ""alive"", and aware of what has happened in the teams' pasts.The script by Philip Eisner is not without humour, but it mostly plays things straight, and the cast performs it with real gravity. Fishburne is good as a rock-solid type of man, while Neill gets a chance to tear into the scenery as Weir becomes more and more deranged. Kathleen Quinlan is affecting as Peters, who is having to deal with child custody issues in her personal life. Joely Richardson is good as efficient team member Starck, and Richard T. Jones, Jack Noseworthy, Jason Isaacs, and Sean Pertwee round out the cast.Things get off to a nice start with Paramount putting a fun spin on their standard logo sequence, and director Paul Anderson guides everything with style.""Event Horizon"" may be derivative in some ways, but it moves along well and is never dull.Seven out of 10.",Event Horizon

18,poolandrews,Decent enough Sci-Fi Chiller that's a fairly entertaining watch.,5,23 April 2005,"Some explanatory on screen text informs the viewer that the Event Horizon was a one-of-a-kind spacecraft designed for faster than light travel that disappeared in the year 2040 somewhere near the planet Neptune. We are then told that it's '2047...now'. Seven years after it disappeared without trace a source of transmission from the Event Horizon has been detected & traced to the orbit of Neptune. The Event Horizon's creator Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) is sent to investigate in a search & rescue ship called the Lewis and Clarke along with it's crew. The Lewis and Clarke is Captained by Joe Miller (Laurence Fishburne), his crew consists of second in command Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), two engineers Smith (Sean Pertwee) & Justin (Jack Noseworthy), two medics D.J. (Jason Isaacs) & Peters (Kathleen Quinlan) plus a rescue technician named Cooper (Richard T. Jones). 56 days after leaving Earth they reach Neptune & locate the Event Horizon. They dock & Captain Miller, Peters & Justin enter the seemingly deserted spaceship. Captain Miller finds a dead mutilated body floating around & lots of blood stains on the bridge. Meanwhile Justin explores the engineering section of the Event Horizon where the core is situated, a piece of machinery which causes a sort of black hole to appear by which the Event Horizon is able to travel from any point to any other point almost instantly. Justin is sucked into the core & thrown back out again shortly after. In the ensuing panic & commotion the Lewis and Clarke is damaged, Captain Miller orders everyone on-board the Event Horizon to discuss the situation. It appears that the Event Horizon only has enough air left for 20 hours, Justin is alive but in a very bad condition & eventually tries to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an airlock. Captain Miller orders everyone to pull together, repair the Lewis and Clarke in time & make it back home safely. As the hours pass the team on-board the Event Horizon start to see visions, disturbing visions that are personally related to them. Searching through the Event Horizon's Captain John Kilpack's (Peter Marinker) video log they discover some terrifying & chilling footage that makes everyone in a big hurry to leave. Except, that is, Dr. Weir who appears to start & become possessed by his creation & isn't so keen on leaving her behind...Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I thought Event Horizon was a decent enough Sci-Fi horror that wasn't brilliant but wasn't bad either. The biggest problem with Event Horizon is the script by Philip Eisner which is a bit of a mess. Nothing is explained satisfactorily in my opinion, it's all very vague & underdeveloped. After I finished watching Event Horizon I had more questions than answers like where did the Event Horizon go for seven years exactly? What has it brought back? What is this evils motivation for doing what it does? When these strange things start to happen & they start to realise that the Event Horizon is responsible why don't they just all stay in the Lewis and Clarke until the repairs are complete? I just didn't get Dr. Weir's motivations, he barely does anything or has any meaningful involvement apart from talking about technical mumbo-jumbo for most of the film & then just suddenly loses his marbles or becomes possessed & until this point we know very little about him so for him to suddenly turn into the bad guy felt empty almost. I didn't like the threat the team encounters, it was very unfocused & not scary or real like say the Alien from Alien (1979). There are other points throughout that I wasn't too happy about either but I won't bother going into them here. And why did the script have to include a typical annoying comedy relief character who swears & comes out with various childish one-liners which are at odds with the rest of the dialogue & characters in the film. Event Horizon also reminds me strongly of Aliens (1986) in it's set up, plot devices & all round feel. Unfortunately Event Horizon doesn't have the tension or excitement. One thing that Event Horizon's script does have going for it is the fact that it moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring, something is always happening. The production design credited to Joseph Bennett is generally very good throughout Event Horizon with it's Gothic looking spaceship sets, I especially loved the design for the core itself & the room it's housed in. Acting is OK from all involved except that annoying idiot who plays Cooper, the comedy relief. The special effects are good, but there are one or two that don't hold up so well these days. There isn't much gore or violence in it, someone with their eyes poked out, someone sliced open and hanging on hooks & someone being exposed to an open airlock where their veins start to bulge & pop. There's a bit of female nudity as well. Event Horizon is well made & has a definite slickness about it, just a shame about that script really. Overall I liked it for sure, but I didn't love it as there were to many vague points that didn't work for me. I just didn't like the evil force, give me a guy in a rubber monster suit anytime over this wishy-washy pseudo hell nonsense. Definitely worth watching but there are better out there, having said that there are a lot worse as well & you couldn't really go wrong if you can find it going cheap or are able to catch it on T.V.",Event Horizon
19,utgard14,"""F*** this ship!""",7,17 October 2015,"A spaceship called Event Horizon returns after disappearing years before. A rescue ship investigates and finds evil. Evil, I tell you! A good sci-fi horror flick that has improved with age. I like it more now than I did when it was first released. It's a movie that borrows so liberally from everything from The Black Hole and Alien to Hellraiser that it leaves itself open to charges of theft. It also uses a formula that has been done to death -- the motley crew of a ship (space or sea -- doesn't matter) encountering some dangerous creature or force. That formula was never better than in Alien, although its roots go at least as far back as the 1950s sci-fi boom. So with the film's creative bankruptcy, why do I still rate it as high as I do? Basically because it does its job very well. It's an entertaining movie with few artistic pretenses. The cast is good for this kind of movie where there's usually at least one person hamming it up so badly they bring the whole movie down with them. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are the standouts but the entire cast is solid. The special effects and sets are not too shabby. It's one of director Paul W.S. Anderson's better movies, not that that's saying a lot. I don't really have any superlatives to throw at Event Horizon, as it's not the best of anything really.

Though you sort of know where this is going (from the synopsis and first signs in the movie), it is not that predictable. It is just original enough to keep you interested..On the downside, plot is not entirely watertight. eg Ship's hull is fractured, yet the crew in the affected area are still able to breathe...CGI is fine.Good dramatic cast - Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan (among others) - who all put in solid performances.Not a must-see, but reasonably entertaining.",Event Horizon
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Perhaps his best,7,28 May 2008,"Like the other genres, horror is not limited to being done one particular way, or any single type. Too bad W.S. has yet to look beyond... this. Here, it truly starts out well. I watch more or less everything he's been involved in, but I haven't spent a lot of money on it, several of them were lent or given to me by acquaintances. He leaves something of a finger-print on anything he's done(harshly put, some might say that once you've seen one of his... yeah), and with both the actual quality and the audience response(they don't always go together), it's odd that he keeps getting to direct. But before its drowned out entirely in something of an ocean of blood(oh how I wish that was hyperbole... something else that's evidently alien to him is the concept that less is more), this has merit. The whole thing is pretty much bathed in CGI, mostly well-done. Some of it is there to distract and show off. The humor isn't bad, and it's seldom forced. The plot is reasonable, and the concept certainly is interesting. The pacing is OK. Acting varies, some of it is relatively good. The effects tend to be great. The film is just uneven... where it starts with hinting, and at least some measure of build-up(which Anderson seems to have since just about completely abandoned), it ends with a comparatively inordinate amount(if they were going for contrast, they missed the mark) of gore, at times grotesque. I'm not saying there's something wrong with that style, the main thing here is how it doesn't fit with the rest, and the overall issue is that this appears to be the only kind he'll make. Throwing violence mercilessly at the viewers, underlined with loud heavy rock. This is, or can be, scary, and unsettling. It just doesn't deliver what it sets up as what is to come... maybe Paul got bored half-way through, and subsequently made whatever was left of the flick the way those of us who've seen at least two are used to him doing this. The references herein would be better received in a more expertly done piece. I recommend this to fans of Paul W.S. Anderson and his work. Failing that, those who like their movies more or less laced with guts. 7/10",Event Horizon
22,evanston_dad,Movie Can't Survive Its Ending,5,2 November 2010,"Many films have explored the paradox of being trapped in the infinite vastness of space, and ""Event Horizon"" joins the club.This blend of sci-fi and visceral horror is never much better than a cut-rate version of ""Alien,"" but at its best it does manage an effectively claustrophobic atmosphere and a sense of creeping dread. But the film's best moments are a distant memory by the time the last 20 minutes or so have played out, and we watch a scary premise collapse under the weight of its attempt to make sense. Many of the final scenes are just silly, and the very end is a clunker.Movies like this don't need terrific actors, but it could have used one better than Laurence Fishburne, who has the largest role and never acts like anything more is at stake in this life and death scenario than whether or not he's going to get the salad dressing he asked for.Grade: C+",Event Horizon

Jones: Mindless Alien rip-off with the only event seen over the horizon being leaving the theatre at a quick pace. Laurence Fishburne captains a spacecraft where Sam Neill boards claiming to have built another craft called Event Horizon. Apparently it can bring reality to the worst nightmares of any given person before execution. For viewers it could mean viewing the film again. Predictable storytelling that executes morons in gory techniques. Directing by Paul Anderson is uninspiring. He previously made the equally stupid Mortal Kombat. Fishburne shouldn't add this as a career highlight. Neill plays the villain with the brain the size of a pea. He claims that the craft created a big hole to hell. Kathleen Quinlan plunges to her death after one stupid move. Perhaps she realized that this wasn't a good career choice after Apollo 13 and couldn't live with the decision to star in it. Joely Richardson is also featured among others. Nobody here is likely to place this film high on their list of great career achievements. It does contain fine visual effects but one may have to look beyond the horizon to find a story. Although one can create a hole but not to hell.

And for the most part, it works very well.But the script is very bad, and the inclusion of Jones as Cooper is an awful inclusion as he he is just there for comic relief, and feels really out of place in this sort of film.Fishburne and Neill do the norm and are as watchable as ever, but it's the supporting cast that really surprise in this. Issacs and Pertwee are really good, and show that they are as reliable as always.Visually it's very impressive, and the build and maguffin are quite unsettling, but after a while, it turns into a film about people walking down a corridor and trying not to look into a spinning ball.The final act, which should have been shocking and macabre, is daft and way over the top, and although it's action packed, it's pretty boring in the end.So it's a fun set up, which is quite eerie in parts, but the ending lets it down, becoming ridiculous and killing of characters as quick as the makers can.Hello to Jason Issacs",Event Horizon

They pick random people, probably a broad variety, but bland as all get out to help the studio execs gut a director's vision. Probably not even horror fans. What we get is good, but the potential is there for it to be way more disturbing, a horror film that is totally fabricated, but still resonates. Though, this one is good as I so enjoy the supernatural and then to combine it with science fiction...awesome!The story, a ship, 'Event Horizon' has disappeared and seven years later as reappeared. A crew is set with the task of going to this vessel and discovering if there is anyone left alive and to salvage the ship if possible. On board this crew, a Dr. Weir, who is the man who invented the special engine used to propel the ship forward.

As they explore the ship, stranger and stranger things keep happening and hampering any chance of the rescue team making it out alive!I thought all the actors and actresses did good. I knew Sam Neil would be good and so is Lawrence Fishborne. The.visuals are really good too and the film has a very good atmosphere essentially being a spaceship that is haunted. I just think it would have been better with more extended peeks into hell, because who wasn't curious to see what the makers of the film came up with? Unfortunately, they got a squeamish test audience who thought it was too much and us horror fans are left to wonder. Of course, my biggest question is how the heck did a copy of the film with the extra scenes end up in a Transylvania salt mine?So, I liked this film as I have been trying to watch all the supernatural horror in space I can. Got The Dark Side of the Moon too. Wanted Nightflyers, but that is not even on DVD. The only other one I can think of is Lifeforce which does have some cool visuals, but mainly takes place on earth.

30,sddavis63,Quite Forgettable Aside From Laurence Fishburne,3,22 January 2012,"Strange. I was hesitant about this film basically because it had Laurence Fishburne playing a spaceship captain. I like Laurence Fishburne. He's a decent enough actor - probably a little under-rated. But I couldn't really see him in that kind of role. He surprised me. I thought he worked quite well as Captain Miller of the Rescue Ship Lewis & Clark, sent to investigate the sudden appearance of a ship (the Event Horizon) that suddenly appears in orbit around Neptune after disappearing seven years before. The truly unfortunate thing was that Fishburne seemed to be the only thing that worked in this. The rest of the cast didn't really capture me, and the story just didn't grab me.The Event Horizon had been testing out a new kind of engine that would allow it to travel faster than the speed of light by essentially bending time. It was lost without a trace. When it reappeared (in the year 2047) Miller's team, which had the scientist who invented the new engine (played by Sam Neill) included, heads off. There seem to be no survivors, but plenty of strange things happen - which are clearly related to this new kind of engine. The crew has strange hallucinations (or are they?) and it turns out that what the new engine has actually done is somehow opened a hole into a new dimension; into some parallel universe that can only be described as hell.It disappointed me. The cast (aside from Fishburne) was weak and the story just simply seemed to get progressively sillier as the movie went on. It's not a great addition to anyone's sci-fi video library.

32,bowmanblue,Hell is just a word...,8,9 July 2014,"'Event Horizon' is basically a 'haunted house' but not a house – a spaceship instead. Many people have called it 'Alien meets Hellraiser' and, seeing as I can't think of a better description, I would say that's pretty apt.A rescue ship locates the wreckage of the lost long experimental starship the 'Event Horizon' and goes in to investigate. Not a good idea. Soon all manner of spookiness and nastiness befall the rescuers and they end up the ones in need of saving.You'll probably recognise a fair few of the cast (mainly Lawrence Fishburne in his 'pre-Morpheous days) and they all do a good job at portraying their characters. However, the real star of the film is the ship itself. The Event Horizon is brilliantly realised and the sets are amazing. This all goes to help build the film's ultimate plus point: the atmosphere. It's dark, it's brooding and you do feel that you're in a – albeit futuristic – haunted house.There's not an awful lot of 'sci-fi/horror' films about these days, so perhaps this one fits into a bit of a niche market. So, if you like the sound of something which has the atmosphere of Alien crossed with the gore and themes of Hellraiser, then this is for you.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Event Horizon

Quite strange for a epic sci-fi horror.It turns out that Paul Anderson thought he was directing a movie that would be as revolutionary as Ridley Scott's Alien was back in 1979 and when he turned in his first 130-minute cut of the film it was painfully obvious that his effort and ability to make a solid horror film were sorely lacking. Paramount cut more than half an hour of footage and released it as a crash-and-burn flick with little fanfare.That's the real story behind Event Horizon. Over the years Paul Anderson has blamed the studio for the film being a tedious bore but it's all down to him and his approach to this lame material which is full of the easiest, EASIEST stinger scares, weak direction, and a superficially ambiguous script that he thought he could go all out with.Even with very low expectations of Hellraiser/Haunted House/Generic Slasher-in-Space tropes you'll consider doing the dishes or the ironing before the movie is halfway over.",Event Horizon

36,tabuno,A Solid But Not Completely Successful Fusion of Sci Fi and Horror,7,18 January 2019,"5 September 2010. Sphere (1998) with Samuel L. Jackson came out a year later using the same underlying premise in an underwater environment scenario who has a presence in ways resembling Lawrence Fishburne in Event Horizon though more grounded in this movie as well as a subsequent version in Supernova (2000). But perhaps the closest psychological connection to this movie comes in the form of Galaxy of Terror (1981).For 2047, the technology (notebooks and computerization) appears to be more 2020, even though it has a futuristic but contemporary feel 13 years later after its release as well as the incorporation oddly enough of weirdly archaic looking mechanical devices with steam and grinding metal from the Iron Age.Incorporated into this movie are bits of Alien (1979) doors and door sounds and smatterings of Alien (1979) chasing and running down corridors, and even an Alien (1979) mysterious signal or message parallel and is even suggestive of the older First Spaceship on Venus (1960) or Planet of the Vampires (1965). Vague visual color similarities to The Cell (2000) and some design inside the core's mechanism to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as later scene depicting being trapped outside in the vacuum of space. The visuals in this movie particularly the first third are fascinating as well as beginning to show signs of aging with the not quit lucid and authentic integration of floating objects in a vacuum, however, the effort and the overall impact are impressive and likely strikingly new when the movie came out 13 years ago and really broke new ground since 2010 came out seven years earlier (1984). Some of the scenes have not been replicated even to this day, even with the availability of the technology - like the interior of a deep frozen weightless vessel.The explosion airlock scene is a particularly crucial scene where the screenplay and director is able to retain a believable, comprehensible consistency, a scene is actually seems to barely steer away from stereotypical overly dramatic standard of sensational horrific gore like like that observed in Outland (1981), though the final climatic scenes do have a compelling sense of suspense and drama.Additionally, Sam Neill's crucial importance in the movie can't quite bring up either by the script or perhaps his acting to truly provide the depth necessary to truly display the credibility of the horrific transformation from the science fiction genre and their a few editing issues especially when Laurence Fishburne suddenly finds himself alone in a corridor with a haunting voice reverberating around him, and even the sudden discovery of the disposition of Lt. Stark played by Joely Richardson occurs without much explanation. One of the later destruction scenes also seems to be so overly destructive, to the point of portraying itself as a lazy, convenient script device. By the end of the movie, even the bio-detector devices used earlier in the movie seem to have been forgotten as the descent into an exclusively horror movie genre takes over unlike their use in the more intense sci fi emotive scenes from both Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986).While the descent from science fiction into horror might be considered a twisted corruption of science fiction, it might also be a fascinating fusion of the two in terms of how the interaction between the alien unknown of science fiction is manifested in the human mind and perception and behavior. And where good and evil is observed, it may be the human moral underpinnings of our anthropomorphic attempts to explain what we do not understand or conceive, but what is and it is our darkest fears of what we do not fathom that result in panic and paranoia and what might be delusional creations of our own inner psychic but are just as real in an alternative presentation. Yet even with this explanation in the end, even though its seems to skirt successfully for prolong time, Event Horizon (1997) doesn't quite seem to avoid the overly simplified blood and gore horror fixation during the latter third of the movie which takes some of the action-thrills from Alien (1979) but in a psychological monster as opposed to physical monster way as depicted in The Omen (1976), The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963) and particularly The Hellraiser (1987) come to mind. Sphere (1998) even with its much more tame and for some ""boring"" scenario seems to able to more effectively capture the alien-horror-sci-fi fusion or Sam Neill's struggles that were more sedately and cerebrally captured in the remake of Solaris (1972) by George Clooney.On the whole, this movie experience is interesting, sometimes scary, with a twist or two, and presents the American satisfaction of a sci fi action thriller, incorporating a strong horror element, and retains the American sci fi ending scene. Nevertheless, Event Horizon can't kind manage to present a superb fusion of these genres in a new classic form, but it can be commended for its attempt. 7/10.",Event Horizon
37,The-Sarkologist,How technology can send you to hell,6,26 January 2012,"To summarise this movie in a few words, it is a mix between Aliens and Hellraiser with an episode of Space 1999 thrown in. This movie is a Science-fiction horror – that means there is gore and there is lots of mention of hell and there are corpses running about. To me that is not horror, rather horror is something that makes me scared or makes me jump – this movie did neither, though I will say that it is quite suspenseful.Simply the story is that Earth is only beginning to move into space. They have just colonised the Moon and Mars and have sent one ship out to explore the outer reaches of the solar system – it never returned. Seven years later, another ship – the Lewis and Clark, set off to find this ship.The action of the movie is set aboard the ship The Event Horizon and is trapped in the upper atmosphere of Neptune. The visual effects are quite outstanding. When the camera zooms away from Daylight station at the beginning, a real sense of vertigo comes over the viewer. The depiction of a very stormy and wind swept upper atmosphere is quite good as well – though if it is windy then there would be atmosphere which the movie clearly states there is not. This movie also looks at going into a vacuum without a protecting suit. Some have said that the body will explode immediately – and this is possible if you still have air in your lungs. The whole spacing scene is quite gruesome.Some of the more shocking scenes of the movie deals with the gore. As a viewer we are led to watch some very gruesome scenes – and some lead up to some even more gruesome ones, though we are spared seeing them at the last minute. This is not something that I enjoy though; gore, I find, really puts me off a movie and even though it is used to incite emotions, the emotions that tend to be incited I tend not to appreciate.Event Horizon exploits the unknown. Like other horror movies, there is a lot of supernatural suggestions and this tends to scare people – that is if you do not truly understand the truth about this universe. It really looks at the extent of human endeavour and how our desire to become master of the universe is also bringing about our destruction. It looks at the horror of how our exploration into the unknown could release powers that we cannot control. This almost happened with Nuclear weapons, and the possibility of it going out of our hands still exist. We are destined for destruction and our greed will take us there.Characters are interesting but really nothing to explore deeply. Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) is okay and so is Doctor Weir (Sam Neill). The movie does create a mystery as to their past and slowly reveals it to us. We watch as these to main characters are confronted by their fears and watch how these fears try to destroy them. Even though these characters are faced with fears, these two are really the only two that are developed. One character is tormented by her dead son but the others tend to remain shallow and unobtrusive. The rescue technician does provide for a bit of relief, but even so, the development that exists with Miller and Doctor Weir is not at all evident. One thing that I noticed is the large number of Australian accents in the movie.Event Horizon is good if you like horror and suspense. If you are in for a simple science-fiction flick then wait for Lost in Space (not that I have seen it at the time of writing this).",Event Horizon
38,UniqueParticle,"My favorite space movie easily and my 1,400 review!",10,3 October 2021,Everything about Event Horizon is my jam especially the fact it's about a crew that investigates a ship that disappeared into a black hole in which ensues chaos and some of the horror ever! The cast is perfect for the story they all flow really well. One of my favorite scenes is when Sam Neil explains the gravity connection with a naughty magazine page that bit is brilliant. The epilogue is one of the best in cinema history; when everything is bonkers I even put the scene on YouTube. Another thing I must say is the editing is one of the greatest things ever!!,Event Horizon
39,merklekranz,Sci-fi that goes nowhere.......,1,22 January 2008,"I have a friend who religiously attends a 24 hour sci-fi festival each February. I was quite surprised that he had not heard of ""Event Horizon"", considering the number of sci-fi's he has seen. With great anticipation we watched it and his reaction was that it was nothing more than a sound and light show, with a non-existent plot, and minimal character development. So the question is, what is the attraction of this movie? Perhaps the funhouse type jump scares appeal to the horror crowd, but if it's the gore that attracts, why put up with a whole bunch of sci-fi mambo jumbo? I give up and so will you. Not recommended. - MERK",Event Horizon

Jones, Jack Noseworthy, Jason Isaacs, and Sean Pertwee. The acting was very good by these actors especially by Fishbourne and Neil, Isaascs, and Pertwee. The film is very scary and its very unpredictable. The special effects are outstanding. I just love the main title when the film begins and Michael Kamen's music is perfect for it and the rest of the musical score by the great Michael Kamen is awesome! I recommend you buy the score because its a dang good one! The film has some gore but it doesn't go very far. The story is good and the directing by Paul W.S. Anderson is very good. If you like the cast mentioned above and want to see an excellent horror science fiction film then I strongly recommend that you see or even buy Event Horizon today!",Event Horizon
41,johnnyboyz,"Spooky, Violent and Atmospheric. All in all, a good film.",6,23 May 2004,"Event Horizon has taken some basic conventions from the horror genre and mixed them up with a very basic Sci-fi setting. There are characters you just KNOW are going to end up dying some sort of a horrible death, an obvious protagonist and some very clever little plot pointers here and there such as how the ship 'Event Horizon' can travel quickly through space and little things like that that make the film seem a lot more different than others in this cross genre.Several characters put aboard a space ship with a 'no way out' element very much present and the fact it's in space and in the middle of nowhere makes this feel a little more claustrophobic than normal which is a good thing.The twist in the film, I must admit, did take me by surprise and all though afterwards you think that maybe it was a little obvious, it still does set you back a bit. The acting isn't all that good but at the same time, they weren't dire performances. It was the kind of acting that goes unnoticed without any real performance standing out no matter how much screen time one may have. The dark, sinister setting is used very well and it isn't all CGI which has been the downfall of quite a few horror/sci-fi films in the past.I liked the early sense of mystery and atmospheric feeling of confusion almost like some of the characters were private eyes, trying to discover what happened and untangling a mystery that has been made up.All in all, I think you should see the movie and I think, odds on, that you will like it. Maybe not absolutely love it but you will feel a lot better after this film than maybe after certain others.",Event Horizon

45,Anonymous_Maxine,An excellent science fiction film that suffered badly during the transition from the big screen to video.,8,28 August 2000,"When I saw Event Horizon in the theater I was terrified, and I loved it! However, when I first saw it in video, the larger than life quality that it once had was largely lost, and problems with the plot and the acting began to come through. I didn't notice (or care) before I saw it on video that there was no effort to describe what ""the dark"" was or where the ship had gone during the years it had been missing (the main goal of the expedition) or where Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) wanted to take it at the end.
Jack Noseworthy, who I particularly liked in Breakdown, delivered a terrible performance, and Lawrence Fishburne was also pretty bad, but I have never really been a fan of his. There were also horrible discrepancies in the plot. What, for example, made the film's writers think that the audience would believe that a human being can float around in Neptune's atmosphere for a few seconds wearing nothing but a pair of pajamas and still survive. In ANY condition. I have found myself defending this movie to a lot of people, but there is no excuse in the world for that scene.
Despite all of the numerous problems that are present in Event Horizon, I still maintain that it is an entertaining science fiction movie and it provides several good thrills. However, in order to do it as much justice as possible, if you watch it on video, turn the volume up really really loud, turn off all of the lights, and the bigger the screen, the better.",Event Horizon
46,jzappa,Made of Whatever Materials at Hand,7,30 May 2010,"Event Horizon is a bustling makeshift handiwork made secure by impressive production design and performances from actors who aren't easily embarrassed, but it begins with panache. It has the nuanced space vessels moving grandly against the domain of stars, it has the abysmal roar of the massive generators, it has sets boasting convincing technology, and it even has those high-pitched, jabbering, hardly discernible voice-like noises that remind us of Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, which give you the eerie sense that tiny creatures are plotting against you. The year is 2047. A rescue mission has been sent to Neptune's proximity, where seven years earlier the titular deep space research vessel vanished. As the rescue ship Lewis and Clark nears, its transmitters read that the temperature on board the other ship is freezing. No indication of human life is recognized. But there are signs of some other sort of life all through the ship. I love movies like this. I enjoy the dated fine points. Case in point: Everybody on board the rescue ship smokes, which is improbable in 2047 on a deep space mission where, later, the carbon dioxide air scrubbers will perform a vital function. And the captain, Laurence Fishburne, wears a leather bomber jacket, bespeaking that Neiman Marcus remains booming decades from now. I liked all of that stuff, though there wasn't much import to it.What happened to the ship named Event Horizon? Scientist Sam Neill might know. He created the ship's gravity drive, which candidly resembles a minor variation on the Machine in Contact, with three metal rings gyrating around an axis. The drive supposedly conceives a black hole and then sucks the ship through it, so that it can travel astronomical reaches in a second. Neill gives the binding junior high lecture on this process, taking a piece of paper and showing you how far it is from one side to the other, and then folding it in half so that the two edges meet, describing how that occurs when space bends. The crew members nod, observing sternly. They're an exceptionally qualified space crew, on a mission where space and time are livelihood, although they seem to know less about quantum theory than most of us home entertainment couch potatoes do. It's back to Physics 101 for them. They're more like a mix of marine caricatures, as is the case with the zealous and scripted deliveries by Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson, and even buddy cop foils, as is the unfortunate case for Richard T. Jones, playing a character cursed with so many horribly retarded lines that I hold the entire cast and crew responsible for not voicing the need for another rewrite: He's even carrying on like an Eddie Murphy bit when catapulted into space at one point.So, anyway, where did the ship go for seven years, and what occurred while it was there? Why is the first team all dead? Alas, Event Horizon is not the movie to field these issues. It's all flair, pay-off and special effects. Each scene revises the fundamentals: Early in the film the Lewis and Clark nears the Event Horizon through what I think is the tempestuous gravitational field of Neptune, with endless thunder, lightning and commotion. However as soon as those effects are taken advantage of, the remainder of the movie takes place in the tranquility of space. And although we are regaled with quite pleasant shots of Neptune, the crew members never regard the planet in astonishment, or acknowledge the remarkable spectacle that would shift any Earthling's paradigm forever. They're always so preoccupied with their obligatory, often cheesy dialogue they're heedless of their environment.The open-faced muse for this entertaining enough sleepwalking exercise in genre expediency, by the director of Mortal Kombat, is an incomparably superior but far less accessible film, Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, where a space station courses a colossal planet. The planet in that film is seemingly alive, and generates delusions in the minds of the space station inhabitants, making them believe they're back on Earth with their families. Same thing goes down in Event Horizon, where the crew members sublimate family members and colleagues they long for/cherish/blame themselves for the loss of, although where Tarkovsky was integrating the submerged psyche with the view of a planet as a single organism, Event Horizon exploits the figments and illusions of memory predominantly for jolts and cries of wolf, as well as distilling the antagonistic forces into a single supernatural villain stalking the ship like another Alien film.It is declared bleakly at one point that the gravity drive is an example of humanity going too far, into reaches we should not dare. There is a charge that someone has ""broken the laws of physics,"" and from the way it's accused you'd think perpetrators will be put in jail or charged with damages. Naturally there are no ""laws"" of physics, simply conclusions about the way things appear to be. What you ""break,"" if you break anything, is no longer a law but just an outmoded view, now replaced by one that makes better sense. Soundly implanted in this movie is a mistrust of actual science. That's probably why its characters know so little about it.",Event Horizon
47,strong-122-478885,"Laughable, Over-The-Top Sci-Fi Glop",4,17 June 2014,"Me thinks - Event Horizon was just your typical ""shock-the-audience-before-they-fall-asleep"" type flick. I really had to laugh at how hard this film tried & tried & tried (ho-hum) to shock the socks right off of me. But, unfortunately, it failed quite miserably.I mean, I really couldn't take this whole bungled mess seriously, especially when it came to the ""Shades-of-Hellraiser"" stuff and the inevitable possession of Sam Neill's character, Dr. Weir.Like, c'mon, already. Neill (portraying pure evil, personified) was about as demoniacally frightening as a frickin' tootsie pop, for crying out loud.Set in the year 2047, a rescue mission is launched to Neptune where an exploration ship known as the Event Horizon inexplicably reappears as mysteriously as it vanished 7 years earlier.The Horizon's crew is gone (wait till you find out where), but there's clearly a disturbing presence aboard (a literal understatement) that appears to be somehow connected to some ""black hole"" business which supposedly warps space.Striking set-designs, impressive visuals, and an intriguing premise do nothing to alleviate the sheer boredom, and laugh-ability, that quickly sets in with this decidedly weak, Sci-Fi entry from 1997.",Event Horizon

The plot surrounds the Event Horizon, an enormous spaceship that has the ability to jump from one point in galaxy to another in seconds using the Gravity Drive, the device that makes this even possible.  Anyway, it disappears on its maiden voyage and mysteriously reappears 7 years later.  A rescue team led by (Laurence Fishburne) is sent to investigate.  When they arrive, they discover that no one is on the ship, but of course it doesn't mean they're alone.  Soon after they arrive, the crew members begin witnessing horrific visions as the ship begins ""toying"" with there minds, searching deep down into their minds projecting their secrets and fears and turns them into horrifying reality. When I watched it, I had no idea that it was actually a horror movie and not a sci-fi film.

49,jimbo-53-186511,"Ridiculous, generic and predictable but to its credit it is somewhat watchable",5,11 August 2016,"A rescue crew are sent in to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding a ship that disappeared into a black hole some 7 years ago. The crew manage to locate the missing ship known as 'Event Horizon' and quickly discover that all is not quite right with the Event Horizon.As with most space related films Event Horizon has an intriguing premise and is also a film that opens up promisingly; albeit it is a tad slow and does set itself up as being more worthy than it thinks that it is. It's a pity then that the slow burn approach never really builds into anything great - it essentially cobbles together elements from many other films such as Solaris, Black Hole and Alien to name but a few making the film both generic and predictable. Interestingly, this creates a tonal clash between the first half and the second half whereby the first half is slow and pretentious (which are things I hate) and the second half is whacked out, ridiculous and quite fun to watch (which are things I love). This gives the film an uneven feel to it resulting in a film that I didn't hate, but also one that I couldn't love either.The cast are actually good here and work well to make the second half of the film fairly intense and enjoyable; this is hampered slightly by a rather lame and predictable twist later in the film. Paul Anderson's directing is good and he mostly makes good use of the locations; the claustrophobic feel that he gives to the film is good and he injects several shots of adrenalin to the picture which does make the second half of the film pass by much quicker than the first half.Yes if we're being honest this is a poor man's Alien and if you're looking for anything remotely original or intelligent then you're best off looking elsewhere. Even though the film seems to start and end on 2 different tones there is just about enough going on throughout the 90 minutes to make it work, and this results in a film that is neither brilliant nor ground-breaking, but one that is bearable and watchable.",Event Horizon
50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A truly scary space horror,9,27 October 2015,"Paul W.S. Anderson has been known for maiming some projects, namely Alien Vs. Predator. His Resident Evil films are a rocky road for fans of the game (I think they're fun, don't judge) and he has a few solid genre efforts in the underrated Soldier with Kurt Russell, and Death Race. Any missteps in his lineup can be forgiven, however, on account of Event Horizon, a terrifying journey into outer space, and perhaps further. It plays like Dead Space, Doom and Hellraiser all rolled into one palm sweating nightmare. When a massive, state of the art deep space extraction ship goes missing in the far regions, a rescue vessel called the 'Lewis & Clark' is dispatched investigate and bring the crew home. Captained by Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and presided over by the original ship's designer, Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). They locate the ship, and board her. From there, they discover that while it has been floating out there, it has visited another dimension, a dimension consisting of the last possible type of energy you want to run into. It preys on them one by one, allowing for some grotesque, shivery death scenes. There's a sequence where they check the ship's video log to find out what happened to the original crew. What they discover there will give you a cold jolt of sickening terror, and is the most well orchestrated scare moment of the film, and possibly the decade. The rest of the crew are played by reliably solid actors, including Joely Richardson, Jack Noseworthy, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs, a standout as J.D., the paranoid Irishman. Sam Neil is eerily calm as Weir, and Fishburne remains stoic as the Captain. Horror movies set in space don't often show, up, and are even less frequently effective, but this one shatters the mould to bring us raw, seething fear in a place where there is no escape, no rescue, and no hiding from the malevolent dark energies working against them.",Event Horizon

It contains strong elements of both horror and sci fi, I love the ways in which it incorporated two kinds of films and combined them into one, never really seen one do it in the way this one did. I like a supernatural element in my horror films, and this film had a very strong supernatural/evil element to it... especially towards the end. I applaud that aspect of the film of the horror side because it just makes everything more interesting. Just hearing the plot really interested me in this film and I'm so glad it didn't disappoint!

""Event Horizon"", I'll admit it freely, boasts fine effects and outstanding art direction. At times it also conjures up a claustrophobic atmosphere bubbling with foreboding and dread. The beginning, too, looks very promising.However, it finds it difficult to tell its core story - if it even HAS a core story. It's a clear case of death by screenplay, with the meaning and impact of the movie disappearing under an unrelenting avalanche of blood, shock and fire. (I would not be entirely surprised to discover that one of the various creators of the movie, let's say the director, had a relative who owned a small firm specialized in the delivery of fake blood.) Characters see gruesome visions, live through gruesome experiences, relive gruesome memories and, quite often, die in gruesome ways - and that's it, together with some underdeveloped nonsense about a dangerous experiment punching a hole in the fabric of whatever and opening a gateway to a dimension full of cruel chaos.Viewers familiar with both the science fiction and horror genre may also experience a certain sense of ""déjà vu"".It's a pity because some of the themes are intriguing, such as the idea that one cannot run from one's memories, even if one were to travel to Neptune in a space ship.

The plot is complex and principally involves our cast going into space to investigate and find the vessel Event Horizon. I would say this is more for sci fi fans than horror fans, but there is more than enough tension, suspense and grisly images to please horror fans. A lot of this stuff is psychological and the special f/x are outstanding. Early on in the film, much is lost due to an overemphasis on technical jargon(which sci fi fans I am sure love), but later on the film picks up and goes full throttle into dark and horrific territory.

56,aidanratesmovies,Such a shame Paramount decided to mess with this flick,10,6 October 2020,"Entertaining, wonderfully creepy, and a very intelligent thriller, Event Horizon is an underrated sci-fi gem that is flawed, but ages well still to this day. Event Horizon has its fair share of flaws, which was mainly caused by studio interference of its head company Paramount Pictures. Due to poor test screenings, and its originally conceived NC-17 rating, Paramount forced the film to be cut down in length and in content in order to appeal better to audiences. Little did they know that they basically removed ¼ of a great film, which still happens to be good, but honestly could have been much better, if the edits were still kept in tact. The film has a long history of battling to find its deleted content, with little to no success, and sadly we may never see the original plan intended for this film, but the result is still certainly worth watching. Its performances, for the most part, are incredibly well done- with Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne obviously leading this stellar cast, as well as some good supporting performances from Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs, and Jack Noseworthy. The only performer that seems off in the cast is actor Richard T. Jones, who portrays Cooper throughout the film, and whose take on the character is incredibly silly and out of place. The script, although having a few issues in terms of dialogue, is rather smart- and does an excellent job of conveying the emotion of these characters as well as the peril and fear that comes with this sort of situation. The look of the film can be quite memorable, although the tone may seem a bit grim at times, its visuals can truly be a feast for the eyes- especially when beholding the Event Horizon ship itself. In the end, Event Horizon is a fantastic sci-fi filmed meddled with enough to become just a good one, but what a good one it is!
My Rating: 9/10",Event Horizon
57,truemythmedia,Classic Horror Sci-Fi,8,27 February 2020,"""Event Horizon"" is a lot of fun and shows just how versatile Sci-fi, as a genre, can be. Unfortunately, it also highlights the problems with high concept movies if they don't perfectly execute on their ambitions. I'm not gonna lie and say this is a great or important film but if you are one of those people who has a little Venn Diagram space in your heart for sci-fi/horror films then this is a film for you.First off, the production design in this film is stellar (lol get it?). From the bridge of the Lewis & Clark, to the core of the Event Horizon's gravity drive, and to the neon green crawl spaces underneath the core. The locations are not just designed to feel believable, which they do, but also to play into the eerie feeling of the film which they also do, especially the sequence with Dr. Weir (Sam Neill, ""Jurassic Park"") under the core, lights strobing on and off inside the Jefferie's Tubes he is crawling through.The acting is uneven and feels like certain actors were given different ideas than the rest about what the film was about. Sam Neill is great as usual and the cast boasts a stacked cast with Jason Isaacs (""Death of Stalin"") and Laurence Fishburne (""The Matrix"") rounding things out. Most of the time these actors seem to be in a psychological terror movie set in space and discuss the various terrors in their past and what it means that they are seeing hallucinations about them. They have the sorts of conversations that people facing their fears and imminent deaths might have as they parse their own reactions, psychology, and internal movements.On the other hand we have Richard T. Jones, Kathleen Quinlan, and Joely Richardson, who seem to be in either a disaster film or action movie. Even Larry Fishburne gets in on the action movie vibes as he occasionally channels a hard edged commanding officer who doesn't take no guff and might occasionally have to choose bubble gum or kicking @$$. While these characters may be exposed to similarly terrifying events they seem to handle it more in the cheesy way that 90s action films do. Characters are known to nickname each other things like 'Baby' and 'Mamma Bear' or yell things like, ""I'm gone,"" as they hit a lever that launches them into danger. It feels like half the cast in is the movie ""Alien"" and the other half is in ""Armageddon.""The break down for me is almost that simple. I love the parts of this movie that are horror heavy and am bored by the parts that are action heavy. It doesn't help that some of the graphics have aged more poorly than a person who completed two terms as President of the United States.There's a part of me that thinks that this is a property ripe for reboot/sequel/re-imagining but there's another part of me that fears movie that would try to recapture the magic of this film. I know that for me, the psychological terror aspects of the film are my favorite but that might not be the case for everyone and I'd hate to think that some people who like this movie would be left out in the cold by whoever decided to remake this movie as 'the version they would have liked to see' rather than keeping the messy quality of the original.The messiness actually adds to the film in some ways. It would feel overly contrived to have every single member of the crew wandering around and pontificating to each other the whole movie about the plight of existence and the terror of the unknown just as it would feel untrue to have them all strutting like Space Marines gunning for another trophy. By putting both aspects in the film they both end up feeling more true to life.Unfortunately, my last criticism is also that while it does attempt to do some psychological terror and philosophical musing, the underlying themes of the movie still end up being very muddled. The plot is very by the book and should leave lots of room for character exploration and connection but ""Event Horizon'' leaves these characters as two dimensional stand ins. There is never any doubt about where our main character's journeys end. Almost before they ever step foot on the ship you can go down the line, one by one. Dead, dead by suicide, dead by sacrifice, turned to the dark side; you know it all from the beginning because these characters don't have multiple personality and psychological traits that make them who they are. They are stereotypes with one or two events that have happened to them in the past.All in all, I really like this movie. It's one I re-watch all the time and has a lot of great set pieces and imagery but it certainly isn't the deepest film. However, I don't think that is what most people are after with a movie of this type so I won't let that stop me from recommending it to almost any sci-fi or horror fanatic.",Event Horizon
58,masonsaul,Disappointing sci-fi horror,4,15 August 2019,"Event Horizon has a good setup but it's unfortunately a disappointing sci-fi horror. Most of the characters have no depth and it's almost entirely reliant on jump scares. The cg is awful and the ending is abrupt. It's also very derivative. However, it still has some positives, the music by Michael Kamen is really good and Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne give good performances despite their one dimensional characters. The set design and practical effects are impressive but are also extremely derivative of Alien.",Event Horizon
59,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Solid, but Flawed Sci-Fi Horror Film",8,14 June 2019,"This was a film that I remember watching back when it came out and hit the movie channels. After that initial viewing, I thought it had a really had a dark concept. My thoughts were actually that this was a lot like Hellraiser in space. The synopsis is a rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned...with someone or something new on-board.We actually start this one with getting back-story of how there was first colonies on the Moon, followed by mining colonies on Mars and then finally they created a ship named the Event Horizon, which is also the name of the point of no return for black holes. The ship goes missing and it is reported that it blew up. We learn this is a cover-up and that the ship disappeared. In the film's present, the ship has returned.The film then introduces us to Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). He is the designer of the Event Horizon. He is asked to join a team that is going to check on the ship that has reappeared by the planet Neptune. A rescue mission is put together with the ship, the Lewis and Clark. Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) is tasked to lead it. He isn't told what the mission is; just that is rescue and salvage. With him is a medical tech Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson), Cooper (Richard T. Jones), Dr. D.J. (Jason Isaacs), Smitty (Sean Pertwee) who is the pilot and finally Justin (Jack Noseworthy).Something this film does that I like is kind of introducing us to some of the technology. Everyone is put into a stasis to save their bodies as they travel through space. I will admit this film gives off a bit of Alien here with a crew trying to answer a distress call for a ship. As well as try to salvage it.Once they arrive in the area they are supposed to, they find the missing ship. Dr. Weir gives some background on its special engine and how it uses black holes to jump across the galaxy, making space travel much faster. The Event Horizon is scanned for life-forms, but they are getting weird readings. It is decided that Capt. Miller, Lt. Starck, Peters and Justin will go aboard. Part of this is to getting the ship back working to bring it in.Justin goes to where the core of the engine is and something happens. It somehow turns on by itself and sucks him in. Cooper gets him back out with the winch he is connected to, but he's in a coma like state. Dr. Weir tells them this isn't possible as it has three electric fields keeping it in place and has to be turned on manually. The crew starts to see some dark things of their past and loved ones as there's something not right going on with the ship. It gets even darker as Peters uncovers the ship's log and sees the final moments of the previous crew.I do have to admit, that coming into this film I was excited to check this out again, because I hadn't seen it since I wrote a paper about it in an astronomy class about black holes. It wasn't as brutal as I remembered it and of course not as scary either. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy what I saw. The concept of black holes is something that fascinates me. I really want to know if the gravitational pull just destroys everything or if they are really like wormholes that lead to another place or something else.This concept of what hell is really a place that is dimension just beyond ours is something else I really like too. What if bending time and space like this film is doing could really open a door to a world like this. I almost wish this film would have focused more on this than what we got. I listened to a podcast about this recently and they brought up there was a lot of cut footage, with some of that being more gore. I actually wish we could have gotten more of that and a bit less of what we did get to be honest. The film doesn't seem to fit together as well as it should. There are gaps in the story and time wise. That is not to say that pacing isn't good, but it doesn't build as much as tension as I really wanted it to. The film runs 96 minutes and I do wish we got 15 minutes or even push it to a full 2 hours as there is a great concept here.Since I kind of brought up how this does have a Hellraiser feel, we do get this entity that takes what scares or depresses us. It then uses it against us. This is a terrifying idea. Not only that, I love the torture aspects where the bodies are mutilated. I'm not big on pain, so this idea makes me cringe. They don't take it far enough though for me to really feel that way. We just get glimpses of this and I will say, it is some of my favorite aspects of the film as it reminds me of the CD cover to a Rammstein that fascinated me.Next to move to the acting, I would say that Fishburne is solid in this one. He is a fair captain and I think that he genuinely cares about his crew. He turns a tight ship and is fair. Not his best performance, but still good. Neill I think is really good as well. I do think that he kind of disappears through stretches of the film and I'm wondering if part of this is scenes that were cut. I wanted more from him. He is quite creepy though as the film goes on. Quinlan I thought was solid. I do feel bad for her is that her son is disabled and she wants to stay on Earth with him. Richardson is fine in her role. She is pretty easy on the eyes. Jones, Pertwee and Noseworthy are also pretty solid in their roles. I will admit that Jones did get on my nerves a bit. There isn't much of the rest of the cast, but they do round out the film for what is needed.Something that I dreaded about films from this era was the effects. Back to the podcast I listened on this, they were talking about how they didn't hold up. I will say that I'm torn. The effects that were done practically of course look great. I just wish we would have gotten a bit more. For the CGI, this think they are definitely hit or miss where some look really good and others really bad. I do like the look of both ships, but something that also struck me is that you'd think this would feel more contained. The Event Horizon feels so big that you don't get that cramped feel that makes space movies scarier. The film though is shot very well.Now with that said, this film didn't hold up as well as I remember it, but I still enjoy it. I think that there is a great concept here there is just a lot missing. I think this actually hurts the pacing of the film as it moves through some things too quickly and doesn't build enough of the horror as it could. The acting is good though and again, some of the ideas that are explored are solid. The effects are definitely hit or miss. The soundtrack of the film didn't really stand out to me, but it did fit for what they needed. I would say that overall this film is above average for me. I would recommend giving it a viewing especially if you are into sci-fi horror.",Event Horizon
60,Samiam3,"Short, Silly, Superficial but watchable",6,7 May 2009,"Event Horizon is an awkward sci-fi flick. The only thing it really succeeds in doing in being grizzly and ominous (not to mention gory). Over the course of an hour and a half, we are not given much more than a handful of shocks. However, the filmmakers somehow manage to execute this messy story well enough that if you like this sort of thing, you may not be temped to walk away.After being lost in space for seven years, the Event Horizon spacecraft has suddenly reappeared in the solar system in the year 2047. A small crew led by Captain Miller is sent out to explore the ship and get some answers. What they slowly begin to realize is that the ship has not merely gone off the edge of the map, but it has been to hell and back, and now there are supernatural forces aboard. The reasons how and why this has happened are not explained to us, which is kind of disappointing. What follows is a story of survival on the haunted ship with lots of gore, cheap dialog, and typical cardboard acting.Event Horizon is not the worst sci-fi film out. I would definitely recommend it over films like 'Sphere' and/or 'The Fifth Element', but regardless, the movie still needs work. It is just barely entertaining.",Event Horizon
61,Spleen,There's a difference between darkness and blackness.,1,10 August 2001,"Darkness is frightening, because we don't know what it contains.  Blackness isn't frightening - it's just ugly and off putting, like the flourescent greens that also figure so heavily in the colour scheme, like the sudden loud noises and the lascerated flesh.  ""Event Horizon"" doesn't know the difference between scary, startling, and sickening.But what makes the film really bad is the complete absence of characterisation.  How many people were aboard the rescue ship to begin with?  Five?  Ten?  If only I'd counted.  There's the ship's hubristic scientist - so utterly lifeless a hubristic scientist that I bet if you were to tap him on the shoulder and ask, ""Why did you do what you just did?"" he would look puzzled and reply, ""Because I'm the hubristic scientist."" Similar remarks apply to the jivin' black guy, and to the tough but capable captain (although he, out of everyone, comes closest to being an actual character).  Everyone else on board is utterly unmemorable.  Is this better, or worse?  Hard to tell.  I think Laurence Fishburne's captain is easier to take than the average faceless crew member; Sam Neill's scientist is much harder.Don't think for a minute that I'm blaming the actors.  It's the script.  No more than half of the lines CAN be delivered with conviction, so no more than half are.  The cast spends most of its time shouting at one another, explaining things (in a sort of a way) to the audience, and wandering off suddenly to investigate this or that without telling anyone only to come back having forgotten whatever it was they had been doing before they left. It becomes tiring after a while, watching conversations you know won't lead anywhere because they'll be forgotten as soon as the camera turns to something else.P.S.: I can't help noticing that an earlier reviewer tells us that if we don't want something scary and suspenseful we should watch ""Bambi"" instead. He can't have seen ""Bambi"" recently.  Concede for the sake of argument that ""Event Horizon"" is scary; still, ""Bambi"" is far more suspenseful.  One cares whether or not Bambi survives.",Event Horizon
62,RatedVforVinny,"Quite brilliant entry, to the Sci-fi/Horror genre.",8,10 December 2019,"A brilliant Sci-fi drama, that owes far more to the old haunted house films, such as 'The Haunting' and then later 'The Shining', than a typical monster in space farce. Groundbreaking and original, which took loads of risks for the time (especially with the gore scenes) some which have never been seen. Boasting such fine acting talents as Sam Neiil and Larry Fishburn. There might just be an exciting directors cut on the way, or hopefully over the horizon.",Event Horizon
63,ctomvelu1,A blast,8,1 September 2009,"As the years roll by, EVENT HORIZON keeps looking better and better, much like the initially maligned BLADE RUNNER and JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING. A rescue ship arrives near Jupiter to find a long-missing research vessel empty, the crew nowhere to be found. But is Event Horizon really empty? Turns out it's haunted, after going into another dimension and returning not quite right. The rescue crew gets picked off one by one by unseen forces. A great cast and terrific set design keep this baby moving along to its shocking conclusion. A variation on SOLARIS and every haunted ocean vessel movie, EVENT HORIZON is a Halloween-oriented masterpiece of scares and thrills. The second half flags a bit, but the first half is about as scary a cinematic ride as you're likely to take in this lifetime. Paul Anderson definitely came up with a winner here, and the movie was clearly ahead of its time when first released -- just like BLADE RUNNER and THE THING. The ending is open to interpretation, which actually works in its favor. This movie will grow on you with repeated viewings. In 1994, Sam Neil had starred in JOHN CARPENTER'S IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, which makes an excellent companion piece to EVENT HORIZON. Both feature Lovecraftian ""lurking at the door"" themes.",Event Horizon
64,PredragReviews,"""I told you she won't let me leave - she won't let anyone leave""",9,29 June 2016,"The Event Horizon is an abandoned ship found by the crew of the Lewis and Clark. Sam Neill plays the designer of the Event Horizon who lost contact with the crew and has gone to find his masterpiece. No spoilers here, but if you hate sci-fi or horror, give it a miss! Event Horizon is a cult film, not well received upon release but a sleeper of it's day. Quite a large budget but never oversold, this sci-fi horror really delivers the goods due in large to the director, Paul W S Anderson. This genre is his forte and he is a director of distinction, using excellent visuals, keeping the tension prevalent making you feel on edge constantly. Great example of Sam Neill's qualities with strong performances elsewhere, but it is the juxtaposition of the imposing girth of the ""techno-mediaeval"" Event Horizon and it's gravity drive and the claustrophobic nature of the the Lewis and Clark which gives the feeling of despondancy, everything is stacked against the characters.The balance between British and American characters plus an Australian also makes this film better for me because you get a little tired of having an all American cast in big films, no matter how good they are. The acting in the film is good as a consequence in this, all of these good actors being up to their full standards. As for the story-line, well, it doesn't get any better than a ship getting sucked down a black hole and coming back with an evil entity onboard which killed its crew and is bent on killing the rescue crew too. ""The Event Horizon"" is a stunning ship and the Gravity Drive is a stunning looking device to go in its heart - it's no wonder that Dr. Weir became obsessed with it. But this film is a good example of how obsessions can become deadly, so watch out. The dark entity starts to make its presence known and eventually takes over Dr. Weir and kills most of the crew. It involves some fantastic scenes such as Justin depressurising in the air lock and some guy on a ship log recording pulling out his entrails though his mouth. Sounds gory? Yeah, it is, but don't let that put you off even if you really need to have a strong stomach for it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Event Horizon
65,vengeance20,Craving for the 130 minute uncut version!,7,10 September 2016,"Heard about this film earlier this year & saw from the graphic visuals that I had to have it! Not a big Sci-Fi fan myself, but gave this one the exception with the great visuals & bloody effects which I must I say were epic as hell!The film is about some space crew members who go off in search of other crew members who went missing on a voyage through space at Event Horizon. Though they discover something far more sinister & dark when they get there!I found the film to be pretty good, considering I know little about Sci-Fi. Especially the terms, phrases & things they were saying, but it was good & sort of understandable. The gore effects were good though I had heard before watching that there is about 30 minutes of lost footage which got ditched because some pussy wimpy screen testers fainted from the strong extreme gore used! Now that to me was how it should have been, though the film didn't disappoint in terms of gore or graphic violence, I felt the uncut version should've been kept if not released, there is however hope of an uncut release as far back as 2012, though it's been for years & we haven't heard anything since...but fingers crossed! I felt the gore effects in this film were quite restricted & not prolonged enough & could've done with a lot more disgusting vile gore & maggots! But like I said, it was acceptable enough despite the disappointment in the toned down violence! The death scenes were decent enough & some of the visuals didn't disappoint too much. It was an OK kind of film & one worth watching & if not re-watching & this is coming from someone who doesn't much like Sci-Fi films! The ending was satisfying enough & not clichéd like other horror film endings! But it was good. At only 91 minutes & the fast paced feeling I did quite enjoy how fast it moved, though for the sake of seeing prolonged gore & bloody extreme violence I would've wanted it to be longer & wouldn't have minded despite it being Sci-Fi & slightly confusing. I would've killed for the prolonged deleted scenes!I overall found this film to be pretty good despite the lack of gore & prolonged visuals of graphic violence which could've been prolonged more. I would've liked to have seen some graphic blood splattering violence, but unfortunately no. I'm so hoping for the 130 minute directors cut that we've been deprived of all these years!I give this flick a 7/10. If the bloody gory vile scenes were prolonged more & some good bloody kills I would've gave this film a 9 rating, but this cut version gets a generous 7/10! Give this a watch if you like bloody horrors, I did & it was pretty decent! I don't like Sci-Fi films, but with the exception of horror I watched it! I recommend this film despite the cut.",Event Horizon
66,screenman,Vacuous But Scary,7,15 November 2008,"It's a space rescue mission, with a mixed crew of cynical but competent astronauts led by the excellent Larry Fishburne. Sam Neill plays the covertly knowledgeable 'outsider' with a disproportionate say it what goes on. A signal has been received...So far the plot is a very close parallel to 'Aliens'.The signal has come from a space-probe that was officially 'lost' some years before. It's a frightening, garbled noise, once again like that of 'Alien'. Now the vessel has been relocated out amongst the gas giants planets on the edge of the solar system. Authorities need to find out what went wrong. It had several crew members.The effects and set-pieces are extremely well realised. It is very atmospheric. The 'Aliens' like paranoia is etched with a Gothic horror texture that has a hint of 'Hammer' and 'Quatermass' about it.This ship, it transpires, was more than just a probe. It was the first vessel to jump through hyperspace. Somehow, it's come back. And there's nobody home - or so it seems...What follows are a series of set-piece dream-shocks that ratchet-up the tension fairly well. Slowly, the cynical crew become less cynical as they realise that the vessel is possessed. And not only the vessel; so is Sam Neill's character. It's a fairly predictable slaughter-by-turn with nasty fates for those earmarked.The whole internal structure of the vessel has a menacing, Gothic completeness that is so unlike anything typical of human design as - once again - to resemble the spaceship in 'Alien'.It would seem that this vessel passed through some kind of hell out there in hyperspace and is somehow tainted by association. During this time the crew went insane. On board Video-monitors have recorded their behaviour and it ain't pretty. The surviving rescuers need to escape.There is a want of clear explanation between the evident 'evil' we are led to believe exists and its relationship with the 'scientific' universe. The two ideas merge well in effects but unravel at the rational level. I was left extremely disappointed by the denouement.Also, the interior of the vessel is smeared with large splashes of gore that we must assume are the organic remains of the dead crew, and yet nobody even mentions them, does blood or DNA tests or anything. It's as if the mess is either perfectly normal or that only we can see it. Further, in the time that they inhabit the ship, with air replenished and heating on, this stuff would begin to putrefy and quickly stink-out the confined living space. But again; no-one apparently can smell it either.Acting is fair to good, the script rather flaccid, but the effects and tension are first-rate. It just leaves the impression that they didn't quite know what to do with the idea. Perhaps Nigel Kneale should have been consulted.The movie also reminded me of a short story by Cordwainer Smith called 'The Game Of Rat And Dragon', which might well have been its inspiration.Good scares, inadequate resolution.",Event Horizon
67,brando647,Paul W.S. Anderson's Best Movie,8,22 November 2009,"You know what I find most admirable about this film? It proves that Paul W.S. Anderson can create films that aren't mediocre (ALIEN VS. PREDATOR) or crap (MORTAL KOMBAT). I was never a fan of Anderson's films (though I admit DEATH RACE was some mindless fun) but this is the exception to the rule. In the film, a long-lost starship created for faster-than-light travel reappears mysteriously in orbit above Neptune. A rescue crew is dispatched with the ship's creator to recover any survivors and bring the ship home. Once they've arrived, they discover the crew is dead and the ship has returned from a dimension of unknown origins with a dark secret. The film is reminiscent of previous science fiction/horror such as ALIEN, with it's ominous feeling of danger in the isolation of deep space.A good sci-fi/horror is one of my weaknesses. This film has a decent blend of intriguing back-story combined with gore effects that continue to look impressive more than ten years later. Even now, the effects in the film are enough to churn my stomach at points. As a nice change of pace, the film even boasts a decent story, as the crew members of the rescue shuttle fight to escape a ship that's determined to keep them. There are a couple of cheap scares but there is also plenty of intrigue as the Event Horizon's original destination becomes clear.Sam Neill is wonderful as Dr. Weir, the original creator of the Event Horizon who feels himself drawn back to his brainchild inexplicably; Neill is a great actor in my opinion and it was interesting to see him in such a dark role. Laurence Fishburne is a powerful presence as Captain Miller, head of the rescue operation, and there are some strong supporting characters in the form of Joely Richardson and Jason Isaacs. In the end, though, my favorite character would have to be the Event Horizon herself and the evil presence it's taken on with it's return. I've got to give Anderson and his producers credit, as this is one of the best movies he's been attached to. If you're searching for an atmospheric, violent science fiction film, I'm happy to say Anderson's film may, for once, be something worth recommending.",Event Horizon
68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Event Horizon""- Just a solid, fun sci-fi horror experience.",8,3 January 2017,"""Event Horizon"" is one of those films that came out at just the right time, even if it didn't seem like it at first. The brainchild of director Paul WS Anderson and writer Philip Eisner, the movie is a certified cult phenomena. Despite being a moderate financial flop at initial release and garnering decided mixed critical reception, the film quickly found a new life in the home video and rental market, and even now, 20 years later, it remains a favorite for fans of horror and suspense. It became one of the most popular films of the 90's in a weird way thanks to its second life, and I do think it is for good reason- while by no means is ""Event Horizon"" a ""great"" film, it is most certainly great fun. Mildly creepy, well constructed and oftentimes disturbing, it's a very solid sci-fi scare fest.About thirty years in the future, the space-vessel ""Event Horizon"" mysteriously reappears off the orbit of Neptune, after having been thought to be long-since lost. A rescue vessel- the Lewis and Clark- is sent on a mission to track down the fabled ship and see if there are any survivors. On board is a colorful cast of characters, including the Event Horizon's lead designer Dr. William Weir. But it turns out that not all is well- the ship seems to desolate... its crew dead and its mysterious gravity-drive core acting strangely. It soon becomes clear that when its experimental warp drive was activated, the ship crossed into a dark and hellish dimension that drove its crew insane and brought back a mysterious force that now threatens to destroy the Lewis and Clark and its crew. And so the crew of Weir, Captain Miller, Lieutenant Starck and several others are forced into a fight for survival against this mysterious presence...One of the more remarkable things about the film is the sheer Gothic and claustrophobic style that director Anderson injects into each and every frame, and how well it helps to tell the tale with a devilish glee. While he's perhaps best known now as the director of the long-running and wildly divisive ""Resident Evil"" film franchise, Anderson has always been a relatively competent visual storyteller and he has a great eye for style and composition. Building off of the tension and tonality of Eisner's script (which was reportedly re-written by an uncredited Andrew Kevin Walker), Anderson builds an adequate and often frightening sense of mood and tension, and his keen use of both practical and digital effects comes much appreciated.The performances of the cast are quite good, especially for being a relatively serious attempt at a genre film at a time when horror was taking a turn towards the humorous thanks to properties like ""Scream"" injecting a subversive sense of self-awareness. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil in particular excel as our two leads in Captain Miller and Dr. Weir. Fishburne plays a really good authoritative figure in Miller, though he plays it smart and gives small hints of pathos and self- doubt that become apparent more and more as the film moves along, and it gives what could otherwise have been a boring Mary-Sue character a great deal more depth as a result. Neil is just a blast as Dr. Weir, who is haunted by his own demons of the past and goes through some radical changes as the film goes on. Supporting roles by the likes of Jason Isaacs, Joely Richardson and Richard T. Jones are for the most part well-played, though I did find Jones a bit on-the-nose with his more stereotypical role as the ""comedic relief.""Really, the only thing the film suffers for are a few contrived sequences that feel artificial and over-written and for some admittedly dated sequences that just don't hold up quite well. While I do applaud Anderson for mostly mixing his effects between practical and digital, the early half of the film is way too over- reliant on really bad-looking CGI, and it kind of takes you out of the scene for a moment whenever a digital bottle or digital book floats by in zero-gravity. There's also a bit too much effort put into just grossing out the audience or making them jump, and it cheapens the more legitimate sequences of terror. Yes, we know it's fun to toss gore at the screen and insert random jump-scares... but save it for the slasher films and not pictures like this that are genuinely and consistently well-made and frightening without goo and gore and jumps. There's also one really bad dream sequence early on that I won't spoil... but it almost ruins the mood right off the bat. Thankfully, the film quickly recovers and it gets better very quickly, but I definitely think the film could have done without it.But those are really just minor issues in an otherwise fun, engaging and often freakish and frightening tale of terror. There's a reason ""Event Horizon"" eventually found its audience and is still a relatively popular and entertaining bit of sci-fi horror... and that's because it's just so much fun. It's got an intriguing enough plot, wonderful direction and freakish visuals that will stick with your mind, and a really great cast that give it their all. Is it one of the best films of the 90's? No. But I'd venture to say it's one of the most easily rewatchable and fun releases of its decade and I know for sure that even twenty years from now, people will still get a kick out of it.I give ""Event Horizon"" a very good 8 out of 10.",Event Horizon
69,denis888,Abrupt and Not So Thrilling,3,18 October 2013,"This movie was a big buzz back then, but I never managed to watch it in time, so only now I have done that. Well, sometimes, even the great casting does not help - as neither Sam Neill nor Lawrence Fishburne do save this mediocre plot from miserable plodding and very pathetic ending. The plot is very trite and does not leave any thrill or mystery very soon. Yes, very soon you can easily predict the next step and say what will happen and to whom. This is not good, as the trite plot is never an asset but rather a pending tail, that leaves no place for excitement. The very idea of the lost spaceship and lost crew is very old and very quickly the gore comes in, leaving no time to think or ponder. Well, this is a very good work, and this movie leaves you with a very bated feeling of disillusionment and slight boredom - what, is that all that this is? There are better films in this genre, so do not waste time on this one",Event Horizon

71,sme_no_densetsu,A good idea imperfectly executed,7,27 August 2012,"I hadn't seen ""Event Horizon"" in over a decade when I picked up the Special Collector's Edition DVD a while ago on a whim. I remembered it as being a pretty good sci-fi/horror flick but I wasn't sure if it'd still hold up. Also, knowing the background of studio interference, I was curious to see what sort of material was left on the cutting room floor.Now, with the benefit of several more years of movie-watching experience, I can see that the movie is highly derivative. But at least Anderson & company chose good films to borrow from. The general concept of a 'haunted house movie in space' echoes ""Alien"" but Anderson has said himself that his main influences were Kubrick's ""The Shining"" & Wise's ""The Haunting"". Though the film blatantly copies scenes from both of these films and at least a couple of others, this general concept invests the film with some degree of originality.That's not to say that the story completely works, though. Some of the details are intentionally vague, which could equally be the result of sloppy writing. The fact that the third act devolves into a fairly standard action movie climax also undermines the careful building of suspense that provides the bulk of the film's memorable moments.As for the cast, it's not bad but most of the actors are shackled by their clichéd characters. Laurence Fishburne & Sam Neill are solid as always but this isn't exactly the best material they've had to work with. The rest of the cast also perform their functions well, even if their characters don't offer anything we haven't seen countless times before.In terms of production values, ""Event Horizon"" holds it's own for the most part. Despite being only the second best Paul Anderson working in Hollywood today, Paul W.S. Anderson's direction isn't bad. There are some nice shots from time to time and he does a good job of establishing (and maintaining) the film's atmosphere. The visual effects are generally pretty good, though I was less than impressed with some of the 'burning man' visuals.Ultimately, ""Event Horizon"" has some memorable scares but its shortcomings limit its appeal to a cult following. A director's cut would probably improve matters a little but I highly doubt that the movie would rise anywhere near the level of the films that it imitates. Nevertheless, it is worth watching as one of the better science fiction/horror hybrids out there.",Event Horizon

It's a really creepy and existential experience. It goes to the lengths of what is god and the devil. But it's so much more.I don't want to give away the plot. It's about a spaceship that was once lost, but a new spaceship discovers it. And then weird things start to happen. I could even begin to explain.Go see this. Now!!!!!!

73,Screen_Blitz,"Gruesome, eerie science-fiction gorefest boast striking visuals, but shallow writing",6,16 August 2016,"From director Paul W. S. Anderson comes an eerie science-fiction horror thrillers that takes audiences on a ride through it's dark, tasty visuals, but sadly without an alluring screenplay to underpin the stunning aspect. Upon watching this film, it certainly wasn't too difficult to appreciate the efforts Anderson displays on screen; but I could not help but notice the high amount of elements borrowed from many superior science-fiction thrillers like James Cameron's 'Aliens' and John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. It's clear that Anderson is showering in inspiration and knows how to have fun with the genre, but the film as a whole doesn't always work, at least not too well in the narrative department. While it showers the screen with enough blood and gore to make the sensitive crowd squirm and occasional nightmare-inducing to the mix, Anderson attempts on generating a thoroughly frightening experience come with only half-hearted results. Set in the futuristic 2047 in the depths of outer space, the film centers on a crew of astronauts: Captain Miller (played by Laurence Fishburne), Lieutenant Stark (played by Joely Richardson), Cooper (played by Richard Jones), D.J (played by Jason Isaacs), Justin (played by Jack Noseworthy), Smith (played by Sean Pertwee), and Medical Technician Peters (played by Kathleen Quinlan) on an investigation for a lost spaceship known as Event Horizon. Assisted by the creator of Event Horizon, the crew embark on an exploration to the missing spaceship, only to encounter a terrifying force that picks off the crew one by one. Compared to other science-fiction features, this one is nowhere near as memorable or inventive as it sets out to be, nor does it embrace the proper caliber to sustain a truly visceral experience. Luckily, director Paul W. S. Anderson packs just enough thrills and striking visuals to make up a somewhat exciting experience, but the suspense and horror does fall flat at times; especially during the first half. Capturing a claustrophobic atmosphere and nightmarish imagery ranging from grossly deformed human figures with gauged-out eyes, to dismembered mutant bodies, to creepy blood-covered paranormal entities; there is no denying how absurd and horrifying this movie can get as it journeys through plenty of creepy imagery that is bound to make the weak stomach squirm. And the dazzling production design of the spaceship interior and the corridors which borrow heavily from 'Alien' are quite nice to look at, especially with the decent cinematography to expand upon the view. It's too bad however, that the storyline falls short of substance, ending the plot with major questions unanswered (dealing with plot points I rather not spoil) and characters sorely underdeveloped. The crew is trapped in a ship that has been to Hell. As interesting as it is, the film never makes a solid attempt to explain what is going on. Though Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill give an okay, if flawed performances as the lead characters, neither of them manage to stand out too far above the rest of the cast who's characters are left in two-dimensional entities. This is not the stay that none of the characters aren't likable, but sadly none of them are uninteresting in a way that you keep rooting for their survival. And it definitely does not help that the writers pin the characters with inconsistently laughable dialogue. Event Horizon may not the proper narrative heft to support it's flawed storyline, but offers just enough thrills and excitement to make up for the blemishes in it's script. It is not a film that reaches the level of a visceral horror experience, nor does it even come close to. By the end however, it makes for a pulse-pounding thrill ride brought together by the efforts of Paul W. S. Anderson.",Event Horizon
74,oneguyrambling,Deserved cult classic. Excellent and effective space horror flick.,8,17 December 2010,"Event Horizon is at once frustrating and effective, the frustration comes in revisiting the film and realizing that while there is much to admire, there could actually be so much more. The effectiveness comes from the lengthy build up and gradual escalation to the climax that largely lets you ignore the film's failings.Realistically there have been many films set in space over the years, more than a few have aspired to including horror elements, not many have been as well made as this.Event Horizon is a promising film - I keep waiting for the rumoured ""more violent and full on"" Director's cut - unfortunately Paul Anderson didn't build on this promise as everything he has done since has far more commercial leanings, Resident Evil and Death race included.Perhaps he has simply plateaued and it is his destiny to make films with a few good bits, but generally no depth or lasting qualities - or perhaps he likes counting the money made from crappy Resident Evil sequels? ()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*() The Event Horizon was a deep space exploration vessel, but it disappeared on its maiden voyage in 2040. It is now 2047 and the thing has simply reappeared. This has resulted in what they term a rescue mission, but is really a ""what the f*ck happened?"" mission.The team boss-man is Laurence Fishburne (who is still amazingly underrated) and his crew include 7 other members, 6 guys and 2 gals.After a 56 day hypersleep the crew awake very near their destination ()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*() Before commencing the mission proper Dr Weir (Sam Neill) explains wassup. It comes to light that he was the designer of the Event Horizon, and that it is actually a vessel capable of traveling at greater than thought possible speed due to its ability to ""bend space"" to suit its needs.My argument is if they thought faster than the speed of light travel wasn't plausible then how the hell are we expected to swallow ""bending space""? Because this isn't Star Trek, that's why, sh*t just happens to justify the sh*t that follows.Once aboard the crew search for clues that may explain what happened, both to the ship and previous crew. There are signs that something is a little ""off"" but nothing conclusive until one of the younger crew members reaches the core of the ship and things go awry. To add insult to injury the rescue vessel the ""Lewis & Clark"" is damaged and if unrepaired would run out of air within a short time. Always the way.So with the young crew member Justin catatonic the survivors come up with theories, the overriding theme being that the ship won't let them leave and is in fact evil itself. Another neat wrinkle is that the ship is perhaps opening doorways to other dimensions, and not all of them are nice. The good Doc pooh-poohs such theories immediately, even as the crew openly wonder exactly where the Event Horizon might have been for the last 7 years.Shortly afterwards they manage to access the ships' videolog, which gives some pretty gory clues as to what may have happened to the previous crew. Think a picnic on the beach, only with cannibalism, self mutilation and orgies of violence and you'll be pretty close to the mark.Sooooooo understandably everyone wants out. Now. As they prep for their escape each of them sees things and people from their past, often that only they themselves know about and whose stories they have kept hidden for many years. The ship, or something aboard, is preying on their personal fears and affecting their psyche.So we get many scenes that are actually quite tense and disturbing, even though we often don't know exactly what is the problem aside from ""why is that strange new guy/kid/woman on board all of a sudden?"" There are some good gore scenes and notable death scenes that pull no punches and make me curious as to what the full-on unreleased version contained, if exploding eyes and having sex while simultaneously appearing to eat your partner isn't enough then I am confused.You also haven't seen Sam Neill like this, his Dr Weir and the ship seem to have a bizarre and disturbing synergy, and he grows very protective of his bubba as it becomes obvious what the others have in store for it.I haven't mentioned the other crew simply because there is no need, they are there to further the story and either die horribly or cheat death. But I will say that they are effective and no-one lets the team down too much. I wanna bag Joely Richardson a little but her sister (Liam Neeson's missus) died last year so I'll cut her some slack.Event Horizon is filled with freaky imagery, effects and in the latter stages makeup. The production design is first rate with everything looking suitably space-ey even though I think this was a pretty low budget film. The finale didn't quite meet the promise of the first hour or so, but before the bang-bang ending Event Horizon enjoyed a first rate build up and deserves its place in all the underrated lists that it finds itself on, even if it is a step down from the greats.Final Rating – 8 / 10. The guys on Family Guy were right. There are scenes and images that are worthy of discussion. Even if ultimately the film never rises to greatness in any way there are some small touches that elevate this above many also-rans.",Event Horizon
75,xredgarnetx,"Flawed, but watchable, effort",6,13 March 2007,"I have written about EH under another moniker, and have twice trashed this sci-fi/supernatural horror movie. Watching it again does not make it better, like BLADE RUNNER or THE THING, but it has allowed me to spot a thing or two I missed the first or second or even third time around. To recap the plot, a rescue ship arrives at the stranded Event Horizon, a deep space probe, only to find lots of blood and dead bodies and something far worse awaiting them. Anderson borrows heavily from other movies, and EH crosses ALIEN, 2001 and SOLARIS with THE SHINING and HELLRAISER, among others. EH's massive, Gothic-like sets and the sweeping cinematography are magnificent, and the first half of the movie is a humdinger as the rescue crew explores the creepy, sinister EH and begins running into ghosts, or demons, or worse. The second half is a letdown, as we discover that the EH has been where no ship has gone before, into an alternate dimension of pure evil. It doesn't take much to figure where things will be going from that point. Enjoy the first half but skip the second, especially after Sam Neil undergoes his transformation into a poor man's Pinhead. Lots of spooky stuff worth seeing in the first half, though, especially Kathleen Quinlan approaching a sick bay bed where a phantom version of her ill son awaits her under the sheet. I do not care for the film any better today than I did several years ago, but I decided my two previous reviews (written under a name I dare not repeat here) were too perfunctory.",Event Horizon
76,Maciste_Brother,Satan in Space!,2,27 June 2007,"EVENT HORIZON is one of the few films I've regretted seeing at the movies. It was an awful, cringe-worthy movie-going experience and like TOTAL WRECKALL, one of the many science-fiction films released in the 1990s that slowly but surely killed the possibilities of seeing intelligent sci-fi on the big screen. This film is dumber than a box of moon rocks. It follows the by then familiar formula: in the not so distant future, a bunch of astronauts (as expected, they're all ""types"") on a rescue mission in deep space to find a derelict empty spaceship with something terrifying on board. I've seen this story hundreds of times before in such films as ALIEN, THE BLACK HOLE or even going as far back as 1975 with a TV episode from SPACE 1999 called ""Dragon's Domain"". Remarkably, that episode, which was originally shown on TV for everyone to see, is more thought provoking, intelligent and gruesome than this $60 million big budget opus. You'd think that something made 22 years later, with a bigger resources and a cast of capable actors would have resulted with some signs of the genre evolving, progressing but nope, it's the opposite. EVENT HORIZON is a perfect example of a dying genre regressing into a complete moronic state.The beginning WAS promising but that first impression quickly dissipated once the characters started dying, characters we hardly knew or cared about (again, they're just ""types""), all of them butchered in some typically spectacular way, in order to hide the fact that the writing was shallow and the film needed something to prompt the audience from falling asleep or walking away in disappointment. The deaths, as gruesome as they are, amount to nothing because we don't care about the unpleasant crew or their plight. After enduring what seemed an eternity, when we finally arrive at the climax, what little credibility the film had was suddenly blown away because of the dumbest plot point in any science fiction story: blame it all on Satan! Huh, Satan?!?! What does Satan have to do with science fiction? What does a black hole have to do with hell? I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe anyone would be dumb enough to combine these incongruous genre elements in such an unconvincing way. Suddenly, PIGS IN SPACE looks brilliant and groundbreaking next to this turkey. Why would anyone go through the trouble of writing this, producing this, filming this, editing this and releasing this and have it all based on something as hokey as Satan? I mean, I could go to New Jersey to find the devil, nevermind traveling through space and time. Satan, the devil or hell are all earth based concepts and superstitions. They can be effective in horror films which take place on earth but not in a science-fiction film, certainly not this one.EVENT HORIZON reminded me of two things. First, it reminded me of a film called THE EVIL(1978), which is about a group of people (all types) who go to a haunted house and are killed one by one by some supernatural presence which plays with their fears and such. At the film's climax, not unlike EH, Satan himself (played by greasy actor Victor Buono) is revealed to be the one responsible for the killings. That film is unintentionally funny and having ultra camp Buono play Satan was a bad idea. When I saw Buono with little horns I laughed out loud. In EVENT HORIZON, I expected to see Victor Buono appear out of nowhere and start chewing the scenery. The ending in EH is as bad and as unconvincing as the one in THE EVIL.The second thing EVENT HORIZON reminded me of was the brilliant novel CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clark. The plot twist about aliens who look like the devil was a stroke of genius by Clark, who clearly understands the significance of imagery, symbolism and superstition. The novel, though completely different than this film, is a great example of the level of intelligence science fiction can reach even if it deals with hokey imagery like Satan. It's a pity none of this level of intelligence is in evidence throughout this awful film.",Event Horizon

80,jhclues,"Not Much On The ""Horizon""",3,15 September 2000,"**Possible Spoilers**		In an era that has given us such films as `The Matrix' and `The Phantom Menace,' audiences have come to expect a lot, especially visually, and special effects are definitely one of the elements that separates the memorable from the forgettable.  In the case of `Event Horizon,' there are four key elements that separate it from total `B' movie status:  Fishburne, Neill, Quinlan and Richardson; the bottom line is, the story, and the movie itself, just doesn't live up to the star power involved with it.  The Event Horizon is a spacecraft launched in 2040 to explore the `boundaries' of the universe.  Somewhere just past Neptune, it disappears without a trace.  Seven years later, it shows up again, and a search and rescue ship is sent to check it out.  Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) leads the crew, which includes Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson) and Cooper (Richard T. Jones).  Also aboard is Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill), who originally programmed the Event Horizon.  When they finally make contact with the phantom Horizon, they find that the crew is dead or missing, and the only clues they have are from the ships visual logs.  And the news isn't pleasant.  The ship apparently ventured into some other dimension, and returned with a life all it's own, including the ability to discern the vulnerability of whomever happens to be aboard at the time; and when Miller and his crew show up, the Horizon wastes no time in exploiting the fears or remorse of the individuals who have blundered into it's territory.  Soon they find themselves, along with the Horizon's crew, trapped in a virtual `Hell' with nowhere to go; it's like the sci-fi version of `Hotel California,' where you can check in, but you can never leave. 	The concept of the story is interesting, but the transfer from the written page to the screen falls a bit short.  Neither the story nor the characters are developed anywhere near well enough; we get what amounts to a mere glimpse into what makes Miller and Peters tick, and a little more (but still not nearly enough) into the background of Weir.  Throughout the film there are flashes of the Horizon's crew, trapped in this Hell they've entered, with plenty of blood and gore thrown at you very quickly, just enough to give you the idea of what's going on.  But after awhile, these flashes seem redundant and lose any significance they may have had to begin with.  The same process is used to play out the susceptibilities of Miller (what happened to a former crew member of his), Peters (her son) and Weir (his wife).  There are some shocking moments, but not enough to sustain much interest, and the computer graphics are not up to standard by a long shot. Especially early in the film, much of it has an animated look, like what you would have expected maybe twenty years ago (what was great in a movie like `Tron,' for example, doesn't cut it today). 	The supporting cast includes Jack Noseworthy (Justin), Jason Isaacs (D.J.), Sean Pertwee (Smith), Peter Marinker (Kilpatrick), Holley Chant (Claire) and Barclay Wright (Denny).  The performances are credible enough, especially by Fishburne and Quinlan, but director Paul Anderson has wrung little out of what he had to work with, and it's all delivered fairly unimaginatively. The special effects are mediocre, and in the end, what you have with `Event Horizon,' is essentially a pretty decent `B' movie.  There's a few thrills and some suspense, but don't go into this one expecting too much of a return on your investment of time or money.  I rate this one 3/10.",Event Horizon

It carries a Graviton Drive, capable of creating its own ""black hole,"" enabling travel between Neptune and Proxima Centauri (4.7 light-years) in ""about a minute.""

However, this is the first time I have seen this concept applied in a science fiction film.  However, that is the limit of originality the director and writers have applied in EVENT HORIZON.  The movie gets shocking a grisly from the opening scene.  I would suggest both writer an director get themselves a stopwatch and sit through ALIEN, THE EXORCIST and THE HAUNTING (1964).

82,ajs-10,Sadly underrated (IMO)...,8,18 November 2011,"I remember being impressed with this film when I first saw it way back in the late 1990's. It's one of those that, once you've seen it, it keeps coming back to you. I have been meaning to watch it again for some time now and so I though now being as good time as any I popped it in the DVD player, turned the sound up and let her rip! I wasn't disappointed; it's every bit as good as I remember, right down to the pumping 'Prodigy' track that runs over the closing credits. I will give you my take on it after this very brief summary.The experimental spaceship, The Event Horizon, has been missing for seven years after it left the solar system bound for Proxima Centuri. After its beacon is detected in the vicinity of Neptune, a rescue mission is launched. A specialist crew is sent out along with Dr. William Weir, the man who designed the ship. The crew consists of; Captain Miller, Peters, the Med Tech, Lt. Starck, Cooper, Justin, D.J. and Smith. Dr. Weir is haunted with memories of his dead wife, who had recently committed suicide. None of them are prepared for what they find when they reach the, now deserted, Event Horizon. The experimental drive had taken it to places beyond understanding and it hadn't come back alone. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be signing me up for another trip.A very well made film with some really excellent effects. Great performances all round; everyone did a very professional job and made the story believable. So, special praise goes to; Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller, Sam Neill as Dr. William Weir, Kathleen Quinlan as Peters and Joely Richardson as Lt. Starck. Honourable mentions go to; Richard T. Jones as Cooper, Jack Noseworthy as Justin, Jason Isaacs (hello to him) as D.J. and Sean Pertwee as Smith.I must admit I really like this film, how it's got such a low rating on Rotten Tomatoes I will never know! Yes, the plot is a little complicated but I did find it truly scary and there a very few films I can say that about these days. To me I think it's probably the best space horror since the Alien films and it's certainly better than Alien 4! I haven't read what the professional critics have to say on it, but I will stick to my guns and say it's a very underrated Sci-Fi Horror that deserves better recognition Recommended.My Score: 7.7/10.IMDb Score: 6.4/10 (based on 54,832 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 23/100 (based on 35 reviews (No Consensus) counted at the time of going to press).",Event Horizon
83,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Very good and underrated,8,5 September 2008,"In broad strokes, if you take ""The Shining"" plus ""Solaris"" and then add gore-a-plenty, you'll end up with a rough estimate as to what this movie is. However, that hardly does this underrated film the justice that it deserves.From the opening shot to the closing one there are a whole bunch of things that make this an effective horror film. There's the setting, a huge derelict spaceship. There's the question of where is has been and why the crew disappeared. There's also the question as to what made them disappear and is this thing still on board. Naturally, for there to be a movie, the answer to the latter is yes.An interesting thing about this film is that it plays almost like a typical slasher movie, but the catch is that there is no masked psycho with a knife. The killer is the setting itself. Then, what is possibly the most interesting thing is that the film combines straightforward horror sensationalism of gore and violence with a much more eerie and psychological terror akin to ""The Shining.""

84,jrarichards,"Poor man's hybrid of ""Solaris"" and ""Alien"" - unpleasant when not being unsatisfying",6,25 July 2017,"I strangely failed to catch up with British Director Paul Anderson's sci-fi movie ""Event Horizon"" until 20 years after it was made. And now I think I understand why, as this piece does not please the viewer as well as it might. This is a more intriguing failing than it might seem, given quite-adequate special effects on the spacecraft in orbit around Neptune (certainly so for 1997), a pretty reasonable cast (Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs to name but four) and a creepy-enough core plot idea (with a nicely enigmatic little twist at the end).Admittedly, quite a bit of the dialogue here is hammy, the theme music is simply a mistake, the plot realisation is at times predictable, and quite often members of the ""Lewis & Clark"" crew seem to act in slightly unlikely ways (the traditional sin of withholding information from Captain and crew being quite well at work here at regular intervals, for example).But does even this list of misdemeanours account for what happens with this film? I'm not quite sure.What is interesting is that the Neill character Dr William Weir sums up the evil of Hell by reference to eternal chaos and - surprisingly - the film offers up a little slice of that chaos, and it's not pleasant. And, while unpleasantness is not necessarily a crime in a film, or indeed in any other piece of art, the turnoffs here somehow just seem to outweigh any possible rewards of watching, even in a whole that comes in at just 96 minutes.",Event Horizon

87,kuarinofu,This needs an R-rated re-make,7,3 February 2019,"I've seen this around 4 or 5 times now, first at release and the last time pretty much just finished it.
This movie actually makes me sad since it's underdeveloped in almost every aspect.
It is weak as a sci-fi movie, it sucks as a horror since it uses only the most obvious jump scares. The pacing and the editing is clunky. When I watched it the last time I caught myself thinking on how each individual scene could've been easily improved. This movie was clearly inspired by Alien, Aliens, Hellraiser and DooM game series (there are even some Doom easter eggs in the movie). Also, it's hard to watch this in 2019 since the effects really don't hold up, some of them look so bad I don't think they were good even by 1997 standards.
This is frustrating since the movie has some really good gore (and it obviously had more, but it was severely cut by the studio), and a very distinct style in set (and ship) design. Some of the sets they have are amazing, and even though it makes absolutely no sense in terms of actual engineering it still looks amazing. Very nice craft. The actors did their best with a script like that. I mean, some of the ending scenes are so comical and unintentionally funny you really can't handle those any better.
No real point in watching or re-watching this in 2019, but there is a need to re-make this ASAP. I can see this as a kind of slower psychological horror about space isolation with a tint of supernatural. Get a competent director and this would fly for sure.",Event Horizon

The script rips off Alien so much it's a wonder it didn't end in a law suit.A good cast are pretty much all at sea here. Sam Neill is woefully miscast, Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs spend most of the film lighting up cigarettes, as if they had a tobacco sponsorship deal! Laurence Fishburne is better, but the characters are mainly 1-dimensional and uninteresting.There are some nice visuals, and the opening 20 minutes or so are quite well done.

91,anselmdaniel,Scary beginnings with a scattered ending,8,20 February 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Event Horizon is a 1997 science fiction horror movie. The movie is directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, and written by Philip Eisner. The movie stars Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan, and Joely Richardson. The movie follows a distress signal that disappeared during a voyage to reduce travel time. The crew of the Lewis and Clark are sent to investigate the assumed derelict ship.Event Horizon's first two-thirds of the movie is incredibly solid. This part of the movie does an awesome job in its tension and pacing of information. The crew are surprisingly likable with a solid performance from Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller. The crew do their jobs in a believable and logical manner. The exploration of the Event Horizon is incredibly creepy and the hints that are dropped in the first third of the movie sets up the story incredibly well. The sets, costume design, and setting all pervade a sense of dread and horror. This dread and horror is kept up for the first two-thirds of the movie.The story is more about its characters as they remain on the Event Horizon. The audience does get to know Captain Miller well and how he failed his previous crew. Sam Neill as Dr. Weir is also a great addition to the crew and his story is explored. These characters are forced to deal with their dark pasts caused by the ship as well as its supernatural presence.The movie fails in dialogue. I wished that the movie could have had better written dialogue. The movie has incredibly cheesy and terrible lines of dialogue. This gets worse as the movie goes on. The movie's last third act is incredibly messy. This last third act has a resurrected Dr. Weir talking to Captain Miller in cheesy lines. The entire third act's problem is how the movie did lead up to this point however the climax could not deliver.I would recommend 'Event Horizon'. Although the movie's last third act is flawed, it is still an enjoyable and horrific science-fiction horror movie.Grade: B",Event Horizon

93,ctomvelu-1,It will grow on you,7,9 November 2008,"Like BLADE RUNNER and THE THING, EVENT HORIZON will grow on you with repeated viewings. It is impossible to absorb every little detail that occurs in this sci-fi horror classic based on a single viewing. Sam Neil and Larry Fishburne head out to take a look at a manned spacecraft that disappeared years before and has suddenly reappeared in space. Everyone on board is dead and the ship appears to be possessed (whichit is). The body count among the rescue crew quickly begins to mount. The movie is basically a haunted house in space, and it can be scary as hell. It also can get pretty silly, as it does in the second half when it borrows a little too liberally from HELLRAISER. Director Paul (RESIDENT EVIL) Anderson does a terrific job with the massive sets and eerie lighting and quirky characters, but the script ultimately fails him. Best bet: watch it once all the way through, then watch only the first half on second viewing. If you insist on watching the whole thing a second time, from the point at which medical technician Kathleen Qunilan meets her grisly fate, keep one eye closed for the rest of the film. But man oh man, that first half is a real humdinger.",Event Horizon
94,innocuous,Don't you hate to see good money wasted?,5,12 May 2010,"Well, actually, I hate to see bad money wasted, too, but you get my point. A lot of effort went into this film and it should have turned out better than it did. The SFX aren't too bad, and the sets look nice, but the primitive CGI is kind of obvious. The ""weightless"" scenes are also pretty glaring. (Take the lead from the Alien quadrilogy...don't show weightlessness if you don't have to.) Unfortunately, there were a lot ""clang"" moments in this movie. If a ship and its crew travel to a place of utter ""chaos,"" how could they come back in the condition that they did? I mean, chaos is, by definition, disorganization. It takes an awful lot of organization, the opposite of chaos, to accomplish what the ship (or the evil entity, or whatever) did. And what trained crew member, no matter how he feels, is going to think, ""Oh, that must be my kid, who I know is actually 47 million miles away, running down the corridor of my sealed spaceship""? It's just hard to identify with the characters.Other than that, it's kind of OK. Anderson does a pretty poor job of editing and you end up confused about where you are at anytime, but I attribute this to his wanting to keep the viewer disoriented.Worth viewing, but it falls short of its potential.",Event Horizon
95,moviesleuth2,"Mediocre first half, creepy second half",7,17 May 2009,"""Event Horizon"" is still working itself out when it starts. It doesn't iron out all the kinks until the movie is half-over. The first half tries, but fails, to be creepy. However, once it finds its rhythm, ""Event Horizon"" is VERY creepy.About 50 years into the future, a research vessel called the Event Horizon just disappears. No contact, no trace of what happened or where it went. Seven years later, it reappears, and a rescue crew is sent to investigate. Tagging along is the ship's creator, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill). Once they get there, strange things start happening...The biggest problem with ""Event Horizon"" is that the first half just isn't creepy. Paul W. S. Anderson (not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson or the guy-who-shouldn't-be-making-films Wes Anderson) tries to create tension, but at first, the ""creepy"" goings on aren't, well, creepy. There's no sense of danger, and it's surprising that the actors (specifically Kathleen Quinlan in one scene) seem as spooked as they are. Therefore, the film has to rely on atmosphere to generate tension. While I'm not saying that the ""Event Horizon"" isn't a creepy place from the get-go (it is), it's just not creepy enough.This shouldn't be construed to mean that the first hour of the film is boring. While it may not get the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up, it's always interesting. The ship is just begging to be explored, and the question of what happened to the ship (and its crew) is always one everyone's mind.Acting is stronger here than it usually is for this kind of a movie. Laurence Fishburne has a commanding presence as the rescue ship's captain. This was a thinly written character, but Fishburne makes a character out of him. Sam Neill is wasted for the first half, but he becomes a lot better when he has something to do. Joely Richardson doesn't get to do much in terms of character, but she doesn't blow it. Jason Issacs, one of my favorite actors waiting for their big break, creates a dark, but amiable person as DJ. Richard T. Jones (who provides some comic relief), Jack Noseworthy and Sean Pertwee round out the cast with solid, if unmemorable, performances.Director Paul W.S. Anderson has a lot of control over his material, but he makes some blunders as well. His sense of atmosphere needs fine tuning, but even in a movie like this, he has great control of his actors. He can't always create tension, but he always has the audience's interest. This is a solid offering from the man who would later bring us the Resident Evil movies.The special effects vary as well. Granted, this movie was made over a decade ago, but even then some of them could have been better worked out. The explosions look nice, the gore doesn't look fake, and the big effects shots (like of the whole ship) are very real and meticulously detailed. However, the little things don't fare as well. For example, the objects that fly across the room in zero gravity are obviously computer generated, and the computers look as if they were made before ""Alien"" (in production time, not the setting).I know I've been rather vague, and for that I apologize. But I'd still recommend ""Event Horizon."" It's not perfect, but it's not a very bad way to waste a good hour and a half.",Event Horizon

However, the ship wasn't left untouched: something else is on board. . . but who, or what, is it? And what does it want? For some reason, Paul W.S. Anderson has had a bad reputation among horror fans. I'm not entirely sure why. . . seeing as he's not bad at what he does. Sure, his writing for AVP and Resident Evil wasn't the best, but he's not a bad action director. Or, at least, he's an acceptable one that knows how to get what he wants on the screen. Event Horizon, while another sci-fi/horror like the aforementioned, is in a league of its own in comparison to the rest of Anderson's work. It is truly terrifying. Imagine a savage blend of Alien, The Haunting, Hellraiser, and even some Don't Look Now and The Shining to boot. The performances (especially Sam Neill's chilling portrayal of Dr. Weir) were great. The supporting cast of Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series), Sean Pertwee (Dog Soldiers), Joely Richardson (Nip/Tuck), and Kathleen Quinlan (The Hills Have Eyes remake) also all put out solid performances. Luckily for them, they had quality dialogue written for them while Cooper's character (Richard T. Jones) was a horribly written ""token black guy"" character. Frankly, it was pretty annoying to have his humorous character popping up with dumb lines during extremely intense situations (especially one in particular at the end). Regardless, the film was still damn great. The gore/violence were fantastic. The suspense and tension can rival that of many films. Adrian Biddle's (V for Vendetta, Aliens) cinematography was beautiful. And, it all came together into a well made and scary sci-fi/horror film.Final Verdict: 8/10.-AP3-",Event Horizon

103,TheExpatriate700,"Great Climax, But Otherwise Unmemorable",6,13 June 2012,"I was drawn to Event Horizon largely on the basis of deleted scenes I had seen on YouTube, particularly the famous orgy of destruction sequence. Although the climax lived up to the expectations this scene created, the rest of the film was middling at best. The plot involves a rescue mission sent out after the long lost space ship Event Horizon reappears.The film's main selling point, other than its genuinely unsettling climax, is the presence of talented actors like Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, which takes the film up a notch. Indeed, the film's early scenes give it a gritty realism, as the characters genuinely act like members of the military on an unexpected mission. However, there is not enough character development for the actors to work with, except for the Captain and Weir.Furthermore, much of the imagery is clearly lifted from earlier films like Hellraiser and The Shining. Although Paul W. S. Anderson deserves credit for not turning the film into an Alien rip off, most of the film does not come across as particularly original.The climax, with its visions of hell, earns the film a lot of slack, nonetheless. Heavily influenced by Hellraiser, it still manages to pack quite a wallop and will unnerve even veteran horror fans.

106,AndyVanScoyoc,This movie will scare the hell out of you! {May contain spoilers},10,19 August 2004,"I am terrified of this movie...or I should say that I WAS terrified of it. I have now since conquered my phobia of this movie and am just now able to write a review of it. I saw this movie in 1997 when it came out and it is the only horror movie, that in my entire life of watching horror, starting with ""JAWS"" at age 7, that, as an adult, scared me so badly that it made me sick and I had nightmares over it. It is graphic, it is gory and there is just something about the dark and evil scenes that pervade this movie that one can't get over. It's not something that ""goes bump in the night"" but an all out terror that seems to seep into one's subconscious as this movie unfolds. Being a Goth/Macabre/Erotica author, I am used to gore and graphic death scenes, using them quite often in what I write, but the scenes of evil carnage in this movie are simply something that defy description. Even now I find myself struggling with how to describe something that, once you see this movie, never really seems to leave you.The cast for this movie was incredible and I can't see any other cast doing as well as this one did. Laurence Fishburne is gruff and business first in his role of Captain Miller. Sam Neill...what can I say about him except that he was one horrifying character as Dr. William Weir, an obsessed and nightmare plagued man, with deranged dreams of his dead wife and wanting to go back to the Event Horizon, no matter what. The ship called to him and his wife called to him...there was no stopping him. I must take a moment to say that Sam Neill was so convincing as the psychotic and murderous Dr. Weir that it took me years before I could watch anything with him in it, no matter what it was, he frightened me so badly. Now THAT is acting!The supporting cast was just as electrifying. Richard T. Jones, as Cooper, the Rescue Tech gave some of the MUCH needed comedy relief when things became too tense and Jason Isaacs as D.J, Trauma, was ice cold but undoubtedly frightened when he finally deciphers the real message on the cryptic distress signal recording that the crew was allowed to hear, from the doomed last crew of the cursed ship. His fear is realistic, chilling.
Jack Noseworthy, as Justin, Engineer, put in one of the best, if not much too brief performances of his life as the first victim of the Event Horizon's new crew, being sucked into the ""gateway"" and thus traveling to where the Event Horizon had been...hell. ""The dark inside me"" he proclaims in a fit of violent convulsion and that is simply the beginning of the trouble, and makes this movie an edge of your seat masterpiece.Kathleen Quinlan as Peters, Med Tech was tragic, haunted by not being able to be with her son, Joely Richardson as Lt. Starck, Executive Officer was strong and believable and Sean Pertwee as Pilot Smith had probably one of the best lines in the movie, ""this ship is f*cked"" and his loathing of the damned, Event Horizon is evident from the minute he steps on board.I now own this movie and watch it often. If you want non-stop action, horrifying special effects, and graphic gore, then this movie is any suspense and horror lover's dream. I would recommend this movie highly...but only if you have a strong stomach. Oh and it might help to have the lights on as well...""Liberate tutemae ex inferis.""",Event Horizon
107,whatch-17931,"Semi-classic, but not for everyone",9,1 February 2021,"This movie steals with reckless abandon, but pulls it all together so well, it's really quite charming. There are obvious bits from Alien and The Shining, and several others. Arguably, even from Saturn 3, and that film stole like crazy too, but not with such a good result.You can tell this was rushed out because they were forced to, but with a charming and convincing performance by Fishburne, a multifaceted performance by the always interesting chameleon Neill, and lots of other on and off screen talent, it manages to be quite effective. Neill even has a solid (if disturbing) character arc.It's very nice to see Neptune get a chance to shine, and they even show a far more realistic depiction of a human exposed to a vacuum than most films, perhaps the most realistic since 2001: A Space Odyssey.It's absurd in a lot of ways, lol, of course, like why in the world does the engine room look like a hellish torture chamber?As for the gore level- there is some, and the first bit you see is kind of when you sit up and realize this isn't just a tired Alien retread. Notoriously, much of it was ordered CUT by the panicking studio. It would be neat to see the original cut, but the amount that was in the release might have been just about right.

108,ExpendableMan,A criminally under rated horror masterpiece,8,24 May 2006,"Unfairly dismissed as a combination of Alien and Hellraiser, Event Horizon is one of those films that should be ranked among the classics of it's genre yet has somehow fallen by the wayside to be revered by movie geeks and horror aficionados but ultimately ignored by the mainstream. What's especially surprising is that this excellent film came from the directing skills of Paul W Anderson who was also responsible for such tragic misfires as Resident Evil and Alien Versus Predator and shows that there is more to Hollywood's Generic Director For Hire than first imagined.Set in the year 2047 the story concerns the sudden reappearance of a prototype spaceship (the Event Horizon of the title) which vanished on it's maiden voyage seven years previously. A salvage ship called The Lewis And Clark is sent out to investigate and brings along Dr William Weir (Sam Neil), a physics expert originally responsible for the ship's creation. They dock with the Horizon but find no signs of life and as they set about making repairs, the crew begin to experience hallucinations and sense that they are not alone...So far so very familiar but this is far, far more than a rip off disguising itself as a 'homage.' For one thing there is no predatory alien hunter on the loose and instead the horror is far more psychological. Not that there isn't a fair amount of violence and gore but the gradual sense of unease that builds up to it is crafted more on the crew's growing sense of anxiety and paranoia. Plus, there is no definitive explanation given for what they are experiencing. Just what are these Ghosts from their pasts doing on this ship? And what exists on the other side of the black hole? Another dimension where mankind was never meant to go or as the movie itself suggests but doesn't confirm, the very depths of hell itself? Couple this with the excellent set design - the ship is modelled on the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris - and the pulse-pounding moments in the latter half when the chaos sets in and you have one tremendously enjoyable horror film. Best watched alone at night with all the lights off where you can properly get swept up in it's claustrophobic atmosphere, you'll never need eyes to see again.",Event Horizon

110,Jacques98,Am I really the only person who thought this was the cheesiest movie of all time?,1,21 September 2008,"I have a handful of friends who refuse to watch horror movies because they think they're all pure cheese. Event Horizon is definitely gives their argument some backbone. Here is one of the most acclaimed and said to be the scariest movies among horror fans, but when I watched it all I could do is chuckle. Event Horizon is cheese horror, and here is why: - The casting is horrible. The characters are not only all clichés, but they're clichés who can't act. They say some of the stupidest lines in the history of cinemalike, ""Look, a corpse-sickle!""and then act as if they've said the most intelligent thing ever. It's ridicules.The entire movie is filled with melodramatic scenes. Something bad will happen, then it's accompanied by a laughing man imitating Dr. Eviland everyone still takes him seriously. One of the absolute cheesiest lines is, ""Once you're evil, you don't need eyes . . ."" as Dr. Evil-wannabe cackles in his chair. Sorry, I didn't know I was watching a comedy.There is no atmosphere, tension, suspense, or terror. The movie jumps strait from the opening to the scenes that are supposed to be scary, but never gives you any suspense or atmosphere. The ship is so abstract it looks like one of those play places at McDonalds or something, not a bearer of doom that the movie expects you to think of it as.Why does EVERY sci-fi movie have to rip-off Medline L'Engle's book A Wrinkle In Time, then think it's the first movie to come up with the idea? I could list at least 10 movies that have done that, and this makes number 11. Great, we get it: if you fold space you can go from one place to the other faster. We get it already. Think of something new, please. We understood it in the 60's, we understand it now. What I don't understand is why EVERY sci-fi movie can't think of something even slightly new instead of using the same old tired cliché and acting as if it's the first time we ever heard it.There were at least 5 wake-up-and-it's-just-a-dream sequences in this movie, and every time they just get cheesier and cheesier.I'm not even sure there is more for me to complain about because all that is fresh in my mind is how cheesy Event Horizon was. I cannot remember a single minute of the runtime that I actually found something serious or scary. Sure, I can understand why some people would find this movie scary, because as Stephen King proved hundreds of times, cheese scares people. But for someone like me who is spoiled by truly good sci-fi/horror movies, like Alien, I simply can't take this seriously. The premise is great, but that's all I can give it. I think this movie proves that everything Paul W.S. Anderson turns to cheese. If he directed it, even if it's somehow acclaimed, don't see it.1/10",Event Horizon
111,tburke85,Event Horizon A Spooky Horror Thriller With Some Flaws,6,16 June 2009,"Event Horizon is a spooky horror thriller with some flaws from director Paul W.S. Anderson whose admirable in making this movie about a rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned with someone or something on board lurking in the shadows waiting for it's chance to strike. The movie is suspenseful, with some gruesome deaths, and solid performances by the cast. But there are some flaws that weigh the film down. I'll get back to that. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Laurence Fishburne as the hero, Sam Neill in a rare hero/villain role, Joely Richarson, and Kathleen Quinlan. Jason Isaacs, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, and Jack Noseworthy are effective as the supporting characters but some of them lack development because their roles are cut short. The special effects are impressive and the film does offer enough suspense but the ending wasn't the greatest. If they had changed the ending somehow it would've been a little better. There was some suspense but there could have been more and there weren't any real scares except for a couple of them. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered except for a few brief explanations from Neill's character about how the drive works and where it could have taken the other crew. I would have given it a higher rating if there was a clearer explanation to what exactly happened. The deaths however were well executed and brutal. The brief glimpses of people being tortured in grotesque ways were graphic and realistic. Neill's character was right when he says, ""hell is just a word the reality is much much worse."" Well his character was definitely right which doesn't mean good news for Laurence Fishburne and his rescue team who have responded to Event Horizon's distress beacon.

The crew receive a message which I initially thought to contain only the most terrible and to the bone shaking shouts I have ever heard. There was a short text there, among that shouting, which is quite stupidly still undeciphered at those moments(though they had received that message some time before)...oh well, that's not the only stupid thing, but they can most certainly be ignored. These few words get more on the way(hmmm) and from their initial meaning ""Save me"" they transform to ""Save yourself from hell""(that's what Latin can do to you)...but everybody goes on the ship which is the only one capable of traveling at speeds higher than the speed of light(""going around the theory of relativity"") Once on the ship one of the crew members will suffer an accident and the crew's ship will be damaged, these being elements which will prolong the stay on ""Event Horizon""...where our ""friends"" will start hearing strange things, will start seeing strange things and ,worse of all, will start living through them.Some have said that the characters are practically inexistent...I can not agree. They are very shallow, some of them are ""inexistent"", but the main focus point is on the ship and the ""horror"" not on the characters. Still we learn some things about them...the ones least described are exactly the two survivors...strangely enough.As I said, this film scared me...it shows disturbing images, of which some are really gruesome and which could have been omitted, but which make ""a hell"" out of ""Event Horizon"". Anderson actually achieved to scare you through more than just the ferocious images, but he also did it with the sound...a hard thing to achieve, which I haven't seen  accomplished recently. There's not much else to say. For me, in general, horror movies do not have to present any deep message(though, if there's a smart ""head"" behind them, he can get more horror out of such things than out of images) but it has to scare. I am not pleased if I see a movie which tries to ""use"" the ""deep-message tactic"" and then presents a boring and rarely entertaining flick. When I want horror, I just want horror...most certainly, too much of ""image"" horror would make me feel fed up at one point, but considering that this is the first horror movie I've seen this decade(the first REAL one) I can't be unhappy. If you want to get scared...take this piece: 8/10",Event Horizon
114,bazmitch23,"""Do you see? Do you see? DO YOU SEE?""",9,16 October 2013,"I've seen this movie over 20 times. I love it. And I'm not a big Anderson fan. Now, his wife on the other hand.........Anyway, I'm a big 90's kid and this is a true 90's horror film. The idea of a haunted house movie in a spaceship is a good one. Anderson may suck as a writer, but he actually not that bad of a director. As long as he is not writing the script, it's okay.He knew how to scare people with this movie. The jump scares are great and there is a lot of moments that make you cringe. Like the video footage scene and D.J.'s demise. (shudder!) For me, the most intense scene is when Justin is in the airlock without a suit. This scene really had me on the edge of my seat.The Effects are still great. The model for the Event Horizon looks amazing. There are a few moments of poor CGI, like the scene where Justin goes into the core and there's bad CGI blobs everywhere and when the Lewis and Clark explodes. But everything else holds up today.And you gotta love that corridor. It's so HUGE! The filmmakers used a very big mirror to make it look bigger. Same trick used in Aliens.The performances are great. Sam Neil is very creepy as Dr Weir, and Richard T. Jones was very funny as Cooper. Normally the comic relief is the most annoying character in the film. But Cooper works because he's not played by a comedian, he's not annoying and he's not stereotypical. Also, they avoid the ""Killing the black guy"" cliché. Well, Miller dies though.However, some of the editing in the climax between Miller and Weir is a bit choppy and what's with the massive close ups on Weir's mouth in that scene? A failure on release, but has found it's audience on TV and DVD. There are teenagers discovering Event Horizon today. Overall, the best movie Anderson has made. I think he said that this is his favourite movie he's done.",Event Horizon
115,TheHande,The Hell from Space,8,23 February 2007,"Not being the biggest fan of horror-films I must admit that Event Horizon is an extremely competent production in spite of its unsightly gore. The characters and the concept of space travel, which is interestingly rather accurate, give the film a much needed grounding before the real horror elements start to kick in.This movie can be considered a lot of things... 'Hellraiser in Space', 'The Shining in Space' but ultimately it borrows from so many sources that it's impossible to name any single source. In this pieced-together fashion the film works the same way casting actors of various types works well. Fisburne and Sam Neill are the dramatic heart of the film and Anderson's regular, Jason Isaacs, gives a typically strong performance.However, the film does use plenty of conventional horror-film elements and some of these are rather distracting. The ending for instance may not necessarily lack closure, but it may not be the type of closure I was looking for.All in all, however, a film worth seeing.",Event Horizon
116,rparham,Effectively disturbing,7,2 October 2004,"At first glance, Event Horizon would appear to be a science fiction film through and through. It's set in the future, features spacecraft and the men and women who fly them, and is about a rescue mission to another spacecraft. Yet, before long, it's quickly obvious that Event Horizon is, in fact, a horror film set in space, and a surprisingly effective one at that. While not a masterpiece, it is a reasonably disturbing film.Event Horizon opens in the mid 21st century, where man has attempted faster-than-light travel. The vessel built for this was the space ship the Event Horizon, and it contained at it's heart an artificial singularity, a miniature black hole if you will, that will open a door to another part of the universe. Upon first test of the engine, the ship disappeared, not to be heard from again. Seven years later, it reappears in orbit over Neptune and a rescue ship, the Lewis & Clark, is dispatched to determine if there are survivors, and what happened to the Event Horizon. Along for the ride is the ship's designer, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), whos going through a strong trauma in his life after his wife has recently committed suicide. The crew of the Lewis & Clark, commanded by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), listen to Weir's explanation of what happened to the Event Horizon and then receive a transmission from the ship that is garbled but seems to suggest a not so pleasant fate for the crew. The Lewis & Clark crew dock with the Event Horizon and begin investigating the ghost ship, but find strange happenings occurring throughout, with different members of the crew seeing strange things: Miller sees a man he left for dead on an exploding vessel, medical officer Peters (Kathleen Quinland) sees her crippled son, and the ships engineer, Justin (Jack Noseworthy) looked into the singularity engine and is put into a state of shock and Weir begins seeing visions of his wife.It quickly becomes apparent that the Event Horizon has been somewhere other than another part of the galaxy, and it has brought something back with it.Event Horizon is not a groundbreaking entry in the horror genre, that's for sure. Many aspects on display have been utilized in countless other films. And yet, director Paul Anderson manages to give us the requisite chills and leave us on the edge of our seats. A primary element that helps the film is the Event Horizon itself. Designed with a very Gothic look in mind, the ship just looks and feels scary. It is place I can't imagine anyone ever being comfortable being in. The dark, empty hallways and rooms are menacing themselves, and that helps ratchet up the tension. Anderson also does a good job of crafting suspenseful scenes involving the character's visions. Almost every one of those sequences will leave you unsure of what you will see and that keeps the audience in a state of unease.As the film progresses, there is an increase in make-up effects grusomeness, so I would agree that it makes it a difficult film to watch as it goes on. However, most everything in the last half-hour is payoff to the setup, so while it's not always pretty to watch, it makes it all the more effective.Acting wise, Event Horizon is decent, but nobody will be well remembered for their work. Sam Neill is probably the most memorable as the slowly disintegrating Weir, tumbling to madness before our eyes. Laurence Fishbure is effective as the hard-nosed captain, and everyone else gets the job done.A lot of people gave Event Horizon flack upon it's release, and again, it's not the most original horror film made, but it is one of the more disturbing I saw in the mid to late '90s, and I would give it a recommendation, just be careful watching it by yourself.",Event Horizon
117,aleksanderk-95350,Freaky,7,1 October 2021,"I really enjoyed this film it had a great mix of horror and sci fi. The plot felt fresh and different enough to make it unique. The acting was well done Sam Neil is fantastic as always. The effects especially for 1997 looked great in the film. It did a good job at being freaky and scary. I think some of the gore, took away from the film as it felt under at times. Overall good film definitely worth watching.",Event Horizon
118,TheOny13,I'm Waiting! Aaaaahhhhh!,10,17 November 2020,"Oh man! I've waited for ages to see this film. So the other day I got a chance to watch Event Horizon and, wow I was surprised by how good and effectve this movie was. I've heard good things about this movie even though it's production had quite a lot of problems. It seems there was a longer version of this movie that clocked about 130 minutes, while the final version is 96 minutes. Would've made for a better version? Sadly we'll never know because the archive was stored in a salt mine in Transilvania and degraded beyong recovering when it was found. All this was made because the test audiences at Paramount we're absolutely shocked by the gore of this movie. Anyway the version we got was probably one of the most tight, well written, well acted sci-fy horror movies that I've seen and with one of the best atmospheres in any horror film. So what makes Event Horizon such a good movie for me?I'll try to stay off spoilers and only presenting what the plot of this movie is about. So the movie is about a ship called Louis and Clark going on a rescue mission in search for Event Horizon. The first ship that had a gravity core that powered the ship and made it travel long distances quickly. But the ship disappeared when it first activated the core. So now The Louis and Clark is going on a rescue mission to find the ship and salvage what can be saved from it. The movie starts by directly throwing you into the mission and presenting the rescue ship and the crew members. The movie, just like most of them back in the pre 2000 movies, tightly presents the characters and their background. And what makes this movie even better is that over the course of the movie even what happens to them reveal past experiences from their lives which gives them more depth and characterization and ultimately makes the viewer more involved into what happens to them, especially since what happens to them has to do with aspects of their lives. Here I'll go into another thing I loved about Event Horizon. Generaly almost all of the characters make mostly wise decisions, trying to combate the growing threat of the ship they are trying to rescue and better than that, when they don't take good decisions, they usually end up paying for that, and pretty costly to be honest. That brings me to another aspect: the characters. They are all interesting and unique, played by good actors who give their best performance with the script they got. The movie also portrays them excelently, showing aspects from their lives that allow us to get to know them better and be more interested in where the movie is going with them. The actors also do a great job, and it's nice to see actual experienced actors for once in a horror movie. Usually horror movies are made of young inexperienced actors looking to score their big break and make a name for themselves. But here all the actors are pretty mature and middle-aged so that they put on believable performances which make the movie all the more interesting to watch. The script is also very tight combining a lot of information in a very short amount of time, like Weir's story about his wife or Peter's relationship with her son or Miller's past and so on. It's all done very efficiently and quickly without wasting any time. The score is also pretty good, nothing special but only fitting the movie. The special effects are both extraordinary and ugly. And that's maybe the only gripe I might have with this movie: The VFX are at times awfull like objectts floating in the ship or explosions in the ship, which look like some PS2 game, but the special effects, and I mean the real made ones are absolutely flawless! They build the gravity core and the whole Event Horizon ship. And it's nice to see practical effects at use instead of the CGI nonsense that is in most of today's movies. The story is also very good, like it reveals more as it goes along and you find out certain characters know more than they let you know. Also, certain characters' motivation change during the movie and not in a bad way, illogical or just plain dumb (like in The Last Jedi) but rather their choices are logical and in consistency with the story up until then. Then there's the horror and the gore which is absolutely savage! I mean I haven't seen so much gore, violence and scares since, well... Game of Thrones (violence), The Thing (the gore) or The Shining (the scares). Needless to say that this movie is violent, gory and scary. And if you are a horror fan that wants to be entertained, scared and horrified, then this is the movie for you.Honestly I was expecting a pretty entertaining horror movie with really not much of a story or logic or intelligence, but what I got truly subverted my expectation. This movie is sharp, tense, scary, violent, clever and with great story and performances. In other words, it's practically everything I could hope for from a horror movie. Shame it was so terribly butchered in the editing to fit the release of Titanic, and that it was released at such a bad timing. That might have made a bad impression on the critics who gave it like 35% on metacritic and 28% on RT. Ha... remember when anyone cared about what they say? Ultimately, Event Horrizon is a tight, well written, well acted, scary, gory and atmosphericaly tense horror movie. Basically everything I for once would hope for from a horror movie. 10/10",Event Horizon
119,tigerfish50,Derelict Spaceship Lands in a Haunted House,1,27 July 2014,"There are numerous Sci-Fi films jostling at the front of the pack for the ""Worst Ever' accolade, and 'Event Horizon' should certainly be considered one of the top contenders. Although the film has upscale production values, penny-pinching in the screen-writing budget becomes obvious as soon as the characters open their mouths. The story's introduction reveals an experimental faster-than-light spaceship had gone missing on its maiden flight. Seven years later it has mysteriously reappeared orbiting Neptune, and another vessel is dispatched to investigate.On board this rescue ship, the astronauts are bickering like toddlers long before they arrive at their destination. When an exploratory team ventures into the derelict hulk's industrial-Gothic interior, their intelligence goes into terminal decline as the hack screenplay plunges them into a crude gore-and-horror fest. They start screaming at one another like hysterics, while the soundtrack ramps up the melodrama in a lame attempt to disguise the deficiencies of the material. None of the routine nastiness makes any sense, and the eventual explanation for the vessel's cursed condition is pitifully weak. After '2001' and 'Alien' had shown the possibilities for modern Sci-Fi, 'Event Horizon' is a severe disappointment which gives the entire genre a bad name.",Event Horizon

122,pumaye,A magnificent effort,8,11 May 2002,"This movie needs more than one vision to be fully appreciated: the basic idea is magnificent, so as it is visually stimulating, almost stunning in a creation of a Gothic spaceship. Images from the architecture of the Event Horizon are to remain fixed in your brain for years to come. The worst part is probably in the script that suggest too much, but doesn't explain almost anything in the end. This seems to be frustrating for most people (even me in the first occasion I saw the movie), but after repeated viewings you start to enjoy the sense of infinite doom, of cosmic horror in a modern Lovecraftian sort of way that permeate the story and its characters. It could be one of the greatest SF movies of all time, with a little more courage from both the director and the screenwriter. As it stands, it is still worth your time again and again",Event Horizon
123,Siamois,An underrated gem...,7,1 April 2009,"Director Paul Anderson has let me down on a number of occasions but Event Horizon is not of of them. In fact, this entertaining adventure in space is his best film.The main reason Event Horizon is such a success is that it visits many genres, jumping nicely from one to the other. At its heart is ""horror in space"". Science-fiction with overtones of HP Lovecraft and Clive Barker. But the key to Event Horizon is that it always aims to entertain and never takes itself seriously. We don't dwell too much on the science, it's just made as evocative as possible for the story to work. The characters are sketched just enough for us to care about them, but Anderson is aware this isn't a character drama, so again doesn't lose too much time with sappy backstories. It helps that the cast absolutely rocks. The brilliant Sam Neill, Larry Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan and the very underrated Jason Isaacs. Despite the high tension and graphic horror, Even Horizon even has well-placed humorous bits, thanks in great part to the character of Cooper (played hilariously by Richard T. Jones).The architecture and science behind the ship (called the Event Horizon) is simply beautiful and great and contributes to the thrill ride. The ship itself becomes a character. The direction itself is a little sloppy. Some scenes rather uninspired and the editing a bit sloppy. Anderson hints in interviews that the film needed to be rushed due to studio pressure and since a lot of footage has apparently been lost, no true ""director's cut"" will ever do it proper justice.What we are left with is a movie that is too entertaining to pass, especially for fans of horror and sci-fi. Repeated viewings show that the film has very few dull moments. A solid and unique entry that inspired subsequent films (such as Sunshine).Highly recommended if you do not take your sci-fi too seriously.",Event Horizon
124,andy-227,Scared the #@*% out of me!,6,4 February 1999,"""Event Horizon"" scared the livin'...  well you know what I mean.  The taglines say ""Infinite Space, Infinite Terror"".  It doesn't say much, and it gives you the wrong impression of what you will see in this film.  After the poster and the trailers, I wrote this one off.  Then I caught it on HBO, so decided to check it out.  I suffered from insomnia after that.  IT'S THAT SCARY!!!  It's not the ship or the characters that caught my attention.  I thought the characterization was very poor (it's hard to tell or care about who's who).  But what scared me was the movie's ""monster"".  There really isn't one.  Instead, it has a demonic spirit from hell!  Many people say that this borrowed from ""Hellraiser"", but I think this was pulled off better.  It's a bomb in characterization, but it's a masterpiece of horror. I can't remember the last time I was this scared.  I mean, it really scared me!  Plus, the problem with ""Hellraiser"" is that they show you too much of the ""Hell"" stuff.  ""Event Horizon"" blasts its hell in our faces, as quick and as fierce as a strobe-light flash.  It's mean!  And at the end of the film, instead of a resolution, we don't quite get an ending.  Nor an implication of a sequel.  We get the idea that the demon was never really defeated, that the crew was never really saved.  And with that, the intense buildup of fear that is at it's peak at the climax of the film, never really leaves us!  We can't leave the fear thrown at us after the movie is finished. ""I told you she won't let me leave, she won't let anyone leave."" I honestly believe, that when the film is finished, that notorious line is true!",Event Horizon

It's always a movie I'd wanted to watch but wow did I not expect it to turn out as it did.If anything the story and overall plot is the most interesting thing about the movie and it's wasn't a drag to watch. But it fails at any depth or character building. The plot allows the story to get away with a ton of stuff. Some fun, some just weird.The classic punching sound effects, weird casting choice and funky music just all feel either bad, or odd. And sure, it was made in a different time. But to me it seemed like what if you give a triple A budget to a horror slasher director with a cool plot idea.The horror, there is definilty enough, and to this day still has some crazy images and moments thanks to all the practical fx. That said this movie is also filled with VFX and they simply haven't aged well so it's something you need to look beyond.All in all this was an okay movie. For me it was a movie that hit it right in the middle, not outlandish, comedic and gory, but also not too safe and I would guess a great starting point for the early horror fans of the 90s. 5.5/10.",Event Horizon
126,Come-and-Review,Could have been developed much better,5,11 March 2017,"It's been a while since I've reviewed a film on IMDb, but on this one I felt the urge to do so. Event Horizon has a well-thought premise, which simply fails to become anything good. The ""starship in distress"" trope has been used in many films, and much better. One such film was Solaris.The fact is, I enjoyed Event Horizon's first half or so. It had some stupid jump scares, all right, but until then, the mystery was well executed. I believe the story started to get stupid and ridiculous when a certain video showed up.Who's seen Solaris (mind, the 1972 Tarkovskij film) might remember a similar plot: a Space station near a planet reports of certain anomalies that occur on board, as well as the breakdown of the scientists working on the station, and a Psichologist, Kris, is sent. When the Kris gets aboard, a long series of really unsettling and scary events and circumstances ignite to the viewer, and what's relevant, with almost no gore. Some might say Solaris is boring, but, damn it isn't. It's very scary, and also much deeper than many movies. Now, Solaris is also a masterpiece of cinema. Is it fair to confront this film and Solaris?The fact is, that the story of the two films is similar. Sam Neill's character is in this movie's first half in almost the same situation as Kevin, there's the theme of the unknown and the alien dealt with in a similar manner, the setting is almost entirely one space ship / station's corridors.So whats's the difference? The way the material was dealt with. Solaris is clever, unsettling, lets the viewer have deep thoughts but also freaks him out. Event Horizon is, on the other hand, full of Jumpscares (a quite cheap way of scaring the viewer), mentions superficially some aspects that might have been dealt more deeply (e.g. what happened to the ship), and destroys all the premises it built up in the last 30 minutes, letting go to a flow of endless gore (another cheap way of scaring the viewer). Even the ending wasn't satisfying. All the actors did the best they could, Sam Neil for example executed well his role, even in the final arc, even if I personally hated that part of the film. VFX and photography, for a 97 movie, were fine-ish, as well, also I remember that I appreciated some shots and even the set designs. The technical side of the film was well executed. What went wrong, terribly wrong, was the story, and the ultimate meaning of the film.The movie's first 20 minutes made me want to give it an 8/10, the next 30 minutes a 6/10. The final arc was worth a 3/10. Therefore, I feel right to give it a 4.75/10, approximated via IMDb rating system to 5/10.",Event Horizon

The film begins and it's other obvious influence of ""Alien"" (and ""Aliens"" for that matter) also shows, only these people don't feel like real, working class people like the ones in ""Alien"", they feel like movie characters, and this continues throughout the film. They pause during dramatic moments, they are sometimes seemingly unfazed by the chaos around them. The choppy editing, pointless Dutch camera angles and crash zooms, and the constant, cliché score take a lot of the tension out of the film, and each jumpscare is incredibly predictable and ineffective. Unlike its supposed influences, it does not create a sense of tension and dread through silence, but rather only uses silence for a few seconds before each jumpscare. Not to mention the incredibly cheesy special effects that attempted to use CGI, and failed horribly, looking far worse than ""Alien"", ""The Thing"", ""The Shining"", and it's many other much older influences.Paul W.S.

Yawn. One character transforms into something resembling a ""Hellraiser"" Cenobite and the ending smacks of the ""Alien"" series of films. As a sci-fi film, it could have been so much more complex and involving, but the lazy ""All Black Holes lead to Hell"" premise slams the door on a more imaginative explanation of the original Event Horizon crew's bizarre behaviour and messy deaths. Less emphasis on gore and simple shock tactics might have swayed me more in the film's favour, but ultimately the screenplay cops out of asking questions. Instead the viewer has to strap in for a derivative ""thrill"" ride. I watched the film until the end - hoping that it would get better - but I reckon that most of the budget went on the wonderful production design and the wages for the talented cast.I'd be interested to see a Director's Cut (if Paul Anderson ever releases one) but it would have to be a lot more like ""Solaris"" or the first of the ""Hellraiser"" films for me to recommend it.",Event Horizon

140,xbrad68,SCARY SCIENCE FICTION AT ITS BEST,10,20 June 2004,EVENT HORIZON is scary science fiction at its best. The sphere that thinks on board the ship the EVENT HORIZON is like a biomechanical computer that terrifies everyone it encounters. The ship went missing seven years earlier as it was testing faster than light travel. It picked up a sphere of unknown origin and then at faster than light speed was lost in a black hole. The rescue ship LEWIS AND CLARK arrives seven years later. Some reviewers have callously described the ship LEWIS AND CLARK as a salvage ship. Calling a ship LEWIS AND CLARK seems to imply a schism of the mind because it is multiple named and foreshadows the madness among the spacefarers that is to come caused by the sphere. The interaction between Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller and Sam Neill as Dr William Weir is OK but two great actors seem to be limited by the words in the script. It is revealed that both men must have gone into the sphere and a real fear of faster than light travel begins to manifest itself. I gave EVENT HORIZON a 10 out of 10 mainly for its cutting edge special effects.,Event Horizon
141,MetalGeek,Underrated-As-Hell Sci Fi/Horror Hybrid,7,13 September 2010,"""Event Horizon"" came into theatres in 1997 without much fanfare and disappeared in about a week, but when I rented it on video (back in the VHS days) I found it to be a very enjoyable blend of science fiction and horror with great special effects and set design, creepy atmosphere to spare, and decent performances from veteran character actors like Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne. Why wasn't this movie better promoted? Over the years it's slowly been developing a well deserved cult following, as more and more people discover this underrated gem. I just picked up the 2-DVD ""Collector's Edition"" of the film and after viewing it I am pleased to report that ""Event Horizon"" is still holding up well.""EH"" tends to get comparisons like ""The Shining in space"" or ""A combination of Alien and The Exorcist,"" none of which are entirely accurate, yet the influence of all of those films (plus many more) are definitely part of ""Event Horizon's"" DNA. The film I immediately think of is 1979's ""The Black Hole,"" which also revolved around a group of space explorers discovering the derelict hulk of a long-lost space ship, but once our intrepid crew is on board the title craft the film turns into something akin to ""Hellraiser"" more than anything else.Our story: it's 2047 and the mammoth space ship ""Event Horizon,"" which disappeared without a trace seven years earlier on a mission to the outer reaches of the Universe, has suddenly reappeared in an orbit around Neptune. A rescue crew is dispatched headed by Laurence Fishburne (whose Shakespearean voice can make even the most empty headed science-fiction techno-jargon dialogue sound deep and meaningful) and Sam Neill, the scientist who designed and built the Event Horizon. He's especially proud of its more-or-less-theoretical ""gravity drive,"" which supposedly can travel through dimensions via a ""gateway"" that had never been attempted before. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that traveling through this supposed ""gateway"" is going to be the core of the movie. Once on board the Event Horizon, they find no survivors, just a lot of blood splattered on the walls and an occasional frozen, mutilated corpse drifting past in zero-gravity. It quickly becomes obvious that something horrible happened to the Event Horizon when it left our universe, and as the crew explores the ship it also seems that the craft brought something back WITH them from that trip, which wants all of their souls. One by one the crewmen are plagued with visions of hellish torture, or of traumatic events from their own pasts, and several of them meet gory deaths until the survivors realize that they must get off this ship as quickly as possible, before the evil possessing it claims them all as victims.The real star of the movie is the set designer (whoever he or she was; fantastic job!), the ""Event Horizon"" resembles a hellish cathedral of some sort (even before the evil sets in) that will make the viewer uncomfortable from the get-go. Of the human cast, Sam Neill gets to have the most fun, as he is eventually taken over by the horror of his creation and goes all Interstellar Jack Torrance on the innocent salvage crew.Judging from the reviews on this site, ""Event Horizon"" is either a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" kind of film. You can count me as one who loved it, and I will definitely be watching it again in the future. Too bad director Paul Anderson has yet to live up to the promise he showed in this movie.",Event Horizon
142,Vigilante-407,A terrifying journey into space,9,29 June 2001,"I know a lot of folks don't like Event Horizon, but I found it to be one of the few truly chilling sci-fi horror films that I have seen in the past two decades.A rescue mission is sent out after a long-lost spaceship (the Event Horizon) reappears in orbit around Neptune.  The ship was actually the first attempt at faster-than-light travel, and used a unique method of bending space developed by Sam Neill's scientist...which inadvertantly sent the ship and its original crew outside the universe, and into a world of complete chaos that approximates Hell.  Unfortunately, the rescue party doesn't know this, and doesn't know that the ship wants to go back.Both Sam Neill and Lawrence Fishburne given outstanding performances.  Neill is excellent as the scientist who has given all (including his wife's life - by suicide) to create the Event Horizon, and gradually loses his mind to the haunted ship.  Fishburne is the commander of the rescue mission who refuses to leave any of his crew behind, and wants to destroy the ship before it takes them all back to the other dimension. His own dedication to that ideal rivals Neill's insane desire to go back with this ship.There are many similarities between this movie and other science fiction works (including Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and particular Sphere, which came out years later), but I believe that Event Horizon stands on its own as a masterpiece of horror.",Event Horizon
143,DanLives1980,This is Techno Horror!,8,6 April 2012,"Event Horizon is a perfect ensemble collaboration of talent, which takes the basic elements of separate genre legends such as Aliens and The Shining. Essentially it's a clash of religion and science and I suppose what might have happened had they merged Aliens with The Shining.Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil) and writer Philip Eisner (The Mutant Chronicles) made their finest ever film with Event Horizon, the story of a rescue and salvage ship crew employed by Dr Weir, the first scientist to create inter-dimensional space travel, whose titular spaceship sent out a distress call before disappearing into oblivion.The ship has returned and is floating dead in space just outside of Jupiter's atmosphere, its crew has vanished. Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishburne) and his crew, board the ship only to discover the remains of the doomed Event Horizon's crew and to begin salvaging disturbing evidence that the ship - which itself begins to show signs of life - may have traveled to someplace beyond just another dimension.Firstly, I was surprised over time to learn of the writer and director's separate careers. According to IMDb, Philip Eisner hasn't worked since The Mutant Chronicles and I'm not surprised. It was awful. I only watched it because I generally like Thomas Jane's films and it seemed like a good watch just by the trailer.The only other film I really liked from Anderson meanwhile was Death Race. I wish he'd just let Resident Evil die and not come back like the retarded zombies it's all about. Bullet to the head and bye-bye, baby!What makes their first effort work here is the minimalist attitude towards the horror element and the amount of work put into the element of suspense and character building. Otherwise it's down to the clean and safely used CGI and set-pieces and overall, the actors.Lawrence Fishburne who hadn't made a great film up until then since King of New York was a great choice for Captain Miller. He assumes control with ease and just gets the job done like every plain and ordinary working man's boss does, rather than try to shine.Sam Neill as Dr Weir takes the reins of the troubled genius like a true theatre legend, showing why he has been one of the industry's consistently best actors since his re-emergence as a mature actor in psycho thriller Dead Calm. Here he really busts out the dramatic and hams it up to good effect when necessary, making him very much the main event, which I suppose he was meant to be.The backing cast also consisted of some very admirable talent including fellow Brits Joely Richardson as the cold hearted and sensible Ripley-alike second in command, Jason Isaacs as the ship's medic and psychologist and genre legend Sean Pertwee as the typically English grease monkey mechanic. The Yanks gave us legend Kathleen Quinlan as the resident med tech and Richard T. Jones and Jack Noseworthy as the salvage crew. Far from retiring to their characters' stereotypes, the actors play on it well but still develop a good rapport with each other.As I remember one of the most impressive and surprising appearances was of the techno-punk band The Prodigy, who supplied the disturbed twisted metal connoting soundtrack. This served well in the film's overall theme and the filler tracks are suspenseful and heavily suggesting of just how crazy the film gets as it progresses.Since Event Horizon there have been a number of similar themed runaway successes from mainstream and B-Movies alike but rather than giving the opinion that Event Horizon had followed on where genre creator Alien had given it the inspiration, Event has managed to create a genre of its own. If you haven't seen it and you have a budding horror and sci-fi classics DVD collection, this needs to be a part of it!",Event Horizon
144,stefankrs,Good space horror,7,16 September 2021,"This movie is really underrated, but I can tell why. This movie isn't for everyone. This movie is about a lost space ship called ""Event Horizon"" and a rescue team responding to its radio transmission and investigating the ship.

It doesn't have the greatest plot and may sound dumb but it is very entertaining and visually pleasing.",Event Horizon
145,BeanieCore,A refreshing take on sci-fi horror.,8,11 January 2021,"By the time ""Event Horizon"" premiered in 1997, sci-fi horror had already been played out in many ways. Films like ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" saw dozens of low-budget knock-offs, with the sub-genre so oversaturated that it had devolved into a collection of clichés. But this little film happened to inject the formula with enough originality to become a cult classic, and even stands as one of the better films in it's wheelhouse. Refreshingly, the film opts on old-school scares rather than extra-terrestrial terror. It's pretty much a ""ghost ship"" tale, but with the ship in question being a spacecraft. Still, the film's namesake ship is just as imposing and frightening a structure as any haunted cruise ship. There is great attention to detail regarding it's interior, and some incredibly striking, memorable visuals. It's the ship's long, unending tunnels, dark corridors and strange architecture that create a truly imposing atmosphere. The film's scares aren't all that original, and there's a handful of cheap jumps, but there's also plenty of gruesome body horror and grisly imagery. These moments aren't overtly gory, but the fleeting manner in which these nightmarish images are edited leave them lingering in the mind afterwards. The cast is good as well, and while none of the characters are especially deeply written, they are likeable and believable. Much like the original ""Alien"", the script smartly makes it's characters relatable workmen, rather than space marines or brilliant scientists. Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburn are especially good in the lead roles. It's not the most original film, and it does have some issues, like an underwhelming ending shot, but it's a very effective, very creepy flick. One that ends up sticking with the viewer more than they might have thought. In the end, it's very deserving of it's cult status, and a must for any sci-fi horror fan.",Event Horizon

The entire complexity of the film changes.It's an eerie and lonely journey, with the third act not to my taste.",Event Horizon
147,thelastblogontheleft,Sci-Fi Awesomeness,8,27 November 2016,"This was my second viewing of Event Horizon and I loved it even more than the first. I've heard it described as some kind of bizarre lovechild of Alien and Hellraiser and while I agree that it pays homage to both (I mean, Clive Barker DID consult on the movie in pre-production), it's definitely its own strange beast. It's also worth noting that this film did not do well upon its release, grossing only $47 million or so, not even recouping its $60 million production budget.It's likely that I'm going to love any horror, sci-fi, or thriller based in space. Not only is space completely bad ass and fascinating on its own, but it's a TERRIFYING setting for literally anything to go wrong. YOU'RE IN SPACE. There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no way to escape hell, there's often not even a reliable way to communicate with anyone outside of your own ship/base. It's isolating in the best (and worst) kind of way.In Event Horizon, it's the crew of the Lewis and Clark — including the fearless Captain Miller (played by Laurence Fishburne) — who are heading out to explore the mysteriously re-appeared Event Horizon after receiving a distress signal. It had disappeared during its maiden voyage 7 years prior, so they are on a mission to see what went wrong, and they've brought along the ship's designer, Dr. William Weir (played by Sam Neill).It's pretty obvious from the get-go that something went horribly wrong. They find the crew all massacred. They check out the core of the ship which is one of the coolest damn things I've seen anywhere (and was originally supposed to have a much more sleek, futuristic look until Paul W.S. Anderson, the director, decided to give it a more mechanical, interlocking design as a homage to Hellraiser's puzzle box), and when the ship's gravity drive is knocked into action, it activates and then one of the crew puts his freaking arm through it (I am continually amazed by how many movie characters will just put their body into another dimension) and goes full blown catatonic from what he saw on the other side, and shortly after attempts suicide and is put into stasis.The entire crew experiences intense hallucinations that seem to be catered to their own fears and emotions. They are, of course, stranded at this point, since the Lewis and Clark was damaged and repairs are taking longer than they hoped. They find the last video log of the Event Horizon's crew and it is messed up, including the captain holding up his just gouged out eyes and warning ""liberate tuteme ex inferis"" (""save yourself from hell""). CHILLS. Things are not going well and they soon come to realize that the ship has, thanks to its gravity drive, managed to get to some kind of otherworldly (and obviously hellish) dimension, and now has a life of its own, its only goal to lure its passengers back to hell. Crap.""You can't leave. She won't let you.""The tension is, understandably, high throughout the entire movie. Even before things start to go wrong, it's made clear that the crew is not excited about their voyage, having been called off of a scheduled leave to make it. The atmosphere, though, is what really makes it. You are just creeped out the entire time. It's not even in the same realm as a movie that centers around a serial killer or any kind of single being wreaking havoc. It's THE SHIP YOU'RE TRAVELING IN. The ship you're stuck in is literally trying to destroy you and drag you to hell. Creepy doesn't begin to cover it. It has a decent amount of gore and disturbing images, so it's interesting to know that Anderson had to cut a good 30 minutes from his original version of the movie to appease the test audiences and studio (which he apparently regretted later).""I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars, but she's gone much, much farther than that. She tore a hole in our universe, a gateway to another dimension. A dimension of pure chaos. Pure evil. When she crossed over, she was just a ship. But when she came back she was alive! Look at her, Miller. Isn't she beautiful?""There's also some fantastic scenes that stick out in my mind. The frozen body that had been previously floating around smashing to the ground (and to pieces) when the gravity is switched back on. The sound of Peters' son scraping against the plastic on the exam table during one of her hallucinations. Dr. Weir traveling through the green duct with the lights strobing on and off. Justin snapping back into reality while he's in the airlock and starting to panic, begging ""Mama Bear, open the door"". When they realize they made a mistake in the transmission translation, originally thinking it said ""save me from hell"" but now knowing it said ""save yourself from hell"". Just so good. And the sole survivors are a black man and a woman, so, BONUS.",Event Horizon
148,AJ4F,The ship's name held promise but the film fell short,5,3 September 2013,"I watched this after reading a Stephen Hawking book in which ""event horizon"" was described in terms of general relativity and black hole physics. But the hammering soundtrack in the opening credits warned me that this film probably wouldn't rise to the elegance of that concept. It had too many standard plot devices and was never really scary to me.Here are some issues, starting with most annoying first:1) You'd think that an advanced spaceship crew would be educated like today's astronauts, not blue collar types easily bored by the scientist's explanation of a ""singularity"" and other aspects of black hole travel. They'd send the best of the best on such a critical mission, not jive talkers and impatient drones. ""Say it in plain English!"" is ridiculously overused in movies and insults an intelligent audience. A real crew of that caliber would understand black holes well beyond his folded paper demo. I know it was done for the audience's sake, but still.2) The steam-punk gravity drive and the general interior of the ship seemed deliberately designed to convey malice, not functionality. It's almost as if the ship was built as a haunted house. Why all the spikes in the doors that humans pass through? OSHA wouldn't allow such a ship to be built. The gravity drive seemed more like a medieval torture device than something modern engineering would come up with. I suppose all the spikes could be related to magnetism but it wasn't explained.3) The blood in the ship's structure had no scientific context. It played like a ripoff of ""The Shining."" This movie was too big on ""fi"" and too small on ""sci."" They should have toned down the gore.4) Technical aspects, like the guy in the airlock spewing that much blood and living, or the astronaut being propelled back toward the planet with his breathing pack seemed ludicrous. The electronics damage to the rescue ship seemed impossible to fix. It needed a lot more than skin patches. Why do so many movies show sparks flying from sophisticated instruments which are miraculously repaired in hours?5) The premise that we'd already colonized the Moon by 2015 was ridiculously optimistic, even in 1997.Still, it kept me entertained enough to see it through, so I gave it a neutral 5.I'd recommend ""Solaris"" (2002) for a much better depiction of mentally conjured people, etc. The elements of that in ""Event Horizon"" were done in sledgehammer style, though the eyeless wife did give me a jolt.",Event Horizon
149,mboyd1986,Not Worth Watching,2,14 September 2007,"If you like to be scared by someone walking up behind you a popping a balloon to make you jump, then you'll love this film.If you like a well thought out plot, good dialogue, etc, forget this film.I've watched this film many times and each time I've switched off at different times when I've gotten fed up being treated like an idiot by the director Paul W.S. Anderson. Today I switched off after 5 minutes. So why do I keep watching it? Because I can't remember what happened, but I know the graphics are good and I think it's SCI-FI. It doesn't take long for me to remember why.If he wants to make you 'scared' by suddenly putting a gory picture on the screen with no warning, or making a loud noise or getting the background music to play very loudly, then I don't want to be bothered with this film.This film is to ""horror"" as slapstick is to comedy. Unfortunately, Mr Anderson will probably take that as a compliment.For those who think this is an underrated horror movie... what have you been watching lately? I guess what's really bad about this film is that after spending all the money on the graphics and the set, the only way they can make you scared is by making you jump.I'm sure another director (look up other films by Paul W.S. Anderson to see what class he has) could have made this film a success.",Event Horizon
150,TheSeaLion,An underrated sci-fi horror flick,6,24 April 2014,"There were two films that ""Event Horizon"" reminded me of. The first movie it reminded me of was Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" from 1979 where a crew aboard a freighter goes down to a planet, brings back the alien creature, and then has it pick off the crew one by one. The other film I was reminded of was the film ""Sphere"" based off a novel by Michael Crichton where a team underwater finds a futuristic spaceship and discovers a sphere on it which allows the people who enter it to create real threats with their thoughts. ""Event Horizon"" has the scary, dramatic thrill that ""Alien"" had, but also some of the stupidity that ""Sphere"" had.In the year 2040, the starship 'Event Horizon' disappeared on its maiden voyage. Seven years later, a distress signal from the ship has been received and the crew of the rescue vessel 'Lewis and Clark', along with Dr. Weir (Sam Neil) who helped build the ship, are sent to investigate it. Upon arriving at the ship, they find the crew all dead, but that there are still life-sign readings. Upon further investigation, it turns out that the ship entered a black hole and emerged, now with something controlling it.Starting off, the crew of the ship is not all that interesting. There is a stereotypical comedic relief character named Cooper (Richard T. Jones), a member of the crew who was whisked away from her son's birthday named Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), and several others. The only two characters in the film who stand out as even remotely interesting are Dr. Weir and Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne). However, with the exception of Cooper, the characters are not annoying blank slates that are just there for cannon fodder and, for the most part, you can at least be mildly worried about what the outcome for the character might be.I really appreciate that in a film like this that was made in the late '90s that they did not resort to CGI to create the ships and used models instead, and that the use of CGI was very restricted. The use of models for the ships reminded me and helped me picture the setting of ""Alien"", which I think the film was basing its horror movie in space premise off of. The film was not more interested in showing special effects than it was on telling the story it wanted to tell, which I am glad about. Another notable thing to mention is the design of the 'Event Horizon' is an original spaceship design that I have never seen in any other movie or television show.After the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' look around and investigate the ship, the movie starts to go into the stupidity territory with its plot. The ship used its gravity-drive to enter another universe via a black hole and when it came out, the ship began to screw with its crew, and now the 'Lewis and Clark' crew's minds. I liked the fact that there was not a monster that was on the ship that picked the crew off and it was more of a psychological horror story for the cast, but the idea that the ship is now alive and doing that is ludicrous, even in science-fiction terms. There is not an A.I in the ship's computer that went haywire from the black hole, or the ship is not just stuck in between the two universes, the ship is simply alive and is scaring them.At the end, I became a little fed up with the movie because it did the only thing dumber than having the ship be alive. It brought back Dr. Weir, who beforehand had been sucked into space via an opening in the ship after he was, I have no idea so let's just say infected, by the ship. The ship brings him back, now as a monster to confront Captain Miller. The film does have some stupid moments in it; sometimes really stupid moments, but it also has a genuinely creepy atmosphere and tone to it, and the idea that the crew is being attacked by their thoughts and not some scary space creature is something I enjoyed. While I will not say this is an underrated masterpiece, I will say it is an underrated film that more people should watch.",Event Horizon
151,Alcaminhante,One of the BEST sci-fi movies in ten years ! They don´t make them like this anymore.,10,8 May 1999,"This movie steals ideas from so many movies, that everybody involved in it should be in jail ! But is this a bad thing ? Not at all !It would be bad if all this amount of rip-offs were badly used, but they´re not. They´re very well blended giving the movie a strange unique atmosphere, that we know doesn´t belong to it. But it works great !The only thing i didn´t like about "" Event Horizon "", was that i would like to see more at the end. It ended too fast for my taste while it promissed much exploration.But that´s fine because the end, although totaly cliché, works just fine for this movie. I wasn´t expecting it to be any different, when the movie was such a mix of stolen bits from others. Anyone who expected otherwise is more of an idiot, than this movie has been called by the american critics.Here in Europe, this movie was considered in many reviews, the best american sci-fi movie in 10 years, along with "" Contact "". And i couldn´t agree more.Nowadays it seems that there are no more good scifi movies produced in Hollywood. No more "" Dune "", "" 2010 "", "" Alien "", "" Blade Runner "", "" Aliens "" , "" The Abyss "" and the same goes for horror movies.They just don´t scare people anymore. They´re always just about a bunch of teenagers being butchered even when the movie starts by promissing some good ideas. Today they just make us jump on our seats, repeating the same scenes over and over. They don´t frighten us anymore.I can´t remember when i felt afraid watching an american horror movie. Sin ce "" Friday the 13th "", they all became a joke. Probably the last scary one was the first "" Poltergeist "" back in 83. ( in part because i was 13 ) Since then everything has been a laugh.Until "" Event Horizon "" came along. I don´t care what they say about it in the states. This is a very good horror movie. The best in years, and an excelent scifi adventure with very solid and believable special effects.The atmosphere is perfect and it makes us feel really uncomfortable sometimes. It´s that what frighten us, not the usual scares. You´ll choke, eating popcorns and watching this !The gothic production design is magnificent although We can see were the designers got inspiration from, but its an excellent work. The soundtrack is excellent with very creepy moments and great use of silence. The sound is perfect too.The actors should be proud of their work, because all have very believable characters, even when they have small parts.I´ve seen an interview with Lawrence Fishburn, in a program about the worst movies of the year. The reporter jokes about how crap "" Event Horizon "" was and i couldn´t believe what i was seeing, because Laurence F. almost apologises and asks for pardon for being in this movie !! The only thing i can say is that the Hollywood system really sucks. The reporter made it sound like if, the actor did another film like this, his career could be in danger. And i only could think, WHY ?!! There is nothing wrong with this movie people !I even think this is a great achievement, the way their creators stole from every place, but they managed to make a fantastic supernatural traditional ghost movie. Replace the starship with an old house, and we get the same effect. An excellent horror movie."" Event Horizon "" should be praised for this, not put down, like it was done in the states.I bet if the makers of this movie, had replaced the adult cast, with a bunch of cool teenagers and called it "" SCREAM in Space ! "", this would have been a major hit and we would already be watching part 2 right now. Because that seems to be the actual trend in Hollywood this days. I don´t have nothing against a good popcorn movie. The "" SCREAM "" movies are great and very fun to watch, but why thrash another good movie just because it tries to do something diferent for a change ?Space is an excellent place to haunt. Let´s have some more ghosts in there please. Forget the aliens.This is the way to make a good product out of stolen ideas. Producers, take note.",Event Horizon
152,R_O_U_S,Bodes well for Aliens v Predator,9,16 February 2004,"One of those films which deserves its placing through its initial effect on me.  Seldom have I been more shat up by a film.  Most of the big scares are false ones  hands on someone's shoulder etc  but it still had me on the edge of my seat, as the cliche has it.  It looks wonderful  check out not just the Event Horizon itself but also the zoom out from Sam Neill at the beginning, which just keeps going and going...  Maybe it does rip off Hellraiser, and maybe there are bits that don't make sense, but it does have a bloke on fire, Sean Pertwee (always a plus), a member of one of Britain's noblest acting dynasties being almost drowned in blood, and a truly horrible scene where one character goes out of an airlock.  This proves that the generally accepted `Paul WS Anderson is a talentless hack' line is pure baloney.",Event Horizon
153,trnjamesbond,The Dark Within Us,8,8 October 2010,"I have just watched this movie again and I wanted to write a review on it. It is not a perfect film by any means. But it has a lot of fantasy thinking. The opening score of the film is very energetic with a mix between electronica style music and symphony with dark subtle undertones, it makes you feel that your on the last downward spiral of a really great roller coaster ride. And to ask a question, is the technology in this film based on fact or fiction? When I sit down to watch this movie it makes me believe every time that this kind of space travel might be plausible in the future. It is by any means a simple detective styled film, mixed in with horror and science fiction. An excellent combination by any standards of the film making process.I think this is why the story works for me. The way I look at horror films in general, or any film actually, is do the main characters appearing on screen seem likable? Bad or Good. And in this film they are. Sam Neil is excellent as usual and also Lawrence Fishburn, which I admit to be a very strong believable character of the film. The supporting cast does exactly what they are suppose to do within their character range. As we are all introduced at the beginning of the film, as the captain introduces the crew to Dr. Weir's character, this is why this works. We get to know the characters and learn to like them. The only character in the film that I feel uncomfortable with is Sam Neil's character. With the beginning intro of his wife committing suicide. So you know right away that this person is unstable. You could call it foreshadowing. So right away you know this character might be trouble. Because eventually you find out that he is the weakest person of the crew, unknowingly to the rest of the characters.The fact that the crew has no idea that what they are about to encounter makes this movie even more watchable. You feel how they feel confused and scared. Not knowing what is lurking in the bowels of the Event Horizon. It's like a being in a fugue state of mind, the flight or fright scenario. What would you do if you were seeing all these things that creep up to you from your bad past memories, contorting the them in front of you, and you know in your mind that maybe what you are seeing lifelike in front of your eyes, may or may not be true? Or is this unseen monster mocking your weaknesses? I would be frightened to these horrible visions. That's why I recommend this highly underrated film to everyone.The reason being, you don't really ever get to see where the ship Event Horizon went, or what the old crew encountered. You never really get to see the monster, the only thing that is portrayed in this wonderfully written and directed film is our own inner demons. And I think even today in the year 2010 that this is the true formula of making a great film, it's the idea of the unknown, the mystery and suspense. In all great horror films you always like the characters, you sometimes find something even in the monster that you see in yourself. I think that it is very hard to write something like this and make you feel that through the filming process. This movie has the quality of being a classic. And I truly appreciate all the hard work that was put into this film through the great acting and excellent film direction. It's always a lot of fun to watch from time to time. And is part of my movie collection.",Event Horizon

155,Field78,"This movie went to Hell and back, and left a piece of it inside me!",8,9 June 2014,"Event Horizon is one of those underrated science fiction movies with a legendary troubled production, but the finished product, despite some obvious flaws, still had a solid core that deserved to be seen. Nevertheless, it took an undeserved beating from critics, and the praises from admirers were drown out by cries of derision from detractors. But then it became a cult-phenomenon. Fans congregated on websites and learned that they were not alone in their admiration. Behind-the-scenes footage showed the intention of the filmmakers, deleted material, and sometimes a glimpse of what could have been.'Hollow', 'boring', 'overly depending on special effects' and 'not scary' were some of the complaints heard on the initial release. Well, 'not scary' is something I didn't believe from the start. I have never been able to finish this movie without a light on (especially not after hearing that last transmission played by Weir). The idea that a ship returns with a presence that can turn even the most rational person into a ragingly aggressive, mutilating animal scares me beyond anything that I can imagine. Although I am not an overly religious person, the notion that something resembling 'Hell' could physically exist is more than I want to contemplate. The potential beast inside us and others as the ultimate scare, it is a pretty original gimmick that few horror movies actually employ. With such a solid-gold premise, EH is one of the scariest movies of all time to me. It sadly is not among the very BEST scary movies ever, but it occupies a special place for me.Paul W. Anderson made a lot of not-too-memorable movies, but this 'Shining in space' guarantees him some cult-status (perhaps because he didn't write it?). The wise casting of not-too-familiar character actors makes it not completely obvious which characters are going to die. It also provides sturdy performances from Lawrence Fishburn as the plagued but determined captain, and from Sam Neill, whose surprising but believable turn towards evil in the second half is actually one of the movie's strongest assets. The ships' interior designs and props seemed a bit clunky and unrealistic to me at first, but the future isn't necessarily Star Trek perfect; EH shows us a state-of-the-art ship still very much limited by human imperfections. It is easy to see how ahead of its time this design was in the 90s, and another reason why the movie deserves a re-assessment. By giving the ship the look and feel of a church, the connection with Hell as a place where the sinners are to be judged is aptly made, showing that the makers tried to put in a subtext beyond the ordinary slasher movie. Cinematographer Adrian Biddle uses sweeping camera shots to capture the dark beauty, but knows to keep it steady during the action scenes. Usually, horror works best off-screen, but some of the shock effects, ranging from empty eye sockets to a horribly twisted sado-masochistic home video, are the stuff nightmares are made of, and deserve to be shown in full g(l)ory. The nerve-wrecking sound design makes these scenes perfectly timed, heart-pounding moments. But the biggest impact comes from the 'Visions from Hell', which show glimpses of some of the most gruesome images of mangling and torture ever committed to film outside of a snuff movie. Of course, I couldn't resist going through those scenes frame by frame. I really shouldn't have. I have a pretty good idea now of what Hell could look like.EH has plenty of sick and twisted greatness, but it also has its flaws. Some of the (computer-generated) special effects look unfinished, thanks to a looming release date and an unfortunately rushed production. I feel less bothered by this over time; most great films reveal their technical flaws over time. I am more concerned with what seems missing from the film. Negative test screenings necessitated additional revisions and editing, leaving no time for fine-tuning the drama. Sadly, this has become the way movie blockbusters are made these days, and sometimes it shows: the first act of the movie adequately builds up tension and anticipation, the second act delivers quite well with all the unraveling and increasing terror, but the film regrettably rushes through its final act. The straightforward finale is mostly to blame, as many of the genre's conventions take over: the guilt- stricken hero making his final sacrifice, the bad guy returning for the final showdown, and a big explosion to wrap things up. Some opportunities for important character moments were missed. While some of the crew's torments take center stage, it would have helped greatly if the other characters were more involved in the story than is the case now. Still, with the exception of two people, all cast members get their moments in the spotlights. There are no redundant characters here that I wished to have killed off. Sean Pertwee has a few of the best moments as the character who instinctively knows they're in the wrong place; Joely Richardson and Jason Isaacs are the cool-headed voices of reason. Jack Noseworthy, however, feels like 'the early victim' who lacks development, and Richard T. Jones' comic relief feels a bit forced at times. EH is nowadays praised as quite daring, and influential in both movies (torture-porn?) and games. Although it may not be a masterpiece, this movie has had its long-lasting effects on me. Art isn't necessary beautiful or in good taste, and if quality can be measured in how something moves us, then EH certainly has some. Every time I watch it, I cannot help being drawn to those scenes that truly disturb me, like a ship out of Hell that is beckoning me to surrender to Evil. Every time I have seen it, I lose at least an hour of sleep over it. God knows why we mortals keep putting ourselves through this kind of mental auto-mutilation. Damn this movie!! Can't wait to see it again",Event Horizon

158,Scoopy,almost sang its song in tune,6,20 April 1999,"Once upon a time there were two movies, both considered masterpieces of their genre.One was callied ""Alien"", the brilliantly realized SF/Horror film from Ridley Scott, about a deep space mission that brought back an unwanted predatory visitor from the imagination of Giger.The other film was called ""Solaris"", about a deep space mission that caused the crew to exhibit psychotic behavior and keep living out scenes from their earth life. Solaris, an intellectual film from the Soviet-era genius Andrei Tarkovsky,  is the more complex film. It does not attempt to explain whether the hallucinations are caused by an external force, space fever, passage into a time-space warp, or just the fact that you can't ever run from yourself, not matter how far you go. No monsters.""Event Horizon"" is a cross breed between these two legendary deep-space films. The monster is there, but it inhabits the minds of the crew, learns everything about them, every fear, every memory, and causes their insanity. Solaris with action, and an identified external cause. The idea was pretty damned good, the special effects and visuals were brilliant, and they hired a good cast. Some of the moments will scare the beejeepers out of you.But they went over the top in some ways. Too many explosions. A fist-fight with the monster, what's that all about? Too many empty-headed discussions about what man was or wasn't meant to know. Ultimately too little really original. Reviewers were sharply divided on this film. Some said it was a truly brilliant scare-fest, others thought is was a zero-star waste of their precious time. I don't know. It isn't Alien or Solaris, but it has a lot of positives and I enjoyed it, but I don't plan to watch it again.",Event Horizon

However, it vanishes from normal space and is gone for a number of years before inexplicably returning with no one left on board. What happened to its crew? Did it travel to another universe? Another dimension? Perhaps Hell itself? The latter begins to seem the most likely answer, but if you think that it will be explained to your satisfaction you will be very wrong.

There are, of course, certain flaws and among them is the lack of explanation. All too much happens without apparent reason. Simply writing it off as subliminal fear is too easy.

165,jake-179,Great Sci-Fi/Horror Combination!,8,29 January 2001,"Event Horizon is a great movie, and a masterful combination of science fiction and horror.  This movie has it all, great special effects, excellent actors, fantastic set design, good story line.  When I heard about this movie I knew the movie makers tried to basically create a ""haunted space ship.""  So I had my doubts.  But when I saw the movie I was very impressed. They definitely succeeded!  The Event Horizon is scary, but very convincing as an actual space vehicle.  I liked the originality of this film.  A lot of people were turned off by the premise of a genuine horror movie.  I think people went to the movie expecting to see some kind of alien incarnation, and when they didn't see that, they felt short changed.  But to me, this is a strong point.  The whole idea of a blood thirsty alien stowing away onboard a space ship and eating the crew one by one, has been done a million times.  So I really felt like this movie successfully broke new ground.  Its very original and very scary.  However there were some bad points in the movie, too.  The part where the character of Justin floats out in to space was not very realistic.  He actually exits the air lock without a space suit on, and is exposed to the icy vacuum of space...but he survives!  Impossible.  Scientifically speaking, his lungs would have been instantly collapsed and the nitrogen in his blood would fizz up, like a can of soda that has been shaken too much and suddenly opened.  The next part of the movie that is really weak is the part where Cooper gets blown out in to space and then ""surfs"" back to the Event Horizon by blowing his air tanks.  If you have seen John Carpenter's ""DARK STAR"" this part will remind you of the end of ""DARK STAR"" when the astronaught surfs in to the planet's atmosphere.Other than those two weak points, EVENT HORIZON is a very good movie.  A scare fest full of originality and some refreshingly gory scenes.  If you are a fan of science fiction movies, you need to see this movie. The ships are great, the set design is fascinating, the ideas about space travel are new and even thought provoking, the scares keep you on the edge of your seat, and its really spooky.By the way, does anybody else see the similarities between Lawrence Fishburn's role in this movie and his role in THE MATRIX?",Event Horizon

There are also a few scenes that are oddly and unintentionally comedic, such as with Cooper in space.

I was in desperate need of a good sound system -- I had to run a wire from my VCR to my Minidisc, then convert the left channel into two channels, so the sound was horrible when I watched it...oh, don't stop reading now, that was pretty boring.  Anyways, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill did terrific performances as the head crew members of a ship to save Dr. Weir (Neill)'s beloved ship, the Event Horizon.  I don't want to get into terrific detail, but what was scary was the jump scenes (that's why I wanted a good sound system) and the eerie silence that comes with every sci-fi movie, but sometimes without good execution.  This is not the case for this movie.  I loved the fact that you have to ponder a few things about this movie, even after the credits roll.  To think about a ship that has been deserted for 7 years and you have no idea where it has been, is some scary s**t.  But it is not recommended for the weak: there is a copious amount of blood and gore, and it's somewhat graphic.

At the time it disappeared, the Event Horizon was testing out a new drive allowing it to create a wormhole for instantaneous travel. However, something went terrible wrong.This is a rather good written film. All the elements to make a successful horror film is there and so are the characters. No, the story is not all too great, in fact if you think about it it is rather stupid and the characters could've been better, but all in all it could have been a lot worse. The only good thing about this story is that it's set on a space ship, in a locked environment. It is really not the story that is scary about this movie. Towards the end when the solution comes and there are a lot of story going on it actually starts to look more like an action movie. What makes this movie scary is the mood and the atmosphere.The acting is OK. The characters are not great so you don't get this connection too them and the actors does a decent job in bringing them to life. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are too good leads and the others does a decent job as well.When it comes to cinematography there are nothing special that stands out. It's all over good with some occasional cool shots, but you've seen them all before. There are nothing too great and original about them, but they are good and along with very good lightning they are an essential part of what creates the atmosphere witch makes this movie scary.Something that needs to be given a lot of credit for this movie being as scary as it is, is the production design. The interior of the Event Horizon and also the ""Clark"" for that matter is excellent. It is creepy and good looking.The third element besides cinematography and production design that creates the atmosphere and mood and makes this movie creepy is the music/sound design. The music is good and moody, but they also make the absence of music a powerful tool.As for special effects they are good. The CGI is nothing groundbreaking. It's simply good looking, not too obvious and it does it's job.What we have here is not a movie with a scary movie. It has a good amount of gore, but like The Thing it's the excellent atmosphere and mood that makes it scary. Don't pay too much attention to the story, it's not worth it.

Unfortunatly it is the plot holes that seriously let down what could have been a masterpiece of this genre & I am talking about serious ""who, what, why, where"" abyssess!The first part of the movie is actually very good, & ticks along nicely (although I don't get it that water can save you from 10g Gravity?) But then my eyebrow gets raised when the first flashbacks begin. What has the wife of the designer of the EH ship got to do with the story? Next we get into the recovery of the ships video log, which is full on Wes Cravenesque porn/gore, which inlisted the talents of real life amputees & porn actors! Errr.....WHY!? & what was with the Latin language used for? a connection to Hell perhaps. Then the film begins to loose momentum when the rest of the crew begins to hallucinate/or see ghosts of loved ones. Some of these scenes are so long & drawn out it could almost be a snoozefest! But yet again, why are the crew seeing these hallucinations? because this is yet another big Swiss cheese plot hole which is never explained. This is ultimatly very sad because the original cut of this movie was 130 minutes making me wonder if this lost footage could have explain what is unexplained in the final cut.Overall EH is a stylish attempt at an Alienesque film & it does have its fair share of jump shocks, gore & horror, but its the story that is sadly lacking. But saying all this the overall message of EH is that experimental deep space travel will take you to Hell, which is a weird message to take onboard. Is EH actually an ""ANTI-space"" movie? Well in this respect yes it is! Because here we are 20 years into the 21st century & we have not even been back to the moon. You would think with all the tech advances we have today we should have vacations on the moon by now, flying cars, outposts on Mars, & perhaps even cracked faster than light space travel (the central story of EH) but we have not... Sadly all we have today are meglomainic billionaires socialists pushing wealth redistribution via climate change & forcing the people of our beautiful world into global govenance which they call ""progressive"".....I call it regressive, when now in 2020 the cosmic ocean is left unexplored, neglected & abandoned.",Event Horizon
172,lizziebeth-1,Should be renamed Ripped Off and Sucked In (1997). Awful. 0.0001/10.,1,8 August 2002,"WARNING: SPOILERS!Event Horizon (1997) starts out great: the special effects begin as part of the opening credits: there is a fabulous segue from the Paramount studio logo up into space, refocusing on the stars and onto an apparent gaseous event horizon around a black hole. An event horizon is the perceivable limit, or the boundary between describable and indescribable physics at the edge of a ""singularity"". A singularity, a ""black hole"" star fallen into its own gravity well, can be visualized, just as the Simpsons did, as an infinite, bottomless pit, if you consider normal spacetime essentially a two-dimensional plane. It really is supposed to be infinite, with nothingness and no dimensions, no spacetime, at the bottom. Hell, nothing anywhere inside a black hole can make any sense at all. You and I keep our brains in normal spacetime, and we just don't have any frame of reference at all in common with a singularity. None. That's the point.At the perceivable edge of this thing, back onto normal space, there are some slightly less weird physics, which we have called the ""event horizon"". This is the one-way membrane hiding the black hole. But forget black holes; the event horizon ITSELF is really bad news. If you are unlucky enough to supposedly get stuck in one, you get stretched out infinitely (ouch), because in just the distance between your head and your foot the difference in the gravitational force acting upon you approaches the infinite. For ""you"", time does not pass, and you cannot even be said to have died. Anyway, that's the theory.Black holes were a hotly debated theoretical entity among astrophysicists for about 25 years, especially after Carl Sagan's friend, Kip Thorne of Cal Tech came up with ""wormholes"" around 1970, the theoretical possibility of a path in spacetime through the singularity instead of hitting it (there is a mathematical solution to an equation, but Stephen Hawking doesn't like it much because it depends on too many other variables). The wormhole joins two points of spacetime together temporarily, but you need two gravity wells to make that happen. That's what the ""gravity drive"" on The Event Horizon is supposed to be doing.So in 1997 Paul Anderson (annoyingly similarly named to sci-fi novelist Poul Anderson) and Paramount tried to fictionalize what it might be like to survive a wormhole. What a good idea (NOT) it was to imagine that the gravity drive would also drive astronauts mad. How stupid do you have to be to accept such rubbish? -Well, very.Don't misunderstand, I have no real problem with the folding of spacetime: so it would take a black hole in front and a black hole behind your spaceship (according to the actual scientific theory); so what? Surely the crew of the Event Horizon could have already tamed and placed two such warm and fuzzy singularities on a leash. No problem.Instead, my problem with the plot of Event Horizon (1997) is that the much vaunted gravity drive would interfere with the neurochemistry  and that's all  of human brains in normal spacetime. Kind of a big flaw, don't you think? It would be rather difficult to develop the technology without somebody overseeing the PLANETARY BUDGET needed, actually noticing. Kip Thorne doesn't even appear to have been consulted for this, and perhaps there's a reason for that. The hallucination premise is the avenue for supplying lots of explosions, blood, guts and gore  excitement, but only for bozos. Miramax/ Palace put out a similar schlocky but cheaper turkey 7 years before, called Hardware (1990), which is the only movie I actually walked out on in my whole life. I was THIS CLOSE to walking out on Event Horizon (1997).The casting is OK. Laurence (previously usually credited as Larry, and before that, again as Laurence, I kid you not) Fishburne is the acceptable lead, as Captain Miller. Larry went on to be Morpheus in The Matrix (1999). Onya Larry, he's the only winner out of Event Horizon. I just wish he would figure out who he is.I really appreciate Sam Neill for taking so many ""big science"" roles, probably beginning with Jurassic Park (1993). Here he is Dr Weir, the inventor of the ""gravity drive"", but it's thoroughly awful and depressing to see him so denigrated later on in this movie to a hideous schlock character aboard the bad ship Event Horizon. Please do watch him in The Dish (2000) instead, where he is the sweetest, most mild-mannered radio astronomer you could ever hope to see.Kathleen Quinlan is lovely as usual, but she is wasted as the doctor aboard this popsicle, and remains forgettable. Jack Noseworthy gets initially red-shirted (in Star Trek parlance) within the first half-hour. Unfortunately his thesping is not missed. He had been mugging for the camera again and throwing away whatever lines he had. Richard T Jones as Cooper is somewhat brighter, but he too is annoying with his lack of discipline. Just because his starship captain is also an African American is no reason for Cooper to revert to a stereotype. He's either a mission specialist who NEVER WAS a stereotype- HELLO- or he's a bozo who shouldn't be there.I recommend no-one stays around for the tease ending, which is so lame that it is necessary to tell the audience that ""The End"" has arrived. Ripped off and sucked in, man! Paramount's executives at the time approved this bizarre cross between cutting edge scientific theory and stupid schlock. To whom are they trying to appeal? Any audience capable of understanding the science will not be impressed by mindless blood and gore. Probably the single most offensive disappointment of the 20th century. MAJOR turkey.

Vivisecting, no matter how tasteful the visual conveyance, is never fun.If you'll allow the limitations set by the technology available in 1997 (in terms of CGI and production design) and can stomach a handful of unsettling scenes, then check it out for some thrills and chills. (It's available to stream instantly through Netflix.)But if you haven't seen it and are sensitive to spoilers, stop reading.To continue my introductory discussion, the viewer will buy into a theoretical force if it compels the story forward.When it comes to Event Horizon, everything's sound until they board the actual ship. The stuff with the magazine centerfold is intelligent and easily acceptable.Things get shaky once you start to consider the implications of the ship's consciousness.What's with the ice crystals? Seems like someone fell in love with the term 'corpsicle.'The filmmakers had two options for explaining the darkness inhabiting (or possessing) the ship. The reappearance of Weir towards the end, when he battles with Miller in the hellish core, is a physical incarnation of the entity.The nature of that demonic being is what the film's final cut never nailed down. They could either call it Hell (a concrete location defined by religious beliefs, but at least a colloquial construct of reality), or generate their own mythological realm (the parallel dimension governed by chaos.)Ultimately they don't answer the question.I don't appreciate incomplete narratives, but I understand production difficulties. I just wish they'd picked a side and stuck with it.It's simple enough to believe that the Event Horizon passes through this chaotic dimension but the affect it has on the ship requests a distant reach for our brains to continue the suspension of disbelief.There's a bevy of examples, so I'll list a quick few. One of the main problems is what I call, 'an incongruence of metaphysical properties,' or the misalignment of surreal forces. The quick and easy i.e.? Telepathic abilities don't include clairvoyance.Actions are governed by motivations, and for the plot to unfold the way it does, it would be according to the ship's mandate. We can assume the ship's all knowing and all-powerful, because it telepathically dissects the crew's memories and locates their fears. Furthermore, it projects hallucinations onto their consciousness.Even further, it can cause objects to vanish, like Miller's gun. Meaning it can literally manipulate the fabric of existence.If the ship has the ability to alter reality, its initial antagonism seems unmotivated and inexplicable. Why string along the entire crew through this revelatory process? What does the ship (or the evil entity possessing it) hope to gain through tormenting the individuals?There's an inconsequential argument to be made here. Perhaps the entity's wish is to let the three crewmembers escape, thereby spreadingwhat, exactly? Hell on Earth? Why does Starck seem to be the only one 'infected' so to speak? The final scene suggests her mind's plagued with the same malady inhibiting Weir's character at the film's open.Are we to assume events will play out in a similar manner for Starck as they did for Weir? That's impossible; the Event Horizon is half destroyed and returned to Earth. Will she rein terror across the planet?To pile on top, soon after the film begins, Weir dreams of the corpse floating on the Event Horizon's flight deck. Thereby suggesting clairvoyance.So you can see how the power imbalances, the inconsistencies between referential frames, and an ending of minimal consequence add up to a deceptively contrived narrative.What's life going to be like for Justin, after the macabre experience he's been through? It's almost cruel to let him live; disfigured, traumatized, psychotic and likely suicidal. It's thoroughly twisted, but an attempt to defy convention seems the only impetus for retaining that character's life.The intercepted audio recording is the perfect microcosm for the whole film.It's creepy and ominous, and a believable mistranslation. I'll even allow the idea that their manner of speech transforms to Latin.And hey, for fun, let's forego all discussion of computerized auditory scanners.Who was the message, ""Save yourself from Hell,"" intended for?And who had the wherewithal, after passing through the chaotic dimension, to broadcast the warning signal?Oh. I get it.Once infected, the spread of Hellish dementia's a gradual multi-stepped debilitation.First comes the transformation of basic speech faculties. After that, the craving for sadomasochistic orgy manifests.Silly me. It's all coming together now.Better start rewriting this review.Although.Perhaps I've passed the event horizon(See what I did there?)",Event Horizon
174,ianwagnerwatches,A victim of Paramount Studios,4,26 October 2019,"Event Horizon was forcibly cut down from Paul W.S. Anderson's original cut, which was supposedly a full 130 minutes long but did poorly in test screenings. Before cuts, which were extremely rushed, the film was far more violent and contained all of the scenes that, in their absence, left me feeling empty and disappointed by this film.
The first hour is so incredibly gripping, always having me dying to know what happens next, but in the end, I didn't see much of anything. This film is a tragedy, a disappointing compromise of an auteur's vision.",Event Horizon
175,wilsonstuart-32346,What Prometheus Should Have Been,8,29 September 2018,"This intense and psychological driven sci-fi thriller has kind of languished obscurity, which is kind of unfair. Event Horizon was some what overwhelmed by Titanic when released back in 1997, but twenty one years on (!) It is definitely overdue a reassessment.When a rescue team led by an excellent Lawrence Fishburn, advised by an effective Sam Neill, and a superb cast of British character actors (including Joely Richardson, Jason Isaac and Sean Pertwee) are summoned a mysterious experimental research vessel - The Event Horizon - which disappeared on her maiden voyage, an increasingly strange and frightening incidents start to overwhelm the crew, some of whom are not quite what they seem....Although certain elements are pretty derative - what horror film hasn't been set in some abandoned or derelict venue or other? - Event Horizon certainly does not lack suspense, frights or thrills. The sets are impressive, contributing to the grow sense of unease and eventual menace. Horror films set on abandoned ships seem tricky to master. Event Horizon set a standard that most other films should aspire to. Take note Ridley Scott!",Event Horizon
176,Muldwych,Atmospheric Film Filled With Squandered Potential,6,13 June 2010,"Part 'The Black Hole', part 'Sunlight', 'Event Horizon' meshes the epic sci-fi 'base under siege' by mad scientists and the forces of nature plot of both while failing to achieve the greatness of either, eschewing intelligence and depth for shallow, B-grade disposable fluff that entertains just enough for the audience not to feel too cheated and earns the studio a fast buck. Top-drawer actors and well-crafted flashy effects are used to gloss over a meaningless plot and a wasted opportunity, for 'Event Horizon' explores some intriguing concepts and has several elements of a decent film.Since I first saw it on the big screen, one thing that had always stuck in my mind about 'Event Horizon' was that eerie atmosphere. Director Paul Anderson should certainly explore the horror genre, being adept at building a climate of tension and foreboding. This accentuates the story's central premise: that the ship 'Event Horizon' itself has somehow become affected by the forces it encountered in another dimension. Anderson does a good job of actualising these indelible phenomena on the big screen, keeping the characters and the viewer on edge: we know all hell is going to break loose, but not why or how. He is helped in this goal by the tried and tested talents of an experienced visual effects team that includes department supervisor Richard Yuricich, who earlier proved himself in such greats as '2001' and 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. The result earned 'Event Horizon' the description 'weird' when it first came out and the viewers' inability to qualify what they were seeing was one of the film's greatest strengths - no one was entirely sure how real the unexplained anomalies were, which the ending capitalizes upon.Unfortunately, these efforts are severely undermined by a script that has no interest in exploring the incredible scientific concepts behind the conflict, rendering all the unanswered questions and 'Shining'-style sequences meaningless. It's rather like launching into an intelligent conversation with someone who suddenly decides things are getting too 'heavy' before retreating to the safer topic of whether or not Simon Cowell deserves a knighthood. This has the knock-on effect of ensuring that much of the characters' dialogue is as two-dimensional as their characterisation: if there's a scientist aboard, the chances of him still being sane by the closing credits are about as likely as any military characters present exploring the Kip Thorne ruminations on wormhole theory. The point is not to suggest that anyone should have lapsed into a Carl Sagan lecture on the nature of the universe - those who have sat through the works of Dan Brown will, if still awake, be all too familiar with storytellers more interested in being didactic than genuinely entertaining. Rather, it's the usual desire by the studios not to alienate the meat-heads in the audience with too much of this thing we call 'thinking'. This doubtless also explains the choice of music for the beginning and end credits, which hurriedly promises ""don't worry - there's gonna be shootin' 'n killin'"" - although Michael Kamen's incidental score is thankfully more in tune with his usual standard.Still, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are no strangers to film work held together by more money than brains, the Matrix sequels and pointless 'Under The Mountain' remake being more recent examples. Both are capable of giving so much more, with Neill as usual the best-served out of a modest banquet. Once remembered for playing the son of Satan, this is a man who can convey a great deal without ever saying a word. His Dr Weir alter ego, however, needed far more development if we were to be sympathetic with his plight. Fishburne is never allowed to explore any facial expression other than serious concern, although this might have something to do with his polar opposite in the form of Cooper, as played by Richard T. Nelson, whom I really want to believe is not simply there to be the token 'Funny Black Man', but Cooper is really convincing in the role. Other luminaries worthy of mention include Katherine Quinlan and Jason Isaacs, but only because we've seen them act elsewhere, and Sean Pertwee follows his father into sci-fi for the first time to lesser acclaim, though he is hardly provided with much of a challenge.Much of my annoyance at the lack of effort put into 'Event Horizon' stems from the fact that I am the right demographic for sci-fi/horror. It's frustrating to see a film that in some ways explores themes and story lines I enjoy, but stops short, terrified that it might actually become something truly decent. On the one hand, I could argue that later successes like Danny Boyle's 'Sunshine' raised the bar for the genre, leaving half-baked efforts such as this dancing the limbo beneath it with miles of clear headway up top. Yet precursors like 'The Black Hole' and 'Alien', which, while not necessarily exploring more intelligent story lines, were constructed with greater maturity by genuine film-makers like Ridley Scott, not interested in assembling a film with the help of a marketing team and interested in proper scripting over cheap thrills. Funnily enough, those are the films people still remember today.As such, 'Event Horizon' bears up well in appearance, but falls short once you take a closer peek. It feels like a very emblematic Hollywood blockbuster, half-filled with genuinely-talented artistes, but driven by a studio anxiously matching their box-office winning formula with audience demographics. Closer inspection reveals that its high aims are in fact the shadow of a much shorter arm outstretched in front of the wall where the puppetry is being performed for short-term gain only. Do yourself a favour and dig up the classics or watch considered efforts like 'Sunlight' instead. If like me, you haven't seen 'Event Horizon' since its original release and its spooky atmosphere left you with fond memories, keep it that way.",Event Horizon
177,SmileyMcGrouchpants,A worthy title.,8,10 May 2018,"This movie, which I just saw for $4 at the Academy theater and hadn't checked out since I saw it on video a few years after it played in theaters, is a terrific 3-out-of-4 stars sci-fi as I remembered, all right. What's great about this picture -- even though, at times, it may cause dialogue to be a bit clunky and the pacing to not be the best -- is there isn't a wasted shot in the movie; everything's bringing you new information, and you need to know what is going on, and orient yourself. I've always liked the Alien/Outland-esque ""we're working class dudes-and-gals in a tin bucket who could die no less in space than if we were in the middle of the *ocean*"" trip, and Laurence Fishburne is one of the most quietly compelling actors of the nineties (let's not *just* count The Matrix, okay?). Sam Neill's range slips a little, here; he seems to be ""I'm Sam Neill GOING CRAZY!"" a bit too quickly and willingly here, but that's alright. The premise of Solaris is all over the place, the movie reeks of it; what with the ship that thinks, the suicidal wife, and different rules when you're ""way out there,"" if you know the Tarkovsky original, the Soderberg re-make (which I haven't seen) or the Stanislaw Lem novel it's going to be on your mind. Still, this movie's not predictable; it earns its dangers and recoveries -- you're finding out with the crew, including Dr. Sam Neill (who does a not-bad job about explaining how the Event Horizon could skirt spacetime, years before Interstellar came out).If you don't live in Portland, you might not remember ...",Event Horizon
178,verna-a,Repulsive movie,2,24 May 2013,"You'll hate yourself for watching this and hate what the producers/directors of this film did to decent actors. I like sci-fi films and was attracted to the story outline. Unfortunately it soon became evident no-one had any faith in the power of storytelling and characterization to engage the audience. Instead they had to exaggerate every interaction between members of the crew to be as abrasive as possible, and introduce every cheesy and over-the-top horror film trick they could think of to progress the film. I nearly wrote ""to maintain interest"" but in fact it's a big turn off and you soon regard the whole affair with total contempt. Here's an example of the wit and character development in the film: black male crew member to female crew member while offering a cup of coffee ""How'd you like something hot and black inside you?"" (leers). Just when you think it can't get any worse with exaggerated gory special effects, it does. I see some people like this film, honestly I shudder to imagine the sort of person that would. It's quite repulsive, and the only reason I'm giving it a 2 is that I did watch it to the end to see who they could extricate from the general mayhem. I think I caught a line of dialogue ""In this situation, some self-control is an advantage"". Are they kidding!

I think it was trying to add a bit more a psychological thriller feel which was fine but more silly at times. It's no smarter or worse than Alien Covenant. If anything, it's mercifully short. It has no desire to try and get you to like these characters. It just wants to put them through hell and see if they'll kill each other off.For me, it's not really worth seeing. Additionally it has some very poor CGI (even for the time, it's pretty bad). Maybe if they make a 'Dead Space' movie it can take the good parts of this and actually be horrifying.",Event Horizon

Yes, it's got a big gloomy spaceship.  That doesn't make it Alien.  It mentions black holes, but that doesn't have anything to do with the Disney movie.  It blows up at the end - Hey, I think I saw a movie once where the thing blew up at the end! Jesus.  Oh, and that wasn't a spoiler.  Telling you about an action movie where nothing blows up - that would be a spoiler.Most of all, I enjoyed the zero-G effects, the amazing sets (on a par with Burton's genius on Batman), and the generally fewer-holds-barred-than-usual take on Hell.  It was creepy too, which a lot of horror films fail to be.On the minus side (and not to take away from the film), TV-edited versions of Event Horizon are especially rubbish.  We're used to seeing swearwords replaced, and violence trimmed - but watching this on the BBC the other day I noticed whole swathes missing - entire scenes!  The plot was cut to shreds (even worse than .. is), and I can understand why someone watching it on TV for the first time would think it was a load of cluttered, unexplained rubbish.  Except for the actual look, and the soundtrack - which anyone should realise is excellent.I have moderate hopes for Resident Evil (Paul Anderson's latest film), but - having seen Soldier - I fear he may have peaked with Event Horizon which would be a shame, because (judging from an audience chat I saw once), he seems to be a decent guy.",Event Horizon

182,gothic_a666,Horror gem,7,27 May 2005,"**contains spoilers* It is a well known fact, to most horror fans, that horror and sci-fi hardly ever manage to come together in a coherent way. The tendency is to let the plots slide into cartoonish ""it's the creature from out of space-here-to-gobble-us-all"". One genre ends up imposing its own clichés upon the under, making the ship sink. Event Horizon is not the case. Not even remotely. First of all, as already been pointed out, what matters most about this movie is the atmosphere. It is dark, the angles are odd, all the gore attests to a level of insanity and mindless violence that really IS hell.Instead of re-creating a whole new world or a completely different society as a standard sci-fi would do, Event Horizon takes us to the heart of every day human existence when submitted to endure the horrors of space. And these are Hell. It is psychological horror in that, in a very factual sense, the character's fears end up being their own perdition. The sphere itself may be responsible for some of the most awful sounds ever to star in a horror movie. It reminds me a bit of nails scratching glass only warped out to get under one's nerves. That it truly accomplishes. Event Horizon closes the characters within themselves and once they are trapped, there is no escape. That is also a key element of this movie's power...it's ability to present a ending that opens to a never-ending cycle of suffering in a way that differs from the obvious (you know, shark movies that end with ominous shark tale looming in the distance; haunt-stories that finish with some object being moved around; whatever hero/villain gathering strength from the ashes, all the way to the famous classic The Bulb). I once read a book about the Gothic ethos of horror romances in which it was explained that one of the major sources of fear is morbid reiteration.

First off, the character development here is so dull and sometimes dumb with a script that doesn't seem to reach to its full potential and just falls short. However, the set production here is impressively epic as well as its atmospheric SCARES and inventive bloody GORE scenes but that seems to be all this film has to offer. The film just feels cheesier and dumber as it goes but still entertaining throughout nonetheless.

The eerie tone and imagery combine to create a genuinely unsettling movie. Then in the last half an hour the movie turns into a very grotesque action-horror hybrid. I still enjoyed that part, however I preferred the slow-moving atmospheric sections as that's the kind of horror that resonates more with me. Now, apparently Anderson's original cut was 130 minutes long and it got the NC-17 rating. I personally think that cut, which is apparently even more gruesome would drag on and lose it's atmosphere in favour of Hostel-like exploitation.

Hellraiser In Space!The year is 2047 and Dr. William Weir (Sam Neil) is a scientist / engineer on board a space station in low Earth orbit. He has just gotten word of a distress beacon being sent from the spacecraft Event Horizon in orbit around Neptune. He designed the spacecraft and its unique time-and-space-bending engine core gravity drive and sent it on its way seven years ago. Then he lost contact with it and it was assumed all aboard were dead in some tragic accident.Now it seems to have returned, and he's got to get there and see what happened.He catches a ride there on the Lewis And Clark, a ship run Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishburne) and a crew of six. Nobody on the Lewis and Clark want to go on this mission because they haven't had a vacation in a long time, so they are less than welcoming when the good doctor boards.They are even less pleased when they get to the Event Horizon and seriously messed up things start happening. Apparently, this engine core gravity drive has opened a gateway to Hell, and each member of the crew is faced with their greatest fears.Random Thoughts:Sam Neil should not have been allowed to run around shirtless. Nobody wants to see that.The ship log on the Event Horizon was on a CD Rom. Really? The prop people couldn't imagine a more futuristic solution to data storage?Why doesn't anyone on board have a gun? The weapons they choose are knives or saws.For the most part the design of the space ship and various props was pretty darn good, but there were several consoles and a scanning device that looked embarrassingly dated and cheap. The same goes with the special effects - most were well done but the ones that weren't really take you out of the moment. The design of the core gravity drive was spectacular. The ""special effect"" of the crew creeping along in zero-g with ""gravity boots"" looked really stupid.When the very handsome Cooper (Richard T Jones) offers coffee to a crew member by asking ""You want something hot and black inside of you?""

THAT was his visual inspiration. Seriously? Formatting the style of a set from a video game? As a kid, I loved the Mortal Kombat movie, but I was 6 years old. I just wanted to see karate chopping and blades shooting out of Scorpio's hand. With Event Horizon, we get the same tongue-in-cheek style of Mortal Kombat, except the source material is a lot more unsettling: a mad-scientist constructed portal that has the power to bring you to other dimensions, one of which is the pits of hell. SUCH A COOL CONCEPT, RIGHT? Well, what we get is a oozing-with-cheese action blockbuster with paper-thin characters with dialogue that is more suitable for interludes on Playstation game. The gore is copy+pasted from the preceding and much, much better Hellraiser I and II, and the CGI is on par with the dreadful Spawn which came out that same year. I hate rating movies a 1 because I think it's distasteful and many people that rate 1's are conjectural as means to not get the movie they were hoping for. I hated There Will Be Blood in the theater, but loved it upon my second viewing. I thought The Ring was ""ok"" when I first saw it, but really loved it upon my second viewing when I was alone on a rainy day. This film, however, I feel deserves a 1. I saw this m3 months ago and was p%ssed off at what I had to sit through. I thought maybe there was something that I had missed. Watched it again; hated it even more! *eek*.. The disingenuous actors/dialogues/stereotypes, the settings, lighting, absurd editing, vapidity of tone made me feel like I really wasted my time.I'm not an Anderson 'hater', because I appreciated the Resident Evil film. With that said, I'll just re-watch Aliens or Cube when I need my 'fix' for some scifi horror.",Event Horizon

I had nightmares from that movie for weeks. I saw it again recently. Once again, I had nightmares. This isn't like your average slasher where some guy in a mask goes around slicing people up. This doesn't make you bask in CGI and all its glory. This movie isn't a technological wonder, but you will p*** your pants watching it.The movie sets itself in a spaceship that has been through hell and back. If you are religious, you can already see the horror. Then, a group of astronauts enter this ship, answering a distress signal. They are then confronted by their most horrible fears, which is fatal to some.
The movie scared me because they are in a conflict that their environment won't allow them to escape from.There was also a scene where they had to decipher a Latin message. What they were saying was possibly the most disturbing thing in the movie.Anyway, this is one of my favorite horror movies, simply because it does what horror movies are meant to do, and that's to keep you up at night. This scared me more than the Exorcist (that is to say the movie. The Exorcist BOOK was quite disturbing). Anyway, if your sleep is precious to you, don't watch this movie.

It's completely bloody and explicitly violent and it's not a bad thing: think of it as Tarantino in a spaceship. And it delivers an invisible type of horror without an alien monster, where the only real monster is what's inside the human head. I got really scared with unpredictable scenes and a terrific cast starting with Sam Neil. Somebody said (in his comments, complaining) that the EH ship looked like a torture chamber, well I believe that this was made on purpose, my friend, that's exactly one of the many ways the movie is supossed to treat the fear, with those creepy and spooky elements, equal to a new kind of terror.

Don't hesitate and watch ""Event Horizon"", a breathtaking, deep film with awesome atmosphere, one of the best I've ever seen in the genre. Directed by Paul Anderson (""Mortal Kombat"", ""Soldier"" and in a short time ""Resident Evil""), recreates the typical haunted house story, but in the future and instead of a house, a spaceship.The plot is really interesting and creepy: a salvage expedition travels to Neptune to recover the ""Event Horizon"", a gigantic spaceship that is supposed to travel faster than the light speed by using the blackholes power. In its first journey, it became lost mysteriously. 7 years later, it suddenly appeared in the Neptune orbit.(SPOILER AHEAD!!!)Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and his salvage crew and Dr. Weir (Sam Neill) will find that the spaceship in these 7 years has visited another dimension, ""a dimension of pure chaos, of pure evil"", as they realize that the ship is alive!(SPOILER ENDED) :)""Event Horizon"" is a very frightening film. Not because of the gore only, but the story too. It's really deep and scary. I watched the movie on VHS, a pity because this movie must be incredible in the cinema! That reminds me my friends, that went to see the movie in the theaters. When they went out, they were pale! It's true. They found ""Event Horizon"" weird and violent. Maybe they're right.

210,foxhound-37781,Follows the standard recipe for sci-fi horror,9,14 January 2021,"As stated, Event Horizon basically follows the same formula most sci-fi horror movies tend to. Most people will view this movie as an Alien reskin. Bunch of people on a space ship, things start getting scary, people start getting killed. Even the interior of the Event Horizon is similar in some aspects to the Nostromo from Alien.It's surprising that a movie like this has developed the cult following it has today, but I know why. Because it doesn't have any mediocre sequels or any kind of half-assed spin offs and it does not need them. the movie is perfectly capable of standing on its own two legs and doesn't try to be more than what it actually is.Sam Neill and Lawrence Fishburn are the two characters of focus. They both play good roles and it's interesting to see a younger and sharper Jason Isaacs too. As far as the content of the movie, it has moments of dread, alot of frightening imagery and some gory deaths to go with it.The concept of a space ship that's that can ""gate drive"" to various locations and literally been to hell and back is an interesting idea, but might require multiple viewings to really be able to take in the ""lore"" behind the story. Paul Anderson was able to get this in theatres of summer 1997 due to Titanic being extensively delayed. I have to confer that after Titanic did hit the scene in December movies like this were very quickly forgotten about but still great to see that people are talking about this movie to this day.It's worth watching if you're after a movie that will genuinely give you chills and you enjoy the odd jumpscare. I really like it =)",Event Horizon
211,Mash-the-stampede,"""Save yourself...from hell""",9,2 June 2010,"To this day, ""Event Horizon"" is THE scariest horror science fiction film i have ever witnessed!I was 14 years old when I first watched this film on video and to put it lightly...it scared the shiz out of me! I loved it!!! Now 12 years later a finally purchase the film on DVD (ordered from the states as I can't find it anywhere in New Zealand) and I watched it with a couple friends who have never seen it before. Suddenly I was 14 again! A scared child, too frightened to look away from the screen. Caught in an icy grip of fear and excitement! A feeling I haven't felt since the first viewing of 'Event Horizon'. Brilliant! I jumped in all the same scenes I jumped in 12 years ago and i was so absolutely absorbed in this film. My friends felt the same way i did and we all sat on the same couch with the lights off while this film quietly terrified us!Now I'm not exactly a huge horror movie enthusiast as i find most horror films to be stupid, cheesy and just not scary in the slightest. Horror films now are especially ridiculous as that ""Saw"" series (when will it end?) is just silly and repetitive which is a shame as the first film is a pretty descent thriller, which seems to be another problem for horror films is that there are too many sequels with each film becoming further and further detached from the original making the whole premise and idea of the film pointless and boring.Which is exactly the reason ""Event Horizon"" works. It is a stand-alone film. No sequels. No actual killer as such...it is the presence of an unseen evil which corrupts the characters into becoming warped and ultimately the cause of their own demise. For a horror film the kill count is surprisingly low and no one actually dies during the first hour of the film. It's the suspense of the film and the actual idea behind it which is so un-believable frightening that you find yourself absorbed and un-able to look away from the screen....gripped in fear. That's why this film is so brilliant. The cast is great. It's not overly convoluted. It's scary beyond belief. The story is good enough to keep the viewers attention and adrenaline pumping and the special effects have held up surprisingly well for a film that was filmed back in 1997.I really wish there was a Director's cut edition of this film.If you've seen this film and you were not frightened...you are either really warped, lying, or talked all the way through it. i suggest a re-watch by yourself with the lights off and all other distractions (laptop, cellphone) switched off as well and just sit and watch...I guarantee fear will gnaw at you eventually.And if you enjoyed this film, you should also check out ""Pandorum"" as it is also fairly good, though not quite in the same league as ""Event Horizon"".""Liberate tutame...ex inferis.""",Event Horizon
212,contronatura,Terrifying and bloody film that loses its way,7,23 February 2000,"Event Horizon is a film that I think has been unfairly bashed, though it does have some bad moments. Basically it takes elements of films like Solaris and novels like Rendezvous with Rama and uses them in a pulpy, B-movie horror film kinda way. This isn't necessarily good, since the film ultimately cops out on its initial instincts. After a very creey first half that promises so much, the film doesn't ever really deliver. The problem with this film, as with many horror films, is that the film loses its power once the unknown terrifying presence manifests itself. Upt to that point Event Horizon is suitably powerful as a horror film. And even after it flies off the rails and starts to resolve its situation in typical fashion, it's entertaining. This gets a 7/10 from me - for horror fans this is one to check out. It's not at the level of Solaris, but it stands well on its own.",Event Horizon
213,yasenkiranov,"The most frightening,effective and disturbing horror movie I have ever seen",10,20 January 2013,"I had extremely low expectations for ""Event Horizon"".The film was made in a period where a lot of filmmakers thought that when you have enough money to use and abuse CGI your movie doesn't need a decent script.With that in mind I thought ""Event Horizon"" was going to be a cliché horror film that makes no effort to build suspense and just throws CG blood and gore in your face.I was wrong.Dead wrong.""Event Horizon"" is the creepiest and most suspenseful horror movie I have ever seen.It manages to create a feeling of dread and foreboding like no other film I have ever seen before.This is due to a combination of great camera-work,appropriate music and(believe it or not) CG.Yes,the CGI is actually used appropriately here,not just added for the sake of it being there.That said,the special effects are top-notch(for 1997).Another thing I liked was that the ship itself wasn't the main threat.It was the characters.They become obsessed with their past mistakes(things they had locked away in their minds and didn't want to remember) and that begins to drive them insane.True,the ship is the catalyst for this,but the focus is more on the characters themselves.This reminds me of ""Cube""-one of my favorite movies.The characters themselves are a bit underdeveloped,but they aren't cannon fodder like in many other horror films.Each of them has their the distinct personality and background information is given about some of them.I think this was alright for the purpose of this film.In my opinion ,if they did add more character development it would have ruined the pacing.""Event Horizon"" is a very well made,but sadly underrated, horror movie.I strongly recommend it.",Event Horizon

215,Unicorn-9,What were they thinking?,4,13 June 2000,"What an awful movie. Given the budget and the cast, I'd expected that it would at least be an enjoyable SF romp, but was sadly disappointed. In the hands of a more talented director the poor script might have worked, but the very blatant attempt to recreate an 'Aliens' style intro immediately put me off, and the rapid degeneration into 'Star Trek' style metaphysical nonsense pretty much finished the job even before the sub-'Hellraiser' horror began.The biggest problem is very simple: there is absolutely no reason for this script to be set in space. It would have worked at least as well with a bunch of kids getting killed in a remote house and a few thousand dollar budget. Instead, someone blew millions on this clunker which will probably put others off making big-budget SF for quite a while.
Yes it has some tension, yes, there are a few nice bits and pieces, but overall it's one of the few movies which has ever left me feeling nostalgic for '2010'...",Event Horizon

Too much is left unexplained, and the whole movie is too disjointed : that's a pity because there were a few choices that I really appreciated, like Sam Neill's character slowly revealing himself as the villain, or the ending that leaves some sort of ambiguity with the last shot.

About as bloody as it gets is when you see the video recordings of the event horizon's crew. Since the vcd i saw it on was bad quality i didn't quite catch why they were murdering each other, but if i had to freeze frame those scenes i'd be more scared.The suspense, though, is very real. A number of scenes had my heart pounding and by the time the movie was over i was shaking. I really can't say its *that* scary, but i also can't say why i had to sleep with the tv turned on.Event Horizon isn't what you would call a 'fright fest', because while it didn't make me jump in shock, the images left some disturbing thoughts in me.",Event Horizon
219,Gideon40,"a great, chilling horror movie.",10,30 July 2002,"Although this movie wasn't liked by many people, I found it to be fantastic and I wished it was longer. For anyone who is going to see this film, I suggest to keep an open mind and hopefully not be eating anything while watching it.(Warning:Review is one big spoiler and is meant only for those who already seen the film)Event Horizon is about a ship that is supposedly meant to be a research vessel that gets involved in an accident and explodes. Years later, it reappears and a rescue team is sent in, though the crew isn't briefed at all. Dr. Weir(Sam Neil) reveals that the event horizon is a ship made to test faster than light travel by bending space and therefore defying human laws. He also reveals it didn't explode, it just dissappeared into thin air and now its back. The rescue team is then given orders to salvage the ship and rescue survivors, but all they find are bits and pieces of the crew everywhere. Before the crew can pull out, though, their own ship is damaged in an accident and they are stranded with the ship, and the horror its brought back with it.While this may sound like your typical sci fi thriller, I found it to be different as there were no aliens, there was no form of physical being that was the antagonist. What I found about the movie that interested me was that by bending space fabric, it therefore passed through a dimension not known to humanity. This would be called Hell. i think its good how the movie didn't at all show what Hell was like, but instead left the viewer to find out why it made the crew kill each other. Its because that by entering a new dimension, human scientific laws do not have to apply in it. This is the case in what the Event Horizon has infected itself with. The ship entered a dimension of pure chaos, where it was complete madness on the crew for as long as they were in it. Its actually quite disturbing when you think about it. A dimension where nothing we apply to science is there, a dimension which the video recording of the event horizon's crew describes perfectly. Having said that, it is possible that any scientific impossibilities with the ship would be excused by the fact that the Event Horizon became a vessel of Hell within the solar system. The grisly images of Hell are truly terrifying, as they clearly represent the more realistic image of Hell. Instead of a place where lava spews from the ground and fire rains from the skies, we are shown images of people going through what seems to be something worse than pain and death. And thats correct because thats what hell is all about, continuous, eternal suffering of the worst kind. But what exactly does hell look like? We shall never know, and nobody can imagine it. The film doesn't even go into showing us, and all the better because chances are, it is a place our minds and eyes are not ready for.So, while many consider it a bad, typical horror flick, I consider it to be a creative masterpiece. I'm not contradicting anyone here, this is just my opinion and what i think of the film. I havn't seen a movie that really frightened me, or made me think about its plot's content for days. Event Horizon though, while it didn't shock me silly, left some very disturbing thoughts in my head and left me thinking about the implications in the story.",Event Horizon

It feels like a visitor to another dimension. The dead ship filled with evidence of a murdered crew makes the _Event Horizon_ spookier than many a haunted mansion or isolated cabin in a Hollywood horror.Unfortunately, the plot never really progresses much.

What makes the film so scary is that the ship is big and a little dark so you are wondering what is around every corner.

For those of you who think that ""Scream"" and other recent horror films are frightening, take my word for it, go see this movie and see what scary really is. Masterfully balancing sci-fi, horror and action, ""Event Horizon"" is a superbly made film that feels just like a thrilling amusement park ride. With as many jump scenes as a roller coaster has hills, this film elicits the same visceral response.The film also boasts a great cast with Neill delivering a fine, increasingly deranged role and Fishburne making up for his last action role in the ""OK"" film Fled here, he strongly commands the screen and proves to be a superb action figure. Although some plot elements are never fully explored such as what's behind the ""evil"" control, and what the deeper back stories are for the characters personal visions/encounters the mystery of these elements only adds to the film's overall uneasy atmosphere. While this is an extremely thrilling, scary film, it's also extremely bloody and hard to watch at some times but that only makes it a better horror film and the best scifi/horror mix for about ten to fifteen years.",Event Horizon

The point is, there is absolutely nothing original here.There are some good actors (Laurence Fishburne is a case in point) whose talents are absolutely wasted on this hackneyed script. About the only thing positive in this film are the special effects, and they are the sole basis for the two points in my numerical rating. But they don't come close to saving this movie. I really feel sorry for viewers and critics who are impressed by this film. It either speaks to how impoverished their experience with earlier/other science fiction films is, or how compelled they are by visual effects alone without needing anything deeper for enjoyment.

231,siobhanmckibbin,Definitely an Event not to miss,9,6 November 2011,"Event Horizon is a ground breaking edition to the horror genre, and a breath of fresh air next to all the teen slasher movies of the 90's.Set in the year 2047, there is a sudden reappearance of a prototype spaceship (Event Horizon) which vanished seven years ago. A rescue ship is sent out to investigate along with Dr William Weir, who is a physics expert responsible for creating the ship. There is no sign of life and as they set out to make repairs the crew begin to sense that they are not alone.So Event Horizon may not have the most complicated plot or work on character development but what it does achieve, is creating an intense atmosphere in a confined space. The most accomplished thing in this film are the hallucinations that the crew experience. The editing techniques used to portray these make them the success that they are. You along with the crew begin to question what you actually seeing on screen, because one minute its there, and in the flash of an eye its gone. This helps to give the movie an eerie edge, and it also plays with your psychological emotions.The main element itself was designed with a Gothic look and feel in mind. The camera angles used add to the intensity; the dark, empty hallways and rooms create a menacing feel, and you definitely feel that there is something lurking beyond, which leaves you in a state of unease. Not to mention the gore is fantastic.Paul Anderson utilises many aspects which other horror films have, but what he achieves is more chilling and leaves an audience at the edge of there seats. An atmospheric horror film, what more could you possibly want?",Event Horizon
232,spazmodeus,Actually Scary,9,31 July 2001,"You shouldn't go in expecting classical sci-fi when you go into this movie. It really is a horror movie, set on a misbehaving, damaged spaceship orbiting the planet Neptune. The thing is, space really is pretty damn scary; this movie portrays that really well. I must confess that this movie didn't begin promisingly--basically, it makes you think it will be a standard B sci-fi flick with cookie-cutter characters, a few not-terribly-original tech ideas, and all the rest that comes with that genre. I watched this alone late at night, scoffed a bit, but then...A certain scene made me think ""whoa, that's pretty freaky"" ... ""and that too!"" I was starting to feel strange watching this B-grade Sci-Fi movie. And then it hit me: I was actually scared. I can't quite explain it, but there it was: for the first time since I can remember, I was frightened by a movie. For maximum effect, I suggest you duplicate these conditions: watch this movie alone (not a good ""girlfriend"" movie), late at night, turn off all lights and blast the sound. If you have neighbors, use good headphones. Be charitable with your suspension of disbelief. In this case it actually pays off.This movie is underrated here because I think it advertises itself in a misleading way. Make no mistake: it's a horror movie, and a pretty good one. If everyone who rated it would have followed my instructions above, I'm sure its ratings would have hovered around the 8. Well, maybe 7.5. Still, if you have a free Friday night alone, you won't regret renting this DVD.",Event Horizon
233,soulcharmer,Quite chilling,7,17 December 2003,"It's not another scifi horror movie. I'm already over evaluating every scientific nonsense as something that a priori drags the movie down. The overall feel is more important to me. Almost all cast presented decent performances. Photography was really good for me, plot and script suited me well. There are no stupid predator aliens to devour all the crew but still you'll be in constant tension because it's untouchable and unseen evil what's in the air. But I advice you, unless you are a fan of this genre, you might be blatantly disappointed just because you are not. It's an american movie you know, so there are still some stupid dialogues as well as some even more stupid clichés present.But in overall, I give it 7/10",Event Horizon

But why or why was there so much profanity and gore? For me it ruined the movie, especially the quick nude scene. What purpose did it serve?The special effects were excellent and I found the acting to be solid.All in all, it did provide scares and it left a lingering dread feeling like no other has since the bad, but scary Amityville Horror.

235,steve-862,"Atmospheric, disturbing, chilling......",10,3 December 2000,This is a truly original film and an excellent one at that.  A dark and disturbing piece of film where you are afraid of more than mere death. You are made to be frightened of the engine room in particular and you get that 'don't go in there' feel as the characters are bit by bit tormented by unseen forces and eventually disposed of. Excellent camera work and direction adds to the eerie and dark nature of the film and the acting is good. For those that like films with evil forces taking the very souls of people in quite gory ways this is a must see.,Event Horizon
236,DrLex,More close to 'Doom' than its own movie adaptation,8,29 April 2007,"People who were disappointed about the movie adaptation of the computer game 'Doom 3', should take a look at 'Event Horizon'. It has exactly what was left out of the 'Doom' movie, being the core concept of the game's story. For the rest it's completely different, but the atmosphere is there, and of course the scares.For people who have no idea what 'Doom' is or don't care about it, 'Event Horizon' is just a good sci-fi horror movie. It borrows from many other movies to end up with an original and quite successful result. In fact, the parts where classics like Alien(s), The Shining and even '2001' can be recognized, are so obvious that they should rather be considered homages than rip-offs. As usual, some people complain about the ""science"" in this movie, but if you've read the plot outline it should be pretty obvious that the goal of the makers was not to show us a documentary on physics. To enjoy this movie optimally, watch it in a dark room with either a good surround system or headphones. The soundtrack does a perfect job of setting the mood without being distracting. Visual effects are quite good for their time, and still look good today. The bottom line: a good mix of sci-fi and horror, nothing groundbreaking but nevertheless entertaining.",Event Horizon
237,andrewhumphreys9968,Event Horizon 7/10,7,21 August 2020,"A fairly high concept sci-fi horror from Paul W.S Anderson in which a salvage/rescue team are sent to investigate the remains of a lost ship, the titular Event Horizon. The special effects haven't aged very well, but the premise is still intriguing and when you do get practical effects, they're pretty good. You can tell it's a 90s film from the opening credits alone, and the ensuing madness is a nostalgia minefield.Laurence Fishburne stars as the captain of the crew sent to recover the Event Horizon, it also includes British actors Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee. However, the most notable amongst the cast is probably Sam Neill who plays a doctor brought on for this mission by the crew, but he is also the man who built the Event Horizon. Neill also starred in ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" a John Carpenter film that's also rooted in cosmic horror. All the acting's fine, bur no one really jumps out beyond Neill, and that's really only during the last act of the movie.The horror elements are partly effective, it does utilise a fear of the unknown, but the more in-your-face horror is sometimes clouded by bad CGI. The sound design was a nice surprise and really helped immerse you in the ship's atmosphere. but, the film's strongest point for me is definitely the set design. The way the Event Horizon looks is naturally imposing, with a lot of its doors looking like sharp-toothed maws, as well as a lot of other spiky points to hurt yourself on. The tunnel bridging the crew's ship to the Event Horizon looked particularly cool, as did the room containing the black hole.The make-up design on Neill after he's possessed by the ship isn't the most convincing, but it's gory and the thought of him doing it to himself is enough to give you the shudders. Some of the other characters don't really get exploited by the ship, which is a shame because seeing how it manipulated people lent itself to their character development. All the behind-the-scenes work that went into this is really interesting, from the small-scale models of the ships all the way to the make-up department.Overall, this definitely won't be for everyone. It's an easy movie to write off as dumb or over-convoluted, but I think it's an effective piece of cosmic horror that has enough gore to tide you over and successfully implicates the horrifying without having to show us. It's got a few good build-ups of tension that usually end up delivering and in my opinion, it succeeds as both a horror and a sci-fi. I would love to see Anderson's full cut of this, as I think a bit more mystery-building and character development could help cement this film as even more of a cult-classic than it already is. To be honest, I wouldn't even mind a remake.",Event Horizon

It manages to maintain a feeling of constant dread throughout, something that is very hard to capture, and it does so effortlessly. You truly feel as though you're aboard the ship, and an evil, otherworldly presence is bearing down on you. The only downside I would say is that it's an incomplete film, and upon subsequent viewings, you do tend to notice a hurried pacing. The original cut was much longer, but it was forced to go through extensive downsizing, removing many scenes that I think could of been of betterment to the film. The deleted scene of the hellish Weir climbing down a ladder, upside down and covered in blood, was particularly worthy of inclusion.Nonetheless, this movie stands out for what the final cut ended up being.",Event Horizon

From unimaginably large/wide spectrum of possible ones, heaven and hell are included, and more... With despairing: ""Liberate tuteme ex infernis"" puts this movie as (one of?) the first Sci-Fis that exploit the notion.Beside just said, the movie is pretentious a bit, with too much of everything. To the point of being naive, at least the movie making perspective. Barking around with quasi-Giger design and scenography, ""creepy"" effects and shallow plot with some more-then-expected horror-like moments combining ""lights off shock"" with twisted body-horror (they even spared on the latter). But: the multiverse and horrors within...After 20 years or so, more and more Sci-Fi movies and techno-thrillers are now rather interesting ta analyze. As technology (and science) changed / progressed a lot. Guess it should be the same with the '50s Sci-Fi from today's point of view. ""Multiverse"" is now much more accepted and quite taken for granted concept in theoretical physics and astrophysics.

240,Navaros,"Terrible movie that MIGHT have been entertaining, scary, and good, as a 10 minute short film.",1,10 March 2008,"Event Horizon is a bad B-movie with a SciFi/horror mix, and it fails in every area it tries to explore.All the characters in Event Horizon have zero personality whatsoever. There is no reason to care about any of them.All the dialogue is terrible. It made all the characters be generic talking heads that only ever say the most necessary, obvious things, in the most mundane way possible, in addition to them having no personality.At least Laurence Fishburne had a strong screen intensity and performs great acting (as usual), which makes him interesting to watch for that reason alone. But none of the other characters even had that, so they were completely worthless. Sometimes bad movies can be elevated by great actors that make you care about their characters even when the movie has nothing else going for it. That ability is something an actor either has or doesn't have. Laurence Fishburne has that. Other than Laurence Fishburne, none of the actors in Event Horizon have that. Like Laurence Fishburne says in the classic gangster movie, ""Hoodlum"": ""Either you get it, or you don't"". Fishburne is the only actor in Event Horizon who *gets it*. He made his screen-presence in Event Horizon compelling despite having very little to work with in terms of what his (badly) scripted lines are and the bad script in general.Event Horizon was extremely boring and barely scary at all. Most of the ""scares"" come from cheesy gimmicks rather than from legitimate ways, like having a very loud crashing sound effect suddenly play when a severed hand floats into someone's space helmet.Event Horizon didn't really need to spend 5 minutes rehashing the tired old fold space/wormhole SciFi cliché that has been done ad nauseam over and over again for approximately the past 100 years. It is also very pompous the way this movie pretends it *invented* this concept, when it certainly did not.There are very, very few entertaining/interesting/scary minutes of screen-time are in Event Horizon. Maybe 5, at the very most. That leaves 87 minutes of boring, monotonous screen-time that is filled with nothing but pointless filler. Nothing really happens in this movie until the last 5 minutes, It does not take 92 minutes to say: ""This ship broke the laws of physics, went to Hell as a result, and brought back some scary delusions/supernatural phenomenon"". But Event Horizon tries to pad-out that 5 minutes worth of content into 92 minutes worth of content, and the result is the total disaster of a movie that is Event Horizon.I understand there is a concept called ""suspense"", but for suspense to work there must *first* be characters worth caring about. Event Horizon doesn't have any, so claiming that all the boring filler (approximately 87 minutes of this movie's 92 minute screen-time) exists for the sake of suspense isn't going to cut it. The *only* way that Event Horizon works on any level whatsoever is as a sleep-inducing miracle cure for those who suffer from insomnia.Even *another* universally-panned (Event Horizon was also universally-panned) SciFi/horror movie with the same theme as Event Horizon, did the same theme much, much better. That movie is called ""Supernova"" starring James Spader, from the year 2000. James Spader and everyone in the movie Supernova make you care about them via outstanding charisma and great acting. Event Horizon is a major step *down* from Supernova. Event Horizon is an *even poorer* rehash of what was a very poor movie in the first place. It is no surprise that Paul W.S. Anderson career would continue to consist of creating bad B-movie SciFi productions and video game movies. That is exactly what Event Horizon was. No better of a bad B-movie than any of the rest of his movies that came before and after, all of which have the same very low quality as Event Horizon.If Event Horizon was a 10 minute short film, it could have cut all the crap and had nothing but good, solid, scary, worthwhile entertainment in it. Instead of being that, Event Horizon is a terrible movie in every respect (other than Fishburne's excellent acting), with barely 5 minutes worth of of worthwhile entertainment in it.",Event Horizon

This vessel named the 'Event Horizon', mysteriously disappears beyond the Eigth Planet Neptune. 7 years later, the U.S.A.C (Search & Rescue), space vessel Lewis & Clark and her crewe, are re-reployed and dispatched in secrecy to rendezvous in the vicinity of the Planet Neptune. Prior to embarking on their mission, they stop off at the Low-Earth-Orbit 'Daylight Station' to pick up a mysterious extra crewe member. This is one Dr Weir, whom they are to discover, designed the 'Event Horizon'. They discover this during a ship's briefing , after they have emerged from 'Stasis', and are 56 days outbound; having arrived in the orbit of Planet Neptune. During the briefing, they are also told the 'Event Horizon' vessel lost during the past 7 years, was the source of an intercepted Radio Transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune. Publicly released information at the time of the Event Horizon's dissapearance was a cover story for the fact the vessel had simply dissappeared without a trace. They are also told the 'Event Horizon' was a research mission to create a vessel capable of faster than light flight. This was achieved by using a Gravity Drive. Their mission is to rescue the crewe, and find out where the 'Event Horizon' has been for 7 years.

242,boo_4ever,Irony,9,2 April 2005,"The irony being that Paul Anderson having done so many video game to movie translations (Resident Evil, Alien vs Predator) has probably delivered the best movie of Doom that will ever be made. And it isn't even Doom.Doom is a classic video game about man using super technology to meddle with things best left alone. Portals are opened which spew satanic hordes creating an interesting mix of the technological and the arcane. The Doom movie out this summer looks to have dropped that bit entirely, instead relying on a run of the mill ""people infected by virus"" excuse for all the killing. The essence of that clash though is still here in the criminally underrated Event Horizon.In Event Horizon a spaceship (of the same name) is finally found after having disappeared for several years. It seems it was conducting experiments in faster then light travel - using wormholes to travel huge distances instantly. However it may have traveled to a place no one us would dare to go. And brought back something with it...Event Horizon is a creepy horror film that doesn't rely on a CGI monster revelation at the end to get it scares. The ship itself is shaped like a cross and is itself a Gothic labyrinth. I have to confess I didn't know much about this film until I watched it thinking it was a run of the mill sci fi movie. The tension builds slowly and effectively and it has a terrific ending. The mix of hellish imagery and futuristic sci fi is a fascinating clash for me personally which is why I found myself loving this film.Paul Anderson gets a lot of stick, but don't let that put you off watching this. I've even liked Resident Evil (because I loved the videogames) and Alien vs Predator. So you can see I have a penchant for liking films which have been critically raped. Event Horizon hasn't been put through the grinder as much as the previous films but I feel it still gets unnecessary criticism, a lot of it needless ""I don't need to watch it! Its Paul Anderson!"" type stuff.I still hate Soldier mind you.",Event Horizon

It started off in the right direction by keeping the ship's past whereabouts a secret, giving the horror an ambiguously creepy feel. But it made the mistake of leaving the audience too much in the dark. The only clue ever given is a dead end.The cast is the only part of the movie that works. Most of them give good performances, most notably Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. You can tell they did the best with what they had.The special effects are pretty good.

If you're a stickler for good science in sci-fi, then don't go near this abomination.  The science goes beyond laughable into the absurd.  (""Look, ma -- instant gravity!""  And in the upper atmosphere of a rather large planet, no less, where such things as artificial gravity wouldn't be needed...)But, I do digress.  Basically, the screenplay (if you can call it that) for this load of hardware laden excreta was so all-over-the-place, while being producer influenced (in a bad way) that by the time we got to the gory conclusion, I'd already been there, done that, and didn't give a flying damn.  Consistency out the window, the rules made up as we went along; what was promised (in the trailer) as some sort of psychological venture was nothing more than an exercise in gross-out of the David Fincher variety -- without Fincher's ability to tell a story visually.And, one other debit -- Sam Elliot seems to be suffering Michael Caine disease.  He'll appear in any piece of crap, it seems, if they sign the paychecks and give him lots of scenery chewing moments.  Obviously, he never read the script for this slag heap before he agreed to step before the cameras, which is a shame -- cause I used to like him as an actor.  On second thought, though... Omen III.

246,Dr_Kruger,under appreciated,9,26 June 2008,"I remember this film getting a critical lashing and not fairing too well at the box office, but I can see Anderson's comments in the special features being true. His vision was of a film that, not unlike ""The Shining"", that didn't fair well on it's release, he hoped that ""Event Horizon"" would steadily gain followers over the years.I really don't see why that shouldn't be the case. Although Anderson's more recent films haven't been much to shout about I think he still has a great imagination and better films will surely follow from him. I think ""Event Horizon"" should eventually become a real classic.It's a great spin on 'monster horror', the irony and ingeniousity being there are no actual monsters. Not unlike other great horror's, you don't actually see the evil character in question, only the product of that evil which in this case is Sam Neill's character.There great performances all around in particular Sam Neill and Kathleen Quinlan, it's not overly reliant on special effects, although the effects that are used are timeless, excellent makeup and pyrotechnics (apart from the dodgy early CGI engine coolant), it's excellently held together with timing and pacing which always keeps you on the edge of your seat.The work on lighting especially creates the mood for a great horror.

247,KentaroK,Enjoyable Rental,7,30 January 2010,"In a nutshell, Event Horizon is an enjoyable rental in the suspense/horror genre.There is a lot of gore in some scenes, but it is not, overall, a ""gorefest"".Somehow, despite having great production values, some great actors, and a pace which is just right, the movie also tends not to be remembered. Perhaps it is because the characters are not as deep and developed as you might want. Perhaps it is because this is really three stories in one.The first story, is what happened to the Event Horizon (a spaceship), several years ago.The second story, is what will happen to the Event Horizon in the future. (I'm being vague so as to avoid any spoilers).The third story, is what will happen to the crew sent on a rescue mission to find and recover the Event Horizon. This third story is the focus, told from the perspective of the rescue crew.This movie might have been better if it told just one story, giving itself more time to develop the characters. That way, a prequel (or two) could fill in some more of the back story.However, it seems like film makers are content to only make one movie nowadays. What's up with that? Don't they want money? Anyhow, all three stories take a back seat to the suspense aspects. This is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie, but I think that the horror is what makes the suspense worthwhile, so that is why I call it a ""suspense/horror"". The first time you watch it, you will be surprised, even if you think you see things coming.I own a copy of this movie and will enjoy re-watching it later, already have watched it a few times, but, I have to say that with all the good movies out now (including older movies which are being re-released, etc.), this may be more of a rental than a must-buy movie.As a rental movie, I rate it 9/10, grade A.As a rental, the only thing that could have made it better, was more ""impact"": better dialog, faster pace with more ""action"", more focused character development, less time spent building up the story.If you're looking to buy, I'd rate it only 6/10, grade B.The quality of its parts are high but it just isn't remarkable enough. With a bit more effort, and perhaps making it a series of two or three movies instead of just one, it would have been much more impressive.Overall, then, 7/10, or a B+ grade. Enjoyable as a rental, but make sure to screen it before you buy it.",Event Horizon
248,eichler2,Is it a mediocre horror movie or a horrible sci-fi movie? It's both!,1,12 June 2017,"Just saw this on one of those cable channels that shows uncut movies, and now I remember why I avoided seeing it for so many years.It starts out OK apart from the cheesy opening credits sequence that probably looked pretty cool in 1997 but looks really dated now (as do most of the computer generated effects in the movie). A space ship called the Event Horizon, which was presumed lost seven years ago has unexpectedly sent out a distress signal from Neptune. A rescue team is dispatched along with a scientist who, early in the film, explains that he invented the special drive that was supposed to let Event Horizon open a hole in the fabric of space-time and jump directly to a neighboring star. So far, so good - seems like it could be an interesting sci-fi movie, although there are many signs that it's actually a horror movie, including the fact that the Event Horizon was apparently designed to look like a haunted castle floating in space. And it's actually ""orbiting"" within the atmosphere of Neptune. But whatever.HERE'S THE BIG SPOILER - and I reveal it only because if, like me, you were hoping this would be a decent sci-fi flick, this should put you right off it - the hole that Event Horizon opened didn't lead to a neighboring star. It went, literally, to hell. And after causing the original crew to murder each other in gory, ritualistic ways, it has come back to our universe looking for more victims.OK, say you're willing to buy into that as a horror film plot. Even then this movie is terrible because it basically just lifts plot elements and visual elements from Alien, Stargate, The Shining and a host of other, better films. And then throws in a bunch of jump scares - sudden loud noises, flashing lights, etc - and tons of gore. Nearly everything in this movie is a cliché that you've probably seen elsewhere, and if you're not able to fully predict how the second half is going to play out, then you've never watched a horror movie before.The movie really wasn't even worth the amount of time it took to write this review, but I was shocked when I looked it up on IMDb and saw people giving it 8, 9 and 10 star reviews.

Perhaps it is the echo of that fear I developed in my youth, but there is something incredibly unsettling about Event Horizon. Yes, the sci-fi side of things doesn't really add up, causing enormous continuity errors and goofs, and resulting in this half lost in space adventure / half inter-dimensional psychological horror really hitting the mark - for about only half of the time. The fact that there was a lost 130 minute cut of this 90 minute movie tells me that there was a lot more going on that we weren't filled in on. A recent journey through the revived Twin Peaks taught me that a deeper sense of satisfaction can be achieved by embracing and perpetuating mystery; that great things can come of events that raise more questions than they set out to solve, but here it still kinda feels like we are being cheated out of finding what truly lies behind that portal into the ""hell"" dimension. The lost cut is just that; lost, forever, and that bizarre story just adds to the intrigue around this contrasting movie. Maybe we don't need to find out what ""hell"" looks like...perhaps we are already there.

A movie has to have an ending and it's not always an easy feat for horror movies to keep everyone satisfied with them. This reviewer was. Great performances by Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne really carry the hell-scary plot. It's creepy, eeky and sci-fi fans will probably really enjoy it.

The film moves very slowly but does not deliver any kind of reward for those who are patient enough to wait for it to unravel. One of my biggest criticisms of the film is that is doesn't explore what happened to the crew of The Event Horizon sufficiently to make it engaging and interesting enough. All those ""flash back"" scenes of the crew only serve to frustrate the viewer as it is not sufficiently fleshed out tat the end. We can only surmise some terrible ""thing"" happened to them. It both frustrating and yes becomes boring. Also almost as a homage to Alien(s) it borrows scenes directly from the movie. For instance the scene where Sam Neil is sucked out of the airlock. The scene where the rescue vessel discovers and boards the pod from the Event Horizon ( so similar to start Aliens go check it out) and the scene where one of the survivors ""dreams"" the evil Sam Neil is one of the rescuers........well it seemed pretty obvious to me. Over all terrible film.
 I wonder when Sam Neil walks into one of those lovely old Pubs in Dunedin New Zealand after a day working on the farm, whether the locals ask him ""hey Sam weren't you in that movie , Event Horizon?"" Just as he's about to throw a dart just to put him off..........i would! Ha!",Event Horizon
254,El_Rey_De_Movies,Don't go on this ship...,7,7 April 2008,"This is not a sci-fi movie; it's a haunted house story wrapped in the outward trappings of science fiction. It's a direct movie descendant of ""Alien"" and ""The Haunting"". Sam Neill is, once again, excellent as the designer/builder of the Event Horizon, the greatest achievement of his career that he cannot enjoy because he's wracked by the guilty knowledge that all the time he spent on it cost him the love and life of his wife, Claire. The ship, equipped with some fancy dimension-warping black hole drive, has returned after having disappeared seven years before, God knows where. It's never quite clear, but it seems to be either a dimension of pure destructive chaos or even Hell itself. Each crew-member's hidden fears and guilt are preyed upon by whatever it is that now inhabits the ship. Yes, there is blood and gore (plenty of it!), but this movie gives us chills thru the astounding ship sets (it looks like something wrenched from a Gothic cathedral), clever use of light and darkness, and the feeling that there's something either behind you or right next to you, watching you all the time. It's creepy and disturbing, all the way to the end. One of my all-time favorites.",Event Horizon
255,sebbezw,I don't understand why it gets so mediocre ratings,10,4 February 2006,"This is sci fi horror at its best. Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but movies never scare me. But this one did it. Its efficiently scaring, disturbing and creepy, and at the same time brutal and shocking. Is it hard to understand that mix? Well, mix up Hellraiser: Hell on Earth and Hellraiser: Inferno and put in a sci fi plot and voilá! We've got Event Horizon! Now, the (near) perfect script isn't the only superb thing which makes this movie incredible. Great acting from Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne and Jason Isaacs is also very important. I never liked Fishburne, but this movie changed my mind about this wonderful guy. Sam Neill has always ruled and he does that in this movie too. Jason Isaacs is one of my personal favorite actors so I cant give him bad criticism. Sorry, I just cant. In this case I cant give him that just 'cos his my favorite, he is truly great in this movie. And so is all the other actors. They put their soul and mind in their performance and they add their part to make a true masterpiece.The special effects rule too. So does the direction. And the production. And, I never thought I would say this about a movie which only lasted for 'bout 90 minutes, the running time is perfect. Every second is valuable, perfectly used and not a single moment or scene seems to be wasted. Gee, just listen to what I'm saying! Here I'm sitting and raising this movie to the heavens! Is there really nothing to complain about? Well, just let me say one word; ""No."" I love this movie. If you liked Alien 'cos of the sci fi horror, then you'll love this! I promise! If not, you're welcome to slap me in the face.",Event Horizon
256,bowwowwowyippy,Great,8,13 November 2019,Not sure why the average is so low here. Sam Neill pulls of a very disturbing role that seems unusual for him. I was really on edge this entire film!,Event Horizon
257,kaipi-1,overall pretty stupid,4,20 January 2008,"It's the kind of movie that leaves you thinking, what? The plot was fine but they tried to make it better by adding a bunch of special effects placed in inappropriate places.This movie messed up where all horror movies do, showing too much of the monster too soon in the movie. And when you did see it, it wasn't all that good. Plus, they explain the problem like eight times, I should think that once would be enough. That just got irritating, I get it, the ship went to hell and came back, get on with it.I think they just tried to put too much in too little time. It left nothing open, it was extremely predictable, and there was no suspense. I just found it annoying.",Event Horizon
258,Ekul1021,Pretty good story especially one that influences Doom,7,30 December 2013,"Whoever would have thought that science fiction can be mixed in with religion? Well Event Horizon certainly does fit that bill and no doubt the 3D shooter game Doom certainly followed through.Imagine a ship goes through Hell, must be one pretty bad trip especially when the thought of having demons in a science fiction world seems impossible. The movie color does give that evil view and Doom certainly took that creative license to another level.Unfortunately, some of the acting was about on average especially with Sam Neil which could have been expanded like why was he so obsessed with the ship and the history on his wife too when she has no eyeballs.Otherwise, a good film that goes good with Doom 3 since game was a success and no doubt owes some to this movie.",Event Horizon
259,Gorgorgorgoroth,"Stupid, just stupid",3,20 June 2016,"First of all, the plot was stupid. Sam Neill built a ship that went missing for seven years because it entered a dimension that was ""pure evil"", or something like that, and the ship came back. The ship became ""alive"" and it somehow had access to people's thoughts, it would know about other people's family members and their past. Umm how? Also, close to the end of the film, Sam Neill got sucked into the space vacuum and he eventually got back to the ship because ""the ship didn't want him to leave."" Really? That doesn't sound stupid to you at all?Secondly, the acting was lame. I swear the actors had almost no emotion whatsoever, including Laurence Fishburne, even when someone was about to die, the actors still hardly had any emotion.Thirdly, Sam Neill being the antagonist was just corny. I couldn't take this movie seriously anymore.Fourth, the movie felt like a mixture of ""Alien"" and ""Hellraiser"". So unoriginal.Last but not least, the movie was made by Paul WS Anderson who is known for making shltty movies.",Event Horizon
260,lukalele,Stays in your mind,6,7 April 2007,"I thought this was a passable horror film, not much that's original, but scary enough. Good, suspenseful music, visions of dead people, all the usual stuff in an immersive sci-fi setting and the film does it all well.There's one thing I have to give it credit for that sets it apart... it has THE most disturbing depiction of hell I've seen in any film, before or since. The images go by in a split-second, on screen barely long enough for your mind to register them, but they managed to stay in my mind long after the film was over. They really drive the point home that hell is really NOT a place you'd want to visit, ever. Way more impact than the fire and brimstone version.Quite disturbing and very, very effective.",Event Horizon
261,The-Evil-Dead,One of the best horror films of all time.,10,11 February 2004,"This is one of the very few movies that ever got to me for some reason or another, and I still can't place why... Maybe it's the creepy video they uncover that tells the fate of the last crew of the event horizon, or the atmosphere that this movie gives off. I usually don't scare easy, and have seen too many horror flicks for my own good, but to this day this one can still give me chills. I suppose it would take the right viewer, the one that doesn't like to be a dork and laugh their way through the whole movie regardless of what it is. Anyway, the story and plot are quite minor, but what is served up here is great atmosphere and some good scares. Definitely good fare for any horror buff, and I've yet to have any of my friends turn it away after a viewing. I'd provide a description, but it's been done already.Another plus to this movie is Sam Neill's excellent performance as Dr Wier. He's a totally creepy and whacked out guy, and once things get rolling, he really appears as if he's having a good time with his role as the whacked out doc. Jason Isaacs nails his role as TJ, and even good ol' Larry Fishbourne isn't half bad ( Compared to what he usually doe )
This movie is worth it for the good scares, and Sam Neill.A solid 9/10",Event Horizon
262,motorfocus82,Didn't finish it.,8,18 November 2012,"I'm giving this score on raw concept, because when I watched it, I didn't finish it. So obviously, there's a bit I didn't see. This is the only time this has happened to me. It was a long time ago... I was 16.At that age, I knew just enough about physics to know that, with the black hole horror movie device, the restraints had been removed. You can theoretically put ANYTHING on the other side of a black hole. It's a dimensional gateway concept perfected, with some theoretical scientific validity. After seeing the chick with no eyes at the beginning, I decided that I was good without watching whatever other madness the creators came up with. I can do without filling my pants tonight, thanks.I should rent it and try again, but... hell no.",Event Horizon
263,sibelian,Not bad...,7,14 October 2006,"7 stars.I'd give it an 8, but it's not QUITE an 8. 7.8, say.The design is good, REALLY good, unique and compelling. They manage to make the ship look beastly creepy. It's a bit OTT and obvious, but V effective...The acting is really surprisingly good. The script ISN'T that good, but is made more than palatable by excellent interpretation by Sam Neill and most of the rest of the cast except Lawrence Fishburne, who spoils his part sufficiently to bring this film down from a ""9"".(I simply can't understand why people keep casting Fishburne in Sci fi or Fantasy films. He obviously despises the genre...) The premise is a Hellraiser rip-off, but sufficiently different to make the new angle work in surprising ways.Sam Neill really pulls this movie back out of Fishburne's clutches and away from the brink of turkeydom several times and *then* his gravitas slingshots it into well-deserved cult status...Good last shot, too...",Event Horizon
264,Oreolove,Snooze!,2,10 January 2002,"This movie redefines ""turkey."" The creators have managed to make it as unbelievable and confusing as possible. (How many people have you seen get sucked into space, without a spacesuit, and return to the ship with nothing more than minor cuts?) Not even the All-Star cast could've saved this one. Sadly, the ""All-Star cast"" didn't live up to their title. Laurence Fishburne came off as a jerk even though he was the hero and Sam Niel was sadly miscast far below his talent. The plot moved slowly, most of the characters came off as either stupid or sharp-tongued, and the ""comic relief"" just came off as annoying. I would like to congratulate new-comer Jack Noseworthy for pulling off a decent performance, although he somewhat becomes like a vegetable before the movie is half over. The plot is left with holes you could drive a truck through, and leaves the viewer feeling emotionally drained and utterly confused. Nothing less than a miracle could have saved this bomb.",Event Horizon
265,martoni64,"Disturbing, creepy",7,17 May 2007,"You would be excused if your first thoughts goes to Alien when seeing this movie. A crew off to discover what happened to the exploration craft Event Horizon, which has just recently been resighted after having been missing for 7 years.But where Alien excelled in it's monster creature, Event Horizon is a more Gothic space horror story. It works on the psychological level without too much gore in the final theater version. It doesn't create such a claustrophobic atmosphere as Alien but still is good as action.Apparently not well received when shown in the theaters, but I think it is very much worth a look. It could have been even tighter psychologically perhaps - but apparently under rated by media reviewers.",Event Horizon

267,cmills-98693,Don't store your directors cut in a salt mine.,6,2 November 2019,"After watching it is clear that an extended, gorier directors cut is exactly what Event Horizon needs to push it into the really great category. Unfortunately while this cut did exist, they stored it in a salt mine in Europe and it rotted away, meaning that the only cut available now is the 95 minute normal one. While good at times and psychological at times, it reminded me more of a very tame Hellraiser as opposed to its own individual entity.Still a strong movie and a great sci-fi/horror crossover.",Event Horizon

270,Fox in Socks,Quite an enjoyable horror movie,8,7 September 2001,"This is certainly one of the spookier films I've seen in a while. Don't expect 2001: A Space Odyssey crossed with Alien, though. It does have strengths and weaknesses, and sometimes the cast get a little too Scooby Doo in their investigations. There are a few rather artificial devices used to advance the plot, which depends more on set-pieces than seamless storytelling. The film scores highly on imagery and environment. If you let it draw you in, it does create a pretty good atmosphere which in the early stages owes more to classical horror than cheap shocks. Particularly pleasing is the imaginative use of sound effects to enhance your sensory experience, rather than just as a vehicle for a bolt-on soundtrack.Good, but not great. Should certainly appeal to anyone who likes Clive Barker or John Carpenter",Event Horizon

273,hhg2,High gore in outer space hell,2,13 May 2015,"There are two basic types of horror films--suspense-based and gore-based. Since I can't stand the former, it won't be a surprise that I greatly disliked this movie. Placing the scene in the future allows for some plot contrivances (whatever plot there is), but the ""science"" in the science fiction is so lame as to be laughable. I doubt there was a technical adviser within 10 light-years of either writing or production. With no plot and no character development (and some idiotic characters, to boot!), you are left roughly with an Olympic-pool sized bloodbath to make up for the rest. There were some reviewers who mentioned Hellraiser as a possible reference type in their comments, and I would concur. Some of the special effects grotesqueries were good, and that is why I gave a rating of 2 rather than 1. If hack-fest movies are your thing, have at it. I'd guess it might rate much higher in your view! But, if you are/were looking for an interesting science fiction tale, seek elsewhere.",Event Horizon
274,marshallonfilm_,"""Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse.""",3,1 April 2020,"Developing a cult following for its terrific set design, gruesome sadomasochist iconography and otherworldly Lovecraftian themes, this $60 million cosmic horror shoots for the stars as 'The Shining in space', but slips into a worse dimension with a frustrating sci-fi spin on Clive Barker's Hellraiser. Plagued by many demons during a troubled production, such as its rushed editing schedule, unfinished CGI and poor sound mix, the film falls apart with gory sequences that feel torn to shreds and stitched back together, not too dissimilar from Sam Neill's hokey turn after a strong set-up in the first act. Aspects like the techno-gothic aesthetic and spooky atmosphere contribute to a sense of foreboding and dread, but sadly never pay off, thanks in no part to a mediocre Philip Eisner script and ill-advised studio meddling. Despite horrifying visuals and a host of game character actors, in particular the tonally jarring but hilarious Richard T. Jones, Paul W.S. Anderson misses the mark for a dull 96 minutes that doesn't point to a longer, better cut lost to time and space.

Laurence Fishburne is the captain of the Lewis&Clark (rescueship) and Sam Neill is the doctor that created the Event Horizon. I won't tell too much about the movie because I think that you should see it. It is like old horror movies about haunted houses but instead we got what seems to be a haunted ship.My friend, Cathulu thinks that this is a really great movie and that it took his heart away.

Anyway, ""event horizon"" is really scary, it´s about one real thing, the infinite space, and the possibility that this thing exist isn´t very improbable... well.. is a little grouchy (but this kind of ""travel"" can physically exist), but if you put yourself in this situation ,it´s really scaring and the most frighten thing are your own fears (as this movie shows) and as the tagline says.. infinite space really means infinite terror. And this movie is well done, and you can really get in the movie and believe those things. I recommend this movie to everyone.

279,mattwaterhouse,Works brilliantly as both a sci fi and a horror,9,11 March 2008,"A signal is picked up in orbit of Neptune from the Event Horizon, a starship with experimental engines that went missing several years previously. A salvage crew, as well as the ship's designer, are sent to investigate and retrieve the ship and crew, but on board the Event Horizon all is not as it seems... This movie is very good at creating suspense and it does this in many ways, from the performances of the characters and the magnificent score right down to the lighting. And it does this as well as any horror film (aside from the obvious genre leading films like Psycho etc.) The film undoubtedly works as a sci-fi too, but this is psychological horror at it's most disturbing without lapsing into torture porn. Performance-wise, overall this film is a showcase. Britain is represented brilliantly in Sam Neill (who is actually Australian, my bad), Jason Isaccs and Sean Pertwee. Neill in particular shines in what I believe is by far his deepest and most well acted role as Dr Weir. The other stand out performances are from Kathleen Quinlan and the criminally underused Jack Noseworthy: the latter's performance in the airlock scene is simply breathtaking. The only annoying thing about this film in terms of performance was that Laurence Fishburne and Joely Richardson, both established actors, could have and should have been a hell of a lot better in this movie. Richardson is not in it enough, but neither was Noseworthy so thats no excuse. And the Cooper character was just there to play a black stereotype, saying ""OOOO YEAH BABY!"" at every opportunity. Without him this movie would be a definite ten. I have seen this film a couple of times, and it still has the capacity to make me soil myself every time.

But for some reason, I just like this movie more than many of those. The story isn't as strong, for one thing; at times it seems a little (okay, I digress, a lot) contrived. None of this matters, however, because this is just such an awesome film. So the story itself centers around a spaceship that disappeared, and his since reappeared out by Neptune. This ship is the Event Horizon. A rescue vessel, the Lewis Clark is sent out to recover the ship, but it becomes apparent fairly quickly that something isn't right. From this point on, the movie becomes a sci-fi gore-fest, but a good one, with a great story to back it up. The blood isn't constant, either. Event Horizon isn't made to be a slasher film in space. The cast is phenomenal. I personally love Lawerence Fishbourne and Sam Neill. Neill especially is great as he slowly falls into insanity.Event Horizon is a magnificently crafted sci-fi horror film, the best I have ever seen, along with Alien. Sure, there may be some small plot holes, but I haven't been this absorbed in a movie since Avatar. There's people who rip on Event Horizon for miscellaneous flaws. I'm not saying it isn't flawed. However, as I said before, there are movies with less problems that weren't as enjoyable as an experience. EH grabs your attention and absolutely refuses to let go for the next hour and a half. It's hard to believe it was made the same director who single-handedly ruined two sci-fi franchises at once. At least he made one excellent one.",Event Horizon
285,macduff50,"mismatched ideas, gore effects, sink flick",4,14 April 2006,"I have to disagree with those who like this film, sort of.It sets itself up as a science fiction film, but in fact, it's a horror film, and worse, a theological horror film. The spaceship's ""drive"" allows it to travel in space by short-cutting through other dimensions, but when, after an absence of seven years, it returns to the solar system, it turns out (**SPOILER**) that it's actually been to Hell.The problem is that science fiction is based on science, and the idea of this film depends on a literal understanding of some fairly medieval (aka fundamentalist) Christianity. The two simply don't mix. Those who like science fiction will be deeply annoyed by the intrusion of religious ideas, and those who are religious likely will miss this film entirely because it looks like science fiction.In the end too, a lot of loose ends remain untied. Is Hell real? Is it just another dimension? What's the theory behind the way all these dimensions fit together into some universe or other? Are our cultural ideas about Hell derived from some sort of intuition about these other dimensions? Who knows? Who cares? Certainly not the film-makers, who seem interested only in milking the concept for the maximum amount of gore and pointless shocks -- you know, the sort that make you jump in your seat for a second, and then you realize that's all it was: no concept, just another ""Gotcha!"" moment. Manipulative and thoughtless film-making at its worst (or best, depending on your tastes).And the truly sad part is that the acting and the set design are truly fabulous. A lot of energy was expended on making the ship seem workable, real, and genuinely creepy. In the end, however, all the effort is wasted. The story doesn't fit together, and the genre itself is misjudged. Give it a miss.",Event Horizon

The clever plot becomes insignificant, and I couldn't have cared less whether the characters lived or died! Watching this movie required hard work on my part, the only reason I saw it through to the end was just incase there was a possibility it improved at some point.

Needless to say someone got locked outside the room and had to sleep in the cold all alone. There are not many good movies out there that can make a cut for a good thriller. This particular movie made it to a fairly good horror range. A very good collection of cast members (Lawrence Fishburn and Sam Niels being my favorites in the team) and a well thought out plot and special effects. Perhaps I am being partial on the special effects since this movie was made during a time where special effects did matter and it was not just computers that did the image trick. The movie did have its share of gruesomeness that did send some shivers down my back. It is one of the classic movies that I definitely want to own and also recommended to watch in groups or with your significant other. Even today I still consider this one of the classics that should be watched. Even though I admit that I cannot see Fishburn in the same serious manner after seeing him as cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's play house (what the hell was that? A gay cowboy?) but he is still one of the most top notch actors that stands side by side with Sam Niels.,Event Horizon

290,cpudsey,Best horror/sci-fi flick in years,10,5 May 2003,"I really, really liked this film. It went straight into my all time top twenty as soon as I saw it. If you are a horror or sci-fi fan, this is a must see. To put it very simply, Event Horizon is a haunted-house movie, set on a spaceship. This description hardly does it justice though. Picture Hellraiser meets Alien, or Seven meets Pitch Black, and you've got a better idea. Some hardcore sci-fi fans might have a little trouble swallowing the supernatural/horror aspect of the film, though. Not a traditional sci-fi by most standards, leaning more towards horror with a futuristic space setting. On the flipside, horror fans  who aren't into sci-fi should have no trouble getting into this movie despite it's setting. Astoundingly beautiful set design, very nice effects, a genuinely scary atmosphere, powerhouse performance by Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne and a solid story make this a film not to be missed. I am amazed at some of the poor reviews this movie got, particularly the number that included comments like `Where were the aliens?'. It really makes me think they missed the whole point  but you can hardly expect a balanced review of a sci-fi or horror movie from some latte swilling pseudo-intellectual who does nothing but rave about foreign art films. No self-respecting horror or sci-fi fan should miss this movie.",Event Horizon
291,Maarten1985,Decent sci-fi/horror - Underrated,7,13 August 2006,"EVENT HORIZON is a pretty good sci-fi/horror movie which you'll either love or hate. It's a very dark and depressing movie which completely justifies the 'terror' in the tag-line. Perhaps the continuing terror is why some people probably dislike it.As far as I know, most horror movies lack a decent story or decent acting or character development. That's why I'm not into horror movies that much. But Event Horizon has an interesting story that is an ideal and most of all original environment for a horror movie. Even though character development is limited, as the film progresses you'll get to know most of the characters better. Especially Sam Neill's (Dr. Weir) and Laurence Fishburn's (Cpt. Miller) characters.The acting was done very well by most of the cast, most notable Laurence Fishburn and Sam Neill who did a good job. The sets on the other hand are brilliant and creepy at the same time. I would not feel comfortable walking around in any of those rooms, especially the engineering room featuring the Gravity Drive (sphere with 3 magnetic rings within a room filled with deadly spikes on the walls and ceiling). This adds more tension than there already is to the movie which makes the experience only better and worthwhile.The special effects in this movie are quite a treat. Ranging from an external view of the gigantic Event Horizon around Neptune to Dr. Weir and his 'HANDywork' with his eyes.In my opinion, this is a good but underrated sci-fi horror movie with lots of freaky moments that will keep your heart racing. If you like the depressing endless terror, you'll like this movie quite a bit. If you rather have happy endings and laughs, you'll probably dislike it.For the best experience, watch this movie in a dark room at night or even past midnight with the volume turned up a bit over the normal setting.Rated 7/10 on IMDb, but I personally would give it a 7.5/10.",Event Horizon

293,DeviousMrBlonde,A Great Premise Ruined By a Hack!,5,28 April 2006,"Terrible terrible (that's right - so bad I had to write the word twice) dialogue. I can't believe I actually watched this for the second time in my life last night. I had vague memories of not liking it the first time but I said I'd give it another try as I've been starved of good sci-fi since Dark City and of course I've watched the Alien Quadrilogy way too much (AvP doesn't count as an Alien movie).It's about as scary as a pillow. There was some tension at the beginning but once things get going it just gets boring. Nothing original whatsoever, painful forced dialogue, and once the ""action"" kicks in any attempt at creating a story goes out the window and we're treated like morons wanting nothing more than loud bangs.In saying that, the beginning is relatively enjoyable although I found the rip-offs of Alien much too obvious to the point of actual plagiarism.It's just a VERY average movie. In fact I found myself thinking at many points in the film, that this should be standard viewing at all film schools, it is a master lesson in what NOT to do.At the end of the day Anderson is just a hack, there is absolutely no evidence to the contrary. I cannot believe FOX (although it is FOX after all) are considering letting him do something with AvP2.NOW THAT IS A SCARY THOUGHT!!",Event Horizon
294,Sooner_88,"Event Horizon has its moments but, nothing to get underwhelmed about!..",8,13 October 2009,"This I would honestly say.. Is the best last horror sci-fi movie that Hollywood has had a decent crack at it since lately..well, Pandorum! People want to give pandorum a high stake in its genera when Event Horizon is (quote Sam Neill) ""something much much more!"" It breaks the bounds of the psychological mind and brings out the nasty horror of what true interpretation of hell really is! It's mind numbing to see a director Paul S. Anderson give the audience something really gritty and not be accepted as a great sci-fi classic!? It's puzzling... Although the cliché's will be seen, that doesn't effect the nightmare it will effect on you if you are easily traumatized by graphic horror. The movie itself is a miss understanding that to enjoy a film like this, is to leave all realism outside. This movie is a fright fest if you really let it be, and it will never let you go once you accepted it! 10/10",Event Horizon

A Very Dark and depressing atmosphere I remember seeing this when i was young and it was scary as back then and still fairly scary today. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill a really good in this film There are a lot of scary moments and creepy imagery. good cinematography the music i very good for an old horror movie the special effects are awesome lots of gore.If your a Horror/Science fiction fan its a must see classic make sure to watch it at night alone hahaha 8 / 10 enjoy :D",Event Horizon

298,alexis_240,"Very good, but could have been great",9,3 December 2006,"If there is one thing a horror film should be that's disturbing. That's why Hellraiser was so successful 1) because it portrayed hell as something very close to humans and 2) because it used pain as something that many people could get pleasure from. Hence ""Angels to some, demons to others"". Event horizon does have it's share of disturbance but could have been a lot more.Firstly it would not have hurt if the studio had spent some more money on the film, so that the introduction sequence where the crew saves some miners from a fire could have been shot. Paul Anderson said that he incorporated some material from that sequence into the film, and it is true e.g. Miller saving his friend when he opens the pressure door and gets released into space without a suit, but an additional introduction sequence would have been better.Indeed many scenes were cut from the film in order to tighten the pace but don't you think they went too far? I read about the plot before having watched the actual film, and I logically expected to see a sequence where the event horizon disappears and then get something like ""Seven years later"". However we are just told what happened, and you immediately get the idea that this picture was made for a moderate budget. Also a scene was filmed where Dr Weirr (Sam Neil), gets briefed about the Event Horizon's reappearance and convinces the man in charge to let him go with the rescue team. Now why was that cut out? It's probably part of the big studios wisdom, or stupidity if you ask me, which is ""Do not make the film too long"". This particular sequence, I believe, is of primary importance and gives us a longer introduction. The release version, I am sorry to say, kinda drops us into a story it wants to get on with and finish ASAP. I was surprised when I first saw it, no way I expected it to be that fast.Unfortunately there's more like the above. Extended visions of hell and an orgy between the Event Horizon's original crew were also eliminated. Why? Because they seemed to be too freaky. Maybe the studio was not actually aware that this is a)a horror film and b)about hell. What did they expect to see in it? Kids with dolls?. Hellraiser is very bloody, why didn't it get chopped up?It's not that I don't like the film, god I've given it 9/10, but it's so painful seeing something that could have been a lot more, get turned into a just good horror movie when it could have gotten a Hellraiser like status.9/10 for it's good story, the black hole idea,the good performances and it's perception of hell.Finally, Mr Anderson I hope that it won't take you much longer to release the director's cut you promised us.",Event Horizon
299,atrevino90,One of the better horror films I have seen in my life,8,31 August 2020,"To be honest, the Horror Genre is a hard one to pull off, sometimes is too boring, sometimes too cliche, sometimes too gory, sometimes too terrifying, its pretty hard to nail a good horror film that will be loved by most.That being said this film is definitely not perfect if you want to deeply analyze its logic and every little detail, the plot is fairly simple, the acting generally good, but what really makes this movie is the atmospheric horror. If you are willing to see beyond its few flaws and really dive into the atmosphere of the movie, there is plenty to love for horror genre fans.I wanted to see this movie after I heard it inspired Silent Hill one of the better horror video game franchises of all time, don't know if its true or not but it definitely feels like it.Being a 1997 the effects won't be as good as today's standards of course but they are quite impressive nevertheless, I believe its production design is on par with Alien with the exception of some VFX scenes.I would ignore any reviews below 6 and above 9, if you like horror, silent hill and alien more specifically, you will definitely like this, just don't fixate on the flaws like the people giving bad reviews, if you are looking for flaws you will find them on any movie and it just ruins the experience, sometimes being too smart is indeed boring, but I rather dumb myself down and meet expectations or be surprised than pointing to every flaw pretending I am some movie reviewer god that nothing gets over my head, its just not fun",Event Horizon
300,olliemankz,Falling outside of the cracks,5,14 March 2014,"Event Horizon put me in mind of two other movies, Alien, of course, and Forbidden Planet. You have a crew made up of people who are clearly British as well as American so things are pretty international by the year 2047. Either that, or the redoubtable Jason Isaacs and the adorable Sean Pertwee are incapable of doing American accents; somehow I think it's the former. They all board a ship that has been missing for seven years and so naturally we're wondering what kind of Alien-like surprise they're going to get.The movie was wonderful and on the brink of terrifying up to the halfway mark. I was asking myself why I had barely ever heard of it until the second half when we get into the Forbidden Planet version of things. I'm not sure if I can say this is completely Forbidden Planet as what lurks within may come not just from man's own delusions but whence those spring. But somehow this movie does not deliver on that side. I was enjoying some reviews on the platform on which I saw the movie, Netflix, and there as well as in places here people discussed how terrified they were by the movie's dark implications particularly when young; one person said Event Horizon ""destroyed my childhood."" Possibly then its ultimate theme speaks best to the beautifully naive among us where the truth touches a core.I will say, Forbidden Planet destroyed my childhood, or at least my walks to school. Trying not to give anything away, but somehow the symbol of evil in that one transmogrified to huge dinosaurs dogging my every step; I kept turning around expecting a tyrannosaurus rex rearing up on the horizon. I was also terrified of brontosauri but was told they were only herbivores, although I suppose being stepped on by one would not be fun either. Anyway, I think Forbidden Planet was a far more effective film than Event Horizon -- and to those who love Forbidden Planet, please forgive me if I am way off in comparing the two -- and that is why so few of us know about Event Horizon. As many have said here it could essentially be classified as a horror film, with comparisons, say, to even The Shining and others. I know there is a film I have seen recently which garnered the same reception of, ""It's really scary when you think of the deeper implications."" I think that may have been the David Caruso cult classic Session 9; oh, another one you hadn't heard of before either? It's worth checking out. I would half, er, have to leave my recommendation on Event Horizon at the halfway mark. It's worth a check out if only for its place in sci-fi or quasi history. Grab your partner and your popcorn because you're in for a ride. But you'll probably have no trouble sleeping.By the way ... Jason Isaacs is adorable, too. But it wasn't until I caught him in Sweetwater on Netflix that I began to look for he-of-the-impossibly-clear-eyes elsewhere and thus came to Event Horizon. Now there's someone about whom I have to ask ... why I had I never heard of him before?",Event Horizon

The sets, the cinematography, the story, the acting, and especially, the art style. I know this movie has so many ties and influences by other movies, such as Hellraiser, The Shining, The Amittyville Horror and more, but they have been combined and utilised perfectly.Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are cast so well, and the way Sam's character progresses is so haunting. I love the way Laurence never cracks a smile in the whole movie, and is always the voice of wrath. It makes it that much better that he deals with the voice of chaos, that is Sam Neill. The scene between them, when Weir is explaining to Miller about how Hell is just a word is possibly my favourite scene, and leaves it wide open to the possibility of these two becoming arch enemies in future movies. Because, lets face it, this movie needs a damn sequel.I'm really annoyed to hear that this movie was cut short in its release. From the sounds of it, the movie could've been even better than what we know it as, had Paul Anderson got his way with the final cut.

It is a well-cast, solid, and intriguing haunted-house (or should that be spacecraft?) tale with an engaging plot where, refreshingly, most of the true horror occurs in the minds of the characters, rather than in the blood-soaked machete' of some mute killing machine or some wise-cracking psychopath.  I was a little let-down by the fact that they had to turn Sam Neill's character into the more-or-less typical antagonist, but otherwise, a solid horror film that will leave you thinking!",Event Horizon
304,aro-2,"Truly terrifying, but still entertaining...",8,24 December 1998,"Event Horizon starts out with much promise: in 2040, a deep space research vessel, the Event Horizon, is sent out on its maiden voyage and was believed to be destroyed. However, in 2047, it returns and is found in a decaying orbit around Neptune. A search and rescue ship, the Lewis and Clark, is sent out to investigate the Event Horizon's mysterious return. On board the Lewis and Clark, as well as the rest of the crew, is Sam Neill, the scientist who designed the Event Horizon. He explains to the crew what the Event Horizon was designed to do: travel faster than light. When they finally board the Event Horizon, they find nothing but the body of one crew member, and what appears to be the partial remains of the other six. From there, the film goes slowly downhill.If Anderson's only goal with this film is to make the audience jump out of their seats, then it's a masterpiece. However, there is very little suspense. It's a film where you're not wondering who dies next, but, rather, how that particular person will die. There is only one scene in the film that creates true suspense. It involves one of the crew being trapped in an airlock. To make matters worse, you don't really care about any of these people whose lives are in danger. The simplest of backgrounds are given to a few of the characters: Neill's dead wife; Quinlan's son. One thing they left out, though: before Neill cuts Pertwee open you can see a rather large scar on his chest. I wonder if an explanation was originally scripted.Out of the two previously mentioned backgrounds comes the source for the film's most terrifying scenes: the scene in the green tunnel; Quinlan's son appearing in Medical. With the best scenes now described I can get on with the films main strength: terror. Very few films can give you such a feeling of dread. It's a very psychological film(not in plot, but in atmosphere) that's bound to disturb even the most desensitized of Horror fans. The images you see are only a part of it; the lesser part. The psychological aspect is much too intense for words. It must be experienced. Event Horizon doesn't just contain those feelings of dread and terror, it leaves them with you long after the credits have finished rolling.The special effects are incredible. The model ships are so good that it's almost a shame to see them destroyed. The destruction of the Lewis and Clark is one of the most realistic and believable scenes in the film. The interior of the Event Horizon is also great. It's the most important contributor to the atmosphere. Actually, it's the only contributor. It allows Anderson to use all his tricks to make the audience jump in the setting they would work the best. This way he doesn't have to do quite as much work. That said, he's given his film a remarkable visual style.After all of its faults I must say that I found it to be very entertaining. I would strongly recommend seeing this while it is still in the theaters, but beware: it doesn't leave much to the imagination. You get to see bits and pieces of what happened to the crew of the Event Horizon, in very brief, but graphic, images. Also, you get to see what happens to the crew of the Lewis and Clark in not so brief, but just as graphic, images.",Event Horizon

I was drawn into the atmosphere right from the beginning and immediately bonded with the characters. The increase of tension as the crew approaches and then enters the ship is very well paced. The way how hints that something very strange is going on become more frequent and less subtle kept me on the edge of the couch.As the nightmare unfolds there are some truly scary scenes to be savoured. There is a very personal component to this nightmare for every character, which adds depth and originality to many of the jump / gore scenes. This also creates interesting situations when the characters try to communicate their experiences to each other. It's all in your head, right?The whole thing becomes a little inane and over the top towards the end, but if you like this genre just the slightest bit you probably won't mind too much.There is a load of great special effects in this film (I especially liked the zero-g stuff), gorgeous set pieces and all kinds of neat little high-tech props.

I'm here to tell you they're wrong.The cast. All excellent. Fishbourne, isaacs, pertwee in particular are superb. Some really well timed humour hereixed with a sense of desperation. 'This ship is fucked' and 'We're leaving' - all the cast deliver with no weak links.The visual effects were slick as hell in 1997 and still hold up now for me. Some of the zero gravity and spaceship shots are still absolutely stunning.The set design. Oh my god, the set design. Just utterly fantastic. Witness the techno gothic bridge, or the swirling, cheese grater corridor to the gravity drive. The gravity drive itself, just a crazy spiky twirling room of doom. I'm struggling to think of many films that surpass event horizon in this area. It's creative yet still feels realistic.The cinematography - from the vertigo inducing pull back space shot to the creepily lit ship, the 'green corridor' scene, this film just looks GORGEOUS. Every single shot you could pause, make a poster out of it and put it on your wall. Not many films get that accolade from me.The sound design - wether it's the pounding score to the explosions or the jump scares. The sound on this is top notch.The gore and violence. Well, this film is still seriously messed up. There's some imagery in this that has seared itself into my memory. It's uncompromising in it's severity, and I love it for that. I would give one of my testicles to see the extended directors cut that we'll never get to see.And would the likes of the 'dead space' games have been the way they were without this film? I'd say absolutely not. The atmosphere in this film is just excellent. You've got Latin, hell, the works here, combined with the creepy feel of the the first two alien films and it's so, so good.Even though this film has influenced popular culture it was also influenced by the 'alien' films itself, but I'd say it's better than all those bar the first two, and secretly, I think this is as good as the first alien film. It's gone from box office bomb almost to the definition of one of the biggest 'cult classics' of the last 25 years - at least in the sci fi and horror category.That's how highly I rank this film.

It also doesn't make sense as to why Weir (Sam Neill) doesn't mention the delusions he has on the ship (acting as if nothing is happening) doesn't share what is happening to him. Is he in denial?

Only through comparisson can you trully appreciate the score you give a movie . The fact that Event Horizon has scored the same as the movie ""Pandorum"" is an insult and anyone who has seen both will agree .Event horizon takes scifi horror to a completely new level and is up there together with the same mystery horror and frantic beauty of the likes of Aliens.With a solid backstory and real science intertwined with the creation of the spaceships as well as the various mechanics of their ""jump drives"" work , Event horizon is nothing short of a scifi horror masterpiece that does not deserve the score it has been given on imdb .

The visuals are nice, and the film does have a couple of genuinely creepy and frightening moments, which is more than can be said for quite a few so-called horror films.  However, the movie is badly compromised by characters that move about as mindless slaves to the plot, as well as by some excruciatingly bad science.  Now, this is a science fiction movie, and as a longtime fan of science fiction, I am willing to concede such unlikelihoods as their faster -than-light drive and artificial gravity; however, the gross and unnecessary violations of well-understood physics (such as the fact that the ships seem to be both indside Neptune's atmosphere and motionless with respect to it and orbiting the planet at the same time; ask yourself why you don't see satellites ""orbiting"" in the atmosphere of Earth) and the ridiculously artificial technical complications completely destroy my willing suspension of disbelief.  For years, I have been waiting to see a space-opera-type science fiction movie come out of Hollywood that shows even close to the level of sceintific and technical knowledge shown by the great majority of successful hard science fiction writers.

When I was a child I have seen one scene where this man's skin is scorched, but this demonic being is also immortal. The conclusion really grabbed my attention to watch the whole movie. Spoiler: So we begin a missing spacecraft, which was zapped faster than light-speed and it cut through another dimension that was unfortunately ""Hell."" When the ship was discovered seven years after, this crew flies to this missing-mysterious spaceship and venture around. Throughout their quest in the vessel, each individual of the crew kept having these hallucinations about their despondent past. Later on, a scientist named Dr. Weir who has constructed this hellish spacecraft have finally told the crew the secret that this ship was brought back from Hell. This is where the good part starts. After when most of the crew died, the captain and two other survivors tries to destroy one part of the ship so the other part can freely return to Earth. The cool thing is after the captain solely places the last detonator on the ship, a strong heat was closely beside him and this fiery being who is actually Dr. Weir appears; this is what I have explained above. Spoilers:Positives: The grasping-terrifying ship, great frightening decorations like the spikes at every door, the music, the flashbacks, the gore wasn't overdone, and the actors played very well.Negatives: When the crew discovered a camera that recorded what happened during the mysterious disappearance, the video showed the earlier crew being tortured but it seemed too short: although the deleted scenes show 30 minutes of this, which I haven't seen. They could have shown more on the captain's past, and they could show what the youngest member saw when he was forced inside this dark dimension. Please, give it a chance. The movie is very great despite that this didn't have great results. In my opinion, you will enjoy every moment of it.",Event Horizon

We walked out of the theatre and to his car, and we drove 20 minutes before speaking.    Since the first viewing, I have watched Event Horizon several times with friends, and I still get chills watching specific scenes.  The movie was gory, but not overly so.  I think that it added to the shock effect of the movie.  They could have done a better job with the ending, but it was definitely passable.

A couple of reasons will show this, 1, you got a good/strong cast. 2, It's well written and acted. 3, it works and will scare you or make you feel uneasy. I like this movie quite a bit. I'm not one to be scared by movies easily but this one makes it hard for me to sleep at night. Its not so much the movie itself but when your hear that transmission that Dr Wier plays back you know there's trouble ahead and when you see what happens to the crew on that ships log it makes you feel extremely uneasy. The ship plays the perfect villain here and the whole feeling of the movie is uneasy. Nothing looks pretty in this movie. And that look sells it. I would recommend it because all in all it is a good movie. Sam Neill puts on a great performance along with Lawrence Fishburne. The supporting cast is great as well with familiar faces all around.

337,muvcritic,Alien meets The Shining Near the Event Horizon,6,25 October 2010,"""Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse."" -- Dr. Weir (Sam Neill)Evidently, there's not a lot left that you can do in science fiction and horror, so if you're going to steal, why not steal from the best?Event Horizon, from director Paul Anderson (the Resident Evil franchise), opens with a blue collar crew (like the guys in Alien) on their way to rendezvous with a missing spaceship lost under mysterious circumstances (like in 2010). Along for the ride with Captain Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix) and officers Joely Richardson (Nell) and Kathleen Quinlan (Apollo XIII) is Sam Neil (Jurassic Park) as the mysterious Professor Weir, designer of the titular Event Horizon, the first vessel to attempt faster-than-light travel, and who evidently forgot the ""D"" at the end of his name. Weir's revolutionary gravity drive is the same type of spinning, concentric hoola hoops that propelled Jody Foster in Contact, reinterpreted in massive black steel, in keeping with director Anderson's techno-medieval design scheme.The plot line is timely, as NASA just announced a research directive to determine if there actually is any reasonable possibility of interstellar travel, which involves exotic technologies to shear the fabric of the space-time continuum. Unlike the folks in Star Trek who blithely engage their warp drive at the drop of a helmet, the unfortunate crew of the Event Horizon has discovered that removing one's self from the comfortable environment of matter, energy, time and space leads to a chaotic dimension which may or may not be Hell. Consequently, the rescue team enters a ghost ship connected to that Otherwhere by its warp engine, which now pulses and throbs like a living thing. But, when Professor Weir is possessed (like Jack Nicholson in The Shining), he becomes obsessed with dragging Captain Fishburne and the others back down the maw of the infernal singularity, while I wondered, ""Didn't I see this same plot in Disney's space bomb, The Black Hole?""Even though its production design borrows liberally and probably unavoidably from Alien and its sequels, Event Horizon is more like The Shining because there aren't any monsters jumping through the airlock. Its terror is more psychological as the malevolent ship, a place imbued with evil, much like the Overlook Hotel, tries to trick its hapless victims into joining it for a return cruise to Hell by playing on their innermost fears and guilts.The cast gives it their all, but never achieves quite the audience identification factor that Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto and their co-stars did in Alien. The film attempts to be scientifically plausible, although it pretends, like all science fiction except 2001, that spaceships have gravity. Like that concession to physical logic, the film is also obliged to send its characters off by themselves so they can be picked off one by one. And just when you think you've pegged it as Alien meets The Shining meets The Black Hole, suddenly a character turns up in make-up inspired by Pinhead in the Hellraiser series, spouting the same sadomasochistic bull about how, when you're separated from matter and energy, pain and terror become the most intense sensations, creepy sentiments also expressed in director Stuart Gordon's From Beyond.But even though it's derivative of just about everything, Event Horizon is still entertainingly scary, although the most frightening aspect may be the sound track's ability to spike from near silence to overdrive, like Captain Fishburne just gave the order for ""Maximum decibels!"" Hey, you have to love a horror movie that can use as its title track a high-energy dance song called ""Funky S--t!""",Event Horizon

344,jez-47,A cracking horror film!,7,29 September 2010,"I saw ""Event Horizon"" when it first came out in '97 and found it immensely disturbing! Repeat viewings have lessened the impact, but it's still Paul Anderson's finest film to date. The set design - all Gothic chambers and torturous spikes - is a work of art and the visual effects are excellent. Liquid suspended in zero gravity, a walking man on fire and the ship itself are all extremely well done.This is indeed an underrated horror movie and bears much more of a likeness to ""The Shining"" than it does to ""Alien"". However, it most closely mirrors Michael Crichton's novel ""Sphere"" (1987), which was made into a woefully inadequate film with Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone and Samuel L Jackson. The idea of a spaceship discovered which affects the salvage team's psyche is the central premise - ""Sphere"" even has a reference to the term ""event horizon"".This movie slightly falls over in two main areas. Firstly, the characters are not well enough explored (not even Weir, with memories of his deceased wife), although the crew banter riffs naturally on the crew dynamics in ""Alien"".Secondly - and most importantly - the film loses its knife edge tension in the last third, due to an accelerated narrative and a descent into hell. Weir (Sam Neill) in particular becomes a clichéd figure and it's down to Laurence Fishburne (excellent) to maintain the credibility.That said, the scares are well staged and Anderson uses split-second (almost subliminal) shots of body horror and torture, along with clever use of sound and music, to ratchet up the fear factor.

First they steal the guts out of a number of films, notably Alien, and pepper with a pretty silly supernatural plot. Oh sorry, I used the plot word - it doesn't really have one at all.  The most fun thing in this movie is the pessimistic doomsaying Sean Pertwee, whose attitude towards his blatantly obvious impending death probably reflects his personal attitude to the picture. At least I hope it does, he's far too good an actor to be stuck in this pile of poo.  The only other piece of remote interest in this film is in the choice of flag badges on the shoulders of the characters uniforms. Is this some form of subliminal political statement from the producers? English characters have a European Union flag, so obviously this is a bold future prediction.  Sam Neill's character has a more striking political statement on his sleeve.

Consider them *savers*, as in saving you from sitting through this bloody mess. If ""Event Horizon"" had production values that matched the quality of its script, then it would look a lot cheaper. The film does indeed look good, copying that gritty, creepy ""Alien"" look and feel admirably. That's what sucks you in to the story -- that, along with the hope that the story will deliver. Instead what the viewer gets are increasingly preposterous and inconsistent plot points, until the final reveal makes you want to throw a shoe at your TV. ""Hell?!

Rip-offs are sometimes fun, and so are bad films that have something to offer -- in this case, top-tier (for the times) production values.

This film plays to all out primal fears of space and psychological demons as well as real ones and had gets in your head as much as makes you jump.

What I received was actually one of the best performances a villain can give. Sure, he was the scientist in the beginning, but ultimately went mad due to so many things around him. I could imagine no other person, to this day, that could fill Neill's shoes as Dr. Weir.    I'll start with the movie itself. Terrifying, if you really try thinking about it. Not just sitting down to fall asleep to something, although I can't imagine why you'd choose this one. I love the way the story starts out, where you're in an already scary environment, space. Like no other horror, space is finally being used to great extents. Thus being the setting for what would become truly horrific. You start with a basic rescue operation, move to the site, and get trapped with these poor people. The thing that intrigued me the most was that these killings were based on a fear.    Peters' fear of her sick child, Justin being afraid of being alone, Weir with his deceased wife, and Miller with his dead burning friend that he left behind. All of these heroes were pre-scarred, much like in real life, we carry around all this emotional, and sometimes physically draining, baggage. Event Horizon reflects that.   It just so happens they are also on a ship that tore a hole in our universe', and led itself to Hell. I loved that concept, one of the unknown. We fathom the unknown as humans. A black hole especially. One must come to ask themselves what is out there, and what if we were to tamper with it.   Next, I must say the acting is brilliant. Sam Neill stepping up to a different type of role, and slamming it out of the park. I was truly creeped out to see him tear his own eyes from his skull, then blow up the only chance of escape with pilot still inside, and finally to play surgeon on the ship's medic. Ironies, you'll note. It was Smith's, the pilot's, fear of getting out of there that caused him to blow up with the vessel. It was a medic's job that got himself killed. This was also the first time I had ever heard of Lawrence Fishburne. Great stuff, though. He accurately portrayed a broken man trying to help his entire crew out, even if it meant giving his own life just to save one of them.    A final note on the direction. It took Paul Anderson a lot of courage to take on a project like this. Did you know that it was a book? A great book as well. His adaptations to almost impossible imagery were astounding. Let alone his instincts on casting. All in all, you can't get any better than Event Horizon. So, before you start criticizing its gore ethic, think about the story itself, Hell is involved. Make sure you've researched a film of this genre enough before complaining about certain inequities. Science fiction must be studied, not viewed upon a single time, then cast away.10 out of 10",Event Horizon

Needless to say, that claim was false.  And now we are treated to the Quantum Physics version of the same thing in this piece of junk.But the film's message of identifying positively with medieval notions of ignorance, fear and evil wasn't the only bad part.  There were incredibly derivative plot elements.  There was a ridiculous overuse of cheesy horror film tactics.  There were illogical action elements that seemed to be thrown in to keep the audience from falling asleep, such as the entry into Neptune's atmosphere, that just seemed to become a non-factor when the director got tired of worrying about them.  And there was horrendous dialogue that ignored all of the wonderment around these people trapsing through the solar system and looking directly at these distant planets. Finally, the film just disintegrated into gross-out tactics, throwing bloody people meat into your face.I think the tagline is ""Infinite space...Infinite horror.""  The only things infinitely horrifying are this movie's stupidity and its incredible waste of money on special effects.",Event Horizon

It's a wonderful, horrifying world that Event Horizon presents, filled with so many 'guns on the wall' in the way of pointy, crushy, blender like items in the ship, you know they aren't ALL going to be used.It's a shame this so called 'psycological horror' turned out to be a plain, boring gore fest. Sure, it builds up, but then it shows pointless images of messy, mucky people, which really ruin the feeling of aprehention the movie tries to build. You KNOW what they're going to show you, after a while. It becomes predictable.

360,simon647,"It's scientifically inappropriate, which is why it's fiction and also horror.",6,25 November 2008,"The reason why it's horror is because it has gore. The reason why it has science-fiction is because using a black hole as dimensional travel is about as delusional as say... Catapulting yourself down the Canyon and expecting the rocks to soften as you fall on them.Event Horizon refers to the moment where you cross a black hole's edges. Where there is no chance of return whatsoever. So this movie seems to pretend that beyond the Event Horizon, there is another dimension. This is unproven but unlikely. Fiction comes in play at this point, whereas a scientist would have been able to build a mechanism which allows a ship to travel from one point in the other. In this place, the ""Event Horizon"" spaceship.The spaceship is then used for extra-system travel, where it will discover regions beyond the milky way. Bold enterprise, as the ship and its crew discover only to be found years later. The scientist is sent aboard a rescue ship, whose crew consists of growling men and wise women. Well, the choice of crew is rather justified, because they are all astronauts that were looking to enjoy their little vacation back on earth. So they don't take kindly to the good ""Doctor""'s presence.You'll imagine the Doctor's feeling rather ambitious about seeing his spaceship again. Of course, getting there, the doctor starts to get hallucinations of his dead wife, provided by the ship itself. What doesn't make much sense is that he gets these hallucinations BEFORE getting on the ship, while the other members of the crew don't get any until they arrive on-board.Don't worry though, the movie offers a lot more plot holes like these. Does that make it a bad movie? No, the story's believable as long as you hold it to yourself to escape reality for a while. So what makes the movie not so enjoyable here? The acting. I'm not sure if all the actors forgot their faces at work, especially Mr.Fishburne, but they all seemed rather dead-eyed for the most part. Laurence Fishburne often yells without bearing any conviction to his words on his face or overall body. Same with some other characters, while a select few do show appropriate emotions. Unfortunately, we're treated to the stereo-typical black man-in-astronaut gangsta.I mean is it really necessary for black people to always be imaged as the dumb types? Whatever, seeing as Sam Neil and Fishburne are often on-screen, you'd expect better prestations from them. None of it.I personally disagree that this is a bad movie but it's certainly nothing to be awed at. The executions for the characters are all very poetic in a way, but they're so theatrical that it makes them less terrifying, in my opinion.Kind of like watching a play and seeing the main protagonist be given a speech before being executed.Do watch this movie, even for the sake of just having watched it once.",Event Horizon
361,su-49,I wonder why they say that it is Sci-Fi?,6,16 November 2010,"What were good:1. The premise (or intrigue) was promising (alas, when «hell» was started all the sci-fi plot was spoiled).2. The entourage was moderately fine (except the Gothic EH-ship — it's ridiculous).3. Sometimes there is a mood.What were fishy:1. The crew behave themselves like a street gang (is it normal behavior on American special elite naval ships even today?).2. There was one guy flying in open space without spacesuit and still was alive (I am not kidding!).3. To appeal to «hell», «god» and other religious nonsense in the Sci-Fi movie is a fail (it means that writer has been totally bankrupt and spoils the plot and give us some (evil in the case) «Deus ex machina»). If such things occur in the Sci-Fi, they should be scientifically explained (like in the Solaris, f.E.).4. Almost every crew member in the crisis situation behaves him|her-self like a dumb. Think for a moment: You are in the space somewhere far, far away from the Earth, somewhere near to the Pluto. OK? And on the weird wrecked ship you suddenly see your boy or friend from the Earth, which beckon You to a dark corridor. Yeah, it's creepy. And what You would to do? Do You believe that it's really Your boy or friend? Well, members of our crew thought so. :)5. One guy was thrown away to the orbit by really huge explosion and come back with (sic!) opening one of air valve on his spacesuit. %)6. There was a broken (from inside) windows on the spaceship (can you imagine it?)7.

Event Horizon suggests it isn't any good at all. In fairness, I have friends who consider this to be the scariest film they have ever seen, but then they did see it in their early teens.The film borrows liberally from 2001 and 2010, The Haunting, The Shining, The Amityville Horror, The Lawnmower Man and probably about a hundred other films that begin with ""the"", but most notably it seems to be in debt at all times to the Alien series. The unoriginality wouldn't matter were this an effective or entertaining film, but the script is banal and muddled and the direction is uninspired; Anderson draws on horror clichés like constant lightning flashes... in space! Anderson's films generally have a glossy yet dull look and feel, and this one is no exception; a considerable amount of work obviously went into the production design of this film, yet in the film the sets rarely look as impressive as they could and should do.In short the film is a dull, borderline incomprehensible mess. It does showcase a good lead performance from Sam Neill, and an amusing supporting one from Richard T. Jones, but neither really makes the film worth seeing. Check out Levithan instead if you want an enjoyable B-movie variation on the Alien theme.",Event Horizon
363,gunstar_hero,Confused and Horribly Clichéd,3,25 December 2008,"Event Horizon is a movie that can be neatly divided into two halves. In the first, the screenplay is to all intents and purposes a scene-by-scene facsimile of Alien, 20 years later, with no discernible improvement. The sets and special effects, if anything, look worse.In the second half, the script dispenses entirely with the mildly absorbing haunted-house-in-space conceit and delves into the murkily opportunistic realms of psychological horror, a get-out-clause by which director and writer alike are able to incorporate any arbitrary plot twist and remain unaccountable to the audience's incredulity.This movie's claim to any kind of critical respectability within the field of science fiction is frankly laughable.

Clearly not in the class of Alien but it does manage to create suspense as well as deliver some genuinely shocking moments. The premise of a haunted spaceship from hell is not exactly original but it takes this very simple set-up and effectively explores the realms of horror and sci-fi. The gore is plentiful, but not too much, and the jump out of your seat moments hit home too.

367,bigfanofthebob42,"If Satan was making me speak Latin, I'd rip out my eyes, too.",7,21 June 2006,"Event Horizon has the two distinctions of being the only Paul WS Anderson movie that does not feel like it was shat out by a monkey with ADD and smeared onto celluloid, and off being one of the few movies that have genuinely traumatized me. Today, Event Horizon doesn't really freak me out anymore, but it's still an underrated freakout for anyone who hasn't seen it that can accept the weak script and lackluster third act.So basically it's about this spaceship that gets possessed by evil and terrorizes people by making them go crazy or showing them flashes of their friends screaming and being mutilated in some freaky dimension of chaos or something. The flash parts are really freaky, and along with the scene where the ship's log suddenly starts playing by itself without static over what happened after evil took over--it looks like the kind of porn the dark lord Sauron watches, but with tighter editing. By just flashing crazy gory stuff at you, it makes you think you've seen things that are worse than what you have, since most of it consists of people screaming and bloody or nude corpses impaled through the face hanging around covered in maggots. (on second thought, that is freaky) But it tricks you into thinking you're seeing people being graphically dissected and people eating themselves and gay people getting married.A lot of people upon release found it to be really derivative of Alien, among other things, but I don't think it's derivative, because it feels like it's taking place somewhere else in the same universe, which is also how it gets away with having everyone smoke 50 years into the future.The script is lame. ""I'm now walking. I'm now entering the medical bay. I'm now picking my nose."" a lot of the dialogue can be like that. Or there's the other, non-Morpheus black guy, who seems to be attempting to be the best Funny, But Clumsy Negro stereotype in the history of the cinema, and unfortunately he fails because it takes you out of the movie whenever he appears. They might as well have had Paul WS Anderson play the part in blackface. Also, there's a lot of talk about ""hell"" and ""a dimension of pure chaos"", and it all sounds a little silly no matter how freakishly disturbing the visions of it are.The last half hour houses the biggest shocks, for me, but the movie sort of falls apart into a series of action sequences before the big explosion. You know, the kind that happens in any sci-fi horror movie. It's also unfortunate that they turned the Jurassic Park 1 and 3 guy into the outright villain--it's less scary when you can see the bad guy, particularly if he looks like a more lame, naked version of Pinhead from the Hellraiser movies, but with no pins, so he's really just Head, and that's not a cool name for anybody. The whole last half hour reeks of studio impatience and interference. There was originally another half hour that was cut out, and probably contained a lot of stuff that should have been in the movie, but the studio was a jerk and made them cut a lot of the gore, or the ""character"" and ""story development"", you know, things that aren't necessary to Hollywood studios. It's a shame, because with that footage, Event Horizon might have been an actually good movie, and a jewel amidst the chunks of corn in the turd of Paul WS Anderson's filmography.If Anderson made it today, it would be scored entirely with Marilyn Manson, the action scenes would be hyper-edited and incomprehensible, the characters wouldn't even have personalities, and it would end with Morpheus making friends with the evil force so that together they can battle the alien zombies that Anderson felt were necessary to add to make the movie cooler.

TV edits like that have too much poetic licence and too much of the fuller scenes are lost. You have to watch it in full panoramic to enjoy films like this. Now, with the much bigger HD widescreen TVs that people have, I'd encourage the doubters to watch this film again as it should be watched, in all its glory. Some films don't transfer well to the old square TVs as edits, but the TVs we have now do them justice. A lot of older films are worth watching again in Blu-ray on these new TVs. 2001: A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind are some other good examples, but Event Horizon also fares well with modern tech. Watch it as it should be watched, all of it, with none of the wider footage edited out because of screen size. The cinematography is excellent and the film itself stands up well, even today, after 20 years. Not many films can do that without seeming dated.

I wouldn't classify it as sci-fi even though it does pay homage (or some would say rip-off) to many of the greats, such as Alien and The Black Hole. This is a pure horror film and also has a b-movie charm. This is the kind of movie William Castle would be directing if he was still alive today, but much better! It is the best haunted house movie of the lot, but its set in a spaceship.OK, the movie doesn't have the most complicated plot or character development, it works because of the atmosphere and Paul Anderson has pulled off a one-trick pony here.

James Cameron and Ridley Scott reached this level of brilliance in the Alien films and David Fincher with Seven.I've seen this movie over 20 times.

Whether I personally could have handled more of this is another matter.The movie has a deliciously dark and claustrophobic feel to it... I found myself looking for an escape while watching it.  Afterwards, my house felt too small and dark to be comfortable.  That tells me the set design if nothing else was effective.The acting was fair, being pretty standard and having its stellar moments (especially from Mr. Neill).  There were some lines I thought the movie could do without and some bits that could have been written better. Overall, however, I didn't feel it was a sufficient enough detraction to remove from the overall effect of the movie.The plot was straightforward and at times, predictable.  I guess unlike other reviewers I don't sit at a movie seeing if I can guess what's next... I expect to be taken on a ride, not to drive.  Only when a movie is so boring that I have nothing else to focus on do I worry about what's next. This one moved along briskly, and lulled at suitable moments to allow viewers to catch their breath.  It interjected enough backstory to keep the suspension of disbelief up while maintaining the proper pacing for a movie in this vein.Special effects were moderate.  They were good enough not to date the movie but nothing spectacular.  The set designs outpaced them handily.  Combined with good cinematography, the physical feel of the movie actually had more weight and impact than the rest of its elements.Overall, I was frightened by this movie.  Watching it alone at 1 AM I almost had to leave the house after I saw it.  There were moments that in all honesty kinda stank, but the overall effect was unhindered by them.  The level of gore was high, but it was properly used, I think.  The subject matter this movie dealt with combined the elements of gore and violence and other taboo subjects in the proper way to shock, but didn't load them up to the point of rediculousness.  However, I do warn that you do prepare to be shocked.  This movie, when it opens up, pulls no punches.  It is a scary, creepy movie that if it had been done to some high ideal of ""perfection"" in what it tried to do might be nigh unwatchable.  I highly recommend it for a good scare.  Watch with friends. :-)",Event Horizon
382,Muzman,Fun if you don't expect too much,7,2 July 2000,"(minor spoilers in here) This movie has made a lot of people mad.  Mostly people who want a lot more than shock tactics and old-ideas-reworked from a film.  I was lucky really, I saw an interview with someone involved in making it (the writer I think). He was pretty lighthearted in describing how he wanted to do a haunted house movie in space.  Lo and behold; EVENT HORIZON is a haunted house movie set in space.  I laughed out loud when the ship is found parked in the upper ionosphere, perfectly placed to have constant lighting and thunder outside. For the most part it is a stylish, well paced fright fest.  The acting and the dialogue is actually really good.  Despite the fairly limited character development, the performances managed to convince me that the rescue crew had been together for some time.  Great cast too; Sam Neill is still in his IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS mode and appears to be having a ball.  The film also contains some of the most unpleasantly realistic scenes around (slow decompression anyone?) It's no world beater by any means, or in any genre, and it all gets a bit silly just prior to the climax.  But it's classy, darkly comical and shocks with aplomb.  The design is gorgeous (if you like high-tech design that ranges from art deco to neo-gothic) and for me the soundtrack is a milestone of both electronic and orchestral movie scores. (Orbital, Michael Kamen and the London Metropolitan Orchestra do horror! Very cool.) Loads of fun.",Event Horizon

Anderson's ""Breakout"" Masterpiece",10,15 August 2010,"This review is not a summary of the plot, or a critique of the Filmography, cast, acting, etc. This review points to the merits, uniqueness of the film, interesting background info, and my impressions. Paul W. S. Anderson was offered to direct X-MEN, but he declined that offer in order to do ""Event Horizon""- lucky for us! For me,the film was a groundbreaking confluence of space science, physics, science fiction, horror, and spirituality/religion- ""good versus evil"".The film was originally 130 minutes in length, but the studio forced Anderson to cut it down to 96 minutes- something Anderson regrets to this day. The studio and Test audience runs of the 130 minute version proved too unnerving and disturbing as this version was much more graphic than the released version.The film has developed somewhat of a cult status amongst its fans. Meanwhile, Anderson had promised to release a ""Director's Cut"" to include the 34 minutes worth of footage the studios forced him to cut; however, that footage was lost and only remains in lower quality video tape. Hence, no Director's Cut will ever be likely.Despite the lost footage and Anderson having his Post-Production time cut from 6 to 4 weeks, the released version is very, very good. The movie is TRULY CREEPY; especially because of the story: It is seemingly quite plausible and,thus all the more frightening. I first experienced this film on DVD up-scaled at 1080i at home on my 46"" home theater system, alone, in the dark, and very late at night. This movie continuously and reliably sent chills up and down my spine- thanks Anderson! If a Director's Cut had ever been released I can only imagine how delightfully unnerving and disturbing it would have been!Just watched it on Blu-Ray...Awesome... Despite its 1997 release, on Blu-Ray the improved detail, color, and sound improvements make it look so good that it seems it could have been made recently! I had watched it last 2 years ago, yet watching it again still left me creeped out & disturbed for a good while! Event Horizon remains an excruciatingly unnerving, despairing, and frightening Masterpiece- LOVE IT!",Event Horizon
385,nicrok,Underrated sci-fi-horror that lacks consistency,8,25 November 2009,"Event Horizon is an often disregarded, underrated sci-fi-horror flick that has its sweet and effective moments, yet lacks the depth to be a true masterpiece of the genre.A rescue mission is sent out into deep space towards Neptune to investigate a distress signal that seems to come from a supposedly lost derelict space craft - the Event Horizon. The experimental ship, which was able to create black holes in order to circumvent time and space, had not returned from its first journey through time and space. Upon entering the ship, however, the crew of the rescue mission quickly learn that the Event Horizon had better not returned...The first half of the movie is brilliant: we are enjoying very good effects (especially in space, and Neptune), nice acting (by Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne especially), an engaging setting, and an interesting plot. Added with the few effective scares, all signs are pointing to an instant classic. What I personally found quite compelling was the design of the Event Horizon - the gravity core and all the other obscure dwellings that score with their enigmatic nature.Yet as soon as things slip out of control on the Event Horizon, the movie turns into a B-movie style horror slasher with a lot of action and few scares. Many critics were especially concerned with this ambivalent second half of Event Horizon; personally, I found it hard to dislike it, because it was entertaining, given that the movie didn't itself too serious. However, I reckon they could've gone deeper into the whole hell-dimension issue, since I found that idea quite engaging.All things considered, I had a great time watching Event Horizon, and am happy to own the DVD of this rare sci-fi classic. It is, I reckon, the overall mood and tone of the film that will get you.",Event Horizon

To give it credit, it started out positively but apart from some sweet special effects it just diminished into so much half chewed fish.  It was a movie that was made for a ""B-Rate"" actor not the likes of Lawrence Fishburne. Even Morpheous himself looked un-at-ease with his corageous captain role. To be honest, the gore was just tooooooo graphic.  I can tolerate gore in fits and spurts so to speak but it was just too graphic.  For me, hanging someone horizontally on meat hooks and then slicing their inerds out while they're still alive is just too much.

387,inexile,Alice Mined My Eye Holes,9,24 October 2004,"***Spoilers***Hellaciously abstract. Horror offers many opportunities for such explorations.A film about what a film does to the audience's eye. A film about Alice, about eye-holes, especially wormy ones. Unfortunately the director doesn't have a camera to match (what if Baz or Brian had been possessed by Tark? ahh, sweet worm hole).A film about folding, the most important of which is folding space. And the space the film is trying to fold is the space between the film, (and hence also its creator's mind) and us.And with a couple of better actors and a better director this would have been an absolute masterpiece. As it is, I think it is still one of the most successful attempts at bending the space between audience and film.Alice is perhaps the richest, most multi-layered archetype to base a story on.But how many Alice stories are all about the hole like this one is? What an intelligent focus for a story! So we see the story conflated to outer space, and self-referentially is most concerned about space, folding space.And like most Alice stories, this is about a ""dream"" that contains 3 Alices.The red-headed dead wife who haunts from real life, the auburn-haired Mama bear who mirrors her death, and Goldilocks who survives with newly rouged tresses.The film begins with us/the camera entering a wormhole; then we follow the rabbit's dream until we come out the other side by exiting through Alice's dream (as she is released from the other side of the Looking Glass). Pefect framing by the writer.Being an Alice story, and focused on holes, one would think there would be some sex in the story. It's hard to find, but there is. In the background of the story's ""reality"", and rightfully at the greatest abstract distance from the main story, sex is placed within the dreams about the mad doctor's real wife (a dream within the dream, or a play within the play). Dreams about a wife who committed suicide over the death of the creation of that hole-entering sex---the hole-exiting child. The wife falls through the hole of death, mirrored by the death of Mama Bear in the ship.What a wonderful ship, what wonderful set design. The cross-section of the ship is designed in the shape of an eye, the gateway as its pupil, and the umbilical passage as the optic nerve that travels back to the bridge/brain.The eye is referenced everywhere, reflecting the eye of the writer, the eye of the director, the eye of the camera and the eye of the audience. The writer is able to conflate all these levels by using a worm(hole) that is eating its own tale. I.e., the film is about a story that happens in the mind's eye. On one side of the gateway this is happening in the creator's mind's eye and on the other side the audience's, folding us right into the film, and/or it's creator into us. These two worlds are separated by a couple of dams, the director & our own eyes, which the writer needs us to remove to merge our worlds.The only survivors are us, the creator---neither unscathed---and the black sheep child of this enterprise, the film, its folded self represented by an actor who has a lot to learn about folded acting, but at least achieves some folding by doing himself doing Denzel doing the character Cooper.Notes: The ghosts of many other horror films haunt this movie and the ship as it would also haunt the minds of its writer and its audience. Quotes by annotating not plagiarizing. For eg., Weir references Hell-raiser at the end as that is what he is in the literal mode of the story.The sets mirror the film's notions, especially the gateway room and the stasis room. The production designer was well aware of the script's layers.The score was well-suited and relatively minimalist.Muted symbols like the planet Neptune (echoes of Odysseus), the hints of dualism in the opening typed narrative (and those graphics inherent reference to the writer as the faithful narrator), the floating tools, etc... all used well.Some nice layering in the shots, and the framing is decent, but overall the direction was unimaginative and could have used a more mobile camera, one that finds its inner worm.But with such frightfully marvelous writing...Three out of three",Event Horizon

392,derwunderbaremandarin,Plagiarism and clichés,1,9 May 2010,"This is not a good movie. The plot simply is the frame of the first Alien movie (rescue-crew finds a ghost-ship that has been in hitherto unknown areas of space - crew of ghost-ship is found dead - rescue-crew gets trapped on ghost-ship - some evil force starts killing the rescue-team - the inevitable scientist who accompanies the rescue-team turns evil etc.). When Alien presented this story line, it was new, made sense, the movie had a great pace and was genuinely disturbing. The same storyline, about 18 years after the original was out, is a farce. Event Horizon simply does not even remotely create the dense atmosphere of horror that was created in Alien. The turning-evil of the scientist is very predictable. None of the characters (they all resemble the cool marines from Aliens by the way, including a couple of the typical ""weak"" women) is described well, and one hardly cares for them. And when you don't care for the characters, you are not afraid that something might happen to them. A great defect for a horror movie, because if you don't care, the movie is not scary. The movie is full of pathetic clichés. When the rescuers hear from the ghost-ship, they get an audio-message with the usual distorted screaming on it. They filter it, and voilà, one of the cool marines finds out that it actually is *Latin* and translates it immediately. Latin sounds spooky to some people, and that's probably why someone in deep space has nothing better to do then sending messages in Latin while he is being massacred. Incredible. The idea to give the ghost-ship an evil consciousness is ridiculous: the ship is a haunted house in space. If you expect a good horror-movie, avoid this one. YOu will be disappointed.",Event Horizon
393,WWingate,The latest 'Edsel' of sci-fi/horror shlock.,3,16 March 2003,"'Event Horizon' is just another big, loud, dumb movie.  It's a text-book example of how 'not' to make a film.  Gear up a great cast; send them into space with some pricey Hollywood special effects; and then let it all spiral down a hole about as deep and interesting as a shallow pot-hole.Remember 'The Black Hole'?  'Event Horizon' perfectly mirrors what 'The Black Hole' did wrong almost 20 years ago.  The evil that surrounds the mysterious Event Horizon ghost-ship is nothing more than a vague notion of hell.  O.k., so the laws of physics have been broken a little.  So what? Does that deserve eternal torture on a spinning gravity chair?  We never get to see the mysterious dimension that supposedly houses this horrendous evil. We never get to see what faster-than-light travel looks like.  The visions of ""hell"" each crew member faces, are cut so quickly, so sporadically, and so loudly, that the whole thing simulates a form of visual electro-shock therapy.  It's all very unpleasant and uninteresting.The only thing I found remotely enjoyable was Dr. Weir's (Sam Neill) explanation of his ""dimensional drive"".  Unfortunately, it's all cut short by lame banter from the crew in the form of, ""Com'on Doc! Speak English!"" Wow.  Talk about a shortcut to nowhere.   It would appear that the writers made a dimensional jump to mediocre, unimaginative, audience condescension hell.Do yourself a favor and rent 'In The Mouth Of Madness' instead.

394,sampath,"Not perfect, but an accomplished chiller",6,16 December 2000,"After his less-than-impressive (but appropriately cheesy) directorial debut Mortal Kombat, Paul Anderson tried his hand at making a 'serious' movie with Event Horizon, and the result is surprisingly decent.  The title refers to a top-secret deep-space experimental vessel that inexplicably went missing, only to reappear - just as inexplicably - seven years later.  So a rescue crew, led by Lawrence Fishburne, is sent to investigate, but needless to say, the get far more than they gambled for.For the first half, the film does a good job of building up a creepy atmosphere.  In particular, the idea of where the ship has been, and what it has brought back with it, overflows with arresting potential.  Unfortunately for Anderson, however, this potential is never realised, despite some impressive CGI and nifty camera work.  For the second half of the film, he just relies on excessive gore to scare his audience, and therein lies the film's main weakness:  what started off by building up genuine psychological dread just turns nasty and unpleasant - not to mention unconvincing - at the end.  And when Sam Neill's scientist starts running amok among the mayhem committing assorted atrocities, the film completely loses its plot.  The performances are merely passable, with the afforementioned Neill ending up being positively ludicrous. That said, however, Anderson does manage to conjure up some truly intense moments, and there are some inventive special effects that help make the whole thing (just about) worth sitting through.   Not perfect, then, nor particularly original, but as horror hokum goes, pretty reasonable.6/10",Event Horizon

403,FightingIrish,Event Horizon *** ½ (out of four),8,4 November 2002,"Event Horizon *** ½ 1997, 97 min., R (for strong violence and gore, language and some nudity)By Andrew KramerPaul Anderson's Event Horizon is one of the best-made horror films I have seen in a long time. It ranks up there with films such as The Shining, Aliens and Halloween, and yet it feels somewhat lacking. That one aspect prevents it from becoming a true horror classic, but fortunately the mildly mediocre sections of the film are made up for by the film's rollercoaster ride of terror. Event Horizon is probably the most unpleasant, violent and depraved film I have ever viewed, only because it is unflinchingly truthful to the genre. Unlike many other horror films, which lower the fear factor by placing moral characters and happy endings within their screenplays, Event Horizon knows how to terrify an audience. It knows what will scare us and constantly place the characters within situations that will make the heart palpitate with dread. And the characters are not scoring below 75 on the I.Q. test, unlike other characters in recent horror films. They approach each situation like a normal person would approach it.The story: In the year 2047, a massive space ship, known as the `Event Horizon', has just reappeared in the vicinity of Neptune after being lost for seven years. A salvage team is quickly sent out to investigate the return of the lost vessel on a research craft known as the Lewis and Clark. The team is constructed of (for the most part) engaging, but not widely known actors. They include the captain of the research team, Miller (Laurence Fishburne), Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), who built the Event Horizon, and many others including Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan and Jason Isaacs. One of my favorites out of all the characters was Richard T. Jones, who played the smartass Cooper and did a fine job as a comic-relief (`So, would like something hot and black inside you?' which is only one of his best lines.) Most of the other characters all seem as if they have something to share, whether it is from their past or their way of thinking, but nothing than is truly incredible. Hands down, the best performance in the film is by Sam Neill, who goes effectively fanatical after the thrills start to increase in numbers. What they find on the ship, I will leave to you to discover, but let me tell you that you will be proved wrong at many points, and then chuckle at how efficiently a scene was composed.
Consider, for example, (and I won't reveal anything to spoiling), the tunnel scene, where you are just about positive that there will be a sudden shock, but your not quite aware when it will pop up, then. BOOM! Almost ever other scary sequence in the film literally leaps off the screen at you, and you never expected it because you were too preoccupied with figuring out when and how the scare was going to manifest. The way terror is conveyed is absolutely riveting, but there is one characteristic in this film that stands alone, in sheer brilliance. And that is the Event Horizon. The actual ship design is incredible: it looks as if it's been constructed entirely out of pieces of monasteries and cathedrals. Not only are the models dazzling, but the structure of the Event Horizon itself actually depicts a true sense of foreboding and evil (If you don't believe me, take notice to the number inscribed on the airlock door where the Lewis and Clark docks with the Event Horizon). There are, however, some gripes that I had with the film and the first and foremost was that I didn't feel I enjoyed it as much as I could have, due to the overall graphicness and somewhat loose plot. Now I have no real trouble with gore and splatter at all (however, if you do then this film is definitely not for you), but I admit that even though I enjoy horror, I am not a true diehard like others. This film is extremely disturbing: it is the kind of film that stays with one for a very long time, regardless of who you are. The insights that it has make it incredibly (and sometimes uncomfortably) aghast, such as themes dealing with hell and death. The violence is very bloody, but usually if you are not squeamish, than you should be able to handle it. The other major gripe is the plot, which seems not meandering, but a bit unoriginal at times. It occasionally feels like the director ran out of ideas of his own, and therefore had to steal some from other movies. But remember that these are only minor complaints.
Event Horizon is an odd, shocking, thought-provoking film that ponders the deepest and darkest realms of the human soul, and proves that the world is not made up of heroes and villains. It is mostly a film to be celebrated for its intense terror, powerful direction and high production values. See it and enjoy it: you will not be let down.",Event Horizon
404,ProfessorX,Not bad,7,4 January 2003,"Before going on to much worse things (ie. RESIDENT EVIL), Paul W.S. Anderson (formerly just Paul Anderson, but he changed due to confusion with P.T. Anderson, director of MAGNOLIA, the British director made this, he second venture into Hollywood. After the dreadful MORTAL KOMBAT, Mr. Anderson took on a multi-million dollar sci-fi horror movie: this.Scripted by reative unknown Philip Eisner, it's that same-old-story of a space-crew coming across an abandoned vessel, only to find that something is still there. . . Laurence Fishburne is an effective Captain Miller, backed up by a whole sack of cliches; Sean Pertwee's cocky pilot, Joely Richardson's sturn professional, Jack Noseworthy's wide-eyed rookie, and Sam Neill's mad scientist. The plot consists of Fishburne's crew teaming up with Neill to find his space-ship of the title, which went missing 4 years ago. When they enter it, all they find are hideously mutilated corpses and a lot of blood.. .plus a particulary disturbing ship's log, which would make Captain Picard turn positively green with disgust. We soon find out that the Event Horizon can open some gateway and travel through the universe, defying the laws of physics because. . .oh just see it and find out, but it's brought something from it's last travels. . .to Hell.Turning from a rather rum episode of BLAKE'S 7, into a twisted space-slasher was an innotive move from Anderson, and although it doesn't live up to his expectations ('The Shining in Space' was his promise, but it's more like SCREAM among the stars). More like THE HAUNTING (the original not the crap Jan de Bont remake) than ALIEN, this replaces the creepy old house with a creepy old space-ship and it certainly works a treat. The acting is not bad (for a scu-fi movie, anyway), whilst the special-effects and the ever-increasing gore and prosthetics are very impressive. So it's rather sad that isn't actually that scary. There are a couple jumps and frights, but nothing very substantial.This is a case of an idea being brilliant of paper, but not quite working in practice. Eisner's script is good, but there are too many plot-holes and not enough charactrisation. Despite it being buffed up by Andrew Kevin Walker (responsible for SE7EN and, er, 8MM), the horror scenes are gruesome, but none of them stay with you in the same way that the murders in SE7EN do. Although the Spanish Inquisition-style torture chambers are a nice touch.Anderson handles the action reasonbly well, much better than in RESIDENT EVIL, but it is the actual Event Horizon, a labyrinth of steel corridors and large spikey-rooms, which steals the show.EVENT HORIZON is the perfect movie for a Friday night in: pulp sci-fi with buckets (and quite literally, waves) of blood. In the first sitting it was creepy, but in repeated watching, it lacks the rewatchability of other horror movies which continue being frightening as many times as you see them (THE THING, HALLOWEEN).Paul W.S. Anderson does a far better job on this, than on RESIDENT EVIL (which he scripted himself, so perhaps there lies the problem), and is his best film to date. Mind you, that's not much of an achievement as his other movies include SHOPPING and SOLDIER (shudder).EVENT HORIZON has become something of a modern cult-clag movie, and it's fun to watch people being hacked and sliced to pieces, but like all of Anderson's films, they are fatally superficial. 3 out of 5",Event Horizon

Horrid, contrite and an insult to the viewer - the few scenes with promise are in the first half, and the ending is so ludicrous that you aren't sure whether to laugh, cry or drool on yourself from the utter stupidity of this nonsense.  The acting is not half-bad, but the direction certainly is.  If you mix the movies ""The Black Hole"" and ""Hellraiser IV"", you have Event Horizon.  That's it.  Move along. Nothing to see here.",Event Horizon
407,pictomancer,Scariest Sci-Fi I've Ever Seen!!,10,5 July 2009,"This film is the only sci-fi horror film that has truly scared me out of my wits and that makes this film unique in every sense.The film itself is about a spaceship which disappeared a long time ago. The ship was fitted with a gravity device capable of creating a black hole to act as a gateway to a place in space normally unable to reach. It reappears and a crew is sent to investigate (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Niell etc). But they find the crew as either frozen disfigured corpses or splattered blood entrails on the walls. The best description I can give to encapsulate the situation is 'a haunted house in space': the spaceship is kind of possessed and everyone on board suffers terrifying hallucinations.The acting is brilliant and extremely believable. The film sort of builds up tension for most of the film, with the deaths occurring towards the end of the film. Horrible deaths to be exact: someone being vivisected and someone ripping their own eyes out to name a few. The thing that makes the film scary is that you expect something tangible as the cause of the horror (an alien or monster) but its the ship itself. Also the unfamiliarity of space adds a kind of xenophobic feel to the events.All in all, this is a movie you should not miss. I cannot find any flaws in it whatsoever and as I said before, this is the ONLY sci-fi horror that has scared me. Ever.",Event Horizon
408,BradleyUK,Sci-Fi Shock sensation,8,20 June 2003,"Its not the best film I've seen yet this was the best experience I've had in a cinema. After getting lost & sh*t scared driving around dark English country lanes I arrived at the cinema already in quite a state. And from the moment I heard the rocking Orbital opening track I was transfixed. I was in the perfect mood to watch this film and it delivered more than I could have hoped in a cinema experience. After repeated home viewings it does lose its shock factor yet it is still a great film, though I have to add it really was meant for the big screen. The sets are great, the gore is shocking & the ship design is truly beautiful. Admittedly the Event Horizon borrowed its look from '2001' yet they took that long majestic shape & gave it a more modern gritty feel. A few bits of ham acting (listen to when Richardson says ""the hulls been breached"") didn't detract from this excellent Hellraiser Vs 2001 style flic. Watch it with the lights off and the sound up. 10/10 for the Cinema experience. 8.5/10 as a complete film",Event Horizon
409,imzadi001,Okay movie. Disposable crew members.,3,2 November 2011,"Event horizon is a decent film, but it comes with a price. It asks the viewer to essentially suspend disbelief in the face of the idiotic crew of the lewis and clark space vessel, who all seem to concertedly hate the dr. and behave as though they never graduated high school. One would assume that the crew of any advanced space vessel would be less arrogant, more reserved and more capable to deal with the unknown. And for some reason scientific concepts seem to invoke a knee jerk, adolescent reaction out of some of them which causes them to want to beat people up (what the?). Yea, they do not seem to be too big on science, yet they seem to know, paradoxically, how to operate the ship. It is a difficult thing to get past, but once you do, it is a decent film.What this film excels in is atmosphere. And it has plenty of darkness in it, reminiscent, in some ways, of alien. Laurence fishburne does an adequate job of portraying the captain of the lewis and clark, the vessel which is on a mission to recover the secrets of the event horizon (the part where they find the event horizon actually reminds me of 2010: the year we make contact a little, when they find the discovery wreckage).The psychological component is the most interesting aspect of this film, but it is also physically believable, which I guess means they got the props and effects portion of the film right. There are contradictions that are difficult to accept though, and unfortunately they have little to do with the actual story and more to do with stupid inconsistencies, such as when justin (I.E 'baby bear') suffers debilitating injuries from exposure to zero gravity for a mere 15 seconds, where he begins to spit up blood etc, but a scene toward the end where captain miller is somehow able to cope with the same exposure for what seems like several minutes without injury.Okay so, toward the end it becomes apparent why the crew hated dr. Weir, but it's almost as if the story calls upon us hating him before we even know a damned thing about him, such as how attached he is to the event horizon, and even his attachment to the ship seems more of a neurotic condition rather than something to be hated for. Ultimately the film asks us to vicariously dislike dr. Weir through the crew of the lewis and clark, it asks us to admit that these lunk heads know better than we do, but it is difficult to buy and too simplistic a sell. the Dr. himself seems to be the only intellect on board. Everyone else seems to lurch around saying F**k every other word or sitting back with their feet up, chain smoking and acting like throw backs to the 20th century who are disinterested in anything to do with their chosen profession.With all these flaws in account, the film does still manage to encapsulate you with its psychological component. But you almost find yourself not caring whether or not this crew lives or dies. The only one holding it together is laurence fishburne's character, and he seems to be the only person aboard the ship whose fate you care anything about. I suppose, in a sense there is that general feeling of humanity that encompasses you when you see these people faced with such incredible odds and frightening scenario, but it is hard to maintain with how childish, arrogant and knee jerk the crew members tend to be.Overall, a watchable, atmospheric film, but could have been done way better than it was. I have seen it twice over the course of the past 2 years, and I do not think I will be revisiting it too much as there are much better films both intellectually and artistically, that have many more layers that one can invest ones time dissecting, and where the characters are not disposable idiots for the most part.",Event Horizon

I don't think my parents realized how frightening it was going to be when they took me to see it. The film, which takes place in 2047 (when humans have already established colonies on the moon and have started commercial mining on Mars), moves quickly and gets scary fast. Sam Neill plays a scientific engineer (Dr. Weir) assigned to guide a search-and-rescue vessel to Neptune where a ship (the Event Horizon) has suddenly resurfaced seven years after disappearing. Laurence Fishburne stars as the crew's captain (Cpt. Miller) and mediator after news of the lost vessel found creates panic. The Event Horizon (which was a research vessel destined for our nearest star) was actually part of an exploratory project designed by Weir. In the film, he creates a gateway (black hole) that allows for faster-than-light travel. However, unforeseen accidents occur and the Event Horizon ends up at a place far, far away from its intended destination.

Back at the ""Alien"", we knew nothing about the aliens - where did they live, why were they trapped, and more important (for me) who trapped them (remember the large body on the com deck?). Event Horizon leaves no doubts or no shadows about its basis. The ""English explanation"" of Dr. Weir about the speed of the ship Event Horizon is still ringing through my ears!

414,SomebodyToListenTo,"Good Movie, Badly Promoted",8,31 August 2000,"This movie is actually a good horror movie.  Sadly 'The powers that be' at the studio decided to promote this movie as a Sci-Fi entry as other users have pointed out.  That is where this movies' bad rap comes from (see the movie trailer for an example).While the idea is not original there are some genuinely scary moments in this film.  I can not recall seeing a space movie, including Alien, which has exploited the claustrophobia of space so well.  The horror of having a monster lose on a space ship should be a scary experience; hence this movie is no longer Sci-Fi but horror.  As the movie progresses the crew gets more frantic.  It is a great effect but it may have lost a few viewers.  Judging from the reviews, many people fault this point in the movie.  It is a matter of taste.  I don't mind jerky cameras and rapid changes to give a feel of franticness. 
Good movie 8/10, if you have the stomach for it.Be warned, this is a very scary movie that has a number of disturbing scenes involving razor blades, medical hooks and other sharp objects.  * SPOILER * I have spent many hours arguing with friends about the ending.

415,croatoan1,A brilliant idea and promising start ultimately suffer due to poor execution,3,23 March 1999,"One of the most genuinely frightening movies that I have ever seen. Maybe THE most frightening movie that I have ever seen. I was jumping at shadows and having nightmares for weeks after seeing this one -- and movies don't, as a rule. frighten me. If you're looking for a jarring, uncompromising ride to Hell and back, (and make no mistake; the film's tagline promises ""infinite terror,"" and it's not kidding) then look no further.Unfortunately the film's eventual descent into gore will leave many viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, myself included. As the plot (such as it is) plays out, the action becomes more and more gruesome, sacrificing genuine psychological horror for something far more visceral and, in the end, less effective.Despite misgivings, I find that I can't completely trash this film. It delivers what it promises -- terror, on a number of levels -- and in that respects it succeeds admirably. If you don't dwell to deeply on the plot, and the fact that it's blatantly derivative of some of the best (and worst) sci-fi and horror films ever made, you might just have a good time.But if you're looking for a cinematic masterpiece, or if you have a weak stomach, then your time and money is probably better spent elsewhere. Oh, and one closing thought:Explosive decompression, aside from not being explosive, does not work that way; the absolute WORST thing you could do, were you to find yourself trapped in a vacuum, would be to ""expel all of the air from your lungs"".

It's very psychological and surprises you several times with it's bizzare twists. The acting is mostly done by Laurence Fishbourne (Apocalypse Now, Matrix) and Sam Elliot (Jurrasic Park, The Hunt For The Red October). Together they make THE best science fiction flick I've seen since Star Wars. And I know I'm not the only one that thinks this movie is superb every person I've asked has said the exact same thing.

In my opinion dullness would be a greater crime. ""Event Horizon"" drew me in from the beginning and created a sense of suspense that did not dissipate despite various flaws in the script and direction. These flaws include potentially interesting characters with not enough meat on their bones, and a typical ""explosive"" Hollywood climax. I agree with a previous reviewer here regarding what this film might have been had it been allowed to unfold beyond the time constraints of a normal 90 minute movie. Perhaps then the ""Event Horizon"" could have really taken us to some place new. . .""Event Horizon"" is beautiful to look at - the sets and effects are wonderfully realized - and the cast, working within the previously mentioned restraints of the script, are solid.

This is the first movie in long time that actually managed to freak me out (and others I know as well), so at least the horror genre isn't totally dead...With that being said, I think one of the best parts of the movie is the original premise, where a secret faster-than-light ship that travels through black holes to reach vast distances in a short amount of time disappears on route to the nearest star... and comes back, albeit sans crew.  This may appear to be a copy of old stories about ghost ships and the Flying Dutchman and such, but in terms of science fiction it breathes new life.The thriller aspects do ""borrow"" from some established sci-fi/horror movies, but it works in this case, and director Anderson does a good job of keeping the suspense going.All in all, I believe this film is rated worse than it deserves.

What the ship entered was a chaos dimension... not hell, although it sure seems like that to the average horror movie viewer.

The thought of a ship built with an artificial black hole as an engine to bend time and space in half, thus reducing the distance between two points is very intriguing. What truly makes this film is the fact that the ship, after engaging this black hole, or Gateway as it's called in the film, it disappears, and 7 years later appears mysteriously.

422,Daniel Johnson,Can Paul Anderson direct?,4,6 November 1999,"Having seen Event Horizon it must rank as a major disappointment. With the interesting cast and the spooky storyline my hopes were high only to be let down by a Director out of his depth. Perhaps I'm being too critical of Paul Anderson but all his films have left me feeling empty and cheated e.g. take your pick from Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon and soldier. The main problem with Event Horizon is its melting pot of ideas. It seems the film doesn't know whether it wants to be Alien, Hellraiser or the Exorcist. Eventually it just ends up being an expensive mix of stolen ideas and themes all used to illeffect.At times the film was creepy and did have the odd jump out of your seat moment, not to forget the feeling of gloom and dread present throughout the whole film. But the film was way too short and the script laughable. Given the sheer scale of the Event Horizon ship why does it take the crew 10 min to check it out and why does the audience only get to see 4 different rooms? The only answer I can come up with was budget limitations. As for the ending well what was the point of watching the film? Perhaps Anderson should try to direct more films without special effects.

This was a great sci-horror and I'm really disappointed that the studio forced Paul Anderson to cut 30 minutes out. The chaos and madness is glimpsed but never fully entered into. I guess test audiences were p*ssy's and it's too bad that we will never get the proper directors cut this movie deserves.

429,mjbridges82,Sadly eviscerated.,5,22 April 2005,"'Have you ever seen acting in zero gravity?' I have, it's not pretty. Event Horizon was directed Paul Anderson, or Paul W.S. Anderson as he now calls himself in an attempt to avoid being confused with indie auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, though apparently he's now confused with indie auteur Wes Anderson. Dyslexia is apparently more prevalent than I had previously imagined. I doubt the Anderson in question here has ever been accused of being an auteur. Second only to the frankly inexcusably inept Ewe Boll in destroying the reputation of video game to movie adaptations, and maybe those responsible for Super Mario Bros., Anderson here deals with a debut script from Philip Eisner.Establishing itself firmly in a Sci-Fi mould, Event Horizon kicks off with a brief captioned run down of the past 50 or so years of space travel. It's the year 2047, humans are now floating around far flung regions of deep space and happily robbing Mars of her natural resources. We learn that an experimental ship, called the Event Horizon, disappeared on her maiden voyage some seven years previously. Now that a transmission has been picked up from her, it's the dubious honour of a small team lead by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) along with the mastermind behind the technology of the ship, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), to launch a salvage and rescue mission. The rescue crew is typically artificially diverse in personality, gender, and race in order to drum up some banter and accentuate conflict and distrust when the inevitable tough gets going. After the customary pseudo-science babble to explain how the ship works, it makes black holes and travels through them, the unwilling would be rescuers find and board the stricken vessel. It quickly becomes apparent that where ever the Gothic-nouveau ship has been all this time, it hasn't exactly had a positive affect. The crew quickly start experiencing horrific personal visions that seem far too tangible to be mere hallucinations, could it be that the ship is alive and trying to kill them? Wearing it's influences on it's sleeve, Event Horizon's opening scenes manage to ape both the Nostromo introduction from Alien and the external space station shots from 2001. Despite drawing from these rich sources, it's apparent in the brevity and showiness of the execution that these scenes are there simply 'because they can'. Though clearly the art direction and production design people have done their stuff admirably, and cinematographer Adrian Biddle, a veteran of both Alien and Aliens productions, is both comfortable and highly competent in his task, their efforts are sorely dampened by frenetic cuts. Just as you're trying to absorb some of the neo-Gothic dread, Anderson pulls you away in favour of a cheap fright or some inane expository dialogue. Though Sci-Fi in it's trappings, Event Horizon is clearly a horror film, and it's in this endeavour that it finds the most success. Overtly owing much to Clive Barker's Hellraiser vision, Anderson manages to conjure some memorably disturbing scenes. The notion that ship actually travelled to some other hellish dimension, or perhaps Hell itself becomes more compelling with each subsequent gory set piece. Indeed it seems Anderson was slightly too successful in this department. As any viewer will notice, the final third of the film suffers badly from confused editing. Characters go unaccounted for extended periods with no explanation, the action flits around in a chaotic fashion, what the hell is going on? The charitable might offer that it's an intentional device to mirror the chaotic, disorientating events the crew are suffering. The sensible know that, like many of the inhabitants of Event Horizon the ship, Event Horizon the movie has been eviscerated. Literally, the guts have been ripped out of this movie. It's rumoured that around 20 minutes of horror excess had to be excised from the film in order to secure the financially desirable 'R' rating for US audiences. Almost ironic considering Anderson's previous project, Mortal Kombat had the curious distinction of being significantly less violent than the video game that spawned it in order to be compatible with it's youthful target audience.It's a shame the strongest material, both in content and ostensibly quality, have been left out. It would likely have helped propel the film above it's critical and box office also-ran status, and helped distract from some of the films evident short comings. Though the leads Fishburne and Neill grind out characteristically workman like performances, most of the supports visibly flounder with the hackneyed dialogue and paper thin characterisation. It's clear Event Horizon has too many shortcomings to ever have reached the heights of it's influences, but it could have been a whole lot better. I for one would certainly welcome the arrival of the rumoured 'Director's Cut' style DVD. Perhaps this film still has more to offer. As it stands presently, Event Horizon is certainly worth a look for anyone looking for some stylish scares, so long as you don't try and follow it too closely.",Event Horizon

Next, this film went beyond many sci-fi flicks in that there was not the simplicity of a nice ugly creature to shoot at.  Next, it was rich in symbolism (e.g. the ship being in the shape of a giant crucifix).  In addition, the sound-track combined the modern sounds of 'Orbital' with symphonic sounds which is a nice mix.  Also, parts of the film, though very graphic at parts, made very great impressions by what they did NOT show you (letting you use your brain and imagination, which many newer films don't).  Finally, the ending was not a standard horror ending, but one that took a little intestinal fortitude (aka. Guts) to use (I won't say more about why I liked the end as it would spoil it).

The scenes of absolute chaos and the terror reigning when the crew destroys itself were incredibly well edited (sound and image) and got my by the guts. I think this is a vision of hell that is a valid modern equivalent to the medieval paintings by Hieronymus Bosch and others.",Event Horizon

When the big ""secret"" of the Event Horizon was revealed, it was so insultingly stupid that I couldn't believe the filmaker had the nerve to toss it up there on the screen.The film looks pretty cool-the interiors of the spaceship were based on a cathedral, but other than that, there's really nothing to suggest it.",Event Horizon
437,nick L,'Alien' meets 'The Shining'. So there.,7,6 November 1999,"I have read more than one review which has used the above statement, and upon viewing this slick but mixed bag of frights, I can see their point.Here are just a few things that this film rips off of 'Alien' & 'The Shining': - In Alien, Ash (played by a non-American actor) is the traitor in the midst. In Event Horizon it's Weir (played by a non-American actor) - The tone is almost identical to Alien, what with a largely unseen enemy and the final race against time (and a ticking bomb) - The 'inventor's block' suffered by Weir is almost identical to and is handled in a very similar (if more clumsy) way to Jack's madness in The Shining. - There are two scenes lifted directly out of The Shining - the beatiful naked woman in the bath who turns nasty and the cascade of bloodHowever, I still found myself enjoying this film immensely and getting completely taken in by it, and the FX and art direction are great. In any case, at least it steals from two good films. There were several good set-pieces throughout (occasionally marred by Anderson's use of over familiar cliches) and some impressive effects shots (the pull back from the space station and the first visit to a zero gravity Event Horizon are perfect examples). For the first hour, the film keeps impressively spooky yet keeping it's tongue firmly in cheek.The downside of the film is the clumsy scripting. To say that the dialogue is cheesy is an insult to dairy products ('we won't need eyes where we're going' and Weir's constant repetition of 'DO YOU SEE!!!' are prime examples of some lazy scripting). The concept that the ship has gone to hell is severely underused, and is really quite a good concept. Although we are given some brief hints of the Event Horizon's journey into hell with the final, squirming log entry, it never develops into the true nightmare we so wish it to, instead opting for done to death 'eerie' corridor walks and some grisly but boring 'Hellraiser'-style make up effects. Yet the film is still entertaining, and we are least given a juicy, explosion fuelled climax., but for all it's efforts it remains flawed. At least it is this good, given the pitfalls of such an over used genre.",Event Horizon

An eerie feeling was cast by the space ship, which as mentioned before, looked like a torture chamber.  The sound in the movie also made me look over my shoulder every few minutes.  I was really into the movie.  Then about 2/3 of the way through the movie, it took a horrible turn.  It looked as if someone else had wrote the last part of the movie, or the writer was trying to hit a deadline.  Don't wast your time watching this.  It took a big nose dive.",Event Horizon

I really don't understand why it is scary, there isn't too much gore but you really get the feeling that there is something with the characters, a sort of unearthly presence. That combined with the horrific visions, the gut-wrenching ships log and brilliant acting from Sam Niel create a world where every frame of film is infused with pure evil. This is a movie about exploring the unknown, going beyond the limits of what we understand; this is another possible reason for the movies impact which it has on you because there is so much mystery, you do not know where the event horizon has been and came back from and you do not know what befell the last crew members.

Why Why Why Why Why did the producers of this film make a brilliant film right up till the last 25 minutes or so???????? It has sci-fi, it has horror, it has tension and it has scenes that are generally SCARY (and there's very few scenes in movies that genuinely make me feel scared nowadays). The scene where Sam Neil is in the maintenance duct and the lights go out and the red flashing strobe comes on is perhaps one of the most frightening scenes in any movie I can recall and so, so simple. This film has all the right elements in all the right amounts for the first 60-70 minutes and then it just totally derails. Even thinking about it now has me shaking my head in disgust.If ever a budding film director needs to see the best way to butcher what should be an excellent film then this is the one to see.

Since then I have been unable to bring myself to watch it again. A warning therefore, if you're the slightest bit squeemish or easily disturbed, don't even think about watching this movie, just stay clear of it.It is genuinely gory and terrifying all the way through, but there is one moment which is simply unbelievable, where they access the ship's video logs and see what happened to the crew. Now I'm not really a horror movie fan, but this was the most gruesome piece of footage I have ever seen in a movie, and the image stuck in my head for months afterwards. Even now I can still hear those latin words in my head when I think about it.Fans of hardcore horror may well enjoy this film, but my advice is simply not to watch it at all.

448,JackyBryant,Violence and gore are not substitutes for quality writing...,8,10 August 2008,"Event Horizon, the title of the movie, and the title of the fictitious spaceship in the movie that is capable of bending both space and time. And a crew of military spaceship operators are hired to track down the ship after it mysteriously resurfaces in deep space after being lost for the last seven years. Where has this time bending ship been the last seven years? Such a promising and intriguing premise is brutally ruined with over the top gore and violence. What could have been a thinking person's science-fiction mystery or even 'space detective' style movie is quickly reduced do a brain dead slasher gore fest complete with enough blood and mayhem to nearly erase the solid 45 minutes of brilliant writing, directing, and acting that preceded it.Eventually it is revealed that the ship most likely jumped forward in time seven years, instantly appearing at the current time of the movie. If the writers had simply left the movie at that I would have rated this a 10. But instead the ship is somehow magically transported to hell and back...and thus begins the gratuitous and ridiculous levels of violence.Sadly the intent of the movie producers and directors was to not only have the level of gore in the released version of the movie, but an even higher level of gore that had to be toned down to achieve an R rating.This is sad, because violence and gore, while sometimes are great in films, are not worthy substitutes for quality writing and storytelling. Violence with very little plot attached can basically summarize the last 45 minutes of an otherwise perfect film. A 'less is more' approach would have better sufficed, not the full-on head-first blood orgy that happens instead.",Event Horizon
449,Pooua,Wretched Dreck!,1,9 December 2011,"Never has so much been spent on such a horrid story! This movie is 14 years old as I write this (2011, in case you don't pay attention the date stamp). I fished it out of the $5 movie bin at Walmart this evening, choosing it for viewing because it has some big-name actors in a big-budget sci-fi movie, thus beating out Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"" and ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star."" It came with two DVD disks, the second disk for special features.I'll begin by pointing out the positive. The movie has aged well. The cinematography is top-notch, all the lighting, sound, props and special effects look great (to me, a completely untrained couch potato). This positive is one factor that helped me get through the movie, despite my growing irritation with it. The other was the hint that maybe I would be able to see attractive female nudity.Unfortunately, the plot is asinine. Almost all horror movies have asinine plots, so had I known ahead of time this is supposed to be a horror movie, I might have not expected so much from it. Now I've read a few of the other negative reviews of this movie, and I can see I'm not the only person who recognizes the obvious. Virtually nothing that happens in this movie has any business being in this movie. I get angry every time I think about it. So much of the plot is perfunctory climax, bad things happening on cue, and so obvious, because EVERY SINGLE HORROR MOVIE HAS THE SAME STORY ARC! Some people like cheesiness, but this goes so much deeper than even cheesiness could describe.It has nice props. I liked the props. I need to think about that for a little bit, until I feel better. Nice props, even though it seems silly that the living quarters look like the heart of a tokamak.Oh, there is some female nudity in it. In the first half of the movie, we get to see a woman's bare nipple for about 0.25 seconds. I spent the next half-hour wondering why the producers even bothered putting a naked woman in the movie if that was all they were going to show. We spend more time looking into her eyeless eye sockets as she speaks to us in a calm voice. Eventually, Sam Neill's character forces the camera to lock onto those same bare breasts for a minute or so. Visually, nothing else is happening. Then, we go back to the eyeless eye sockets.The movie attempts to introduce tension by the perfunctory personality clashes between crew members, particularly against the new person aboard. The new crew member designed a ship (the ""Event Horizon"") that has been lost for several years, but now has reappeared. This crew was sent to find out what happened to the ""Horizon."" To build this tension, in one scene, the designer shows complete disregard for another person's personal property as he attempts to explain how the ship he designed operates; so in another scene, a crew member damages the ship he built. Let's compromise the integrity of the ship we are trying to rescue, so we can even our petty score! Anyway, nice props. Big name stars. Some glimpses of a woman's bare breasts. The Planet Neptune swirling below. Oh, wait... somehow, the ""Event Horizon"" is orbiting Neptune *inside* her upper atmospheric cloud bank, in clouds so dense that she can't even be seen until the rescue ship almost runs into her. So, actually, the Planet Neptune, swirling all around.If you have any regard for scientific accuracy, you may resent this movie intensely much. If you care about logical motivations, the movie may annoy you. If you value intellectual, thoughtful stories, this movie may drive you mad.Of course, there is eventually blood everywhere. Blood and gore and horrific things. People getting bumped in the head. Eyes being dug out of sockets. Sharp, spiky things. Dead people. Age-inappropriate children in a Rated R movie, causing havoc. That's just me, reacting to this movie.",Event Horizon

I didn't have a clue what it was about (it had only opened that weekend) but rather than waste a trip to the cinema I decided I'd give it a go.Jesus, I nearly wept tears of blood watching this film; it was that scary. There were scenes I actually had to look away from because they were freaking me out so much. But I loved it and came out thinking it was one of the best horror films I'd ever seen.I raved about it to my friends and when it came out on video a group of us rented it and settled down to watch. Unfortunately, none of my friends found it remotely scary and I have to admit, as someone else here has already said, it does lose a lot in the transition to video. This didn't stop my friends slagging me relentlessly about being a pussy.So, on reflection, it is a good film; scary and great to look at but not the horror masterpiece I thought on first viewing.

I'm not even big on science fiction or space movies in particular (my husband ruined me by watching stuff like Battlefield Earth and attempting to convince me it was worthy of my time). I've since watched it without being under the influence of any chemicals, many times, and I can confirm it's still every bit as awesome. I think it may have been a little before its time and didn't get the credit it deserved. At all. ""The ddddark...inssside meee"", ""Do you seeee?!""

I believe this film blended the two aforementioned films and many others to come up with a very satisfying, original end product. I'm not a horror fan by any means, but this film and In the Mouth of Madness (which Sam Neil also starred in) always come to mind.Very great entertainment. Event Horizon keeps you holding onto your seat until the very end. If you hate any sci-fi type movies and think that they're FAKE, don't underestimate this film. If you like horror films and would love for your girlfriend/wife/date to jump a little then you will love this! Either way you will be entertained!

454,amid77,Hellraiser,5,13 March 2005,"This is really stupid sci-fi movie with some kind of religious reference. It's not very clear what this film is all about, and I think the creators are very confused by themselves. Maby they meant to create some dark, claustrophobic and apocalyptic movie, maybe they tried to say something about human nature, limits of science and psychological perception, or maybe about the collision of religion and technology. All of those you can find here, but you cannot find that thing, which distinct a real masterpiece from just some bad movie with good intentions.My guess, whoever made this flop, they just took all the components from other sci-fi movies and combined them into one big mess. The result is scrappy, incoherent, immature, ridiculous, boring and not even frightening piece of crap. I think teenagers may find that movie tense and interesting, but people who can appreciate really good sci-fi, my suggestion is to skip this one.Anyway, using this opportunity, I would like to recommend John Carpenter's early movies, like ""Dark Star"" and ""The Thing"".",Event Horizon

While certainly not perfect, there are some excellent (albeit gory) visuals, much of the acting is solid, and the first half of the film does a great job building up suspense.The story does play around with mind games, hallucinations, and drawing on the characters' past traumas. At times, if you're unable to suspend disbelief, this can make characters appear foolish as they chase after a character that couldn't possibly be there or otherwise see things they should logically know are not real. But if you can wrap your mind around this being much more than horror-character stupidity, you begin to realize just how insidious the evil in this movie is.Sam Neill has done other horror and I think he's underrated when it comes to his appearances in the genre. He does a great job throughout here, adjusting his performance well as his character goes through major changes.There aren't many decent sci-fi/horror films out there. While this one certainly doesn't surpass classics like Alien, it is a suspenseful, creepy film that continues the genre's tradition of asking big, frightening questions.

It is truly sickening in places, and there's a great oppressive feeling of suspense and wonder the first time you watch it. The visuals are impressive, well they are when I watch it on digital TV, the concept is interesting, and there are some great moments, like the visions that the cast members get flashed with. And it is very well acted in places, especially by Fishburne and Niell, the two primary characters.The only criticism I have is for the ending, which seems to just sort of tail off, and doesn't befit the film.

In retrospect, this movie was very effective at disturbing me - if only by producing such unbelievably nasty scenes that I had no choice. I was closer to getting sick than being scared.Maybe that's why I hated this movie so much. Very little about the plot will surprise you, but the images will stay with you for a while.

Event Horizon was put together well and my only complaint is that the people who created the film should have elaborated more on what specifically happened to the ship. It does touch on the topic but it is generally left up to the viewers opinions on whether the ship was haunted or alive. All in all I would have to give it a nine on sheer fear content alone.

470,kayins,Truly Terrifying,9,26 February 2002,"I'm not sure why so many people dislike this movie.  When I saw it in the movie theater, I was truly scared.  I've been watching Horror movies for a long time and I only got scared off of Hellraiser II, Evil Dead, Milo, and Jacob's Ladder (personal demon things were too creepy).  But this movie wasn't scary in visual effect.  But more so tone and atmosphere.  The moview was rich in atmosphere of the unknown and terror.  The gore parts were fine.
I don't mind a good gore flick, but ****MINOR SPOILERS- listening to the the screams of the previous crew, the flashes of chaos, and the setting of the ship, were truly frightening.  Made it seem that there really was some sort of doorway to hell. Not too mention the airlock scene was truly horrific******-MINOR SPOILERSAnyway, a lot of people didn't like the movie because the ending left them hanging.  No closure and people seem to need that.  I think that has to do with the lack of interest in the film.  I for one cherish the unpredictable and this film delivers with a great atmosphere.  I recommend 9/10.",Event Horizon

472,sdsalamida,"Not for the weak-stomached. Lots of gore, and intense horror.",6,26 March 2002,"After reading a few of the other comments, I decided to write my own. When you go to see a Horror movie, you have to accept the fact that you're going to see blood and guts.  It's not just a few bloody noses here and there. So for those of you who were ""disgusted"" by the gore in this movie...maybe next time you decide to see something in the genre of Horror...make sure you know what you're getting into.  As for myself, and many others who saw this movie, there was plenty of gore (which is a good thing).  The psychological horror was intense, depending on how and where you watch it.  For example, I first saw this at 2 in the morning, with the Surround Sound way up, all the lights off...that added to the intensity.  Some of the plot is pretty corny. But for the most part, it's an original, good old fashioned horror movie. I mean, come on...a dimension that is the equivalent of Hell...what can be more horrifying, besides a sequel to Pearl Harbor? If you're a fan of horror and senseless violence, this one is for you.  If you can't handle blood and guts...go watch Bambi.",Event Horizon
473,birdy3182,"Enjoyable, sit down and just watch type of film",8,6 September 2002,"At first, I was a bit dodgy about this film. My mates were giving mixed reviews, some said it was great, others said it was shyte!!My self I think i would choose the first.This film is a welcome escape from all the other rubbish out there now, for example - Armageddon - could have been a good movie had it been less lovie-dovie!! Why do directors always have to put romance into an action triller??!! It ruins it!With this there is no love story inside it, in fact that only part that slightly relates to romance is heavily involved with memory flahbacks of death!! Now that is much better, not to sound to morbid or anything.The fact is, this is a real lads film. If chicks don't like it, then they can walk it, if guys don't like it - then the poofters should hire out City of Angels and stop whinging. Afterall, it is their choice, stop moaning.If you love suspense, gore and basically quite a warped sense of horror, then you should enjoy this. I not, then get something else.Scenes involved people smothered against walls, crew killing each other in a sick and twisted ways (thrusting their fist down each others throat to rip their insides out, that kind of stuff) and quite a good looking part where one of the crew decompresses out in space.Don't expect another type of hollywood movie where their are heroes, this is what films should be like. Simple story - Ship disappears, search and rescue rendevouz, board ship...oh dear, everything goes pear shaped and now everyone is trying to survive, but who are the lucky ones??!!You will have to find out!Oh, and another thing!!! Some critics claim parts of this film is snatched from other movies!!WRONG!!!They used clips from this!! These guys get paid to slag this movie off, and yet they are slagging the wrong movie by saying it is un-original.This movie is different from everything else, I am yet to see another like it!!My Rating? 8/10!!Get a curry, a few cold lagers and a few mates around.

474,emptyskies,Terrifyingly addictive,9,23 April 2002,"Event Horizon is a movie that despite you being terrified of, you just can't drag yourself away from the screen. It's unfairly knocked in many quarters, claiming it's overtly violent. I disagree - the violence is all central to the plot, which is enjoyable (in a ""give you nightmares"" kind of way) and engulfing. The thing that I found so effective about it (other than the plot) is  how extremely easy it is to empathise with the crew of the ship - the characters are such that most people watching will identify with at least one of them (""mama bear"", ""papa bear"" and ""baby bear"" nicknames for some of the crew make you feel like these people really have worked together from before). When you start empathising with characters in a horror movie, it starts getting under your skin... and because of this, Event Horizon is highly effective. There are definitely overtones from aliens, but you'll get much more of a scare from this... unlike in Aliens, the enemy of this movie cannot be shot, and whilst terrorising the crew, they can't live without it. This nightmarish symbiosis dogs the crew as they slowly begin to understand what's going on with the strange occurrences within ship and what happened to the previous crew. The more the movie progresses, the faster the frights come... and some of them are very, very effective, whether overtly (where it gets disgusting) or only in your head (where you're truly terrified). If you're into sci-fi/horror, move over Aliens, this is the definitive movie.",Event Horizon

I'm not saying it's a horror film, it's scary. but it does have it's share of horror.I have seen this movie over twenty times since I was in my teenage years and it rarely gets old.

476,miketunney777,An interesting albeit underrated look at sci-fi horror.,7,29 November 2013,"A critical and commercial failure upon release, this black sheep of sci-fi horror films gained a cult-following and success with DVD/Video Cassette release afterwards. It is quite a solid film, incorporating a rather B-Movie idea with A-Grade production, great cinematography, and above average acting (particularly for a horror film). Character depth is not a big thing, although the characters are quite likable and full of personality whether serious or humorous. The plot involves a ship called Event Horizon that lost all communication after orbiting past Neptune to have the ship reappear several years later. The crew, unknowing of the ship's past or the mission they are about to participate in, mus investigate the ship for survivors only to find a dark secret about the ship which takes the crew's lives one by one. The horror pieces are effective and entertaining, complimented by a cool story and great visual effects/set pieces. Supposedly, the once-lost footage containing 25-30 minutes of extra background insight and horror sequences has been found and will hopefully encourage a director's cut release. The film does spoil some could-be-amazing parts but carries through to the ending that makes the stop and think for a second to realize how the terror isn't over. 8.5/10.",Event Horizon

However, today I watched it for the first time, since I bought it cheap on DVD, so it wouldn't harm.I was highly surprised to witness a good horror story in space, which wasn't at all bad! The gothic style of the ship, the hallucinations of the rescuecrew, it all added to the suspense.I don't recommend this movie to anyone who hates explicit violence, but anyone else who can appreciate horror, just view this one.
It isn't a memorable movie which should very high ratings, but just a fun one. And that doesn't harm anyone from time to time:)",Event Horizon
478,rochus_meijer,The Shining in outer space,9,23 December 2005,"This movie freaked me out of my chair many times! A friend of mine recommended this movie to me years ago. He saw it at the theater and was stunned. I remembered seeing a trailer of the film and wanting to see it badly. Fact is, the film only stayed in the cinema for about five weeks in my country. I was too late, I had to rent it on video. I can imagine that ""Event Horizon"" has a scary effect in the cinema, but watching it home alone made me probably feel more shocked then ever before. What I thought to be a mediocre ""Alien"" ripoff, turned out to be something completely different. It scared the hell out of me..For those of you who saw ""Ghost Ship"", this movie has a lot of similarities, only ""Event Horizon"" is way better. I'll start with the opening credits. Nothing really special, but the music score that comes along with it; absolutely terrifying! Great work by both Michael Kamen and Orbital, who use a sublime mixture of techno, orchestra music and all kinds of chilling sound effects. At that moment I knew I was going to be scared, which didn't take long to actually happen.The acting in this movie is quite well. My credits go to Sam Neill in particular, who plays a role in which I never saw him before. Watch and see for yourself. The story is the worst thing in this movie, although I like the concept of a spaceship that creates black holes to travel faster than light. But the whole 'rescue mission that goes awry' is done so many times before, it didn't impress me much. The same goes for the ending which is in my opinion a bit of a letdown. On the other hand, it probably had a more lasting effect on me just because I was still confused with what actually happened.For those of us who can't stand any gore, don't watch this! Although most of the gore in ""Event Horizon"" comes in flashes, there are particular scenes which do not leave much to the imagination. Shocks will be there plenty for the most of us, as everything hits you right in the face over and over again.Adding everything in this film up: special effects, music and the atmosphere are the best things here. The storyline is the worst, but is still enjoyable as long as you don't take it too serious. So what's my conclusion? If you want to be scared, do as I did and watch ""Event Horizon"" alone in the dark with loud sound.. If you enjoyed ""Ghost Ship"", go and see this movie as it is the same concept, only way better and more believable.. If you liked ""The Shining"", you might consider looking at ""Event Horizon"" as well because a good description is ""The Overlook Hotel in outer space"". It's chilling, it's shocking and it stays in your head for a very long time. Liberate tutemae ex inferis! (Safe yourself from hell!) 8/10!",Event Horizon
479,sabrina_makela,my favorite,10,1 May 2015,"I'm a huge horror fan. This movie was my first horror movie and it is the reason that I love horror. It's the reason I keep watching every horror movie set in space I can find. This movie is terrifying. I still have trouble watching it alone with the lights off and I've seen it many, many times, as I introduce all my friends to it and they usually make me watch it with them. The effects are great and it's so creepy that I jump when things happen, and I never jump at movies. I love the atmosphere, the creepy lighting and the music. All of it enhances the movie, rather than being distracting or directing ones mood toward a scene. The gore is pretty much perfect, not too much, not too little. All in all, just a perfect horror film. I haven't seen a space movie this good, except maybe Sunshine, which is amazing as well.",Event Horizon

This movie makes you think about what is out there in space and gives it a dark and evil twist to space exploration. The movie was entertaining and gripping at all times. It was scary and frightening. The acting was descent except that of Lawrence fishburn. He was very stiff in this movie and conveyed little to no emotion for a protagonist. Lots of blood and gore and some scene were very disturbing but that's what made it so great. I give it a perfect 10 and i wish there's a sequel for this movie.

481,thepigsoftheroundtable,A less scary Alien,7,6 October 2015,"Seeing how I love Sci-Fi horror it was only natural that I would come upon this movie. But after checking out some of the reviews I was almost turned away by the shear amount of hate this movie was getting. But a few people did give it 10/10 and glorious praise, for which I don't know why. Event Horizon just wasn't that scary. The acting and cinematography were great but the movie was lacking in the scares department. The reason for this I believe was because of the lack of an antagonist for the majority of the movie. Unlike Alien which creates a dark atmosphere by letting the audience know that there is something out to get the crew Event Horizon didn't have this. For the first hour of the movie I thought they were all just hallucinating until the doctor went crazy and started killing everyone. At that point he just looked like a cheap knock off of they guy from Hellraiser. The movie also felt very rushed at the end, like the director was just trying to finish it up as fast as he could, like he didn't really care about the movie. Another thing that made me dislike the movie was the fact that there was a lot of comedic relief, especially in really intense scenes and that just didn't work well with this movie at all. Just as I was starting to get a little spooked one of the characters would completely ruin the feeling by saying something funny. It just felt out of place and did not sit well in a dark movie like this. Overall I give Event Horizon a 6/10. I did give it higher than many people because the special effects, acting, and overall idea were great but it was just lacking. The story was convoluted and jumped around, and the movie just felt like I was watching Alien without the alien itself in it. This is the type of movie that should be remade.

I feel like movies like this used a different creativity that was more abundant at the time. In this case 1997. It's only been 10 years, but the technology of now certainly has not enhanced the creativity of movies in my humble/angry opinion. What's wrong with Hollywood?? Example MI 3. This style has been done 10 billion times already!! And it's been done way better, with less technology!! WTF! I really think that the creativity is so low today, it's like at a light simmer, and i think it has to do with a mass over indulgence in S E X. How's that for darkness?!? It's like the current consciousness is saying ""Who cares, I get laid anyway!"" And women don't really care (stereo typically speaking) They just want ""chick flicks"" e.g. no effects, pure emotion e.g. just be natural and vomit all over the film! How did that make you feel?

It also uses graphic and sudden gore, this also adds to the unpleasant feeling. Another standard element is isolation, and the element of being trapped.Of course, a Horror/Sci-fi is not supposed to be pleasant, but you should have another feeling than just ""I am glad the movie is over"".",Event Horizon

The big word for Event Horizon is claustrophobic. Right from the beginning when Sam Neill finds himself trapped in the bacta chamber to the horribly cramped and torture chamber style scenes on board the ship, everything is enclosed and it is this that makes this one of the scariest films ever. The whole idea of the crew trying to escape but not being able to is extremely disturbing and alongside the brilliant characterisations within the film help to create a very eerie mood.",Event Horizon

There are some intensely powerful visuals in this movie, the Core is an unforgettable example of this. Actually, the whole ship is gracefully designed, and some gothic references in it only help to intensify the mood in the film.
The star cast does a brilliant job as well, with one of the best actors in the world, Sam Neill, at the helm. He proves it once again that he is THE BEST horror actor in the world today. (Just check out In The Mouth Of Madness and Snow White if you don't believe me:) He is maybe TOO convincing at some times... Laurence Fishburne is extremely cool as the captain of the rescue ship that encounters the Event Horizon. These two horrifyingly good actors are supported with some very good backup team. Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee, Richard T. Jones, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs and Jack Noseworthy all do their parts oversatisfyingly well!The story is simple, but it doesn't mean it's not good. Event Horizon is a good demonstration of how you can do an extremely, terrifyingly good movie out of a fairly simple story.There are many scenes in this movie I will never forget, such as all the Core scenes, the scene with Dr. Weir inside the panel-tunnel-room(?) and many others.If you want to have a good, relaxing time in front of the telly with your mom and dad, DON'T see this movie!!! If you're looking for THE horror film to watch in your home-cinema DVD system on a dark and stormy night, this is the one.P.S.

492,rich-319,Almost a very good film...but not quite,7,7 February 2001,"*CONTAINS A FEW MINOR SPOILERS*From my perspective Event Horizon is a film that brims with promise but never quite makes it. The initial premise of a Science Fiction/Horror crossover is a good one and the movie seems to attempt to become a version of 'The Shining' or 'Hellraiser' set in outer space with a spaceship substituting for the box or the Overlook Hotel. The contrast between the clean, clinical lines of the space station in the initial sequences and the neo-gothic interior of the Event Horizon is impressive and one of the opening shots showing the exterior of the space station from orbit is superb. Also there are a few pieces of religious imagery thrown in (even down to the cruciform spaceship), perhaps to hint at what is coming later.In spite of the fine effects and some good individual sequences the film never seems to quite fulfil its potential. Many of the horror scenes employ some of the oldest tricks in the book in their attempts to make the viewer jump - knowledgable horror movie fans will be able to spot the shocks coming a mile off! One day someone might remake this and fully explore the possibilities that the storyline of this film offers.

495,lukaszsw,It has something for everybody but nothing that would make it a great movie,7,23 July 2009,"I enjoyed Event Horizon the first time I watched it. Now after some years I went back to it and it still holds although it aged badly. That doesn't make it a bad movie, in my opinion the age made it unintentionally funny and that what kept me watching.The story follows pretty much the same story as the movie ""Ghostship"" (which is even more unintentionally silly) - there is a ship wreck in space, a team is sent to search & rescue and they all get slaughter. Much alike ""Ghostship"" there is a plot twist which is unexpected and makes no sense but sure is great to watch.But what makes this movie bearable is pure comedy on screen. We start with Sam Neil as Dr Weir (thats a villain name alright) in a bathroom on a rescue ship. He has a large mirror and a bathtub (his room sure is spacious for a starship. Of course there is normal gravitation all around. You wouldn't guess how astronauts in 2047 shave - with a RAZOR. His attention is drawn by a dripping tap, the tap itself has no levers so I guess Neil thought to himself ""I should have went for a premium space-tub"". Also all this space plumbers must be lazy not to fix the tap before a mission. We then visit the bridge where everybody have roller chairs (what if the gravity generator malfunctioned?) and spit stupid one-liners like ""its all blinking on my screen"". The captain is Morpheus (played by Morpheus=) and he makes little more sense unless you count an odd leather jacket - is it the part of official uniform? The crew goes into some deep sleep chambers (like in alien but with water) and Doctor Weir wakes up first, everybody is sleeping and computer is silent. Don't you know that this is a nightmare already? This ends with a comedic ""AAAAAaaaaAAA"" by Sam Neil, wasn't he embarrassed by doing a scene like that? After they wake up they found out that they are near Neptun and complain (didn't they know where the ship was headed?). Also its up to Weir to explain to the crew how the government made a ship faster than light. Impossibly the crew is smart enough to tell this is impossible. This scene is priceless because again it hard not to pity Sam Neil to explain the unexplainable. He starts with saying how they managed to fold ""space time"", is it similar to time on Earth? Than 5 minutes before they reach the wreck Dr Weir(d) plays them the one transmission that they've got from it - the recording consist of loud screams and a mad voice saying ""save me"" in Latin. NOW, thats a good hint 5 MINUTES before boarding the vessel! wow =) The team goes to the ships, find it awfully quiet and than find stupid excuses to to wander off and get slaughtered. The big (no) secret is that the ship basically been to HELL and back. That very original. Whats unoriginal is why the ship finds some sneaky way to kill the characters instead of turning the life support off. The design of the capable-of-speed-of-light spaceship is questionable to say the lest. To get to engineering part you have to go trough a section that looks like a meat grinder and the engine itself looks like torture chamber fantasy. Seriously why a a engine would even need so many spikes? and sharp parts. I think the engine is powered on dangerous environment alone. The core is a liquid stable substance and the character exhibits whats seems to be a ""matrix syndrome"" to put the whole hand into unknown substance. What kind of engineer does that? I like the set-up but the rest of the film that follow is sub-par: we see a lot of gore (people with gouged eyes, parts of people falling from the ceiling, people crushed) and all the characters do nothing but invent stupid ways to get out of the ship. The plot twist is indeed unexpected (although not shocking) but at the same time gives no hints as why it happened.Its a funny little flick that is more disgusting than scary but I don't think there is an abundance of this kind of horrors. Its recommendable but don't expect anything remotely serious and coherent. With a good spirit you can have a great time with it.",Event Horizon
496,neverre,The Horror Movie that could have been so much more,2,5 September 2001,"Event horizon is best described as the horror movie that couldhave been so much more. With its cast, director of photographyand even art department. The films story is basically deep space rescue of a lostexperimental ship. The script is excellent with great commentsand psychological impacting rhetoric. But the film looses in itspassing and similarity with many other films of the genre and otherhorror movies.The main similarities I see with this film is the Shinning. A livingship that just enjoys twisting it inhabitants for the pleasure of it.The idea of a living entity that resides in an inanimate object isoften seen but when visuals are clearly similar, it is a shame: thevisions of the little child running around, the whispers in the darkand even the elevator with gallons of blood. Sam Neill's character,a protagonist, even descends into insanity and becomes theantagonist like Jack Nicholson by seeing twisted imagery andflashbacks.Another problem are its camera shots. Most of them remind you ofAlienWhy you ask. Adrian Biddle a great cinematographer and one of my personalfavorites. But the director seems to ask him to place the camera inthe same positions as James Cameron had asked him for Aliens.Even the `Gigeresque' ship make the movie look too much like itbelongs to the Alien SAGA.Paul Anderson, the director of Mortal Kombat I and II, Soldier andthe upcoming Resident Evil, seemed more preoccupied withshocking rather than shocking and scaring at the same time. Heuses extreme gore to try and scare the audience but instead it justmakes it look silly or disgusting rather than stylish. The script wasstrong enough to scare without the gore. David Fincher proves withSe7en that awful gore can be off screen and psychologicallydisturb you more than actually seeing the atrocities.I believe I read the best critique of the film in Toronto's Nowmagazine, during the films run at the theatre. `The actors likeFishburne, Quinlan and Neill all signed to make a different moviethat what was made.' I do not remember the critic's name but Iagree completely.",Event Horizon

And his work in Event Horizon is right up there with some of his best films. In fact, the acting is pretty well in this movie overall, it is not Academy award material but not everything has to be. Laurence Fishbourne walks around with something stuck up his butt as his character seems to lack any human characteristics, but everyone else did a great job concidering what they were given.     The only lacking thing in the movie was the dialogue itself. The story was great, but the dialogue seemed forced and incoherent. A lot of useless talk to fill the time between the tense moments, and too much yelling when those moments come.     As I noted the story is really good, it offers a lot of bone chilling scares and understandable, yet unpredictable plot twists. For being in a far off time and place, and dealing with difficult ideas, every thing was clear, and better yet it seemed to run pretty smoothly, rather than choppy like some scary movies can get as they try to move from one tense moment to the next (Any one of the Jason movies, or Children Under the Stairs (Ack! I hate even saying that name!)).    The BEST part of the film seeing as it nearly knocked my socks off, was the technical aspects. Even many of the elements on the Event Horizon seemed to reappear in the Matrix ship, and everything seemed really realistic even though it was the future (unlike Impostor). The sound effects were really great, it is hard to find a movie these days where sound effects are used in a way to enhance the story, rather than just explain it. Like a good cinematography, sound effects can totally enhance the story if they are used correctly. In this movie they are spectacular! They bring the tenseness to a whole new level usually missed in horror movies. Definitely worth seeing if you want to try out that new surround sound system you just bought!      CONCLUSION:  I would see it once, then again after a long while so you can forget the scary parts. Also, without a good surround sound system this film may seem a little lacking, but worth seeing once.",Event Horizon
498,dorshez,A damn good attempt,8,5 February 2010,"This is my first review so please excuse any mistakes or contradictions.I'm a big fan of Sci-fi horrors but I also like it when technical bits and bobs in a film are all right (like terminator keeps screwing up John Conners age according to certain dates etc). This film doesn't exactly use common sense in places and there are plot holes here and there.But if you can ignore that, and just sit back and keep on track of the plot which is easy to do, it's a good film. Sh** scary in places, a good soundtrack, it's squeamish, some interesting angles, and plenty of suspense. It's certainly not a film for those who are really picky with details, but if you're not, and you just want a night of sci-fi horror with popcorn and a pillow, go rent this out.",Event Horizon
499,mhills5,One of the best sci fi films ever made.,10,18 November 2010,"Event Horizon is one of the best horror films ever made, partly because it is so scary and intelligent. The acting is fantastic, and Event Horizon is full of suspense that will definitely have you on the edge of your seat. The atmospheric setting for Event Horizon is done perfectly, and makes the film one of the most scariest films today. Event Horizon is also incredibly entertaining and never gets boring once throughout the whole film. The movie is made in a very clever way that has everything that a horror film needs to be good. One of the things that makes Event Horizon such a good film is the way in which it is so classic. The suspense scenes in the film are done perfectly and scarily and in a classic way that would make Hitchcock proud. I really do not have anything to criticize about Event Horizon, because everything in the film is done perfectly. And Event Horizon is actually scary, with edge of your seat horror that will haunt you for the rest of your life. Event Horizon is a entertaining, suspenseful and very intelligent and imaginative film that is guaranteed not to disappoint.",Event Horizon
500,Elmyras,Scary stuff,8,1 August 2003,"This is possibly the only film I watched in the cinema that made me literally hide behind someone's shoulder. These aren't the typical jump out of your seat scares but more on the psychological side.Sure, the 'dimension of pure evil' aspect is a little corny and the acting at times Hammy but when it comes to the scares, this film delivers right up to the very end.The casting is a bit of a surprise - Sam Neill and Joely Richardson in a sci-fi horror? - not Oscar winning stuff but they give solid performances.
Loses it's edge on repeat viewings but it's enjoyable to watch with someone who hasn't seen it before.Above average but far from perfect. Would be a 7 but an extra mark for frightening me more than any other film - 8/10.",Event Horizon
501,Electrohermit,One of the scariest,10,15 June 2005,"Don't let the critiques slamming this movie, convince you not to watch Event Horizon. That would be a mistake. Read on, and I'll explain this complicated and disturbing film. There is a hint of a spoiler within my comments, but not enough to effect the film viewing for you. I am a professional artist and writer, with a knack for sci-fi, I try to give some room for imagination. Films that are not perfectly produced can still be extremely entertaining, if you get over the rough edges. Now, in Event Horizon there is cliché dialog and visual elements that could have been more finished. Get over that, and you'll watch one of the most disturbing films ever. Could the film have been made better? Yes. Is the film gripping, believable and frightening? Very much so. Another review on this site suggested the story theme was not that original. I'm sorry, that's dead wrong. It's absolutely unique and frankly I found the concept of Hell, that the movie suggests rather realistically disturbing. In this day and age, when tens of thousands of people are reporting near death experiences and scientists are slowly confirming the existence of other quantum dimensions; there could actually be something very horrible that we are not aware of. I'm not a religious person, but obviously consciousness is forever, atoms just bounce around and fade out eventually. Emotions and experience are massless and carry on in the universe forever. Thoughtful entities in the universe, over an infinite amount of time, will eventually congregate together. Natural physics. Now, if the soul is massless and indestructible, where do all the dark beings go? huh. think about that. Wherever they are ""left"" to congregate would be a very disturbing place indeed. Interestingly, the internet is full of accounts of individuals in medical trauma, having NDEs reporting unimaginable realms outside of space-time, with various levels of benevolence and malevolence. And this is exactly what scared the wits out of me watching the movie. Not so much for the fantastic special effects, the gore and the effects are just enough to enter your psyche and wreak havoc. A good example is ""The Exorcist"". Quite a simple concept really. If someone told you a little girl is tied to a bed the whole movie and talking, occasionally feeling nauseas; you would laugh if someone said you'd be tempted to leave the theater in fear. Think, it's not the prop or actors, it's the concept of demons that wiggles under your membranes. Event Horizon is the same concept, and I applaud the writer and Director. If you watch the special features on the DVD, you will hear the Actors describe how the movie set was disturbing and physically draining to work in. The movie has a vibe. Another bone I have to pick with people is their entertainment systems. You simply can not have a sensory experience watching a sci-fi film on a small wimpy TV screen with tin can speakers. There is a threshold for effectiveness. You don't wake up in the morning and drink a teaspoon of coffee and say ""ahh, I feel better now"". It takes a full cup. Period. So you can not drink a good sci-fi film via a tiny TV. It takes a minimum of 40 inches in wide format. You also need stereo with speakers that are at least 6 inches in diameter and can produce good deep bass. With a nice screen you will melt into the scenery, it will surround you. The sounds will crawl up your back and get under your skin. Not everyone can afford a 58inch HDTV projection TV with surround sound, I realize. Just be aware the gear goes hand in hand with the experience. Be fair to your senses and taste. I'm convinced that 70 percent of the time, negative movie experiences are due to a lack of proper gear.",Event Horizon
502,aphexxx,A very good and scary film,9,18 October 2004,"This film has taken the best part from lots of the best horrors, which might not be an original way of going about things but it is done in a very effective way and i see as a good point of the film and something that makes it fun to watch and also truly terrifying. This has to be a must see for horror fans. It was definitely a pleasant surprise for me to find this film and i was left wondering why I hadnt bothered watching it earlier, possibly because of negative or indifferent reviews it received from people who expect to be continually fed legendary-groundbreaking-masterpieces, which is not going to happen. It is very fast paced especially when they actually get to the Event Horizon. Just enjoy, as I did.",Event Horizon

While the plot is fascinating and forces me to think deeper than just the bloody murders, the dated cheesy action that was the norm of the time, makes me chuckle and become emotionally detached.The film is hard to tear away from scene to scene and you'll find that the movie goes by too quickly to satisfy you. And while this movie is not for the ones who become dizzy at the sight of blood, it is a cult classic if i ever saw one. The plot of the movie is so spectacular in my eyes that i would wish to give it a better rating if it were not for the fact that almost all of the action, jump shots, and dialog are all very dated.I will watch this movie time and time again despite this. Because I simply love and adore this movie. And I will always be crossing my fingers for this movie to be remade in the same way that Evil Dead was. I recommend this movie to all horror enthusiasts, and to any who wish to think about a world much darker than our own.",Event Horizon

And it likes it.This is one of my all-time favorite science fiction/horror movies in space.I saw it when it released in the cinema, and as I walked out, somewhat dazed, I decided immediately to buy another ticket, then went back in and sat down for another viewing.Sure, a couple of the lines were a bit on the cheesy side, but only a couple. The acting and effects were spectacular, the environments were creepy as hell, and some of the visuals will stick with you.There's some gore in it, so be ready for that. If that bothers you.Lawrence Fishburne, Sam Neil, and a bunch of other actors you'll recognize lead a rescue mission, after a distress beacon is received from a research vessel that disappeared years before out near the planet Neptune. It was considered at the time of its disappearance to be the worst disaster in the history of space travel at that point.The ship, using an experimental form of travel, has gone beyond the boundaries of our known universe. Maybe to hell itself. And it came back alive.The premise may sound laughable, but this is space horror done right.(Think Amityville Horror meets Hellraiser in space)

508,Friikki,Very frightening... Very gory... Very good...,8,6 September 1999,"I saw this film on video with my friend's place (yet again). The movie like a combination of Alien and Hellraiser, placed in a long lost spaceship called Event Horizon. There's something evil in this ship, and everybody in the crew starts to freak out. the beginning was kind of a ""clische"", with different illusions of the crew. But when when the movie continues, i felt like this was nothing i've seen before in my life!!! And it was more that i expected. The director of the movie, Paul Anderson, wasn't exactly my favourite director (after i saw Mortal Kombat, of course). But Paul got something in his sleeves, that looked like the Wachowski brothers, with this ""spinnig-camera-in-the-space"". That special effect alone was making my stomich mourning. The flick was a little bit of gory, with lots of blood and insides. I never were a gore-fan, but in this movie i watched with pleasure, never even saying ""F*CK!!'n YUCK"". Maybe it was my sadistic side, but the gore somehow fits in the movie well. Overall:Good movie, fun to watch, with nice special effects and camera angles. I you can get on the video, buy it!!!

The only redeeming feature was some nice effects. As for anything else....what a waste of time. I really didn't care about what happened to any of the characters and was overjoyed when it ended.

512,B'Elanna,A poor excuse for a science fiction movie,1,30 May 1999,"Event Horizon has to be one of the poorest excuses for a science fiction or horror movie around. Previews made it seem as if it would be a Aliens type movie. A good mix of horror and science-fiction with a strong cast. What it turned out to be, however, was a bad movie with bad acting, bad script, bad concept and just plain bad everything. It makes Lost In Space look like a good movie. Sam Neill should stick to movies like Jurassic Park and series like Merlin where the sheer brilliance of everyone else lets us forgive him.",Event Horizon
513,marchy,5.3/10 just doesn't do it justice...,8,8 November 2000,"I could follow suit and summarise the plot once again - which, seemingly contrary to the beliefs of most who have seen it, does indeed exist - but it would be pointless. My main feeling on what makes Event Horizon a film of true quality is not only the excellent storyline, highly credible acting and superb special effects, but the impression it leaves on the brain for hours after viewing. If you truly understand what is going on, the film grips you in a vice lock for 90 minutes and, if the environment (i.e. a dark room, late at night!) is right, provides you with genuine shocks and thrills other quite-unquote 'horror movies' such as Scream can't manage. Certainly, there are some very unsettling moments - the subliminal flashes are pretty sickening - but they aren't just thrown at you for the sake of audience reaction, they contribute to the haunting image the film leaves you with, and believe me it does. This is surely displayed in the way that the gore involved in characters' deaths is mainly left to the imagination, that of DJ for example was all the more disturbing for me because of the focus on his facial expression and the sound he makes. The only real blood and guts is flashed up because of brief illumination or a second-long blast of images, which adds to the tremendous intensity. Of course it also has the old-fashioned make-you-jump moments which will seem all the more nerve-wracking if you were as absorbed as I was. And to cap it all, a film with an emotive soundtrack opening with a pounding Orbital track and leaving you with one final shock seconds before Funky S**t by the Prodigy kicks in has to be good.9/10Now I want that Special Edition on R2 DVD.",Event Horizon

Doesn't matter.  Horror films usually startle me, but don't actually scare me.  This one does, so that means it did it's job admirably.The whole thing is beautifully designed and decorated.  The characterizations are good, and don't really provide any comfort.  Nothing about any of these people says ""Hero who will succeed and save the rest of the world,"" which just adds to the tension.It's not the smartest film I ever saw, but since I respect it's emotional impact, this film gets a ten from me.",Event Horizon

I just popped it in, and was surprised how bad it was. Why did they cast Laurence Fishburne in this movie. He was terrible in it. He's a black man who acted White the entire movie. I've never seen a black man act so stuck up in a movie before. Sam Neill's character didn't even make sense to me. He's supposed to the bad guy, but what exactly made him go crazy? We never get to know. Things aren't explained how they should be. Event Horizon seemed to be a hacked mess. It kinda reminded me of a new outer limits episode.

The only fluke with the film is with Justin, he would have ""decompressed/incenerated"" instantly, but I guess that wasn't in the script.

This movie is excellent; well, at least those who prefer the genre(s)(horror and/or sci-fi). For all those who keep saying it is ""un-original"", how do you come to this assertion? I can think of no other ""ghost"" movie based in deep space on an ""abandoned"" ship. I basically think of it as a ""haunted house in outer space"". The ship itself was original enough - it creates a black hole within itself and travels through it. Not sure if astro-physics works that way, but who cares, it's a frickin' movie people!!!! The gore and scares are not too over the top and do enough to scare some. My only wish is that we got to see Paul Anderson's true cut of the film before the studio got involved. This movie and Alien 3 (another masterpiece!!) deserve to be re-released as full blown director's cuts.

I don't think I have EVER sat down to watch a scary movie and been upset that it was...scary.

The acting is superb, the atmosphere is really uncomfortable, it's well paced and some of the cuts are genuinely disturbing. And it manages all of this without an actual monster or alien as such. A complaint about this film is its lack of originality, but I feel it should be viewed as an excellent blend of different ideas that should be put together and with no doubt works. There's often a comparison with Alien but I prefer this as it leaves a lot more to the imagination, which can be a dark place. 10/10 for me, any bad reviews must be pretentious fools who decided they didn't want to like it before they even switched it on and let their nit picking ruin their enjoyment of a good little watch.",Event Horizon

What gets me most is that anyone I mention this film to says how scary it is. Is this the problem with mainstream success? Can a film hit the mark to much.

Many film viewers see the future as being more akin to a Star Trek-like existence, with humanity achieving an almost Utopian society and venturing to the stars unified and harmoniously, and quite boringly. This film dares say, ""Not so fast. It is scary out there."" The concept of ""inferno ex Astra"" is a literary and cinematic road not taken as often as it should be. I took from this film the idea that humanity is still young and inexperienced, and playing dice with the greatest force of nature (singularities) could lead to horrors unimagined before. Far from a perfect film, Event Horizon should still be lauded for its daring as well as the brilliant performances of the heroic Fishbourne and the deliciously evil Neil.

This movie helped me burn some time I had left to spare, but nothing more. The characters throughout the film didn't make me love nor hate them. It didn't create any kind of feelings for me at all.Overall, the acting was good. The special effects were good (considering this film was made in 1997). The plot was good. But therein lay the problem: everything was just good and nothing more. However, what did impress me was the amount of gore towards the end of the movie. I didn't expect to see someone gouge his eyes off. Neither did I imagine seeing a corpse hanging from the walls from hooks with his guts spilled over the floor. (It wasn't actually that bad, I was just not expecting this kind of violence.)Sometimes Paul Anderson went a little over the top with some scenes, but nothing worth mentioning. Don't get me wrong, ""Event Horizon"" is a good movie and it is worth watching, but it will never stand out, at least for me. With that said, I give this movie a 7/10 (even with all those cheesy lines).",Event Horizon
533,ronski68,Great premise..poor delivery!,6,15 May 2006,"I always think about H.P. Lovecraft whenever viewing movies mixing the genres of horror and sci-fi. I'm not saying that this movie is based on or directly influenced by a Loveraftian tale. However, I'm sure that H.P.L. would have been entertained. Event Horizon begins by offering a chilling and creative premise: A space ship capable of warping space returns after missing for several years and is adrift within the orbit of Neptune. A science team is sent to search for any survivors and investigate the situation of the ship's disappearance. The team discovers that the shipped warped into a dimension of pure evil and went insane; eventually killing themselves in the process. However, what the team is late in discovering is that the ship itself has become haunted (possessed) and is attempting to murder the rescue team members. Viewer questions arise: Has the ship become an sentient evil entity, or are the possessions and poltergeists caused by residual spiritual energies?This creative premise had me intrigued. The movie essentially becomes an orbiting haunted house. What a concept! Unfortunately, the promise of a great ghost story is lost on unoriginal elements. The spooky events used to convey the plot become tired and clichéd. Visual hallucinations, sudden sounds of slamming doors, and laughing ghost children (overused in most horror movies of the late 90's) are meant to convey the atmosphere of a haunting, but fall flat.A better directorial approach should have included each member of the team offering different arguments on the causes of the haunting, bringing in a science-verses-the-world-of-the-spiritual theme. A Lovecraftian blend of the spiritual and hard science would have made this movie more thought provoking and encourage intense conversations among the viewers. This movie is an example of how many of today's directors are incompetent in utilizing sound and visual imagery to convey a creepy atmosphere. A study of ""Legend of Hell House"", Kubrick's ""Shinning"", or Val Lewton's ""I Walked with a Zombie"" would have assisted the director in forming an appropriate atmosphere for this movie. In summary..Event Horizon offers a great horror premise, but the cinematic events fail to carry it through.",Event Horizon
534,betafett-176-53500,"Okay movie, but owes huge debt to better film makers",6,18 April 2015,"Paul WS Anderson has never been shy of inviting people to compare his work (unworthily) to Ridley Scott and James Cameron's time and time again, but Event Horizon, whilst starting off with an unashamedly barefaced 'homage' to Alien's blue collar vibe, owes more to John Carpenter than anyone else. Admittedly Anderson telegraphs this from the opening expositional text, which, like Carpenter's seminal Escape from New York, ends with the year it's set in before declaring that its future setting is actually (a very meta) NOW (something Neil Marshall would repeat in his EfNY/Carpenter homage, Doomsday). The whole flick could be summed up as '2010: Odyssey 2 meets Prince of Darkness' with a little Stanley Kubrick touch added here or there. So, no points for originality then, as Anderson begins his lifelong career choice of associating himself with better and more successful directors. But, despite all this, the movie isn't the train wreck it perhaps deserved to be. Most of the actors throw themselves into their (underdeveloped) roles and, aside from some wooden dialogue and ham-fisted exposition, do a mostly decent job. The special FX are passable, again apart from some ropey effects of liquid suspended in zero gravity. There's a few decent jump scares and a foreboding atmosphere actually more subtle than you would really expect from Anderson. Make up and gore effects were decent too. I'm not a fan of Anderson, and have resisted watching Event Horizon for years, despite repeated recommendations,. But having watched it now, I can happily say I found it his most watchable flick, even though as I write this it's now 18 years old. Is it great? No. Terrible? No. Slightly above average? Yeah, that's fair. But I suppose your work will be elevated too when you stand on the shoulders of giants.",Event Horizon
535,dgfellow24,Underrated,7,24 February 2021,"I am not going to say Event Horizon is a great movie because it isn't. But to have a meta critic score of 35 is ridiculous! Sam Neill gives such an incredibly diabolical performance in this it just carries the movie from a certain point. He starts out as kind of a mild mannered scientist who accompanies the military to investigate a disaster on a faraway space station ship. Larry Fishburne is the officer in charge and he smells a rat from the get go and turns out to be right. I would rank Neil's performance in this right up there with Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, Anthony Hopkins, etc. He is the personification of evil and the movie becomes scary towards the end which really is all you can ask for from a good horror movie. 7 /10 .",Event Horizon

If on the other hand, you are someone who enjoys space and all its mystery but has a dark and twisted side... step right up. This movie is certainly underrated when it comes to creativity, that much is for sure. The entire concept of the movie is quite the unique take on space, and more specifically black holes/event horizons. The characters are created quite appropriately for a film like this, and the acting is solid enough to keep your attention. The twisted concepts and slight gore really add to the beauty that is Event Horizon.

The plot is fairly original, and the characters are deep with their own past, not just typical horror movie fodder. Fot a comparatively low budget the special effects are awesome and innovative, particularly the design of the Event Horizon itself.

The acting wasn't terribly good (and in the case of the fellow who ends up traumatized, downright terrible), one of the two major plot elements was extremely predictable (but the other was quite unique), and there was an explicit nude scene that seemed like it was thrown in there just for the sake of throwing it in there.

In fact, other than Batman & Robin, no other movie has made me want to go to the box office and demand a refund.I cannot imagine that anyone would want to see this movie a second time, much less own it on video or DVD.

The suspense was non-stop and the acting was fine. And for being original: Find me one idea that is. Everybody borrows ideas from other sources. Scream was so unscary it wasn't funny. It had a good plot twist but nothing else. Aliens is an action film with big bugs in it. I don't like the Hellraiser movies really and some of them outright sucked.

My expectations were high....Oh dear. I actually forgot to be scared, it was replaced with disbelief, and finally total boredom. In the so-called terrifying ending scenes I yawned and tried not to fall asleep. Reason? This movie used every horror-film cliche known to human-kind!WARNING! A TINY SPOILER OR TWO HAS BEEN LOCATED ON THE HORIZON! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE!!This whole flick is based loosely on something to do with worm hole travel (to Hell, apparently) and is really a haunted house story set on a space ship. A group of scientists try to find out why their brand-spanking-new space ship goes belly-up and vanishes off the face of the universe then reappears some 5-or-20 years later minus its crew. It has brought back a bad evil ghost instead....While far from original, it does boast some nice computer effects. This is then completely ruined by silliness of the juvenile kind. We have space ship interiors that look like torture chambers, people floating around in space with no space suits on and not imploding (golly gee!), mundane acting by the cast, and the most awful cliches e.g. blood spewing down corridors - oh, puh-lease!!! And the ending was particularly cliched.A few gruesome, bloody scenes are thrown in for lets-shock-the-audience-before-they-fall-asleep measure and some pointless running around in dark corridors from a evil space ship mind. The plot was wafer thin and riddled with holes (cheesy ones!)and I got the impression the cast were uninterested and bored with their roles.

This really is a sad state of affairs and says a lot about the film industry today. This film is not great but is highly suspenseful and there is some good acting.

Also, I want to note how similar this film is to Netflix's The Cloverfield Paradox, not in concept, but in structure and tone.

It tries to be both subtle and direct, but it ends up as being too direct and too over-the-top (too much unnecessary gore). It somehow tries to merge religious and scientific ideas, but it does not finish the job. The ideas presented are too blunt, too rough to fully understand and swallow. Too much Clive Barker and too little Lovecraft, if you know what i mean.So what is the result? A have baked film, with a lot of gore, a couple of scary moments, a wide range of scientific and religious ideas (taken from horror writers) that don't mix very well, which starts out excellent but ends up as being over-the-top, and concluded with a weird ending.It's not a bad film, it will entertain, but it feels like it could have been so much more.",Event Horizon

But lets say the thruth; this film is very well made (the special effects are fantastic, the film editing is very cool too (see the hell flashes), the music is well done, and the horror is graphic and mental).The idea is awesome, the plot so-so, but it creates really moments when you get p***ed in your pants (specially the air vent scene). The cast is good too, and it has two of my favourite actors; Sam Neill and Jason isaacs.So trust me, its a great movie, but be mentalized that you'll see very gory and bloody scenes, so DO NOT SEE THIS IF URE A LOW-STOMACH GUY OR A KID (well if u are a very brave kid, ok), but it deserves a 9/10",Event Horizon

Needless to say, a crew is sent to find out where the ship had gone for all that time and save the ship if they can.The crew (led by Laurence Fishburne) travel that distance with Sam Neill who was the creator of the engine. They of course board the vessel, find themselves unable to escape and start dying, one-by-one.Even though the story and plot are formulaic at best there are very frightening moments with a cast outshining themselves, Sam Neill brilliant (especially if you watch this after seeing another brilliant film with him in The Dish)and unknowns abound outperforming other actors tipped for brilliance by reviewers (Ben Affleck for instance, poor in all the films I have seen him in).The atmosphere, in a dark and small room oozes out of the wood work, the directing brilliant, the camera does not stay too long on any given object allowing boredom to ensue.Overall, Marvellous film, probably fun to make, undeserved of all the slagging off by unimaginative reviewers.

But I watched this movie with expectations of deep space, sci-ency stuff and except the first 20 or so minutes it is really annoying in that aspect. It could be because I watched it really late, in 2016(yeah, my first movie of '16), after having watched interstellar, 2001, martian, contact, this was really disappointing as far as that genre is concerned. Hell, I liked Alien when I saw it('97), but I really don't think I'll enjoy it now, so yeah, it's probably that.

The first scene where Justin goes into the core reminded me a lot of ""Sphere"". In fact, the whole setup reminded me a lot of ""Sphere"", which might be why I liked it so much. The whole bit about the ship being able to fold space and create a gateway to travel through was totally believable. But all these shenanagins about it being able to jump dimensions? What is that about? And what made Wier ""merge"" with the ship, suddenly wanting what the ship wanted instead of saving the lives of his crewmates? He tears out his eyes and suddenly he wants what the ship wants, and somehow has super-human strength, able to pick up bodies and toss them like rag dolls? And what made the ship come back from ""hell"" in the first place? Did it just get bored after seven years and wanted to ruin more lives? The term ""from hell"" or anything like that has gotten so increasingly cliché that it becomes stupid. Granted, all the quick flashes of the people being tortured are pretty freaky, but they're just flashes, and thus limit their level of freakiness. The acting was strong, even though the plot got out of hand at the end. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill do a great job, and it is somewhat interesting to see Sam Neill in an antagonist role. It was also entertaining for me, a huge Harry Potter fan, to see Jason Isaacs (aka Lucius Malfoy) in a completely different role. All in all, I'd give it 6/10.",Event Horizon

However, I have forced myself to watch a few classics over the years Silence of the Lambs, Nightmare on Elm Street and Hell Raiser (regreted them all at the time, but glad I watched them in hindsight). The plot for Event Horizon appealed so I gave it a go. I wasn't disappointed. It's a great film and deserving of a much higher rating than it gets here. Sam Neil turns in an excellent performance as he descends into madness, taking you with him. In the version I saw, possibly cut, there is some gore, but like all great horror films it is your imagination that does a lot of the work.",Event Horizon
572,airship422,haunted house on a spaceship,2,24 December 2011,"There are two main problems I have with Event Horizon. First, the unbelievable storyline and characters. Second, the lack of originality and taking ideas from other famous sci-fi movies.The movie is based on a story that a trans dimensional spaceship returns after having gone missing for 7 years. The ""Event Horizon"" which has a black hole engine, folds ""space"" so that it can travel faster than light. A rag-tag group of swearing, smoking and brawling space ""soldiers"", accompanied by the delicate mad scientist who invented the ungodly missing ship go on a reconnaissance mission. Basically, the doctor goes berserk on the ship, and people start going mad, tearing out their eyes and so on. The ship, it is suggested, has most likely travelled to trans-dimensional hell. The ships crew is seen in the video log consuming itself while the captain offers a monologue in Latin while holding his extracted eyeballs.Event Horizon liberally steals ideas from superior sci-fi films. The grungy space cowboy themes from alien, and the cerebral psychological aspects of Solaris. The film degenerates to lots of running through cryptically Gothic space ship corridors, and self-immolation. Finally there is some large explosion after most of the actors have died.",Event Horizon

On the upside, if you want to take revenge from someone or if you're simply one of those people who derive pleasure from others' suffering ( which the makers of the movie certainly are), go ahead and recommend this movie to someone.

575,joemck92,Awful. **possible spoiler**,3,10 June 2012,"Recently, I've been having a huge Sci-fi movie marathon and last night I watched this one. I decided to watch it as the game, Dead Space is known for taking some of the characteristics from this movie and implementing them into the game. However, there is a long list of things I hated about this movie, but at the top must be the poor acting. For example, (for people who've seen the movie) the scene where Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) has a nightmare in Stasis is laughable. Literally laughable. To add to that Sam Neill really doesn't suit being a ""baddy"". I really can't see him having a bad bone in his body. Like a cool uncle... who saves you from Dinosaurs. What I did like about the movie, is basically everything that Dead Space took from it. The effects the ship has on its inhabitants and the way the some characters go insane makes the movie bearable. Another aspect of the movie I liked was the sense of being alone, millions of miles from Earth, and I feel this movie did do this well. 3 out of 10, pretty poor, some good scenes I guess... and loved how a black guy survived :D",Event Horizon

The latter is a keyword here, although it is not like modern post-modern we get bombed with lately, it concerns more sci-fi content of the film, while it's literally packed with common ideas from sci-fi literature and almost every frame is reminiscent to other sci-fi classics. And this is not a rip-off, it's really intelligent script writing, so that a fan of classical American sci-fi literature of 50's-70's feels himself in this movie like in the very comfortable and familiar world.

577,yowchunfat,Great Movie Ruined By Silly Ending ***SPOILERS***,7,7 May 2010,"Paul Anderson certainly wont be mistaken for a virtuoso filmmaker any time soon, particularly if his work on 'AVP', 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Resident Evil' is anything to go by, but for one brief moment in the late 90's, he was on the verge of creating a genuine psycho-horror masterpiece. And then Evil Paul took over again and ruined everything about twenty minutes from the finish line.The plot is thus: In the year 2047(which suddenly doesn't seem quite as far away as it probably did in 1997), Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill lead a salvage operation into Neptune space to investigate the sudden re-appearance of the starship 'Event Horizon'. The ship had disappeared without a trace seven years prior during a complicated light-speed travel experiment, and it's the crew's job to rescue any survivors, salvage the ship and figure out what the hell went wrong.Needless to say, the ship has been somewhere horrifying and has brought back something, well, let's just say it's not very nice. But it's also not what you'd expect - There's no acid dribbling alien killer here, in its place a tense, claustrophobic nightmare that truly defies description. In fact, it's that good that it reminds you of something Clive Barker or John Carpenter could have conceived.So for the majority of its running time, 'Event Horizon' manages to be a genuinely frightening and surprisingly innovative sci-fi/horror show that is not only well written, but extremely well acted as well. The characters, the set-design, the extremely creepy central concept of an otherworldly hell dimension accessed through a black hole, are all excellent. And then suddenly Anderson loses the plot, and gurgles out possibly the silliest and most cringe-worthy finale since Denzel Washington impaled John Lithgow on the electric tower in 'Ricochet'.If you don't want to know what happens, stop reading now. If you'd rather save yourself the torture of watching it, then Sam Neill suddenly tears his own eyes out and morphs into Pinhead from Hellraiser, the token comedic-relief-black-dude propels himself through space by dumping his oxygen tanks (yeah right) whilst delivering his best Eddie Murphy impression, and Morpheus (sorry, L. Fish) blows up the ship (much to the behest of Pinhead), looking as though even he realises how stupid this film has become and is glad to put an end to the madness.Anderson could have had a classic on his hands here, but unfortunately his 'Resident Evil' side got the better of him in the latter stages of the film. That said, the rest of it has proved to be good enough to earn him a respected cult favourite, but one can only help but wonder what might have been if he had have exercised a little restraint in penning the finale. 7/10.",Event Horizon

It seems that what Anderson tried to create here is a Kubrick type film somewhere between ""The Shinning"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey"". What it turns into is at best a ""B"" movie with a lot of blood, gore and splatter which are a bad diversion from the screenplay and the script which are at times absolutely woeful. The acting is OK to very good considering how bad the script is in places. Lawrence Fishburn does an excellent job but then again he is in my opinion very underrated as an actor. I think Anderson really blew an opportunity here to create a great movie with sequel potential.

Story about a lost ship and a technology to challenge space-time fabric by fabricating its own black hole should definitely look interesting for a SciFi movie plot, however, as the story evolves you start getting that bad impression that you were deceived. Suddenly you are struck by the terrible truth: this is just a pseudo-science fiction movie with an horrible plot that looks like a bad hellraiser imitation.

This movie, as I said before, is not art. It doesn't want to be, I think.  At least it doesn't go for pretension to fool people into thinking the movie has far reaching poetic ideas.  But it is entertaining, to me.  That is, mainly because the film exhibits a certain Gothic atmosphere I like. Not that it's terribly original in that (or anything else for that matter), but its gothic sense is pushed into overdrive later in the film, expresses some simple, not too challenging but interesting ideas, gives you an action climax which is loathable for it being an action climax, but entertaining in its setup and execution, interesting designs (I like how the ship is shaped like a cross) and some extreme imagery and style.  Where the film excels, in my opinion, is its excessiveness.  It pushes the gore and horror over the edge beyond what you would have first imagined, and gives you genuine terror with this concept and showing you in a somewhat restrained manner, how it is.  This energy is good enough for me to enjoy the film without necessarily calling it a good film.",Event Horizon

This movie was actually pretty scary. Some of the scenes gave me the willies. I will admit that other scenes were indeed quite unoriginal. For instance, how many times have we seen the grieving mother or husband follow the obvious illusion of their lost loved one to their doom? Message to the filmmakers: This is a scene that doesn't work anymore- It's L-A-M-E.But all in all, I wasn't disappointed at all. I expected to be, so maybe that had some bearing on the outcome.

Then I got the Laserdisc from America, again with Dolby Digital, and cannot change my opinion that this is one of the coolest movies made in 1997.  The acting was great, nods going to Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs and Especially Sean Pertwee, the direction was pacy and smart, and the design of the film - from the FX to the sound - was exemplary.  The music was cool, especially the Orbital scetions, and even though the plot is somewhat routine, the way the film was done was fantastic.  It could have been another stupid alien intelligence flick - see Sphere - but instead chose to not really explain itself and be all the more frightning.  Like Billy Loomis said - ""It's much scarier when there's no motive"".Classy film, all round.  Oh, and to Jim and Isobel of Mutley Plain, back in Plymouth, who trashed my review in Scene magazine, I was right and you were wrong about this film, I certainly don't owe you £8.60, and expect to see these same words on a cinema screen in a few years when my first film comes out.

All I can think of saying is that it's crap.  I leave more eloquent comments to those better-qualified critics whose articles you can read on this database  but amazingly enough if you read through them you will even find some neutral, or even positive criticisms.  Some things I just don't understand.What I'd like to say, then, is that I'm utterly disgusted that such a movie can fall under the genre of ""Science Fiction"".  Why?  If it happens in space and you throw in a few mysterious phrases like ""another dimension"" and ""outside the universe"" does it automatically qualify?   Nowadays such stock phrases seem to me to be just a licence to let anything happen, regardless of plotline or logic.  If you don't understand what ""focussing gravitons"" means, I'll tell you.  It means that a lot of nonsensical stuff is going to happen later on in the movie, which one is meant to accept because when you ""focus gravitons"", anything is possible, really.

The special effects were great.A lot of people complain that the first three quarters is great and the last bit is bad simply because they reveal too much of what's going on and there's no more mystery. Let's look at it this way: people have to realize that the movie makers are trying to sum up the movie at this point. If they didn't, we'd complain more that we didn't get to find out what was going on. If you don't like gore or mind tricks, don't watch the movie. But if you want to, go in expecting a fun ride, not 'art'.For me the movie was gripping the whole way through! What really made the movie is I came out of it immediately wanting to go back in and watch it again. It was fun. What else should a movie be aside from trying to make a point--and who went to the movie expecting it to make a point about society? Basically people got what they wanted, or they didn't have fun in the movie. Either way, it was a good movie, just that some people had fun and some didn't! The only complaint I had was subpar acting from Jack Noseworthy, who is usually quite good.And you never know who'll come out at the end until the last few minutes. This movie was complete with a final showdown.It's basically The Shining crossed with outer space. That's my description of it. Rent it. It's not a new release; it'll cost you about $3.

There are several explosions (one in zero gravity, A must see!!), excellent made gore scenes, made in the good old 'The Shining' way with short 'shocks', and PERFECT audio, both in the speech, the soundtrack and the soundfx.I recommend this movie to ALL, well perhaps not to the ones who get scared when watching 'Goosebumps', but how many is that?I voted for this movie and gave it 10, the only thing I dislike about it, is that the intro sequence (directed by... written by...) isn't very interresting the third time you see it ;)Rent it, or even better, buy it now.

You can watch it again and again and it will STILL creep you out, like every good horror/science fiction film should.  The plot is great, the acting is amazing, and you never look at saying ""I would have done this different."" Altogether, a wonderful film that never got the respect it deserved.",Event Horizon

I personally loved it so much, I made a website about it. There aren't many errors, and for those of you who've listed Justin not dying immediately when he leaves the ship as one, sorry, people can survive in a vacuum for short periods of time.

613,sermon,What could have been a gothic novel turned out to be a gorefest,5,20 August 2000,"I was very interested in this movie when I heard about it. A classical ""Gothic novel Haunted House""-tale being transferred to a science fiction background with an empty, haunted spaceship - that sounded quite interesting and new. This movie could have been one of the best Science Fiction movies of all times - if it would have been done right. It started out quite good - the crew finding the ship and going aboard, but then the whole movie turned from a psychological, creepy and atmospheric film into a gorefest. When will Hollywood directors learn that real thrills are not produced by blood and gore, but by the things you DON'T see. A sound, a pounding, camera angles, music - THAT is what makes me shiver, the old ""to thrill is not to show"" recipe that leaves room for imagination, not the straight into the face thing with guts flying around. I really expected this movie to be a classical gothic novel-kind-of-thing in the tradition of movies like ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" (1963 version of course) or ""The Innocents"" (also the black/white version) but it turned out to be a cheap and gory movie in the tradition of  ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". It's a pity - the subject REALLY had a huge potential . . .",Event Horizon

It is an anti-drug movie but it may be hard for non-drug users to understand this (the same goes for The Beach). Thats why it is filled with all that gore, it is supposed to be a metaphor for a bad trip. The most obvious anti drug statement is the message the crew finds that is in latin. If you like sci-fi-movies with an anti drug statement, then this movie is for you. If not, don't bother.",Event Horizon

Fishburne and Neill need to read the scripts they receive before they except roles in crap like this! This gets a lowly 1 in my book.",Event Horizon
616,maoraw,Way better than Alien and similar movies,8,31 July 2020,"I am baffled by how many call themselves ""true horror fans"" and then proceed to call Alien a better movie than Event Horizon. I could go on ages about how Alien is a pitiable excuse for horror, and how I laughed all the way through it, but this review is about Event Horizon, I will draw some parallels as Event Horizon has obviously been inspired by Alien. Event Horizon may have taken the base premise of Alien, but instead of making it about a laughable ""monster"" with a crew that is somehow too stupid to navigate situations they should be trained for, Event Horizon is clever and surrounding a crew that you get to know just enough so you will feel a sense of care and understanding for them. This is part of the suspense, that movies like Alien failed to do (crew members in Alien are rude and only Ripley is somewhat intelligent, yet stupid enough to go save a cat. In space. For today's standards, Event Horizon holds up but all Alien has is nostalgic and comedic value.)Now I'll admit, Event Horizon does have its cheese moments, such as the wacky sound effect when Miller is thrown towards the wall in Event Horizon, and the entire fight with Weir. Part of the story with Weir could be explored more, most of the characters are somewhat relatable.One scene I really appreciate is the face of pain and sorrow Smith make right before the bomb detonates and he realises he will die. That is impressive acting.People complain about the gore, calling it too much. I would say it's just enough to get the point across and leaving enough to be up to the viewer. It's disgusting and horrifying enough to leave you up at night.I can't help but question the intelligence of people who prefer horror with bad CGI monsters such as alien, over masterpieces such as Event Horizon and Sunshine that relies much more on the psychological aspects. The greatest horror of all is the human psyche. No CGI alien or monster could ever hold up to how scary humans can be, and that's what makes this movie far superior to similar movies of its time.Worth noting is also the major sacrifice Miller makes at the end. Not only killing himself but sending himself to a Hell dimension to save his crew.",Event Horizon
617,pablolamprea,What to expect,8,20 April 2006,"Excellent movie. Sure, it has its glitches, but it does a great job at scaring the beejezus out of you. The music is outstanding, with frantic beats and trumpets filled with angst. The effects are excellent, and the make-up is quite convincing. The only thing that you could say doesn't click quite right is the plot, but it does hold more in is more believable than your standard horror movie. The tension is held throughout the whole movie, and it provides decent plot twists. In the aspect of acting, the cast does a decent job at characterizing the different personalities of the crew. The only one that fails is Laurence Fishburne, who looks ""bored"" where a normal person would be screaming histerically in horror. But it doesn't distract that much. Special note for Sam Neill's performance, which is a very convincing portrait of his role. Also noteworthy, the music by Michael Kamen and electronic-gurus Orbital. Is an excellent mixxture of two very good genres, capable of scaring the crap out of you by itself. I'm listening at it on headphones now and I've jumped in my chair 4 times, in 2 songs. Is a must see for fiction and terror fans alike",Event Horizon

It seems like a lot of people tends to trash the movie because of the its director rather than the movie itself, which is sad. But a lot of people trash the movie because they see it as a Alien ripoff. I know I am stepping on peoples toes now, but if you see that connection, perhaps there is a reason why you are hanging around here writing reviews with your own point system DESPITE THE TEN GRADE SCALE AVAILABLE, instead of doing it as a profession. Basically you mean, that just because Alien happened to take place in space, all post-space science-fiction movies is a ripoff on that. Like saying that just because Apocalypse Now took place in Vietnam, all subsequent Vietnamn movies are meager plagiarism.Well, Event Horizon is in its core, a movie in its way is very primitive; it focus on the lowest of our instincts, survival, and does it very well. Throuhgout the entire movie you have this sense of an evil presence and the subliminal horror really flips over to a crescendo in the end nicely.

It gets a 4 / 10 from me because of the decent individual acting performances and the relatively high production values (aside from the video compositing).Check it out if you're really into gore, Sam Neil, or Laurence Fishburne but don't expect much suspense in the way of Alien from this space slasher flick.",Event Horizon

Event Horizon was one of those films that made a huge willing-suspension-of-disbelief jump during its trailer to be able to tell a story of what it truly might be like at the other end of the universe.The cast performances (led by Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill) were outstanding with no weak acting that I can speak of. The characters themselves were intriguing as each crew member was in essence fallible yet competent.The dark theme and raw evil created in all aspects throughout the movie (the score, the characters, sharp images, lighting) added a scared 's***tless' viewing experience.I often wonder if the perception of this movie hurt its ratings.

I can't believe that such people, those being top of the line astronauts would have been so stupid as to continue to be taken in by the entity that is now occupying the ship. However the most frustrating thing of all is how much it borrows (and I use that term lightly) from the first two Alien movies. Almost damn right plagiarism in terms of scenes. The familiarity is so blatantly obvious that I'm surprised there wasn't a legal case put forward by the 'Alien' franchise. Even some of the lines are close to the Alien scripts. Characters are generally unconvincing and lack originality. It always amazes me how Hollywood can put a crew together on a space ship that after 5 minutes falls into undisciplined chaos.

A team of salvage and rescue experts make contact and try to determine where the craft has been all these years.That's as good as it gets, folks.  The premise.

The actors play their parts convincingly and there is not an abundance of gore, it is subtle and only in flashes of a few seconds - long enough so you know its there, but not long enough to make out exactly what it is - which works well and adds to the quality of the film.. the sets are genuinely unnerving and even if the Event Horizon was 'normal' you wouldn't want to be walking the corridors alone.I was a little disappointed with the end, it would have been much better if the very last scene had been cut - It would have left it more open (in a better way that the current cut does)..All-in-all an outstanding effort by Anderson and hopefully a directors cut will be released!",Event Horizon

I don't need to build a complete sentence with a name like that. He really is a great actor. On the rewatchable scale I think Event Horizon comes near the top.

When I heard that, I had to immediately watch this movie. Oh boy ....Let me start off by saying, this movie was not as scary as Dead Space. NOT EVEN CLOSE. The movie itself wasn't even scary period. I was disappointed to find out that there really wasn't some sort of life form on the ship like the necromorphs in Dead Space. It was all psychological type stuff the members that boarded Event Horizon experienced. And hey, lets not forget to add the funny black guy .... *sigh* I am so mad at the lack of good sci-fi horror movies, especially deep space. Pandorum was trash and Splice ... I guess the sex scene made it laughable. Obviously Alien is the king, and how long can I live watching those? James Cameron needs to get back in there.

I'm sure if you brake it down in mini-parts the film isn't very good, but a film is made to been seen as whole.

The gore in Event Horizon isn't such a big part.. well there IS gore but it's not the ground for the movie, just a supplement.

It has huge plot holes and an annoying tendency to take the viewer right to the water but just not let you drink any, if you catch my drift. Referring to another reviewer's comments, yes the Event Horizon does look very foreboding and ugly - that my friend is the idea, it helps create atmosphere. The movie does deliver plenty of shocks, especially the 'Hell Scene' which is quite disturbing in all its glory. All in all its a fun ride, just not perfect by any means but it could have been a hell of alot worse, I just wish Paul Anderson had spent a little more time explaining or trying to explain where the Event Horizon had been and what exactly had happened on board, more depth would have been very welcome.

The characters and dialogue were hammy as hell and had me constantly cringing. The whole 'where did the Event Horizon go' idea was intriguing but woefuly unexplored, not I don't think because the writer wanted an air of enigma and mystery, but rather because they clearly could not be bothered to come up with anything beyond a vague premise to attach some special effects to.

A ship, a spaceship, that went far, so far to reach... to reach the hell, or a crazy dimension in which your fear becomes reality, dead comes back to life, and people go nuts.

646,benedict-m-holland,Cheesy and uninteresting.,2,16 June 2014,"This wasn't a terrible film as far as movies go. I love SciFi and I don't mind SciFi horror but this movie just was not that great. The plot is that a crew is sent off to check out a ship which magically came back from who knows where. Hilarity ensues. As it turns out the ship is, for lack of a better word, haunted. The old crew is dead and now the ship wants a new crew which it is finding in the people sent to investigate. The CG might have been decent at the time but come off as cheesy. There is a distinctive claymation scene, or possibly terrible CG scene, which had me cracking up. There is gore. Lots and lots of gore. The creepiest parts don't show the ultra violence which is more or less a blessing since that sort of thing just creeps me out and is more or less unnecessary. The gore is not too memorable as far as it goes but a few scenes should have you at least surprised that they managed to use that much ketchup. --So here is where it falls flat and this is the spoilers section.-- Everything scary happens in extremely predictable ways. When someone goes off alone (despite being on a haunted ghost ship with literally the entire old crew dead by murdering themselves) that is when it gets spooky, every single time. It is so formulaic as to be funny. ""Oh, there goes another character running off after something."" and BAM... the ship essentially kills or terrifies the crew member AGAIN. My favorite line was ""What HAPPENED to your EYES!?"" ""Where we're going, you won't need eyes to see."" and apparently they were going to ""hell"" which you never actually saw. Funny but not all that scary. By the time the 3rd crew member was running off alone after having 2 other dead crew members I started to pretend that they were really going out to Michaels to pick up some crafts to make the ship happy. As it turns out the ship became corrupted on the trip to ""hell"". There wasn't even an AI to corrupt, it was just the physical ship that was corrupted. I didn't know that was even possible, even in SciFi but it is or was and the ship is now trying to murder everyone on board but somehow failing miserably. Actually this was something I didn't understand. If the ship was actually sentient and wanted to murder the whole crew just open an airlock. If the ship wasn't sentient and just horrible things continued to happen to the crew, how come there bodies are not impaled on all of the wonderfully placed locations... you know... by accident? It seemed like the ship wanted to just punish the crew without killing them by killing them in new and profound ways. By the time the ultra scary part happens where they start flashing creepy or scary things at you rapidly I lost all interest in the movie. I suppose that the flashing of creepy things SHOULD scare people but by that point, you have already seen a few scenes from ""Silence of the Lambs"" so the rapid maggot scenes really fell flat. I will give it props for having a woman and a Black man survive at the end. That was honestly most unexpected since I sat back waiting for each person to be knocked off in turn and really just expected the whole new crew to die screaming. If you find this scary, then you are not use to SciFi in this particular genre or you are shocked by formulaic horror. The dialogue is terrible. The gore is semi-realistic in parts but not really when it counted. I still wonder where all that blood came from which flooded the bit of the ship at the end. Also... see ""The Shining"" for that particular scene. It just felt like it was ripping off other GREAT movies and left me waiting for it to just end.",Event Horizon

What I will say is I seen this movie when it came out in 1997, and it was definitely the scariest movie I have ever seen. Throughout the years whenever I would run into a discussion of horror movies with people I always brought up event horizon and people fall into two categories, either they agreed with me as being the scariest movie of all time, or they hated it ... no in between.The premise of the movie is simple. In the distant future a space ship goes missing in the far reaches of our solar system mysteriously returning a few years later without its crew. A team of marines are send to Neptune to find out what happened to the ship and crew.The special effects are pretty good, the ambiance/mood is dark and eerie, and the cast ... wow, I think they did an amazing job, with Laurence Fishburne how can you lose.If your a sci-fi fan and/or a horror movie fan, this movie is definitely for you.

650,alexwstg,An underated movie,7,22 August 2018,"This is a very good film with some creative and terrifying ideas. They try creating a space-time portal to instantly travel to places light years away, but instead they create a portal to hell. Great performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Neil.My main criticism lacks to their lack of military preparedness. A ship goes missing in mysterious circumstances, no crew alive, and they just get on board with flashlights and life scanners? And I was criticising the attacks squad in Aliens for the lack of Green Berrets style organisation! At least they had guns! Not that weapons would have saved anyone on the Event Horizon ship anyhow... Well worth a watch.",Event Horizon
651,fields4532,Creepy and Entertaining,9,28 April 2006,"A movie with mixed feeling for the premise, but still great to watch. Many argue that ""Event Horizon"" is one of the scariest sci-fi movies ever made, while others say it's just a rip off of other great space movies. It's always a gamble when the plot has been done before, but ""Even Horizon"" stands out as an original of it's kind, which could be either good or bad. I did find ""Event Horizon"" to be quite a thrill. The idea that no one can hear you in space is haunting, and that the rescue crew is millions of miles away form civilization. The special effects were done well and are even up to today's standards. Both Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne give good performances, as well as the rest of the cast. The crew is a tough, marine style bunch, but their morale quickly dies as they soon fall apart upon landing on the Event Horizon.When the rescue crew finally boards the Event Horizon, they learn that the crew that once inhabited the ship is gone, but a strange presence returned with the ship after it's long disappearance. Creepy sound effects and haunting echoes may be enough to scare most viewers, as this movie achieves it's goal as being a good horror film. The plot however, remains flimsy. There are plenty of holes in the script, and several questions are unanswered regarding some the events that occur. And many other things go completely unexplained.""Event Horizon"" earned a reputation as an extremely gory film. There are several disturbing scenes, such as a spike impaling accompanied by more blood than I have ever seen in a movie before. There are also some cool fire effects to add to the intensity. An interesting point is the way the alien like creatures toy with the human rescue team. They cause them to hallucinate and visit their worst and most frightening memories of their past, that cause them to break down on the brink of insanity. And you get to see it all as the crew imagines it. Often images of dead loved ones appear out of nowhere and it scares the hell out of some of the crew members. Frightening, but also entertaining.",Event Horizon

Add some really good special effects and a very dark atmosphere, and you will end up with an enjoyable and unpredictable movie. Of course Event Horizon isn't the new Alien or Blade Runner, but it never intended to be.

Of course, it has played off of other movies, but most movies do. I was scared !@#$-less. I don't get scared very easy. I don't remember the last time I was actually terrified! Jack Noseworthy didn't exactly get a good part but he did a wonderful job as Mr. Justin. I Love Jack and this is one of his better movies. Sam Neill is also H-O-T! Everyone did a great job. People said it didn't make you care about the people. I didn't think so. Cooper was funny and the humor of the story, without him, to me, it might have been unbearable...he kept everything down to earth. Starke, again, didnt really have a place, so she falls. And SMith, he didnt want to be there and he was so scared, it made you want him to get away. And last but certainly not least, Sam Neill aka Dr Weir. Now, he was one you wanted die. He was normal at first and then his ship turned him into something non-human. Personally, this movie is my fav and I think it's sooooo great. ANd definitely scarey! I watch it anytime I can. It's crazy, especially when they flash ""hell"" in your face. I got it not knowing what it was...just on faith, and I wound up covering my eyes during the movie and saying to myself ""OMG, this is something else...I don't know if I can handle it"" I think Jack (Justin) should have had a better part but he says he loves the fact his character gets traumatized and everything that happens to him....so I give all the crew a 10 out of 10 for a great performance.

The plot is cleverly developed and adds a twist of horror to that usual SciFi quandary - how to travel faster than light.The characterisation was intelligent and varied, my favourite being Sean ""Son of Dr Who"" Pertwee as Smith. Fishbourne was a strong, level headed captain who takes over as the focal point of the film from Dr Weir (Sam Neil) towards the end of the film.There are many overtones from other films, such as Don't Look Now as well as Hellraiser, Aliens etc. but that doesn't mean it's a film worth experiencing.",Event Horizon

Forget Alien and all the copies of it, they are no match for Event Horizon. This film doesn't need monsters or aliens. The cast is small but amazing and from all over the english speaking world, and they are all perfect for their part. If you look close you will also see that the special effects are much better than in all other sci-fi movies. The ships actually feel real and it looks like real metal not some computer creations.After seeing Event films like Alien seem ridiculous and not the other way around. It might be a mix of other movies but it is better than them. A lot of people didn't understand the storyline or what this film is about (like in ""Fight Club"" for example), if you do though you can watch the finest sci-fi film ever.Let's call it a Generation-X movie. You are in another age? Forget it you mabye would not like it.The cast has short dialogues which are played perfect, and it is shot very interestingly. The music is second to none.The beginning of the film is one of the best ever (music, titles), and its also no typical hollywood movie since it is directed by a european.

666,Jimbo-121,"Terrible, just terrible.",1,23 July 1999,"This comment contains mild spoilers.I hardly know where to begin. I went to see this when it first came out, expecting a stylish, smart sci-fi horror movie.  Instead, I saw something that could have been a decent horror flick, if it weren't for the complete disregard given to common sense. Here are my problems with the movie in no particular order:What sadist designed a ""suspended animation"" pod that, when opened, dumps you on to the deck in a huge splash of water?It was said that they accelerated to 10Gs - floating in a tub of water wearing a snorkel isn't going to keep your lungs from imploding at that level of acceleration.The CO2 scrubbers (a big deal in the movie) were located at the end of the ship with the space drive - as far from the living quarters where the CO2 expelling humans spend their time.  And, the ship is conveniently designed to explode in the middle, which would split the ship in two, in case the experimental space drive  misbehaved, but would also doom the crew to a slow, suffocating death.  Not the best design in the world.Stuff was used for atmosphere that would be impractical at best : A huge cruciform windshield, doors with big spikes that slam shut alarmingly fast, a dim, dank sick bay with operating tables shaped like neon coffins.  All of which makes for a creepy atmosphere, but none of which makes any sort of sense in designing a spaceship.  I'd much rather have a scary movie in which they at least *tried* to have things make sense.No one on earth could figure out they were speaking Latin in the video?  I know it's a dead language, but come *on*!There's much more, including one of the crew traveling through space by venting O2 from his suit, but hopefully I've given you enough reasons to avoid renting this thing.  The bad, bad, *bad*  science was ludicrous enough to keep me from getting even a little scared.",Event Horizon

There are spoilers ahead....This movie started off very promising but about halfway through took a nose dive into the ground.  The plot revolving around Sam Neill was contrived and had no direction, what did his dead wife have to do the ship? And then when he begins to kill the crew because they want to leave, all of a sudden he has superhuman power and easily overtakes a man with a sharp knife in his hands, not to mention he has no eyes!I actually started laughing by the last of the death scenes because it was fun to see what new, terrible death they could produce.  The only real scene that held my attention in horror was the footage of the first crew being tortured and the captain holding his eyes and speaking in Latin. The rest of the movie contains mediocre acting ( I was especially disappointed by Laurence Fishburne who usually is outstanding), borrowed plots, and a story that drags on and on.At the end Sam Neill says ""Hell is only a word. the reality is much, much worse.""

Be warned: do not look for very much depth in the story line.It uses the man vs. supernatural theme well; the characters are still in big trouble despite all of their science and technology.The set of the ship is wonderfully Gothic.  It makes the viewer uncomfortable just looking at it.It has good visual effects.  They may be diminished by the quality of the home theatre system you watch it on.  Some of the gore in the movie is a bit disturbing, however, it does add to the evil qualities of the character.Unfortunately, the script does not do the actors justice.  I know Fishburne and Neil are capable of a lot more.  We are given a superficial background and little insight into each of the characters.  They are predictable and act irrationally which is expected in most horror movies.We are given a slight bit of comic relief but it seems terribly out of place under such grim circumstances.Do not over analyze this movie; just sit back and enjoy.",Event Horizon

The violence didn't bother me.  It was claustrophobic, and not in a compelling way.  The actors gave every impression that they knew they were in a stinker and mailed it in.

691,cadge01,Alien meets Solaris with a touch of Lovecraft,8,17 November 2019,"Every once in a while I watch a film that has been so poorly received by critics that I am genuinely astounded as to how so many professional critics can have came to such a spectacularly different conclusion as I have. Event Horizon is very much one of those films.The plot concerns the crew of an interstellar recovery vessel led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) who are en route to salvage the eponymous ship, which has reappeared after a 7 year absence. The ship's designer (Dr. Billy Weir played by Same Neil) gives the crew a very hand-wavy explanation of how the ship uses a gravity drive which generates a black hole to enable it to traverse far greater distances than any existing technology allows - a concept that is implausible if not impossible. Unfortunately it seems as though the Event Horizon's crew died in a very bloody and violent fashion.In terms of genre, the film very much fits within the sci-fi horror niche. In particular it appears to derive a great deal of influence from Alien (to the extent that both ships resemble the Nostromo). However a number of characters experience hallucinations and this as well as the theme of humans trying to interact with something they cannot fully understand also reminded me of Solaris. And when a film contains a quote along the lines of 'You break all the laws of physics and you seriously think there wouldn't be a price?' it's hard not to think of the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft in which science, technology, and even reason, prove futile in the face of vast and uncaring universe.Despite the fast pace and frequent use of special effects characterisation is not ignored. Much of the horror is drawn from characters being presented with traumatic images from their pasts. Likewise, there are several scenes where the characters clearly show concern for and emotional attachment towards each other. However given that two of the rescue ship's crew are female, I was relieved the makers of the film didn't try to force a romance subplot. It was also a relief to see characters acting in a fashion that allowed them to show fear whilst still coping with the situation in a rational manner - as opposed to the traditional two extremes of the horror genre; hysterical idiots or fearless ubermensch. In particular, Laurence Fishburne provided a suitable commanding presence as a strong leader who clearly cared about his crew, while Joely Richardson came across as an effective second in command.While Event Horizon is never quite able to reach the greatness of Alien (which I consider best in class for sci-fi horror) it did manage to sustain my attention through a combination of suspense, horror, and mystery. There were no glaring plot holes, I couldn't name a bad actor, and the special effects all hold up to viewing in 2019. I have no idea why the critics hated this film so much, for sure there may be an element of snobbery towards genre fare, but many of the same critics have given positive reviews to other genre films such as those from the Alien or The Terminator series. While the opinions of others won't stop me enjoying a film, it is a bit of a shape to think that many people will be turned off watching Event Horizon by its poor critical reputation. So for those who are evenly remotely interested in it, I would enthusiastically urge you to seek it and judge it for yourself.",Event Horizon
692,djhast,The horror...blah blah...the horror.,1,18 June 2010,"Good choice if you enjoy yelling at the screen. Take a pass and instead watch these three GOOD movies, from which all the clichés in this travesty were boiled down: Alien, The Shining, and Hellraiser.On the other hand, if you would like to experience a textbook example of everything despicable about commercial feature film production these days, this is it (except for merchandising, but I don't think they make bobbleheads with bleeding eyeless sockets). It would be a fun movie to analyze line-by-line or shot-by-shot, identifying as many other movies as possible for each.This insult to even modest intelligence contains literally not one second--not one frame--of original script, cinematography, effects, makeup...even acting (from actors who are terrific in so many other movies).It has ALL been done before, over and over and over again. Every line, every gesture, every scary sound effect or face popping up in the dark.This movie is a gateway to film hell...or hilarity, if you decide to approach it that way (the only possible way to sit through it).",Event Horizon

WHY does every sci-fi space ship need to have a retarded and unstable military crew who knows nothing of science? Is the line ""do you speak english doctor?"", while the scientist is explaining what the mission is, some kind of inside joke among sci-fi directors that is mandatory to the genre?

I was 35 when I first saw this movie; after it had finished I felt like I was 10 years old and had just finished watching an old scratchy B&W werewolf flick.It had been so long since I had truly been disturbed in a scared way I'd almost forgotten what it felt like. Schindlers List troubled me, but not in this way, this was a true feeling of shock and horror. Four or five minutes after the screen had gone blank and the music faded, I'm still staring at the TV screen in a nicely terrorized state. I had to shake myself to snap out of it. Fabulous!!!!!I love seeing peoples faces after I have told them to watch this film. They give me that, ""Oh my God!!!!!!"" look and breath in deeply at the same time. They too have been truly traumatized for a short while. When they discover the nature of the garbled video message is a great recoil moment within the film and one I can still remember some 5 years after seeing it. If you're easily scared don't watch this movie, you'll have a heart attack. If you haven't been scared in a while then be prepared for how marvelous that feeling is. YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!",Event Horizon

696,dblack-1,Event Horizon is scarier than Alien,7,7 July 2001,"Event Horizon is scarier than Alien. Although many aspects of the film have roots in earlier efforts such as 2001, Alien, and Hellraiser, it effectively molds these influences into a new and horrifying story.  The film has an excellent progression of plot, and the acting of the main characters, particularly Sam Neil as Dr. Weir, and Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller, is excellent.My own pet peeve of Horror movies is that the terrifying moments are often artificially created by the incredible stupidity of the characters.  This is mostly not the case in Event Horizon.  The set and special effects lend a very creepy air to the whole movie that makes your hair stand on end, and when action happens you're suitably primed to jump out of your seat.I have two problems with the film: 1) The music at the opening and closing credits doesn't set up the mood of the film at all, and leaves you expecting something else. and, 2)  The ending is a bit unsatisfying, and somewhat cheesy.Overall, however, this movie is well made and conceived, and has only a few weaknesses.  I recommend it, just know that you'll have to sleep with the lights on for a few days.",Event Horizon
697,pgdicko,The Best Sci-fi Horror film since 'Alien'.,8,19 January 2007,"Since it's release in 1997, this film has not been given the credit it deserves. It has a great mix of science fiction, horror, and suspense. The director Paul W.S Anderson has since gone on to direct 'Soldier' and Alien VS Predator. But I Believe this is his finest work to date. The film creates an eerie, and terrifying feel with the help of incredible set designs, precision lighting and unique cinematography. The film also boasts a stellar cast which includes, Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, and Richard T. Jones who is brilliant as the extremely witty 'Cooper', he has some hilarious one liners and brings a little comedy to a genre where you would not usually see it, and probably would not want to, but somehow this film makes it work. It works because the mood of the film is still at the front of your mind and there is always an horrific and terrifying scene waiting around the corner. On the downside, I believe that the story could have been developed a little more. Perhaps with a more detailed explanation of what happened to the spaceship of the title. However, the fact that the story is very original was good enough for me.",Event Horizon

699,bsheehan,Prometheus,2,31 August 2001,"I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie than Event Horizon.  While the early graphics were good, the script was bloody awful.  It's essentially the story of Prometheus, retold yet again.  Prometheus, you recall, stole the secret of fire from the gods and was punished by being chained to a rock and having his liver eternally pecked out by eagles.""Bloody"" is the best one-word description.  There's lots and lots of blood, in fact - gallons of it.  Disembowelments that make Prometheus's torment look like a Sunday picnic.  And why?  Because the scientist broke the laws of physics.I'm not surprised to find Sam Neill in this turkey, but I'm disappointed that Lawrence Fishburn's considerable skills were wasted on it.Most everyone dies horribly, of course, but you can save yourself.

It's movies like these that give SciFi a bad rap.The motivations of the characters are thin. The doc misses the wife he neglected and the cap can't lose another man. These two paper thin motivations are all that exist to motivate this plot. In the end it doesn't matter as it's all the devil's fault.Actually, the movie is a very weak admonishment of mankind's technological pride. But instead of giving us a real reason why we should be careful, the movie points out that hell awaits our over achieving technologists.Of course, I expected way too much from this movie, but again, I still assert that it's a waste of resources on such thin ""gotcha"" type horror.",Event Horizon

This movie is one hell of a nightmare (watching it with the right atmosphere). Creating such a terrifying mood is an art which is very seldom these days. Most horror movies are more or less for people who've never been watching movies from this genre. The further the plot goes the better the frightening atmosphere... to sum up: this movie is highly recommendable.,Event Horizon
706,magnus-287,Doom meets alien,5,9 January 2009,"I found the combination of space and all the references to hell/satanism a pretty weird combo. The setting is nice, and to be a sci-fi from 1997 the animations are totally acceptable. Once the ships start to malfunction, the lights being flicker and the blood starts flowing, you get that fuzzy 'doom' feeling :) This film has a lot in common with the movie Sunshine, which also is about a rescue mission in space where the crew is affected by some 'mysterious' psychological power. If you like movies like Sunshine or The Sphere, you will probably enjoy this too.Oh, and as an old Prodigy fan, I liked that they used Smack my bitch up for the ending credits ;-)",Event Horizon
707,Mark_Simmons,Atmospheric and disturbing. Probably a classic.,9,23 July 2002,"Although 'Event Horizon' would certainly not rate as one of the all time great movies, it is, in my opinion, still a classic. You certainly won't forget watching it in a hurry, even if you want to.This is a rather strange film that really doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Sci-Fi movie? Classic horror? Blatant gore-fest? It's all of these. It doesn't manage to do justice to any of them individually. But together though, it does work.The acting is reasonable to good, given the tacky script, although there are times when the actors look a little sheepish in delivering their lines. Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill and Sean Pertwee are the most convincing though. The rest tend to look a bit confused on occasions, as if they don't really believe what they're saying.Visually though, the film does deliver. This is definitely the sci-fi version of a haunted house. Miles from anywhere, cut off from civilisation, thunder and lightning, creepy gothic interiors... Some of the sets are truly unsettling. Especially the medical bay and the gravity drive engine room. Full marks must go to production design for these. I could watch this one with just the sound effects and no dialogue and still get something out of it.Getting into the mood of the film though, it really does need some more flesh on its bones. As an idea, there is enormous potential to do something very special here. Unfortunately though, it never happens. An extra half an hour, and more depth to the speculation about where the Event Horizon had been, earlier on - maybe between the first Lewis and Clark crew members entering the 'EH' and the ship reacting to them - would've helped pace the story better. As it is, it does tend to head off at a rapid rate of knots towards its rather inevitable and slightly predictable conclusion far too early.Overall, though? Well, spooky, unnerving, and downright disturbing on occasions, it's like watching a car crash in slow motion. You know what's going to happen and you really don't want to look, but you can't help it.I can understand why some people didn't like it. There's a lot of schlock without the solid foundations that this sort of film needs to keep it from sliding in its own entrails. But it *is* memorable and it does get a definite reaction from viewers, whichever way they go. It may nod it's head to 'Hellraiser' on occasions. But where Hellraiser was just plain camp, Event Horizon really does scrape it's fingernails over the inside of your skull now and then.A classic? Yes, I think so.At the end of the day, I would say, 'watch it'. It's only an hour and a half of your time. And you never know... ...you might be strangely glad you did.Oh, and I did have some rather weird dreams after watching it. Unusual that. I normally don't have a problem with horror in that way.Hmmmmm....",Event Horizon
708,justskittles,Great mix of Sci-Fi & Scary,9,25 February 2014,"This movie was dark and scary as ""heck"" while not being just plain gory (while I will state that there are definitely several scenes which are quite graphic, I think they didn't go over the top) The reason it's among my personal favorites is the way they managed to scare you. The scenes that make you jump aren't cheap scare tactics, (ok SOME are) but most play into the storyline and enhance the overall darkness of the film. They managed to give the film a nice sci-fi or futuristic look without being cheesy, and while highly unlikely, the concept and technology behind the film I personally find to be plausible which also puts it higher up on my list. The plot was explained well and flowed nicely from beginning to end. The movie was able to wrap up the story while also leaving the ""classic"" scary movie close of ""could there be more""? Definitely best with a decent surround sound system and a darkened room! A+ in my book!",Event Horizon

All those: Please, give it second chance. I think, if you like Lynch's latest work, you will also find a way through this movie, far away from a simple shock feeling, or a ""Woaaah"" for the special effects. The fact, that the ""event horizon"" (not the vessel, the idea of its existence) is a border, no one got a clue or a shining, clear definition for yet, and maybe no one ever will got one, makes me discuss with my friends after watching the movie for a few hours. Sure, the actors aren't that great, and you will miss a deeper psychology as well as a great dialog. But: such kind of movie got all what it needs, and all of these things are much more present than in other sci-fi-movies 'round the '90s. A pleasure to watch, especially if you like science-fiction, beautiful vessels and a never-ending space. And: Science fiction never makes me feel fear before like in this movie.

710,Underdog143,"Great start, comic ending",5,21 November 2008,"Over the years, I've heard people talk about Event Horizon with some reverence. It seems to have a special cult following in the sci-fi/horror genre. However, I never rushed out to rent the flick, even after receiving some props from a couple of characters on Family Guy. Finally, I spotted it listed on an HD movie channel recently.Firing up the DVR, I settled in for some average sci-fi gore. Setting the expectations low didn't help raise its rating for me. The film starts very promising. I'm a sucker for something with a premise like this one (ship lost for years returns; WTF happened). Spoilers and stuff:Unfortunately, the sense of dread just didn't build up for me. It started pretty well with the transmission from the ship and then just goes downhill. The visions didn't do anything for me and the big reveal was a let down.In the end, the final confrontation became comic. I laughed at the dialogue (""What happened...to your eyes?"") and the sound effects sounded cartoonish. When the two guys were flying around the bridge, I was busting up.

This movie is supposed to be shocking and evil... that is kinda the point considering what has happened to the ship.  I don't think it falls into the brainless horror at anytime.Its scary and gory, and I like how one person put it: ""nightmare fuel."" even for adults, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 14 or so.But great acting, great story, great twists, great ""mood"" scary vs. boo scary.

714,chorprobe,one of the few science-fiction-horror movies with a really strong atmosphere,8,23 January 2004,"Although I don´t like any other of Paul W. S. Anderson´s movies, ""Event Horizon"" is one of my favourite sci-fi flicks of the 90s. The threatening atmosphere is built up in an intelligent way and the sequences when the rescue crew is exploring the corridors of the deserted space ship make your nerves break. Even the ship itself is scary at first glance. The menacing atmosphere is mainly created on the fact that the rescuers can´t see an ""enemy"" or any reason for the disappearance of the ship (at least for a long time). -The unknown itself is the enemy and here ""Event Horizon"" shows some parallels to ""Alien"" (although Alien is far better). The score is wonderful and majestic and it underlines the horror of being trapped in space. Also the idea of the story is not bad. Acting was o.k. to me. Overall I recommend it to people who are into the ""Alien"" -trilogy (!) and who like sci-fi movies that don´t need any superficial action-stuff. 8/10",Event Horizon

The film takes the viewer into a perfect tension and has taken its place among the unforgettable works of golden age of 90's. The producer and the director seem to have chosen this name particularly for the ship named after Event Horizon, because the ship that managed to bend space time has succeeded to go beyond space and time, and then the ship itself becomes the very event horizon.

716,flyboy015,Event Horizon: the Gateway to a Dimension in which Movies SUCK,3,12 August 2010,"I had been waiting for quite a while to see this film after having watched Pandorum, a 2009 sci-fi flick with a similar plot. Compared to Pandorum, Event Horizon was a huge let-down. Perhaps the worst aspect of the film was that it had so much potential- with a great hook and lead-in, a talented cast with strong supporting roles and an exceptional expanding plot, I was dumbfounded when the credits rolled. About half-way through the movie, the ship becomes ""alive"" and Sam Neil undergoes a swell transformation, after which he can throw his co-stars into tables and walls with ease (and perform various other feats of impossible strength), can somehow see well enough to make coordinated movements despite having gouged his own eyes out, and makes clear to the average sci-fi buff that the bridging of science-fiction and horror genres is not suitable to amateurs.In its favor, the film's first half is exceptionally interesting and immersive, and has a perfect balance of horrifying scenes and on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense, as well as a strong plot, believable background stories and and a steadily climaxing series of events. But as soon as Sam Neil begins his man-killing rampage, this sorry excuse of ""Classic horror and sci-fi"" takes an obvious turn for the worse. And what's more, it becomes even cheesier and tacked on the further the storyline progresses, with Sam Neil's eventual reincarnation after having been blown off the ship's bridge and into deep space.Most sci-fi/horror movies have a definitive moment when the actor(s) realize that things won't be turning out so swell. But for 'Event Horizon', this translates more into a realization of the viewer that he or she has just wasted more than an hour of their time. The gory death of DJ, who is crucified and gutted, seems senseless when the storyline and premise of the film are considered.I did like some of the shots in the movie, however. For instance, in my own opinion, the first glimpse of the Event Horizon's bow with the name written boldly across the ship and garnished by carnival-style lights is exceptionally characteristic. The scene in which Justin realizes he is about to be blown out of the airlock and sent to his death was very well-filmed. His begging for Peters to open the door drove more horror into me than did any other sequence of the film, in fact. I also liked the bit when Sam Neil backs into the darkness, declaring in a chilling (and at this point still tasteful) ""I already AM home."" I wasn't too impressed with the initial panning scene of the space station, which apparently cost the film a third of its budget. I also thought the sequence in which Weir's wife, Claire, cuts her wrists was well-done. His pleading with her to not slit her wrists is as equally terrifying as Justin's apologetic face- especially Weir's line, ""Not again!"". So I would say that there were definitely some great horror sequences darted throughout the movie, in which acting and filming were excellent; nearly perfect. And for the culminating suspense scenes, my hair really rose when Peters creeps across the med bay, with the disturbing scratching sound and heavy breathing in the background, and the perfect amount of ever-so-slight camera shake. Very well done.Despite a few instances of amazing cinematography, generally-good acting, good visual effects and a seemingly-promising opening plot and storyline, ""Event Horizon"" was a masterpiece of a fluke. I was very disappointed, having expected much more than what was delivered in the second half of the movie- so disappointed, that I was shocked to find that more than a handful of people enjoyed it. I believe I'll stick to sci-fi/horror movies like Pandorum and 2001: A Space Odyssey.",Event Horizon

I made sure to record it onto VCR because I am a huge fan of horror and science fiction films so this seemed like the perfect blend. I was NOT disappointed.A lot of people so far have either: a) Made bad reviews about the film usually unjustified. or b) Spent the whole review slagging others off and not actually reviewing the film.Anyway, onto the film. The acting both from Fishburne and Neill is second to none and is without a doubt one of the best performances I have ever seen either of them deliver. Secondly, the plot, although not much, has originality. The film is more psychadelic than physical horror but it really can get you thinking.For horror fans this is a MUST. one of THE best films of the 1990's and I would recommend that everybody should check it out at some stage in their lives.

Everything comes together really well at the end and as matter of fact it also leaves you in suspense. This is one of my favorite horror films of all time.  One of the elements that makes this movie so scary is the fact that the scientific concepts are possible although not likely.  I think Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill played their roles very well.  The horrific imagery was actually scary compared to those that are unrealistic and very cheesy.

719,jmlumpkins,I walked out of the theater.....,10,2 June 2011,"I saw this movie when I was 16 years old. At that time, I had seen my fair share of scary movies and had been certainly scared by many of them. However, none of them were so disturbing, that they made me literally leave the theater. Forget covering your eyes through a scary part, I felt the need to leave. The part that disturbed me so much was the scene where the designer of the ship was in a crucifix (upside down maybe?). As a Christian, this was too real for me and it affected me to my core. Don't worry, I did come back to finish the movie. But to this day, I have yet to see be a movie that moved me (literally) as much as this one.Many of these reviews hit the nail on the head. It isn't that gory scary, although, eyes being ripped out and exploding blood vessels due to open skin exposure to outer space, were kind of cool. And it wasn't shock scary (the flashbacks and screen flashes of the Dr.'s wife shown with missing eyes and only having dark voids for eyes, were pretty spooky). The thing that made this movie memorable for me, enough to label it the scariest movie I've ever seen, was the fact that it encompassed and masterfully portrayed something that all (for the most part) of us fear, straight down to the core of our souls. Hell. The plot implies that a piece of hell had been brought back with this ship. This is very believable because it, in theory may be science fiction. We don't know what's in the middle of a black hole, therefore, one could assume that it is conceivable that a hell like existence is in the middle of a black hole.

The cast are good in there roles the effects are also fairly good the camera work and direction are superb but its none of these things that make the movie so good for me.

This movie i think fills me with a feeling of total dread right down to my gut the hair on my neck sort of queasy sick feeling thats why it is scary, not for the gore or jumps its the mood it creates within you i have trouble watching it alone at night in the dark and I'm a fully grown man there is just something about it that makes me feel so uncomfortable watching. I get people don't like this actor or that or the weekend bedroom scientists that want to pick holes in the theory of worm holes and jump drives, but hey its sci-fi that's the point it doesn't have to be feasible or work its fiction the only restriction is our imaginations in this genre also i think the edit for television cuts a lot of parts that help hold it together so please find a DVD and give this a go it shouldn't be scary but there is just something i cant put my finger on but i find it to be one of the most clever films I've ever seen simply for the way it makes you feel you will be thinking about it for weeks afterwards please just try it.......and enjoy it for what it is",Event Horizon

Hoe can I have missed that? The plot sounds interresting and you can't go wrong with good actors""
Turns out there was a reason I hadn't heard about it...Some people review this as having a deeper than just gore, kind of story, but all I see is a series of ""scary"" events going down without really pushing the story. And then everything gets revealed in a sentence in the end. The movie could have been like 40 minutes and the experience would be pretty much the same.

724,goldenboyfromeastla,"Poor man's ""Sunshine""",6,10 February 2012,"I went into Event Horizon with my expectations fairly low and my expectations were met. The film has some potential and seems promising for the first 30-40 minutes. The suspense is good, the plot is unraveling, and we're learning about Dr. William Weir and Captain Miller. The plot is ridiculous. Once the team reaches the ""Event Horizon"" this movie really goes to hell (HA HA, GET IT?). It's explained that the ship has been to a terrifying realm outside of our universe and returned, and now it makes everyone hallucinate their worst fears. It goes through some back stories about how Captain Miller left one of his men on a ship to burn to death, and some other stuff that no one really cares about. Not to mention the lady that keeps seeing her son. Who cares? She doesn't contribute to the main story at all. It's all mindless filler that no one really cares for.I must admit that I am a fan of science fiction but this one takes the cake in some aspects. At one point the crew is next to Neptune with 10 hours of breathable oxygen and no one is panicking at all. Oh you know, no big deal, just going to suffocate in 10 hours. Not to mention one of the crew members navigates space without a vessel. Just in his space suit. It's all a big mess.Overall, this film is largely comparable to ""Sunshine"", but with much darker tone. It's enjoyable if you can overlook some of the highly unrealistic and poorly written ""drama"". I enjoyed it for the most part and would say it has a decent ""rewatchablity"". Decent film.",Event Horizon

728,jonah-serrano13,What a disappointment ...,5,29 November 2014,"Let me preface this by saying this movie has, or had, so much potential. The concept is great: A crew investigates a ship that has gone missing for many years only to discover its been in Hell. You would think that this would make for a gripping, terrifying, unique film. Instead we are forced to watch flat characters stroll around an empty ship where the actual ""horror"" aspect of the film takes nearly an hour of the movie's 96 minute run to take into effect. This is one of those movies that feels much longer than its actual run time.This movie had so much going for it: a great cast, a great plot, great effects that still hold up 17 years later, etc. Unfortunately, nothing actually interesting or ""scary"" happens. This is just another movie that relies on gore to be scary, and guess what, it just doesn't work. I was left thinking that so much suspense and atmosphere was created to reflect the horrors that the Event Horizon experienced in Hell that the writer did not know how to live up to it. So instead, we are left to be scared of visions, fire, guts, and torn out eyeballs.And that just isn't scary.",Event Horizon

It is a shame, because the central plot about how they find out about what happened to the original crew was genuinely chilling and well carried off. The captains story about the crew member he lost in a fire was a bit cheesy, and the doctors hallucination turned out to be quite dull really, she was really scary, I'd hoped she'd turn out to be something more disturbing than a wife who committed suicide. Those 2 things really let the plot down in my opinion, but I give it such a high rating because despite its flaws it's one of the scariest films I have seen in a long time, definitely not for the faint hearted.",Event Horizon

But it's not especially the type of movie that I wanted to rewind and go back to certain scenes just to make sense of the current scene. I guess I just didn't expect it to end up the way it did. You always find the alien and kill it, and everything's better, or at least until he sequel comes out. :) I think the reason it creeps me out is because what they find is not an alien or something they could kill, like in most horror movies you watch, but evil itself, incarnated in the characters fears - creepy stuff.

733,PvilleNJ,The Shining Meets Alien,8,6 December 2004,"I liked the movie but do not understand why it is alleged to be worthy of a cult following. It's certainly a better than average science fiction flick but I found ""the horror"" in it more hokey than terrifying. The plot was a great one to work with (starship vanishes for seven years, mysteriously returns with its crew dead or missing) and I read the book too which the movie generally follows except for its weak portrayal to the viewer of the true horrors the former crew of the Event Horizon actually experienced. The casting was generally weak. Lawrence Fishburne as the rescue starship's Captain Miller wasn't working. I thought he played the role too tightly and reserved. Samuel L. Jackson would have been a better choice. Kathleen Quinlan still knows how to sob like a victim very well but hasn't turned in a decent performance since Lifeguard. Richard Jones as Cooper is a stereotype all the way and Jack Noseworthy as Justin was unnoteworthy. WARNING SPOILERS GALORE!If a central theme is that the ship has been to hell and back, then you've got to do a better job of presenting what your vision of hell really is. The book lays this out in detail. But the film covers it in quick, fast, vision sequences that if you blink, you'll miss. Using my DVD, I had to go frame by frame to see what was being flashed. Those were great, horrific shots of people in the apparent agony of existing in hell. Had they been put up there in extended, detailed sequences then you'd get an idea of the horrors of hell in unfolding detail. But to flash them by so quickly just detracted from the terror because it all went by too quickly. If you put all that work into a shot, let people see it and feast upon it! It seemed more like the crew had just gone insane rather than the what really happened; having been to hell and been forced to do perverted things and have perverted things done to them. Just reading about those things (remember the arm down the throat? Yuch!) in the book was terrifying because you could imagine it in your mind. The film failed to capture the true potential of this horror, again because the sequences flashed by too quickly. Sam Neil as the satanic figure worked well enough as he slowly succumbed to the evil. But the climactic battle mano-a-mano with Captain Miller was a head scratcher. Settle this by a fist fight with a creature from hell? I don't think so. And why would the creature yell when Captain Miller destroys the ship? Wouldn't that be what he wanted...to send everyone straight back to hell? Ah well.This could have been one of the best sci-fi horror flicks of all time. The plot had such great material to work with. But the execution was a disappointment. The fact that this film is so popular, though flawed, attests to the viewers primal fears and desires concerning what could have been presented, but wasn't. We just got a quick, unsatisfying glimpse of hell when we wanted the characters to actually take us there, terrify us, and make us all go back and want to become Christians the way The Exorcist did. Overall, the screen version just wasn't as compelling as the book. I've seen scarier haunted houses.",Event Horizon

735,jklimentowski,I wasn't amazed by this movie,5,17 December 2012,"A horror science-fiction movie. When I think of this genre I always have ""Alien"" on my mind. I think this is a perfect example. Unfortunately ""Event Horizon"" lacks both in the horror and science-fiction parts.As for the science fiction - well it is just not realistic enough. Of course not all movies should be as realistic as ""2010: Space Odyssey"", but still when you compare it to ""Alien"" it turns out quite poor. Actually there is not much realism or physics in it at all. OK - the idea of time-space folding is nice, but the idea itself is at least as old as The Dune movie, or perhaps even older. I liked the scene of transition from zero gravity to artificial-earth gravity with fluids and bodies instantly dropping. The decompression sequence tries to be more horror like than scientific... and that is all I think. The rest is just pure fantasy.So forget about science-fiction - is it a good horror? This might be a difficult question for me as most horrors make me laugh rather than scare mostly due to their stupidity and lack of realism. There are of course exceptions like Alien or The Thing. What makes the difference? I think it is the realism of the situation. I really can't be scared by ghosts which can do anything. It is just too unreal - I can not place myself in such a world and my imagination fails. Unfortunately Event Horizon is a movie it this ghost type. Anything can happen therefore I do not feel like one of the terrified crew members, rather I wonder what could the director think of next. Of course there are some more or less scary moments, but these are just typical horror tricks - sudden action with a proper sound effect. There is no feel of terror while watching the movie.Another thing at which the movie fails is the plot. While the beginning sequences are quite interesting with every minute the plot becomes more and more chaotic. At some stage one really gets bored as it seems that there is no real goal or solution of the plot. One by one some things happen which try to scare you, but there is no logic in them. I can imagine that such a movie could last for a long time with random scary adventures happening to the characters until all of them are dead. But what is the point of watching that? Unfortunately the ending is also quite predictable and gives you no satisfaction of discovering something interesting or an unexpected solution. It is just as plain as that.OK - so is the movie really so bad? Well it is not a perfect movie, but not a terrible one either. One can watch it and have some fun but it is not a movie that you would like to come back to after years. Just see once, have fun and forget.It is worth to mention that the move has it's own style. While placed in future all the ships and equipment sometimes look like designed in the past. I can't describe it exactly but sometimes I had a feel of watching a sci-fiction movie from the fifties. Why did the director decide to chose such a scenography instead of pure futuristic one? No idea but I think it works fine.",Event Horizon
736,somatic-1,Modern sci-fi classic with perfect atmosphere - 8.5/10,10,3 November 2004,"What can I say about this film? It is one of the most scary, beautiful and creative films in genre of sci-fi. The word ""scary"" cannot express its satanic atmosphere, actually. The idea of unexplainable evil from the beyond is not so original, but Anderson (director) managed to express this feeling of 4D chaos in audiovisual flesh of the film. The rare feeling. I think, that the only one film as thrilling as this is Kubrick's ""Shining"". Kubrick has very powerful acting in his film, but Anderson made the same feeling more based on cold atmosphere of outta space. This film always leaves me in very very dark mood. I also think ""Event Horizon"" is somewhat underrated film today, because people look at it like at ""another one predictable space thriller"". ""The Shining"" was also underestimated at the time it went out. But in some time it might become more watchable, because it has stuff that won't let it become unwatchable, like, say, first ""Alien"". In some time it will look like Hitchcock or Carpenter. Brilliant movie.",Event Horizon
737,ahorn88,"Fun sci fi, not real scary",6,3 March 2013,"Just watched this movie as per the suggestion of this post. What I expected? Shocking, gory imagery. Mind bending, unsettling theories of what could be possible in this world over the next 100 years. What The movie delivered? A middling sci-fi thriller with a pretty great cast; not particularly scary. The premise is great - the human race, ""flying too close to the sun,"" rips a hole in the fabric of space time, opening a portal to a chaotic, evil dimension. The spacecraft itself is transformed into an evil being, devouring any well-intentioned rescue crew that happens to cross its path. This is one of those movies that on paper and in my head seem incredible - limitless potential - but unfortunately the execution just did not match up. The hype I had built up based on comments people had made and a review or two that I had read prior to viewing made me expect a mind f*** to compete with other creepy sci fi flicks like The Cube or The Cell crossed with the horror and gore of Candyman. At the end of the day, I recommend checking out Event Horizon as a fun sci-fi movie that requires a bit of imagination and the suspension of disbelief thanks to the mid 90's special effects. Expect a 5/10, discover an 8/10. And that's my 2 cents.",Event Horizon
738,prince_kheldar_67,I loved this movie,10,6 November 2004,"I personnaly loved this movie. Many people hate this movie but I don't understand why unless they just hate sci-fi/horror flicks. The first time I saw EH I thought it was pretty creepy, especially Claire with no eyes, the recorded message, and the little kid that kept appearing throughout the film. The second time I saw it, I liked it even better. I finally bought the DVD and have watched it several more times and I love it. Maybe watching a movie more than once isn't for everyone. I think that a lot of the negativity for this movie comes from the director Paul Anderson. A lot of people really hate this guy. After seeing Alien vs Predator some of this hatred is understandable, but I feel that EH was by far the best of his movies.The cast of EH was very good. I thought that all of the actors did a good job with their characters. Maybe they could have done a little more development of the main characters, (ie Weir, and Miller) to tell us more about where they came from and their backgrounds. Jolie Richardson is hot too!! I thought that the whole concept for the movie was great, a ship that travels to another dimension and comes back alive. I love it. Some of the ways the crew members are killed are pretty cool too. The visualizations of Hell and the original crews fates are awesome too. Lets face it, Hell is probably a very bad place!!!!In summary, this is a great movie, although not to the caliber of Aliens.

It also poses interesting questions regarding theoretical physics, in as much as the theory behind the Event Horizon's revolutionary gravity drive is to defy the law of relativity and create an artificial black hole to bend space time and jump through the resultant hole to stars light years away.The Event Horizon unlocks the gateway to another dimension, one in which all constraints on human behaviour are removed. The result , chaos and cruelty are the norm, hell is reality. the reality is as bad as you can imagine. After all, nothing that is in this movie did not originate from anywhere but the human mind. Whilst the film is essentially science fiction, it can also be called a horror film as well, due to the carnage shown in the ' visions of hell' scenes.Well recommended, Regards, Ian",Event Horizon

I did not find it clever, inspiring, or original. Even the CGI was weak in many spots.The average rating surprises the heck out of me, are people's standards really that low?

The movie can never be called boring because it leaves you at the edge of your seats on account of it's suspense and shock-value. The movie is certainly not for the faint-hearted and fickle-minded as it contains certain horrific scenes and gory visuals. The horror works quiet well at the psychological level too.

The ship's deck where the doomed crew worked was very dark and cold. Also the size of the Event Horizon made it all the more chilling. The scene where the guy repairing the ship and gets blown of into space was a little silly.

Even though you don't see anything of this don't-wanna-be-there-dimension, the effect it has on the crew just says it all. The plot maybe quite simple, but the film doesn't dwell too much on it, it does not imply it is a mind-blowing idea. You won't hear Laurence Fishburne saying: 'Oh, my God! A hell dimension! How is it even possible?!' Nothing in the movie is scarier than stuff I've seen before, still the scariness of Event Horizon isn't in the gore, nor in the shock and awe moments. No, it's in the atmosphere. It's in the ominousness which somehow grabs you and doesn't let go. It's in the gut-feeling. Event Horizon is a gut-movie. Maybe that's the thing I couldn't put my finger on.",Event Horizon

There is a large amount of slow burning tension, and the looming threat of the unknown is strongly present. And the idea of a ""Hell"" on the other side of the universe is a brilliant and terrifying idea, playing on the fears of Christians and Atheists alike.

758,adorablyirish,"Personal Favorite movie! Wonderfully done, and very deep!",10,30 January 2015,"I only discovered this movie last year while searching for Sam Neil. However once I began watching it I was hooked. It starts off with catching you up to when the ship disappeared, which draws you in. And then mentions the reappearance, which captures you attention. I am fans of both Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil when the movie began but you can bet after watching it I searched out more of their work. And it was the first time I had seen Joely Richardson but I was certainly impressed. The rest of the cast supported them all very well. I certainly believe that this movie was sorely under appreciated. The discovery of the recording, the flight log, and the first frozen body were all big moments I couldn't look away from. Laurence's character Captain Miller was brilliantly portrayed as strong and loyal, more so now after what had happened prior to the movie. Yet perhaps the best performance in my opinion was Neil's Dr. Weir's slow decent into madness. This movie was unnerving chilling and scary, but not in the usual horror movie way. So I leave you with the best quote of the movie (in my opinion) ""Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.""",Event Horizon

That's the second best thing. The rest of the cast is adequate, and Sean Pertwee plays an excellent Sean Pertwee character, Sam Neill's scientist guy is just bizarre. The third best thing? There isn't one. The special effects are a strange blend of cinematic excellence, and homemade 3D animation that looks like it could have been done as a student project, specifically the floating objects seen when first encountering the lost ship.To summarise: It's confusing pseudo scientific nonsense trying vaguely to justify a formulaic slasher horror film.

In other words, we don't know anything about what's behind. The concept of opening a portal to hell isn't unique, but the combination with such sci-fi-aspects (explore the unknown) makes it work pretty well. Many people criticize the acting and the visual effects in this, but I compare it to other horror movies or other animated films from that era and that actually makes it look good. I probably overrate Event Horizon by a large margin, because I watched it when I was young and it almost scared me to death. But even when I watch it today, I see a solid Sci-Fi-Horror movie with a good story, many disturbing scenes and a great deal of space adventure. In my opinion, it follows in the footseps of the best in the genre like Alien 1979 or The Thing 1982. It's a shame, that this kind of movies are pretty rare these days, since the genre has so many possibilities for a great horror story.",Event Horizon
762,dominikkohlstruck,Waste of time,2,2 January 2016,"I'm seriously mad. This movie started as something promising and turned into something horrible. I already expected a movie that is more horror than sci-fi.My problems with this movie were:THE SPACESHIP DESIGN is horrible and doesn't make sense in any kind of way. The ships look like updated planes from 1930. Seriously? I mean, even the spaceships from 1950 looked a lot more futuristic. The interior? All dark. I also don't see why they've designed the sleeping pots the way they did? Like – every time someone's being released from a pot, the whole water splashes onto the floor. Who's gonna clean that sh**? Also – spikes! Everywhere! Why?! I don't see any plausible reason behind that. I also don't get how it's so easy to turn on gravity on board? TV shows like 'The 100' make gravity on board a lot more realistic.THE STORY starts great. Mystery is there – all over the place. And somehow – after 50 minutes or so – the movie starts to get messy. Lots of blood – lots of scary things happen. But it turns out, the spaceship got to a place no human has ever seen and came back with something evil – something that has an incredible power. OK. Cool story – but it doesn't make any sense to me. Look: don't you think – whatever it is/was – it really gives a f**k on what we humans are doing in this universe? I don't think so. If something is that intellectual and powerful, I think it's going to act more like Dr. Manhattan ('Watchmen'). I don't know. Thorough the story they try to come up with a plausible story, but it just keeps on getting more and more absurd.THE CHARACTERS. I just didn't give a  Practically all of them died and they died horribly but as they practically prevented the audience to get an emotional connection to the characters, it just made the movie pretty boring.I love sci-fi, I'm not a huge fan of horror (though, I think there are great movies worth watching), but this is none of the above. If I had to choose a great sci-fi movie, I'd pick Gravity or Sunshine.",Event Horizon

764,sujishalexander,Before the Matrix & after the (Jurrasic) Park,8,5 May 2016,"It was lonely at home & late in the night, I decided to watch some TV & doze off. Unfortunately I flipped on HBO & they were playing Event Horizon. By the end of the movie not only was I awestruck & scared out of my wits, the entire night I was up thinking about the movie. Usually I watch a movie after reading the reviews, hearing comments from friends etc. This was a shocker for me.Its not every day you see a good mix of science fiction & horror. Of course it was the screen presence of Laurence Fishburne & Sam Neill that first made me stop channel surfing but the rest of the cast too did an excellent job as far as acting was concerned. But it was the subtle development of the plot that did the trick. The movie starts off in the year 2047 with a rescue & salvage mission of a ship the ''Event Horizon'' which mysteriously disappears during its maiden voyage & then reappears after 7 years. The Event Horizon was an attempt to perform space hops (jump from one point in space to another immediately without actually burning fuel & traveling that distance).Along with the salvage team they have Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) who obviously knows more than he is ready to disclose. The rest of the team (& the movie for that matter) has Capt. Miller (Laurence Fishburne) who is cool, composed & ready to see the reason beyond the logics. As the crew tries to find out what happened to the crew & where the ship has been for the last seven years the answers, unpleasant as they are, only lead to more darker questions.The crew soon suspects that they would need a salvage team themselves. And even worse, someone or something does not want them to leave. Alive, anyway. The visuals & sound are beautifully intertwined in this horror classic. Not to the visually gross scale but good enough to send shock waves down your spine. Laurence Fishburne shows us hints of the man we know as Morpheus in the Matrix. Sam Neill was there but actually falls short in making a lasting impact.The screenplay was good considering that I was seeing it on TV with commercials and all & still felt the movie was scary enough. The facts open up one by one evenly throughout the movie & not in one sudden shocker (as revealed by scary old granny/grandpa giving a scarier story & warning as seen in a normal horror flick). On the whole a very good movie especially if you are a sci-fi & horror fan.Just be warned don't see it alone, at night esp. if you would like to sleep after seeing it!!",Event Horizon
765,bummerinmyveins,"Such great potential, squandered.",5,21 July 2016,"Event horizon is one of the most cult classic movies of all time. As much as it is a mediocrity, I can see why. There is about 30 minutes of film cut from the final, and while it is a noticeable removal, any mysterious backstory is enough to turn what would have been a slightly above average sci-fi into what is now an urban legend. This cut also made the film basically uncriticizable, as any perceived flaws can be blamed on the cut rather than innate problems with the film. So as to win the favor of the fans before pissing them off, lets start with the positives of the film.For one thing the costume design is great, as well as the concept. The concept's strength is what makes the execution such a disappointment to me, for reasons I will get to later. The acting is usually strong, especially from Laurence Fishburne. The movie is very good at building suspense as well.The biggest and most noticeable flaw is the development of the characters. The characters are as generic as can be, the only thing making them interesting are the personal traumas that are taken advantage of in their own hell. If the movie had gone more in depth on these personal traumas, and really made an effort in showing how personal and scary these traumas were to these characters- the movie could have been something great. Instead we get a bunch of tropes with some dark backstory mislabeled as character.Horror isn't know for it's strong characters (although there are definite exceptions to this) but in a movie that gains its horror from building personal hell for these characters, the least that could do is make them people.",Event Horizon

There are very few movies that affect me like this. The horribly gory and violent parts are all in the quick flash scenes.. when you freeze frame and examine those scenes on the DVD, I was scared beyond belief. The horrible things that happen... the flash-forwards and flashbacks... This movie is all about the atmosphere, where the story takes place.. the spaceship Event Horizon (a very scary looking spaceship if you ask me), that disappears 7 years earlier and shows up out of nowhere.. where has it been? What happened to it? If I had a choice... i would rather not know (but that is because I found out what happened and it scared the crap out of me)... I can't quite explain it in words... but this movie is quite a masterpiece. It succeeds where most of the Sci-Fi Horror movies don't.. it actually scared and bothered me.. frightened me even...

769,camelman-1,A good idea drowned in red dye and bad writing,3,6 October 2008,"I just saw Event Horizon on DVD, long after it was finished bombing in theaters, so if I were jumping on a bandwagon by calling it a banal sci-fi/horror misfire, that bandwagon has already left without me. I genuinely didn't like this film, although there was still enough substance to earn three stars, and I feel like that's pretty generous.The movie opens with an in-your-face techno song played over a worm hole effect that looks like what you'd see on Windows Media Player, and until that point, I had high hopes for the film. Since it's become a cult hit, I'd heard nothing but good things, and I went in with an open mind. However, it hardly picks up from there, with the cliché 'typewriter' text exposition that not only hands us the first third of the plot, but continues to needlessly label every scene change for the next few minutes.We're introduced to the generally bland crew of the rescue ship Lewis and Clarke, some of whom have the nerve to rhyme when working at their stations (""Everything's green on my screen, skipper""?). I tried to tell myself that the dialogue wasn't *that* bad, that Fishburne and Neill were still good, even if the rest of the cast was at best mediocre and at worst cringe-worthy. But let me use an example before I stop nit-picking the first thirty minutes of the movie.This rescue ship is being sent to investigate the disappearance and sudden reappearance of a top-secret vessel, the Event Horizon. They bring along the ship's creator, played by Sam Neill, and he explains the mission to them, telling them the Event Horizon is a ship designed for faster than light travel. One of the crew members asks him to explain how it's possible, and he says it would be too complicated. They insist, so he explains. Then they get mad at him for giving a complicated explanation.This is *not* good writing, and it's a standard that the rest of the film follows. Without giving too much away, the rest of the movie follows the trials of the crew as they arrive at the Event Horizon. Here's where it earns three stars: the set design. The Gothic interior of the ship is beautifully crafted, although you'll have to forgive how un-practical it is (and for a state of the art space ship, you'd want things as simple and practical as possible). I did, just because the art direction was so good. The absurdity of the ship's design never affects the plot or characters, so it really has nothing against it.Then there's the story, which loses coherence in proportion to the crew's sanity. By the end of the movie, there's not much sanity, and there's not much coherence. The obvious comic relief character plays a ridiculously major role, tension is sacrificed in favor of cheap, blood-soaked imagery, and religious references are as unwelcome as they are cheesy. You might laugh, like I did, at the villain and his motivation/appearance. At one point, the makeup on his head makes him look like a puppet. And maybe this is just because I'm not a horror regular, but the use of the word 'evil' killed any credibility or meaning that the later revelations about the Event Horizon might have had. It becomes a gore-fest, with some serious over-use of blood to try and convince you that it's 'scary'.More blood does not make a better movie. It didn't make a better movie out of Event Horizon, and maybe if Paul Anderson had realized that while he was busy planning the fist fight (yes, there's actually a fist fight.) then it could have tapped its potential. This could have been a great psychological thriller, if they had taken more pages from H.P. Lovecraft and hired a more competent screenwriter. Believe the negative reviews, unless you're willing to forgive the problems above, or if you're one of the many people who *does* think more blood makes a better movie.",Event Horizon

It started well with a good scientific explanation of Faster Than Light travel by folding space. But then it turned into a stupid horror movie, where lots of violent scene are just gratuitous. Without all the horror and all the violence, it could have been a good movie.
If you are looking for a horror movie with a little more wits than average, this movie could be for you.
On a technical note:
Nobody would design a bridge that you would have to explode to separate a ship into 2 sections, that makes no sense. If one wanted the possibility of separating a ship in two, you would design a locking mechanism that you can lock and unlock at will.If a crew starts having hallucinations and acting on it, the first order to make, as a commander, is that nobody can be by themselves.

I wish I had read the reviews on this one before seeing it. It started as quite interesting Sci-Fi with some aspects of space travel nicely taken into account. Then it just went down the drain. If you are going to have a Sci-Fi movie you are going to have to present believable technology and advancements (the complete explanation how everything works is not required). In my opinion the wormhole to hell as a concept doesn't work at all. At least not if the movie was supposed to be anywhere near Sci-Fi. In Doom 3 the concept worked just because the original games were made with tongue in cheek attitude. And blasting the spawn of hell with guns is fun.I consider Sunshine to be quite much like this. So if you didn't like this movie you aren't probably going to like Sunshine either.If you're into horror and Sci-Fi is not the type of movie you see because you'd like to have a glimpse of what could be then this movie just might cut it.,Event Horizon

This was an interesting bit of forward thinking by the film's creators as there has been talk for many years that the flag should be changed so it doesn't have the Union Jack, so as to show our removal from colonial Britain. This film was set around the year 2050 I think and the creators must have thought our flag would be changed by then with Australia deciding to honour our nations original inhabitants.

Anyway I really like good directed late 80's, 90's, 00's horror films like: The Devil's Backbone, Descent, Switchblade Romance (pretty spooky though)... I think horror films like these a really cool but not that scary. And this is where I think Event Horizon is different. This movie is also good directed, OK acting... but it is also very spooky.

A rescue team along with the ships designer (Sam Neil) is dispatched to investigate. Events take a dark turn However when the ship is boarded and things are eerily not as they seem. We learn the ship has traveled between dimensions and actually took the previous crew to hell and that the ship has become corrupted by the chaos in the afore mentioned dimension.Event horizon boasts an impressive seasoned cast of actors Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne, Sean Pertwee, Jack Noseworthy, Kathleen Quinlan and Richard T. Jones star.Along with the excellent cast the movie boasts incredible set design. The ship is gothic in appearance (which I personally love) and fits the narrative of the plot very well. Gore is used fairly well, there are very short graphic scenes which leave more to the audience's imagine which in my opinion works better than hellraisers use of showing you everything gore.Event horizon does fall short in some places however, the movie has absolutely fantastic ideas which are sometimes poorly executed. These can be attributed to constraints placed on the direction by paramount cutting a lot of scenes from the movie, which the cast themselves were not happy about.In conclusion Event Horizon is probably one of my favourite Sci-Fi movies of all time (think the shining but in space with gore). This explains the cult fan base which has developed over the years since the movie was released. The film still holds up really well which is unusual considering the movie came out in 1997.
