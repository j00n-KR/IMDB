0,Leofwine_draca,Get past all the sex and it's a mature and thought-provoking movie,6,18 June 2016,"Lars von Trier has ever been a censor-baiting director and he seemed to reach new extremes of sex and sadistic violence with his ANTICHRIST. His new NYMPHOMANIAC films go even further, pushing the boundaries of on-screen sexuality with pornographic depictions of coupling and the like, so these films are only recommended for the least prudish of viewers.NYMPHOMANIAC VOL. I is certainly an interesting and intriguing viewing experience and would remain so even if you took away all of the gratuitous sex and sexual situations involved. It's a character study of a woman who is first discovered battered and broken in a shady alleyway. The quiet and bookish Stellan Skarsgard brings her back to his apartment, where she tells him her life story up until the halfway mark. Skarsgard has long been a watchable presence in cinema and he actually turned out to be my favourite character in this. Although he's present only on the sidelines, I loved the way his character brought theory and academia to the story, drawing parallels with various historical and religious stories. His relationship with Charlotte Gainsbourg feels naturalistic and spiky.The rest of the film is a mixed bag. Some of it is repulsive (involving the young underage girl), and other parts are depressing (the Christian Slater character). Shia LaBeouf gives a surprisingly good performance (despite the dodgy accent) as a character of depth and humanity which you wouldn't believe based on his first scene. The set-piece sequence with an outstanding Uma Thurman is a definite highlight here and one of the cringiest/most awkward things I've ever watched on screen. Much of this film rests on the shoulders of the young and slight Stacy Martin, an actress who exudes an icy fragility throughout, and watching her character growing up on screen is quite the experience. VOL. II takes the story down ever-darkening pathways, and must be watched in conjunction with this instalment (like KILL BILL, the film was only broken into two parts due to the length).",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
1,SnoopyStyle,interesting but not compelling,5,26 January 2015,"Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) finds an unconscious and beaten Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) in an alley near his home. She refuses to go to the hospital or contact the cops. He takes her to his home. She tells him about her life as an nymphomaniac which he compares to fly fishing and other ideas. Joe's father (Christian Slater) was understanding of her curiosity as a child. At 15, she (Stacy Martin) was eager to lose her virginity to Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf). Her friend B (Sophie Kennedy Clark) opens her up to sexual promiscuity. She encounters Jerôme again. Mr. H (Hugo Speer) leaves his family and Mrs. H (Uma Thurman) brings their three boys to show them their father's mistress.It's around 'Chapter two Jerôme' that the movie lost me. I don't know if it's the whole movie is basically Gainsbourg telling a story. Or that the movie keeps using letters for character names. I get why the bulk of the men get letters but her best friend needs a name. I come to the realization that this could be all manufactured by Gainsbourg's character. The movie loses all the tension and the immediacy. It becomes a sexually-explicit, slow, boring manufactured thing whether she's being truthful or not. Lars von Trier is inventive but the story meanders. This is an interesting movie but not a compelling one. Scenes that should be raw like Mrs. H is more comical than intense.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
2,Hitchcoc,"So, I Saw This Title on Netflix.....",5,27 July 2015,"Apparently this film has received considerable attention. Many of today's most visible actors appear. I watched it because you have to admit the title is a bit provocative. It is hard core pornography which has been elevated because a story line and good production value has been thrown in. It involves a young woman who has been badly beaten and thrown in an alley. She is discovered by a man, an intellectual, who lives alone. His life gets more interesting as she relates the story of the rise of her sexuality. He finds parallels along the way to her sexuality in more mundane subjects like fly fishing. We are then treated to a series of encounters which she has growing up and afterword. She has a fixation but there is one real rule and that is that she gets to call the shots. For two and a half hours this thing goes on. There are very graphic scenes all along the way, but there never seems to be much of a point, other than to display her as a sad character (though she would never admit this). I guess this goes on to a second part which I probably will not see.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
3,Horst_In_Translation,von Trier on nymphomania - enough said,6,15 September 2014,"This is the first half of director Lars von Trier's newest controversial movie. A woman is beaten up lying on the street and taken home by a priest. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgård build the framework of the film when talking about the history of Gainsbourg's character Joe, in this part pretty much only about when she was a girl / very young woman. That is also why Gainsbourg does not yet play herself in these flashback scenes. She confesses why she despises herself and tells about her past in several chapters. The young Joe is played by acting newcomer Stacy Martin. Looks-wise she fits the role as you can clearly see similarities to Gainsbourg and here and there she also proves that she has some acting talent in addition to her body which is certainly nice to look at. Occasionally she reminded me of Marine Vacth in ""Young and Beautiful"". Anyway, most males in the audience will have equally much difficulties as the males in the movie to resist Martin's temptation.Story-wise, it was all solid, but there were hardly no moments of greatness. The part with her relationship with her dad was fairly uninteresting and left me rather unimpressed. The one big highlight, however, was Uma Thurman, who only had one real scene, but almost stole the complete movie during that scene. Excellent portrayal and great writing there. It's actually a very tragic moment (especially with the children around), but her character is so sarcastic that it becomes a comedic highlight. Something that came off as negative were the comments from the priest. They were obviously included to form a bridge towards the next chapter from Joe's life, but they were sometimes so random that they almost sounded stupid and you would think Skarsgård's character was a simple uneducated man, which he certainly was not.It is 2 mostly entertaining hours, even if I felt the philosophical and thematically deep aspects and references von Trier used felt often forced. In the 21st century, it is certainly hard to make a film that defies conventions and still manages to shock people, but von Trier keeps giving it his best and occasionally even succeeds in breaking taboos.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
4,claudio_carvalho,Sex and Hobbies,7,22 March 2014,"A man named Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) finds a fainted wounded woman in an alley and he brings her home. She tells that her name is Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and that she is nymphomaniac. Joe tells her life and sexual experiences with hundreds of men since she was a young teenager (Stacy Martin) while Seligman tells about his hobbies, such as fly fishing, reading about especially about Fibonacci numbers or listening to organ music.""Nymphomaniac: Vol. I"" is an erotic drama by Lars von Trier with the dirty story of a woman obsessed by sex and her lovers. The storyline is the same of ""Anita"" (1973) and the detailed plot also discloses the relationship with her father and her mother. Based on the hype in this movie, I was expecting a boring art movie with explicit sex to shock the audiences. Actually, it is a dramatic story divided into chapters with touches of humor. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Ninfomaníaca: Volume 1"" (""Nymphomaniac: Volume I"")",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
5,kosmasp,More to it,9,22 June 2014,"It's not really news that erotic/sex sells. It's also nothing new that von Trier likes to provoke people. What I didn't expect was that the movie would actually make sense. It is bits and pieces (no pun intended) which make it like a collection of short movies, narrated throughout, but those pieces are really good looking.The Uma Thurman segment alone is standout and is an easy 10/10 if it were a short movie. It's part of a bigger story, which I haven't seen concluded yet. I only watched this (in the extended cut) at the International Film Festival in Berlin. Obviously this gets very explicit in its showing of the act/intercourse. Trier is the first to point out, that you don't see any bits from the stars of the movie though (it's pointed out at the end of the credits, but you could guess that they'd do some digital trickery there ... which is quite impressive).One thing is for sure: If you're here mainly for the saucy stuff, you will be disappointed by it. This is a drama after all and while the title might suggest something completely different, there is a real story behind it all. And above it all, a lot of humor. Am looking forward to part 2",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
6,jboothmillard,Nymphomaniac: Vol. I,8,9 October 2014,"Director Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark, Antichrist) is renowned for doing almost everything for real in his films, I heard about this first in a two-part film during its limited release, and I definitely wasn't going to miss it. Basically on a cold winter's evening in an alleyway, old charming bachelor Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) finds woman Joe (Antichrist's Charlotte Gainsbourg) beaten up, he brings her to his flat where she can rest, she tells him she is a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac, and she recounts her highly erotic life leading to the present day at age fifty, and as she tells the story Seligman connects and analyses. Joe opens that she developed an ongoing fascination with genitalia and finding stimulation at age two, her Father (Christian Slater) was a doctor who she spent time with learning about trees, and her Mother (One Hour Photo's Connie Nielsen) she describes as ""a cold bitch"". Young Joe (Stacy Martin) randomly, with no relationship, lost her virginity to Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf), it disappointed her, years later young Joe accompanies her best friend B (Sophie Kennedy Clark) on a train, they compete to sexually engage the most people and win a bag of chocolate sweets, after sex with several men in a toilet Joe wins the sweets by sexually assaulting a man, S (The Idiots' Jens Albinus), who previously denied them, with a forced blowjob. Next Joe tells about her first experiences of actual love, she did have lovers as she, B and other friends formed club ""The Little Flock"", who liberate from the prospect of love, but all members do develop serious relationships with their lovers, meanwhile Joe drops out of medical school and finds work as a printing company secretary, her employer is none other than Jerôme. Sexual intentions are clearly on Jerôme's mind, and he is frustrated as she ignores his advances and sleeps with other co-workers, but he does develop true feelings for him as she writes in a letter, but Joe is too late as he leaves with his uncle's secretary Liz (Felicity Gilbert), Joe is fired by his uncle, the real company owner (Casino Royale's Jesper Christensen), for her lack of experience, and despite a longing for Jerôme she returns to goes back to indulging in nymphomania. On of her lovers is Mr. H (The Full Monty's Hugo Speer), Joe causes conflict as he leaves his wife, Mrs. H (Uma Thurman, originally Nicole Kidman was cast), for her, the wife tries to humiliate them both in front of her children, and it gets worse when Joe's next lover A (Cyron Melville) arrives in the middle of Mrs. H's mental breakdown, the family finally leave, but not before the wife criticises Joe's lifestyle, slaps Mr. H and leaves screaming. Seligman mentions the mysterious death of Edgar Allen Poe, Joe tells of the last time she saw her father, she is the only one to see him and they say their goodbyes as he dies of cancer, she witnessed his fits of violent spasms and screaming for his wife, staff kept him restrained, she sleeps with several people to try and take her mind of her father in hospital suffering, when he does finally die Joe becomes depressed. After Seligman talks about perfected composed music, Joe uses this as an example talking about her next two lovers, tender but predictable F (Nicolas Bro) who puts having sex with her before his own needs, and animalistic controlling G (Christian Gade Bjerrum), before the end of this chapter she recalls finding Jerôme on one of her regular walks, he separated from Liz, Seligman finds this a preposterous coincidence, but they embraced, engaging in passionate sex, but this was the point Joe was emotionally distraught to discover she cannot ""feel anything"", this is the end of Volume I. Also starring Jean-Marc Barr as Debtor gentleman and EastEnders' Charlie G. Hawkins as Young Lad on Train. Newcomer Martin excels as the young and growing lead character, Gainsbourg narrating this first volume is good too, Skarsgård as the bookish single man playfully interrupts with his psychoanalytical interpretations, LaBeouf is fine despite his unconvincing English accent, and supporting members Thurman and Slater do well in their scenes also. The film is notorious for its real sex, using pornographic actors to double for the modest stars, while they act sexual scenes, and even use prosthetic genitals for close ups, but it is not just all about the sexual escapades, it is promiscuous tale of self discovery, it may not be to everyone's taste, but personally I found it a most interesting provocative arty drama film, the darker Volume II is also not to be missed. Very good!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
7,BA_Harrison,Bl()()dy b()ring.,1,19 November 2017,"A man, Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård), finds a woman, Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), beaten and bruised in a snowy alleyway. He takes her to his grotty little apartment where she recounts her life story in which she cannot keep her knickers on for more than a few minutes.'Am I boring you?' asks sex addict Joe in the middle of Lars Von Trier's Nymph()maniac: Vol. I.Why yes yes, you are, you tedious little bint, and so is everyone else in this pseudo-intellectual art-house porn flick aimed at chin-stroking perverts who want to be seen as cultured while getting their kicks.As you might have guessed, I loathed every single frame of this incredibly boring piece of pretentious X-rated garbage, and all those that made it possible. I hope that none of you ever work again. It's not that I'm averse to the odd spot of cinematic filth, only when it's as pompous and painfully prolonged as this film, which, together with Vol. 2, clocks in at well over four hours.I wonder how many people who paid to see this first volume actually bothered to go and see the next instalment. I'm guessing not many.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
8,Quinoa1984,Nymphomaniac vol. 1,8,28 April 2014,"Picture this: sitting at home and putting Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 on your on-demand and starting it up. For the first minute the screen is black, though there are sounds from the stereo of like rain-drops or an alley or maybe a sewer. Is there something wrong with the picture on my TV? Has it finally seen its last days? But then, a minute and a half into the movie, the first shot finally emerges as a slow (but not slow-motion) crane down from a brick ceiling to reveal a battered woman lying on the ground. And then comes the metal music, as if we're being assaulted for a moment ala Michael Haneke in Funny Games. And it's this that introduces us to ""Joe"", our protagonist (Charlotte Gainsbourg who, here is mostly just sitting in bed talking to Stellan Sarsgaard like an odd, perverted episode of In Treatment) lays it all out: how, from a very young age, she became infatuated, obsessed, couldn't get enough of sex.Some thoughts on volume one... Some of the conversation parts about fly fishing get a little long-winded, even for von Trier, and same goes for the visual accompaniment. But there are some really, tremendous and fantastic set pieces here that veer between achingly funny comedy of (ill) manners (Uma Thurman's scene, where she plays a wife of a man who cuckolds with the younger version of Joe and brings her kids along to guilt-f*** him - seriously, it makes Larry David look tame by comparison as far as cringe comedy goes), and, a usual for von Trier but never unappreciated, punch-to-the-gut drama (Christian Slater, man, where did THAT come from?) It actually took me a little while to get used to Gainsbourg's sort of detached voice-over. Once it clicked though, it clicked well. Even Shia LaBeouf is impressive, though playing a dick-weed is not a stretch at all for him. And hell you can get once or twice a moment of actual eroticism amid the sorrow and dread - to give you an idea, that one Bach organ song I thought you would use for death/funeral music is used here to underscore a sex montage.Not quite on par with his best, but it's still a remarkable achievement and it gets me excited for part 2 for sure.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
9,CinemaSerf,There's maybe just a little of all of us in this woman... (no pun intended!),6,29 June 2020,"On the face of it, this is just rather crudely presented soft-porn; but I think that if you bother to look a little deeper then this is actually quite an empowering film. That not to say that it's good - I don't think it is; but it is one of the first films with what could be described as having anything like an A-list cast to deal with the sexual needs/wants/addictions of a woman. Charlotte Gainsbourg is a sexual animal who recounts the tales of her encounters to Stellan Skarsgård whom she has only just met having fainted whilst out walking in the woods. He acts as a rather sagely sounding board provoking and absorbing in equal measure - but clearly without any physical or sexual interest in her himself. There's a bit of the child-in-the-sweetshop about this von Trier effort: the more sex she gets; the more risqué the venue or the activity, the less rewarding she finds it - like any addiction, her nymphomania is never sated. There is plenty of sex, but none of it especially graphic or violent - and you see bits of Shia LaBeouf and Christian Slater that you might not have expected! At times it does come across as sleazy and tawdry, but that is all part of her insatiability and though I can't say I could recommend this; it is certainly far more sophisticated than many give it credit for.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
10,grantss,"Despite the controversy, quite dull and pointless",4,30 December 2014,"Despite the controversy, quite dull and pointless.A movie that relies largely on the shock value of its subject matter and of some of its scenes. Take these away and it is largely empty.There are some interesting themes that appear - fidelity (and infidelity), addiction, control - but these are just touched upon. In the end it is the usual Lars von Trier exercise in pretentious navel-gazing. Even the erotic scenes are hardly erotic, seeming just ho-hum and a chore.Performances are like the characters: dull. Charlotte Gainsburg only does pretentious roles (which explains why she tends to appear in von Trier movies) and this is no exception. Stellan Sarsgaard is particularly boring. Shia Lebeouf seems out of his depth in a serious movie. His accent is particularly appalling and laughable, ending up somewhere between English, South African and Australian.About the only performance that I found riveting was that of Uma Thurman, but unfortunately her screen time is very limited.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
11,zetes,"Starts off interesting, but overstays its welcome (and then there's a part 2 that's even longer!)",6,13 January 2015,"Breaking the Waves was one of the defining films of my youth. I was a really big fan of Lars von Trier up through Dogville, but, frankly, I don't think he's made a great film since then (though I have slightly enjoyed each of his films that followed). The Nymphomaniac diptych has always seemed, since its inception, to me to be, I don't know, a bit too obvious. I wasn't really looking forward to it, to be honest, particularly since the whole saga, in the director's cut edition, runs five and a half hours. This first volume runs two and a half. This is basically Lars von Trier does Emmanuelle. It obviously gets very dark. The film opens with Charlotte Gainsbourg, who plays Joe as an older adult (as a younger adult she's played by Stacy Martin), laying in the street, having been beaten severely. Kindly old fly fisherman Stellan Skarsgard carries her home and nurses her back to health, and she tells him the story of her nymphomania. The story is mostly uninteresting. There's a lot of sex, and it's beautifully shot, but two and a half hours of this is just too much. The acting is quite poor. The cast of Vol. 1 includes Christian Slater, Shia LaBeouf and Uma Thurman, all of them poor (LaBeouf, in particular, can't do a British accent to save his life). I probably could find better movies to watch, but I think I will watch the even longer Vol. 2. There's at least a promise of Charlotte Gainsbourg screwing a couple of black guys. That ought to be hot.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
12,namashi_1,"Repulsive, yet Engaging!",7,24 March 2014,"Lars von Trier's 'Nymphomaniac: Vol. I' is Repulsive, yet Engaging! A disturbing, no-holds-barred story about a sex addict's tragic life. It may not please everyone, but it held my attention, to a large extend. 'Nymphomaniac: Vol. I' Synopsis: A self-diagnosed nymphomaniac recounts her erotic experiences to the man who saved her after a beating.'Nymphomaniac: Vol. I' is explicitly sexual & graphic. The Sex-Scenes are pretty disturbing, while each chapter keeps getting more & more aggressive. It depicts a Nymphomaniac's story with zero inhibitions, which in my opinion, is its biggest strength. Its not pretentious or hypocritical.Lars von Trier's Screenplay is wild, sad & yet somewhat powerful. His Direction, on the other hand, is fearless. Performance-Wise: Charlotte Gainsbourg & Stellan Skarsgård lead the narrative, with interesting performances. Stacy Martin is incredible. Not only does she let go off her body, but also delivers a performance of great loss & numbness. Uma Thurman is remarkable. Her lone sequence is haunting. Shia LaBeouf is effective. Christian Slater is subtle. On the whole, 'Nymphomaniac: Vol. I' is one of its kind.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
13,lasttimeisaw,Nymphomaniac: Vol. I & II - An ironic smack to the hypocrisies.,8,17 June 2014,"A 4-hour binge watching of provocateur Lars von Trier's latest feminist saga (divided into two volumes) is a candid confession of a middle-age nymphomaniac Joe (Gainsbourg, doughtily consummates her enthralling rendering in von Trier's Trilogy of Depression, after ANTICHRIST 2009 and MELANCHOLIA 2011, 8/10), out of self-hatred, she chronicles her deviant life from childhood to present, to an elder Jewish polymath Seligman (Skarsgård), who brings her home after finding her lying on the street afflicted from a savage assault. Dividing the narrative by eight chapters (five of which is named after things Joe spots at the stark room they are staying, and the rest three are Jerôme, Ms. H and Delirium) , Joe and Seligman set about a chamber conversation where Joe relates her sexual experiences and personal battle of being a nymphomaniac while Seligman pleasingly proffers some metonymical digressions eruditely drifting from fly-fishing, classical music (Bach's cantos firmus and Beethoven's fugue), religions (Eastern church's bliss-provoking icon to Catholic church's weight on suffering, meanwhile Seligman is a non-believer and an anti-Zionist), and paraphrasing Joe's comment, the dullest one is about the Prusik knot. The vigorous and informative two-hander plays off intermittently between the flashbacks of Joe's exploration of her sexuality, in the volume one, a young Joe (splendidly portrayed by the débutante Stacy Martin) commits herself in promiscuity to kick against the stale notion of ""love"" with her bestie B (Sophie Kennedy Clark, an exceptional veer from the young Philomena Lee in PHILOMENA 2013, 9/10), winning a sex contest on the train by performing a fellatio to a passenger who is en route to impregnate his wife, being a disinclined home wrecker of H's family (a welcoming Uma Thurman reverting in the groove as Ms. H, with three young sons tailing along to face off with the other woman). At the end of the day, Joe falls for her virginity-snatcher Jerôme (LaBeouf), as love Is the secret ingredient of sex, when her life is back on a normal track, incomprehensibly and precipitately, she lost all her sexual desire. This is the coda of Vol. I. In Vol. II, Joe plunges into the imperative venture to regain her sexuality, she bears a boy with Jerôme and opts for C-section hoping to rehabilitate her vagina, engages in interracial threesome, finally, gives in to the sadomasochistic therapy with K (Jamie Bell, a trans-formative endeavour as the young domineering sadist) at the expense of her relationship with Jerôme and her child. Segueing into the next paragraph, the film veers into a masculine aggression facet of Joe's character revelation (almost she is always the one who initiates in all kinds of sex activities), now she actually utilizes her experience and knowledge to succeed in the niche as a debt collector, and eventually develops a lesbian liaison with her young disciple P (Mia Goth), then the movie descends into a dire quandary when P cheats on her with Jerôme (Michael Pas substitutes for LaBeouf here, although non-simultaneous cast-alteration is quite perplexing) and after a futile assassination, Joe is whipsawed by the betrayal of P (with the taste of her urine) and a ruthless reenactment of her humiliation with the 3+5 Fibonacci sequence numbers about her virginity.That's the story before Seligman found her on the street, throughout the film, von Trier deploys intricate cinematic tricks to unflinchingly titillate viewers' perception about how to deal with or accept our innate lust with diverting enlightenment, like the opening audio-only 3-minute prepares us for a journey chockablock with vicariously sensational feelings, a graphic exhibition of genitals, PPT-alike slides interposed laboriously to clarify the cerebral notions pointed by Seligman, not to mention the symbolic soul-searching process through wintry trees for Joe through the influence of her late father (Slater).Ultimately, the film reaches its climactic conclusion, Seligman is a self-claimed virgin, an asexual man predominantly basks in books, in other words, the perfect antithesis of Joe, the final humanistic touch of von Trier is to shuck off the theoretical benevolence and shatter the veneer to uncloak the intrinsic hypocrisy with an in-your-face smack, libido overrides sensibilities most of the time, fashionably-coined terminology doesn't define who you are, we falls into von Trier's cynical subterfuge involuntarily, nevertheless, it is upbeat and gratifying in the realm of my own POV.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
14,KineticSeoul,"Not really understandable, but kinda interesting",6,23 May 2014,"Lars von Trier is one of those art house directors I just can't agree with when it comes to his messages for the most part, however I can also sort of understand why he thinks the way he does. Not to come off self-indulgent, but he is somewhat understandable to a point. He seems to be a guy with a lot of thoughts and ideas about humanity even if it usually leads to depression and anxiety (which are actually few reason why people go to watch movies). Everyone has there opinions and some may come off very different from the social norm, and this movie is very different from the social norm. This centered mostly on being a nymphomaniac and the selfishness of mankind. It's like Lars combined 80% his thoughts about sex and 20% about the other stuff, like psychological mindset and hopelessness. Lars is a director that loves melancholia in art, thus puts that element in his movies like this one. The main story progresses with the interaction between a female nymphomaniac Joe(Charlotte Gainsbourg) and the psychologically calculative person Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård). And it delves into the progression into how the nympho came to be in her situation through her past story from being a kid to a teen. With her first tarnished romantic vision when it came to sex, but still couldn't relinquish her thirst for wanting more. It's basically a story of Joe's uprising and journey through her sexual endeavors. What I couldn't understand was why Joe would have sex with random people just for a bag of candy. It however delves into the subconscious of Joe, some I could kinda understand and other parts I just couldn't because it just didn't make any sense to me. I personally found certain imagery and interactions when it comes to the human mind to be interesting. Shia LaBeouf is also good in this, but that is because he is very good at playing annoying wimpy douche characters. Sure this movie does have some pretentious self-indulgent elements, but most art house movies are on the pretentious and self-indulgent side of things. And this movie is riddled with imageries that relate to sex when it comes the human mind which some audiences might find intriguing. Again some may agree with, others won't when it comes to the messages of this movie. Some may say this is pornography and I kinda agree to a degree, but this movie does not really revolve around nudity to sexually arouse the audiences. Sometimes the nudity or sex scenes are there for shock factors, but not necessarily sexual arousal. I thought Charlotte Gainsbourg was good playing her character in this, mainly because she is really good at playing broken and messed up characters and goes all out. But her constant swallowing of saliva does get kinda annoying after a while. Joe is basically a character that speaks out the mindset of Lars von Trier while Seligman represent the social norm, well at least in volume one. What I found interesting was how Joe beats herself up by talking about how her sexual hunger ruins people's lives, but justifies herself at the same time. Which is something people just do from time to time. And represents the selfish side of human-beings. The most entertaining aspects of the film are that it is shot rather unconventionally, despite the really well done cinematography. Despite few interesting parts, this movie lacks much depth. It tries to act like it does, but it really isn't. However I got what I expected out of this which is somewhat of a interesting take inside the mindset of a nymphomaniac. Not all that understandable, but again interesting.6/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
15,Hellmant,While I can't say I really enjoyed 'VOL. I' I do think it's a well made and memorable film going experience!,8,17 March 2014,"'NYMPHOMANIAC: VOL. I': Four Stars (Out of Five)The first half of writer/director Lars von Trier's two-part Danish film. The entire 5 and a half hour long uncut movie was released in Denmark at the end of last year. There's also two versions of each half (a softer and more explicit cut is being released, of both parts). The second part is due out in theaters in just a month. The film as a whole is considered the third part in the director's 'Depression Trilogy' (preceded by 'ANTICHRIST' and 'MELANCHOLIA'). It revolves around a woman, who's been obsessed with sex all of her life (and diagnosed as a nymphomaniac), who tells her life story to a man who comes to her aid after she's been beaten. It's controversial due to the fact that it contains a lot of explicit sex and it's almost all real (The genitals of pornographic actors were superimposed over the actors playing the parts in the movie, using digital compositing). While I can't say I really enjoyed 'VOL. I' (and did find it very disturbing) I do think it's a well made and memorable film going experience.Charlotte Gainsbourg stars as the nymphomaniac, of the title, named Joe (at the age of 50) and Stacy Martin plays the part when she's much younger (in flashbacks). The story begins with Joe being found, unconscious, by a man who lives near by, named Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård). She had been beaten and Seligman wants to call an ambulance for her but Joe tells him if he does she'll run away. He instead takes her back to his apartment where she tells him all about her life as a sex addict. The movie also stars Shia LaBeouf, Christian Slater, Connie Nielsen, Uma Thurman and Sophie Kennedy Clark as people from Joe's past.I definitely don't believe you can judge a movie by the actions of it's characters. If the filmmakers used exploitative or distasteful methods to tell a story (that aren't necessary) that's when a viewer can make a strong statement about whether they think a film is immoral or not. In the case of this movie I do think all the sex and nudity (depicted in it) were essential to the artistic intentions of the filmmakers. I found it to be disgusting and overly graphic at times but that's just my personal taste. I'm not going to rave about the film because I didn't love it nor do I find it to be exceptionally well made. It is a good movie though and a memorable one. I really liked Shia La Beouf's acting in it; Skarsgard, Thurman, Slater and the two leads as well. It's also very beautiful to watch at times.

Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) comes across a severely beaten woman, Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), in the alley one night.He takes her back to his apartment for recuperation. While she rests, Joe regales Seligman with the sorted saga that lead to her attack.From an early age Joe was a sexual being. It was not until her deflowering by Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf), however, that she discovered the virtues of copulation.Lover after lover, Joe details for Seligman her hypersexuality and the events that formed her professed impiety.More analytical than exploitive, writer/director Lars von Trier doesn't shy away from the dalliances. Instead he dissects them with poise and humour. Incidentally, Nymphomaniacs should make sure they have a sturdy bed.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
18,Bored_Dragon,"""When we are, death has not come. When death has come, we are not.""",10,23 January 2019,"Nymphomaniac (2013)
[Director's Cut]""Nymphomaniac"" is the final part of Lars von Trier's ""Trilogy of Depression"", after the ""Antichrist"" (2009), which was to me inexplicably dull and unjustified morbid, and ""Melancholy"" (2011), which I have not yet come to see. Originally, ""Nymphomaniac"" was conceived as a single film but, due to its inhumane length, in the theatrical release, it was divided into two two-hour films. I am watching the director's cut, which lasts five and a half hours.The first film begins with a scene in which an older man encounters a beaten woman lying on the street. After she refuses an ambulance and the police, he takes her to his apartment and places her in bed. Then he sits down next to her and she tells him her whole life, the life of a nymphomaniac. Occasionally he interrupts her with interesting comments on various topics, such as philosophy, nature, music, literature, mathematics and even fishing, but all these digressions are directly or metaphorically related to the main subject of the film and represent life philosophies that will lead you to thinking and self-analysis, especially if in some of them you recognize yourself.The film is full of explicit pornography, but this time it is not there just to shock and cause controversy, but it greatly enhances the artistic power of film and contributes to the credibility and the dramatic nature of the story. The sex scenes are not simulated, they are genuine pornography, but they were shot by porn actors and subsequently edited together with the bodies of the main actors. The film is fantastically shot and directed, and drama and pornographic scenes alternate in perfect harmony. The atmosphere is hypnotically dark and depressing, additionally empowered with an interesting selection of music, which ranges from industrial metal band Rammstein, through rock classics, to Bach's organ compositions. Although the movie is very slow and long, my attention has not been weakened for a moment.In all three films of the ""Trilogy of Depression"", Charlotte Gainsbourg plays the main role, but as the first part of the ""Nymphomaniac"" takes us through her childhood and girlhood, in the main role we see Stacy Martin, who, although not particularly beautiful, is extremely cute and sexual, and in every way a sight for sore eyes in comparison with Charlotte. Charlotte's rescuer is played by Stellan Skarsgård, who appears in a total of seven von Trier's films. There is also Christian Slater in the role of Nymphomaniac's father, as well as Uma Thurman, who gave perhaps the best performance in her career. Stacy, Charlotte, and Stellan topped their roles, but in her relatively short scene, Uma Thurman completely overshadowed them. Her scene is totally over the top, but still somehow realistic and believable. This somewhat relates to the film in its entirety, but Uma's scene is one of the most powerful I've ever seen. Ruthlessly awkward, strongly emotional and definitely unforgettable. Uma deserved an Oscar big as the Statue of Liberty.There's still three hours of the second movie left for me to make a final judgment, but for now, this is a pure ten.Seligman: ""Well, I divide humanity into two groups: the people who cut the nails on the left hand first, and the people who cut the nails of the right hand first. My theory is that the people who cut the nails of the left hand first they're more light-hearted. They have a tendency to enjoy life more, because they go straight for the easiest task, and save the difficulties for later. So, what do you do?""
Joe: ""Always the left hand first. I don't think there's a choice. Go for the pleasure first, always. And then when you've done the left hand, only the right hand remains. That's the easiest one left.""
Seligman: ""I never thought of it like that. Well, you're never too old. Never too old to learn.""10/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
19,Reno-Rangan,The first phase of transformation of young Joe.,8,7 May 2014,"The Danish director Lars Von Trier is one of the rarest among who rapidly changes theme, plot and genre in his each movie. I love his filmography and been watching those for some time now. I am not a great fan of musical themes, but his movie 'Dancer in the Dark' is one of my all time favourites. These all led me here to take a quick glance on his latest two installment movie series.This movie tells a story of a woman called Joe, who suffers from being a nymphomaniac. Especially this first movie briefs her life as a youngster who seeks a different class of men to fulfill her sexual thirst. This story was told in a series of flashbacks when middle aged Joe recalls her earlier story in the presence of an old man. The stories she told was presented in chapters like a book and each chapter contains different characters in different phases of her life. She spits all her secrets that were preserved so far which stuns the old man.''The secret ingredient to sex... is love''In between the breaks of the chapters the old man brings up some comparison of book, history and art to her story. I don't know, Von Trier might thought to convince the audience by saying it is not just a fiction, but the reappearance of history in the modern world. Well, he succeeds, but some people won't agree for not shown in a decent manner. I mean everything in the movie was raw. It makes me think the world (filmmaking) is not anymore the same.The commitment given by the actors were exceptional. The kind of shock that Von Trier gives through this movie will remain with me for a long time. He approached with this to the different class of audience where the majority will remain silent and away from it. This part was so much better as it stands true to its title where part 2 a bit reorders everything and travels in an alternate direction. Especially the end was so sudden and makes us to feel an incomplete. It is better to watch one after another without giving much space and that is how it works most probably.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
20,Dr_Coulardeau,Lars von Trier really has a Jewish problem in his mind.,7,23 August 2015,"That's a monumental film with four hours of moving pictures that end in one single sequence that alas changes the whole meaning of these four hours. But let's keep that last sequence for the end.The film has a subject that is irritatingly made sibylline by the parentheses in the place of the O in the title. These parentheses could mean many things but they always have to mean that something is in- between them, and in a title it can only be the person this title indicates, hence Joe. She is thus asserted to be in-between two things and though we do not understand what she is in-between when looking at the title, we very fast understand many possible meanings.Right at the beginning of the story, a story that is being told to us by the voice over of Joe herself and the voice over of Seligman, her benefactor, savior and listener, she tells us about a vision she had when twelve or so with two women appearing in the sky, one being seen more or less like the Holy Virgin by Joe herself. But Seligman at once introduces another interpretation. One is Valeria Messalina, Emperor Claudius's wife, and the second is the Whore of Babylon. The first one is a woman with a very dubious reputation though that reputation is probably more the result of political strife than of real facts. ""She was a paternal cousin of the Emperor Nero, a second-cousin of the Emperor Caligula, and a great-grandniece of the Emperor Augustus. A powerful and influential woman with a reputation for promiscuity, she allegedly conspired against her husband and was executed on the discovery of the plot."" (Wikipedia) The Whore of Babylon everyone knows since she is the great monstrous promiscuous by profession heroin of Saint John's Apocalypse, or Book of Revelation. It is strange a girl of twelve could have a vision of these two women though she has no religious education and she does not recognize them, hence she does not know them. That's the type of detail that shows that Lars von Trier is manipulating us because he wants to introduce Seligman as someone who knows about this all because as we are told he is a Jew and he tells us his name means ""the blessed man"" in German or Yiddish. He even clearly says he is an anti-Zionist and he declares that anti-Zionism does not mean anti-Semitism though many people think the opposite. . . . And then we come to the end and what Joe says then is essential:""Even if only one in a million succeeds in mentally, bodily and in her heart of ridding herself of her sexuality, this is now my goal."" (Seligman: ""Is that a life worth living?"") ""It's the only way I can live. I will stand up against all odds. Just like a deformed tree on a hill. I will muster all my stubbornness, my strength, my masculine aggression. But most of all I want to say thanks to my new and maybe first friend. Thank you, Seligman, who perhaps is happy when all is said and done. I'm happy at any rate that the shot didn't go off and made me a murderer. If I may, I'd like to sleep now.""We are surprised by the ""masculine aggression"" in this discourse because she never showed any masculinity at all. Her aggressiveness was always feminine sexuality and submission to masculine violence, willingly in her masochistic-sadistic period and unwillingly in her last encounter with Jerome. The script here does not correspond to the film we have seen, because that script would imply her lovers were nothing but clandestine homosexuals.But the film that could stop there with Seligman getting out, Joe turning of the light and going to sleep, does not reach its end then. A final sequence is added with Seligman, in his shirt coming back into the room and trying to take advantage of sleeping Joe. We understand Joe refuses, we hear Seligman arguing she has done it with a lot of men, as if that argument gave him the right to take what he suddenly wanted after having explained that he was a virgin, that he had never had a woman, not a man as for that. We hear a shot in the total darkness on the screen, pants being zipped up and then feminine shoe steps going away. She became a murderer after all.But that was inescapable after the four hours of Freudian rationalizing about Joe. The shocking element in this last sequence is that the one who tries to take Joe without her consent, the one who has no moral ethics at all in such a situation where Joe had enshrined in him her total trust is also a Jew. This ending implies that Jews do not ask before taking, and Jews are perverts and a few other things. That last sequence is absolutely and inescapably anti-Semite. Why did Lars von Trier inject that last touch of unacceptable ideology in a film that had been too long for one and too intellectual for two, but it had remained free of sexism, racism and anti-Semitism. Unluckily the last sequence changes that last fact and this is not acceptable, just the same as the sexism implied by a man taking a woman without her consent. Does it reveal the film is anti-Semite? Definitely yes. Does it say anything about the author and director? Certainly not. Then what is the director's motivation in that last touch of anti-Semitism? He is the only one who can answer this question but it is definitely out of place in this film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
21,johnnyboyz,"Difficult film to love, but rarely uninteresting and oddly captivating when it's at its best.",7,21 January 2017,"Reaching a comprehensive conclusion on the first part of Lars von Trier's ""Nymphomaniac"" is a grisly yet satisfying exercise. The film is generally refreshingly observationalist, in its taking a step back from what it depicts – from what I can garner, it neither glamorises nor demonises to any great extent the behaviour of the characters within. By the end, the characters have been neither punished nor rewarded for their actions. There is a very cold, empty tonality to von Trier's first Nymphomaniac volume, but this is not a criticism – the life of the film's lead, a middle aged woman who goes by the surely deliberately androgynous name of Joe (Jo), has almost entirely consisted of furrowing about trying to find that next lay with the opposite sex. She has done very little else and, despite living through the latter half of the twentieth century, not to mention possessing a gift for oration, we sense has very little else say on any other subject.The film consists almost entirely of flashback. It is Charlotte Gainsbourg playing present-tense Joe, a woman found beaten and bloodied on the concrete courtyard of an apartment block in an unspecific English locality on a rainy day. Stellan Skarsgård's Seligman, a grey suited monosyllabic neighbour from abroad, finds her en route coming home from the local shop - rather than call for help when she asks him not to, he brings her back to his dwelling so that she may recover and that is when she decides to recount her life hedonistic life-story which will lead us to this very moment.In the past, she is played by new-comer Stacy Martin, whose job it is to bring to life Joe's years of adolescence and young adulthood – one characterised by a radical outlook of anti-marriage; anti-bourgeois and anti-love on top of a demonstrating of just how much of a bohemian hedonist she really is. During this time, she will garner some menial office work; maintain a friendship with her father and have an on-off relationship with boyfriend Jerome (Shia LaBeouf). It is during these scenes that von Trier seems to combine props; attire and other mise-en-scene from the 1960's; 70's and 80's to create a very non-specific era –his shooting of it in Germany is further designed to disorientate us during the viewing.But why was she lying on the concrete, bloodied and bruised, in the first scene? Why is she deciding to tell Seligman her tale in the first place? What, precisely, is Skarsgård in relation to anything at all anyway? These are not questions von Trier answers in Volume One – indeed, they are in a sense irrelevant to the film's nucleus. But then, what of that? It seems to be that, no matter what you are talking about, be it fly-fishing; organ music or something else, you can incorporate philosophies or stances on sex into it – sex is life and life is sex and parallels can be found between the actions of a good fly-fisherman and a woman on the prowl; between the makeup of the specifics of a Johann Sebastian Bach sonata and the way a sex-addict balances their lovers. Correlations and equivalents are everywhere, if only people would just take the time out to look for them...But is this really the end of it? Perhaps one character is actually the figment of the other's imagination: a bored, single and lonely Seligman imagines he meets Joe coming home and concocts a story possessing everything he doesn't have. Moreover, perhaps a concussed Joe is still lying there in the street imagining aid from a stranger. Whatever the case, von Trier essentially allows his audience to fulfil the role of Seligman – someone who listens on in either silent awe or restrained disgust at how Joe had a sexual revelation as a young child with her friend Bea (Sophie Kennedy Clark) and decided to act on it in a way that saw her spend her teenage years as she did.Their dual-dynamic itself opens up several tins of numerous kinds of worms in its basis – the gender imbalance is a pseudo-feminist driven psychoanalytic nightmare: a clear distinction between orator and receiver, it is the woman propelling proceedings but her tale is one of often perpetual sexual humiliation as she lowers herself to playing the whore; the tart; the loser. She has nothing else in life and is one-dimensional – she recounts her experiences for the pleasure of the male, be it Seligman or the member of the audience.While they are Joe's experiences, the entire film seems to be made up of figments of Seligman's imagination: it is he who is picturing Joe in the bathroom; on the train and with on-off boyfriend Jerome – something alluded to when he tries to picture Joe studying geography although apologies for imagining it incorrectly before we carry on again. Then, there is the problem of the unreliable narrator – an issue Seligman himself even raises towards the end when he deliberately stops Joe mid-flow on account of not believing an aspect of the story she is telling. This is an odd and very disorientating moment, wherein Seligman wrestles power off the story-teller and is suddenly in command of what we play witness to.What are we left with when everything is said and done? We certainly come away feeling like we have experienced something – there is a centrepiece which I will not spoil that seems to get stuck in to whether Joe has lived a worthy life: it reaches the conclusion that she has not, for bohemianism and nymphomania is a fatuous, rotten thing which destroys your life and the lives of those around you – lives you did not even know existed. Indifference is a strange reaction to have to the film, but then loving it or hating it is very difficult. I would certainly recommend it, but with reservations.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
22,filipemanuelneto,Very little art in a movie that would be boring if it didn't have so much sex.,3,7 December 2017,"Contrary, perhaps, to the majority of the public, I decided to see this film because of the name of its director, Lars von Trier. If I liked ""Antichrist"", I don't know yet very well what to think about this film. The script is the story of a woman who calls herself a nymphomaniac, but whose pursuit of pleasure seems to have taken her too far, to the point that she also wants to believe that she's a lousy human being. When she is found fainted after a beating, she decides to tell her life to the nice man who helped her. From there, the film unfolds into two intercommunicating ways: the dissolute life of this girl, Joe, and the exchange of comments between her and the good Samaritan, Seligman, who insists on not seeing her alleged perversity.The film is absolutely loaded with explicit sex, with genitals close ups and penetration scenes. Von Trier remains faithful to the rule of showing everything that is spoken. So this movie requires you to be, at least, able not to be scandalized by that. On the other hand, sex scenes are so cruel and insensitive that you probably will not take any pleasure in watching it. This is not a porn movie made for us to get excited, but the idea is to get the opposite effect: like Joe, we don't feel anything. Emotionally violent, the film raises constant moral and ethical issues regarding religion, psychology, relationships, etc.Charlotte Gainsbourg has done well enough in this film, although its not the best performance of her career, and the same can be said about Stellan Skarsgård. Their performances seemed too warm and very monotone, and their dialogues range from obscenity to the monotony of the most sterile philosophical discussions. In contrast, Joe and Seligman could not be on more opposing poles: She's a girl who lives to feed her sexual addiction, in a way that we would find dirty and reprehensible; Seligman is absolutely pure and innocent, inasmuch as he does nothing wrong, he is a virgin and lives in a world of books, theories and classical music. Uma Thurman seems to be in the middle. She is the most violent and intense actress in the film, in that she plays the betrayed woman, a person just like any of us, who saw her life being destroyed by a lolita. And so, the emotive and explosive way as she behaves comes closer to us than any other character.I liked the actors and the way they worked, I think it suits the movie and the characters they gave them. I liked the way the theme was presented, with the sinner making a confession in a repentant way to a man who seems to be above mortals. But the movie is damaged by the absence of art, by the monotony of the dialogues, by the perversion of sex and the omnipresence of pointless sex scenes all over.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
23,leonblackwood,Shocking and entertaining! 7/10,7,15 November 2014,"Review: What an epic tale of a girl who is addicted to sex. Its brilliantly put together and it's very well written. Her whole life story is shocking and very emotional and the realistic scenes can be a bit off putting in some ways, but they all contribute to this intense emotional rollacoaster. Uma Thurman, Shia LaBeouf and Christian Slater, all put in excellent performances but the actors that stand out for me, has to be the leading actress, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgard who has a loving nature. I'm glad that I'm watching both volumes back to back because I would have been annoyed if it ended like it did in the first volume. Anyway, this is definitely a big eye opener of a world that I really didn't know existed. Watchable!Round-Up: I really didn't know that this film was going to be so in depth and prolific. Its only a couple of notches down from a soft porn movie, but if you look past the sex scenes, the storyline is unique and original. After watching the bonus parts of the DVD, the actors were also shocked with the script, but they all gave it there all, regardless of shame and there status. Basically it's one of those movies that people will be talking about for some time because everyone will have there own personal views about her morals behind her actions. Budget: $4.7million Worldwide Gross: $13.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there extremely deep dramas about a girl who is addicted to sex and tries to moralise her many conquests, to a stranger who takes her in. 7/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Having just undergone a beating, hence the end of Volume Two will make sense, she's taken in by old and virginal loner, Stellansgard, who tops Gainborough's performance, his best to date, along with many other great performances, least of all Slater, who plays Joe's dad, who's still bloody good too. Don't write him off. Stellansgard, a patient and listening ear, really taking in what's being said, where at one point Gainsborough, accuses him of not listening, becomes like a kind of shrink to her problems, her gluttonous need for sex. Yeah, through a numbers of chapters, we start from her innocent childhood, a scene, predators, can lap it up, where she discovered her anatomy. We move on to her teens years, still with the same friend, who play this game on a train, to see how many men they can snag for a f..k, where the trophy, is a bag of smarties. Whoopee! Some simulated oral scenes will shock, but remember you've walked into a Lars Von Trier's film. As the story progresses, we cut back and forth to the cosy scene of confession and listener of our wonderful two mains, where Joe grows as a woman, humping her way through more men, as her dad falls sick, (the scenes with her as a little girl and Slater, taking walks in the woods I really liked). Breaking off a number of relationships, inevitably, one lover clings on, throwing away his marriage whatever, and moving in. Get ready for one funny scene that ensues, involving wife, Uma Thurman, who I did not recognize at first, visiting Dad's whore, bringing her three boys, who look traumatized, where as actors, obviously didn't know what the hell was going on. The scenes a bit over the top, and out of the ordinary, Again refer to - A Lars Von Triers film. Shia La Beouf brings the impressive kind of acting we expect from him, as Joe's virginity stealer, who volunteers on short notice, a little arithmatic involved too. He shows up later, as her boss at her new job. Too, I must mention the beautiful fly fishing scenes that fit into the story. Like Vol 2, and this one, Trier overindulges with the shocking and pornographic sex, and nudity, and our teen philly Joe, is a tasty sight in the raw (unlike Gainsborough) while speaking in a elegant sexy voice. But Trier overindulging, is very entertaining, for obvious reasons, by giving us something different in Art house. Thanks Lars.

I'll have to see it again, maybe I missed some subtleties. Stacy Martin is new, fresh, almost a revelation, in the most difficult role of the film.

27,freemantle_uk,"Bold, Thoughtful and Explicit",8,1 March 2014,"As you would expect from the controversial Lars von Trier and a film  called Nymphomaniac, you know in advance that we are not getting a shy,  conservative affair and von Trier does not disappoint. The infamous  director manages to craft a two-part film which fans of art-house  cinema will be salivating from the mouth over.  In a ubiquitous British town, Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) finds Joe  (Charlotte Gainsbourg) unconscious in an alley way. Seligman takes Joe  back to his home where Joe tells him she is a bad person and tells him  her story from her childhood, to young adulthood (Stacy Martin), to  present day, reflecting on her sexual experiences and major  relationships, while the intelligential Seligman and Older Joe  philosophising and interpreting her actions.  Von Trier does not hold back from showing various sexual activity and  Joe's descent into sexual violence, as she looks for more extreme ways  to get a thrill as her behaviour and needs take a physical, mental and  social toll on Joe. Nymphomaniac is unflinching with its sex scenes,  Joe getting hit hard during her sadomasochist sessions and showing of  male and female genitalia of all shapes and sizes, including wince  inducting moments when showing the harm on Joe's private parts go  through.  Throughout the film we see Joe's sexual journey, from her fascination  as a child to her pleasure herself and seek fulfilment. There are many  different aspects of Joe's sexuality during Nymphomaniac, using sex as  an escape when her father (Christian Salter) and the indifferent on  face when she competes with her friend to seduce as many men as  possible during a train journey. Von Trier explores many of the  destructive aspects of being a sex addict, destroying friendships,  being unable to form any relationships with partners and family,  struggle to have emotional attachments and the impact that Joe's  actions has on others. Joe is a character who rejects the idea of love  and romance and leads to the question, does Joe reject it because of  her upbringing, her addiction makes her unable to love or because is it  because of her inability to loves makes her a sex addict? The  discussions between Older Joe and Seligman are a framing device and  allow von Trier to explore the philosophical parts of the story. But  this is when von Trier spells out his views and meanings of the film.  Both Older Joe and Seligman are used discuss to complex mathematical  theorems, religious iconography, the meaning of words and morality. But  to be fair, some of the elements do require specific knowledge so some  explanation was needed.  Nymphomaniac's cast features von Trier regulars, established talent  like Jamie Bell and Uma Thurman and new actors with Stacy Martin,  Sophie Kennedy Clark and Mia Goth. The performances range from good to  excellent and the new young actresses do show real talent, as they give  fantastic performances.  The let down in the cast is Shia LaBeouf. It is easy to mock LaBeouf  because of his recent off screen antics, but his performance was  hampered when you can play guess the accent. My own personal guesses  were Scottish, Irish, New Zealander and South African and other  people's guesses ranged from Cockney, Australian and Scandinavian.  Von Trier and his cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro were able to  combine both a grim, kitchen sink realistic aesthetic, while also  making sure von Trier adds artistic flourishes, as he uses graphics,  text and cross cutting to various images. Despite some of the heavy  themes and imagery, von Trier made sure moments dark humour and wit to  help lighten the mood and prevent Nymphomaniac from being too  depressing as an experience.  Nymphomaniac is an interesting, thoughtful film that is more than about  controversy and titillation. Filled with a mostly excellent cast,  Nymphomaniac should please fans of von Trier and art-house cinema.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Nymphomaniac, like ""Shame"" and ""Looking For Mister Goodbar"", is yet another sordid, unsavoury and sneering look at the consequences that are apparently supposed to result from excessive promiscuity.When it comes to sheer heavy-handedness - This shamelessly preachy, little picture self-righteously tells the viewer that having lots of sex with many partners is a hateful thing (so don't you dare love it).This is the sort of movie that neither stimulates the mind nor arouses the libido. Nope. It absolutely numbs both. If you are expecting Nymphomaniac to live up to its title as being an intensely pleasant and wildly erotic experience, you are definitely in for a major disappointment.Incompetently directed by Lars Von Trier (who must be an utterly despicable prig) - Nymphomaniac amounted to being nothing but a dreary, little soap opera (with lots of graphic sex thrown in for good measure) that took 4 frickin' hours to get its shallow, sex-hating point across.....

29,meeza,"OK, but not satisfied",7,5 December 2014,"""Nymphomaniac: Volume 1"" sure has its high volume of gratuitous sex and symbolic interpretations. Writer-Director Lars Von Trier charters dangerous, controversial waters again with yet another risqué subject matter. This times he comes to the world of obsessed sexuality and its psyche. Von Trier favorite Charlotte Gainsbourg stars as our nymph protagonist Joe. Joe is bruised & battered on the street at the beginning of the film and is found by a caring stranger named Seligman; played by another Von Trier fav Stellan Skarsgard. Seligman takes in Joe, and slowly Joe tells him about her nymphomaniac life chapters; from the climatic genesis of her sexuality to the sadistic end. Many of the sexual scenes in the film include a young Joe who seduces at a rampant pace; you can call her Mighty Joe Young. ""Nymphomaniac: Volume 1"" is yet another depressed offering by Von Trier; and its in the opposite spectrum as the ""feel good"" movie of the year. Now, don't get me wrong, Von Trier did show the story of the young Joe in a compelling manner, but the talking scenes between an older Joe and Seligman did not excite one bit.

30,parry_na,Spoilers for parts 1 and 2.,9,9 February 2018,"'Nymphomaniac' is a huge project written and directed by Lars von Trier. Trier has proven a controversial figure over the years, with his filmic output attracting similar contention and many awards (Shia LaBeouf, who stars as Jerome, has said about von Trier that he is 'dangerous. He scares me. And I'm only going to work now when I'm terrified.'). Trier suffers from depression, and appears to inject some of his personality into the characters. This is my first experience of his work, and I absolutely love it.A beautifully directed opening, simply featuring snow falling on an industrial landscape, water dripping from roofing, slowly reveals the beaten and broken figure of a young woman Joe. She is found by lonesome scholar, bachelor Seligman, whose quiet ways mask his erudite intelligence. When Joe stirs, she too, is very well spoken, very refined. After she refuses medical treatment, he takes her to his spacious but dilapidated home. Therein, with the falling snow outside acting as a constant backdrop, she tells him about herself. She is a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac, and despises herself for it. Using his own interests as a yardstick, Seligman interprets her self-loathing, often into something more positive. Joe's stories are divided into various chapters, sometimes resulting in her destroying lives and relationships, sometimes not. Seligman's precise and dispassionate synopsis is because he is a virgin and remains sexually unmoved by Joe's forthright, graphic accounts.Possibly the most disturbing chapter is 6. ""The Eastern and the Western Church (The Silent Duck)"", in which Joe visits 'K' (Jamie Bell) to assuage her never-ending sexual dependency. The violence inflicted upon her willing person is punishing and sadistic - and it comes at a heavy price: the loss of Joel and son Marcel. Here we are actually seeing the regular repercussions and personal consequences of her condition and it is horrific.'Nymphomaniac' is fascinating throughout. The playing is exemplary, the direction beautifully contrasting the ramshackle calm of Seligman's existence, and the unstoppable, often self-destructive calamity of Joe's addiction to sex. Sometimes the scenes are extremely graphic for a brief time, but such is the surrounding story and reasons for her carnal addiction, they convey the nature of her being rather than shock. There is a poetic sense of symmetry to certain events, words and statistics that ensures many things come full circle. And ultimately, that the flaws of the characters dovetail each other in a very satisfying manner.The cast list contains Charlotte Gainsburg and Stacey Martin as Joe at different ages, Stellan Skarsgård as Seligman, and features Christian Slater, Uma Thurman, William Defoe and Udo Kier amongst many other very talented, naturalistic actors. The excellent Mia Goth plays 'P' (Goth is starring in a forthcoming remake of 'Suspiria' in 2018). My only complaint would be that the actors playing young versions of the characters look unlike the older versions - that is, if everything else wasn't so perfect. And perfect isn't a word I have cause to use very often.'Nymphomaniac' was released in two parts in the UK, but has a total running time of either 241 minutes or 325 minutes, depending on whether you see the uncut version or not. It has deservedly won multiple awards, including three for Trier himself. Devoting the time to watch is an undertaking, but is worth it, because your eyes will never dare to leave the screen.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
31,sauravjoshi85,A good movie on an unorthodox subject,8,6 June 2020,"Nymphomaniac is an erotic drama movie directed by Lars Von Trier and stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stacy Martin, Stellan Skarsgård, Shia LaBeouf, Christian Slater and Uma Thurman in the leads.The movie is being made on a very bold and controversial subject. There is no doubt that sex is an integral part of everyone's life but discussing it in an open forum is still considered as a taboo but Lars Von Trier has done the unorthodox by making a movie on it.The movie is very slow but compelling. The director is been successful in touching the aspects which is generally avoided by many filmmakers even by those who had chose to make movies on sex addiction.Acting is great and special mention for Shia LaBeouf who had successfully played his teenage and adult version perfectly. Both female characters were also impressive but Stacy Martin deserves more appreciation. Support characters are equally impressive.The movie is made on a very bold subject and is full of nudity so viewers discretion is recommended. The movie might disturb some viewers with lots of nudity and close scene of intercourse.Cinematography and background music is good. Direction is superb and acting as I mentioned earlier is strong. The expectation is high for the second part and hoping for a good second part.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
32,TdSmth5,"Some good parts, some weak parts",8,22 February 2015,"Review of the short version.Some woman named ""Joe"" for some reason, lies beaten on the street. A stranger offers to call the ambulance but she refuses. He takes her to his place. He asks if she wants to talk about it. She doesn't know where to start. Once he starts talking about fishing, she realizes where to start--at the beginning.When she was little she had a friend called ""B"". B came up with all the ideas for games and stuff to do and it involved the discovery of their bodies. Joe quickly discovered her genitals. Her father was a dr. who told her about nature and trees. Her mother she couldn't stand. In her teens she decides to lose her virginity quickly to some guy named Jerome. Later in their teens B and Joe play a contest to see who can sleep with the most strangers on a train. The winner gets a bag of candies.In the next chapter, and Joe's life is told in chapters, she and B form a club of girls who are against love. But eventually they all start falling in love with someone, even B, who tells Joe that the secret ingredient to sex is love. So Joe leaves the club, studies medicine but breaks off the studies. With no skills she applies for a job at a printing company as a secretary, which she thought required no skills. The boss there turns out to be Jerome. While she starts sleeping again with men, she fantasizes about Joe, but plays games with him, leading him on but not giving in, which drives him crazy. Eventually she falls in love with him but he's gone.Now Joe start sleeping with lots of men, every day, and tells of the scheduling problems that causes. Because she can't keep the men all apart she calls some random one to tell him something random, like breaking things off. When she tries to break things off with a married guy as she says, because he won't leave his wife, he suddenly shows up at her door with his things. Behind him is his wife with their three kids, to show them their dad's new place. She doesn't make a scene but clearly makes him look bad in front of his three sons. Then Joe's next appointment shows up and the wife flips out.Joe then presumably tones down her promiscuity. It's also around that time that her father ends up in the hospital with terminal cancer and dies. Watching him lose his mind and body is too much stress for Joe and she again start sleeping with any man she runs into at the hospital.In the final chapter in part I, Joe runs into Jerome and she starts a relationship with him. She also sleeps with two other guys who each offer something, but sex with Jerome is the complete package, until suddenly she can't feel anything anymore.All of her stories are prefaced and sometimes interrupted by observations made by the man who finds some metaphor for her stories, or she'll find an episode in her life a metaphor for something he says. We learn a bit about him as well. He's a well-read guy so he sees unusual connections in the details of Joe's stories all this while Joe keeps telling him how bad and sinful she is, something which the guy at thing point cannot agree with at all.Nymphomania I offers some insightful ideas about sex, love, relationships, fishing, music, etc. Missing for the most part though is the characteristic Von Trier editing and some of his humor, of which we get only few examples here. Coming-of-age stories are always entertaining and this movie starts out very strong with chapter 1 as we witness Joe make casual sex the main part of her life even though she gets no pleasure from it. But things do go downhill afterward. Joe's fascination with Jerome makes no sense, even more so since the character is portrayed by the awful Lebeauouf. The long chapter with the wife also doesn't really add much to the story. While Thurman can at least act, she has no place in this movie either; no American actor belongs in this movie. The chapter with the dying father is rather ugly. So far it's not clear the source of her nymphomania, what need sex fulfills for her, other than the occasional therapy.This movie even in the short version doesn't compel your attention the whole time. Things are slow, not much happens and the attention to detail that Von Trier offered in his previous work is reduced here. But it is perhaps some of the more accessible of his work.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
33,Amari-Sali,"In a rather complicated, yet poetic, journey, one young woman speaks on her experiences with sex and intimacy.",9,26 May 2014,"It is hard to say what drew me to this movie. Be it the suggestive poster, all the whoopla over the sex, or just my infinite wonder of how Shia LaBeouf went from Even Stevens to a quite accomplished actor. Either way, despite all the focus being on sex, I figured like Blue is the Warmest Color, the reason sex was the focus is simply because ""sex sells."" Though I hoped when I started the movie that the film would be far more than well written soft core porn.Characters & StoryJoe (Adult: Charlotte Gainsbourg/ Young: Stacy Martin) is a quite complex girl. She is a sex connoisseur, self-proclaimed nymphomaniac, and yet defies most of the stereotypes associated with a woman who loves sex. She is intelligent, clever, and though she does hookup with strangers, even a married man, there is a difficulty to listen to all this and still not see her humanity. Something which Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard) sees as well. For, after finding Joe lying down, bruised and bloodied in an alley, he takes her into his apartment and tries to understand how she ended up there.This leads her onto telling a vulgar, sexual, erotic, poetic, sympathetic, insightful, and dare I even say: thought-provoking story. One which leads you to understand what the concept of sex means, outside of the realms of love which it often is associated with. It makes it be anything from simple human to human intimacy, something to relieve stress, and strips it down to its most basic form.Alongside this though is Joe's story which, thanks to the excellent writing of Lars von Trier, makes it so that even when you are watching two people pounding genitals, making love, or simply having sex, as sexual as it is, it never becomes something done just to excite your senses, a la a HBO/ Showtime program. It has deeper meaning, and supports the story, rather than be used to represent the climax (no pun intended), like how it is used in romantic films, or be used because the actors agree to it. And arguably, as Joe says at the end of the film, after a while you become desensitized to the point where Joe having sex is like Olivia Pope on Scandal drinking wine. It is just a part of her character's hobbies.PraiseOne of the things you always have to admire about filmmakers who don't seek blockbusters is that they really do focus on reminding us cinema is more than a means of entertainment, but a true art form. One which can combine controversial things, like a woman owning her sexuality, while presenting the guilt which comes with sex; the issue of how pleasurable it can be, producing the feelings you have sinned; and then adding the idea that a strong love for sex doesn't make a person any less human.Which Stacy Martin, who plays the teen-young adult version of Joe, does magnificently. We watch her carefully go from naïve to someone fully in command. All the while trying to understand human nature and needs. Be it for love, money, or even time to one's self. Then, with Skarsgard's character, though at first he is presented as the usual older man taking in a young woman to be some knight in shining armor, in many ways he becomes her student. Not in sex, nor even life really. Just, she helps him understand how appearances can be deceiving, and how even with the back-story of a person told, you still can be left in the fog and know nothing.For while you can tell facts, and explain feelings, this is far different from experiencing something. And between Von Trier's words; the conversation between adult Joe and Seligman; combined with Martin as young Joe brings the conversation, and Von Trier's script to life, to really pick apart and praise each bit would take longer to write/ read than the film is.CriticismQuite honestly I am drawing a blank. Admittedly, the film can feel a bit long, and while the sex scenes are interesting, especially since they do seem to be about Joe getting off as much as the guy, which is sort of rare in film, I must admit that once you get to the 5th or 6th sex scene, you may start growing annoyed when they pop up. Other than that, I guess the only other critique is that you sort of wish they went into more details about her lovers, but with her implying that most of them were just sex partners, there seemingly isn't anything to additionally add, without making it seem she was carrying on actual relationships and not just having f buddies.Overall: Worth SeeingNaturally, I wouldn't say to see this with a prude, or someone you'd have to explain sex to, but for a mature adult this is a good film. For while it may feel a bit dragged out, and have so much sex that it is desensitizing, the sex is just one of the things to bring press. The story itself is very much like the analogies Seligman uses to explain fishing. You will get hooked and caught in the net of von Trier's film, and rather than suffer like many fish do, you are taken, played around for a bit, and left with an odd mix of feelings including discomfort, curiosity, and a heightened sense for everything said makes you want to look at the world in a different way, experience more, and listen more even. Which, to me, is why this is worth seeing. After all, how often do you get something out of a movie besides saying you spent $12 for a good way to kill time?",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
34,Amyth47,"Boring, Actually.",2,20 February 2019,"My Rating : 2/10Lars Von Trier has always been an edgy director so you know you're in for something hard-to-watch as he tackles difficult subjects in a complex manner. In 'Nymphomaniac: Vol. I' he explores nymphomania in his usual artistic manner meant to push the envelope as much as possible. Well, what can I say? I find myself in the 'this-is-just-a-$hitty-$ex-movie' category, unfortunately.It didn't click with my sensibilities and I didn't find any deeper meanings or intellectually stimulating exploration of the protagonist's helplessness.WHY?

35,Rob_Taylor,An utter waste of your time.,1,6 March 2014,"It's rare I give a movie a single star, but I'll do it here. Before anyone freaks, let me say that the pornography did not in any way bother me at all. I've seen plenty of porn in my time and all of it, without exception, was done better than in this film.The problem I have with this movie is more to do with the fact that it is deadly tedious and boring! No, seriously, with this much T&A in a film, it still manages to be utterly boring. It is impossible to empathise with the central female character because she seems so totally unlikable. She happily screws anyone and anything that she lays eyes on.As a study of actual nymphomaniacs, I find this rather blunt portrayal of people with a sexual problem to be gratuitous and sensationalist and totally without any real concern for the subject matter being ""showcased"". It wasn't enough to simply follow the plight of a woman with a problem, you had to put her into every conceivable sexual cliché there was, just to get across your point that she was a sex addict?Let me put it this way. If I went to a local porn shop, rented a dozen different movies about a dozen different aspects of sexual activity, then spliced the footage together with the non-sexual content from Nymphomaniac, you wouldn't notice the difference. Everything from bondage and sado-masochism, to threesomes, anal, oral, lesbianism and interracial material shows up here. It's like a porno pick 'n' mix!Most of the time I was laughing so much at the utter absurdity of it. As I said, it's impossible to feel any kind of sympathy for the woman in the ""story"" (yeah, I used quotes deliberately there..) because the whole thing is such a sorry mess.What we have here is another attempt to make a ""cerebral"" movie that falls flat on its face. The audience for this movie is unidentifiable. Those seeking a thoughtful study will be sorely disappointed and those looking for cheap titillation will find themselves bored to tears most of the time. Anyone seeking an actual story will likewise be left feeling cheated.All in all, it fails. Another over-hyped excuse for ""cinematic art"" that accomplishes none of its stated goals. If it succeeds, it will be because people have been suckered into thinking its something that it isn't.This is so preposterous that I expect the DVD/BluRay release will have a bright yellow, star-shaped sticker on the front emblazoned with the words ""Contains actual penises and vaginas!"" in a sensationalist font.SUMMARY: Pretentious nonsense masquerading as an art movie. Hollow and dull, relying too much on its much-hyped pornographic content which is, frankly, dull as ditch water. Best avoided, though it is amusing in a ""train-wreck"" kind of way.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
36,cricket30,The joke's on YOU: Just how much of a non-sexual . . .,6,15 April 2014,". . . Unerotic, libido-killing turn-off is NYMPHOMANIAC VOLUME ONE? Is there a reason Sex Addicts Anonymous plays this at their ""Quitting Cold Turkey"" retreats? You Betcha. Tons of reasons. One of the biggest is Christian Slater's feces-smeared butt. Director Lars Von Trier lets his camera linger on this Poopy Mess, as Slater--portraying title character Ms. Joe's dad--madly raves on his death bed, imprisoned by a strait jacket. Von Trier's only gesture of mercy toward we popcorn munchers is filming this lengthy segment in black & white. VOLUME ONE (and I must stress that I'm writing this BETWEEN volumes, the only fair way to review this initial installment) begins with 104 seconds of black screen, before S. notices Ms. Joe lying in an alley. As far as the ""hard-core sex between name actors"" touted in many published reviews, the screen COULD HAVE STAYED BLACK for ALL of VOLUME ONE's 117 minutes--and you would MISS NOTHING! There is no real sex here! It's a lie, like ""The Emporer's New Clothes,"" and the bamboozled ""professional"" reviewers apparently are the only Americans that never have been exposed to actual pornography showing people having sex for real. Most of the ""hard-core"" stuff alluded to here by the on-screen dialog obviously is FAKED, and the 22 seconds of explicit naughtiness is performed by nine credited extras, or ""sex doubles,"" denoted only by fake first names. VOLUME ONE may be the best cure yet for NYMPHOMANIA, but it surely does NOT qualify as entertainment, titillating or otherwise!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
37,brchthethird,A surprisingly funny art-house porno from Lars von Trier,9,14 November 2014,"NYMPHOMANIAC: VOLUME I, the first half of Lars Von Trier's latest cinematic opus, is a sexually explicit but astonishingly thoughtful and thought-provoking examination of a female with insatiable desire. The story begins with Seligman (Skarsgard), who finds Joe (Gainsbourg) lying bloodied and bruised in the street. He takes her to his home in order to help her rehabilitate, and Joe proceeds to tell him the story of her life, more specifically her sexual life. Of course, with her the distinction is quite superfluous. One thing I knew going in was that the film was going to be sexually explicit, although upon seeing it, it wasn't anymore explicit than Von Trier's other films have been. What surprised me the most was the clever analogies that were made, as well as some humor. As unlikeable as Joe makes herself out to be, you can't help but feel empathy for her. And of course, I attribute this to the standout performances by Charlotte Gainsbourg (as present-day Joe) and Stacy Martin (as younger Joe, and who has more screen time in this first part). She's playing a somewhat manipulative individual, but yet her performance is critically underpinned with a certain sweetness and vulnerability that I, as a viewer, was able to emotionally connect with her. Also important is Seligman who, in the context of the film, acts as the intermediary between Joe and the audience. There were also impressive performances by Shia LaBeouf, Uma Thurman and Christian Slater who managed to shine despite their limited screen time. Overall, I'd say this is a spectacular film with great performances and an engaging (but not titillating) story. Definitely for fans of Lars Von Trier and art-house cinema. However if you're prudish, it might be best to stay away.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
38,maurice_yacowar,Encounter between celibate and nymph points to spiritual realization.,9,20 April 2014,"There's a rare moment of quiet grace late in Lars von Trier's 5-hour psychological epic, Nymphomaniac. After the dark night of soulful storytelling the sunrise appears in a small patch of light on the brick alley wall behind Seligman's (Stellan Skarsgard) house. Perhaps caused by a reflection off an unseen window, it's still magic. It emblematizes a hope, an improbable radiance, perhaps even the prospect of redemption in one of the harshest visions in cinema. It seems all the brighter after we've learned how Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) came to be abandoned beaten and befouled outside Seligman's flat. She was betrayed by her one true love Jerome (Shia LaBoeuf) and P (Mia Goth, and she will), the young girl she saved and adopted as ward and successor. But that light is brief. The film ends in a mutual betrayal, unseen in the darkness that has resumed its pervasive hold. That final act, heard but not seen, proves profoundly ambivalent because it marks the conversion of both central characters. Throughout the narrative, as Joe recounts her life story of sexual impulses unbridled and destructive, Seligman appears her saintly opposite. He is a man of culture and knowledge. Jewish, he is of the people of the word. The 16-volume OED anchors his shelf as his intellect does his self. He explains Joe's apparently impulsive behaviour by finding abstruse parallels in fishing, science, mathematics, music. A celibate, he represents the life of the mind. Even more important is his unflagging forgiveness, his finding a positive aspect to Joe's every humiliating confession. Seligman is literally ""the happy man"" because he is blessed with humanity. Indeed, for a brilliant reading of the film as a defence of Jewish philosophy see Liel Leibovitz's study in Tablet Magazine. But in that last scene the saint proves only human. Having resisted sexual impulses all his life he is unintentionally seduced by Joe's revelation of the life he denied. She doesn't make that life appealing, but she jars him into an awareness of it. Worse, his assault comes hard upon his defence of her entire sexual career as a woman's assertion of her rights against the dominant male order. Then he practices what he preached against.In rejecting her samaritan's unexpected approach Joe shows she has finally transcended her sexuality. Telling her story and receiving Seligman's understanding have given Joe a new self-respect and the courage to be abstinent. No more is her sexuality a compelling shame: ""Me vulva. Mea maxima vulva."" That she kills him reaffirms the moral and emotional complexity of the human condition. She couldn't kill her ex-lover for seducing her ward but when she kills Seligman she expresses her despair that even this good man is as hypocritical as the society she has shunned. Shorn of his pretence to intellectual detachment, his soul is as bared as the winter tree. Earlier Joe said her ""only sin"" was that she ""demanded more from the sunset."" The sunrise finds her demanding more from her saint. As if to celebrate her character's ascension Ms Gainsbourg sings a slowed-down bluesy ""Hey Joe"" over the end credits. This is the most astonishing and compelling film of the last 10 years. It's the film John Donne would make if he were alive in the film age. Every scene ripples with the tension between the body and the soul, the flesh and the spirit, the profane and the sacred. ""Fill all my holes"" speaks to Joe's spiritual void as much as to her physical cavities. For Joe to transcend her initial nature she has to move from her absolute numbness at the intermission through forms of self-flagellation, her assault upon the flesh, through her lay confession to emerge absolved. True to Donne's spirit, it has moments of brilliant black comedy. And the crowning glorious punchline: to save herself she has to kill her fallen saint. This is also the perfect First Date film. The graphic sex is an ice-breaker. If the girl is offended by Joe's activity, hey, remind her of all the penes for once on view too. This is that rare mainstream film, with equal opportunity sexual spectacle. Besides, unless you really mess up, Part 2 virtually guarantees a second date.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

This is the kind of film ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" wishes it could be. Lars Von Trier closes out the ""Depression"" trilogy with a sonic boom. It daringly traps us in a closet, and locks the door shut. We are trapped in the world of Joe, forced to witness her spiral into sexual chaos... and nothing about it is sexy. Nymphomaniac uses sex as a weapon. It penetrates us like a sharp dagger. Even in it's most gratuitous moments, we are captivated. We want to know, how low can Joe go? Even at it's length for a film of such uncomfortable subject matter, you're hooked. You might even be a little spooked too. Von Trier makes a connection to Sex and Death.

I think this film was supposed to be happening in England but I think whole Western Europe can be mirrored in this.What I liked about this? First, acting is fabulous! Both main actors are outstanding. Congratulations! Second, besides digging into depths of human sexuality, I liked how European history was knitted into the film. Without us having sex there would be no European or any other history. May be we do that a little bit too much, I mean sex, there are after all 7 billion plus people on Earth.I did not like praise of the Ortodox Church. Since Serbs burned two of my houses, one in 1943 and other in 1991 in Herzegovina and Croatia respectively, just for us Croatians being Roman Catholics I do not agree that Ortodoxy is a religion of peace.All in all an outstanding work by Von Trier and the rest of the crew.

42,Likes_Ninjas90,The film is both transparent and impenetrable and none of the actors overcome the weak script,4,24 March 2014,"Some people believe Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier is a fascinating and innovative auteur. His detractors, including myself, view him as an aimless provocateur and an attention-seeking misogynist. He treats film as a form of personal therapy. It is a stream of consciousness onto which he imposes his anguished feelings. His family history accounts for his temperamental relationships with actresses and representation of women. On his mother's deathbed, she told him she had an affair with a man who was his real father. She wanted to give him the creative genes his adopted father could not provide. Lars von Trier has never forgiven her. In Antichrist and Melancholia (which both featured Charlotte Gainsbourg), women were viewed as destructive, violent or mad. In Dancer in the Dark, Icelandic singer Bjork played a mother who was going blind. She vowed never to make another film and said of the director: ""He needs a female to provide his work soul. And he envies them and hates them for it. So he has to destroy them during the filming."" There are actresses that enjoy working with the director though. Nymphomaniac is his third film with Gainsbourg. She believes in his self-expression. Yet neither of the two volumes dispel Lars von Trier's glaring issues as a person or filmmaker. The script he has written can be viewed in two ways, either as a metaphor for himself being weary of falling in love, or to make things more Freudian, an unflattering view of his mother. It begins with Joe (Gainsbourg) lying in the street, beaten, until she is found and tended to by Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard). He wants to know why she sees herself as a terrible person so she recounts her entire sexual history to him. She recalls how she merely wanted sex and not to fall in love. Yet after her first sexual encounter at age fifteen with Jerome (Shia LaBeouf) her feelings for him became irrepressible, particularly in their later lives. She also undertakes various sexual experiments involving different men and even a teenage girl. From the moment Lars von Trier announced at the infamous Melancholia press conference in Cannes that he was making a pornographic film, it should have been apparent that this would be an exercise in ""cringe cinema"". The writing isn't strong enough to justify the explicitness of the sexual material. Spread over two films, totalling four hours in length, it is a poorly realised narrative, often disjointed and incoherent. It relies too heavily on visibly weak story constructs and coincidences and tries to paper over them by being self-referential. The framing device used to introduce us to the different chapters is highly contrived, unless you believe someone would recollect their entire life to a stranger.The episodes that follow Joe's introduction range from being offensive to implausible. Some are surprisingly funny too but are the laughs intentional? The chapter I particularly disliked was when Joe recalls her teenage days. A young Joe (dully played by newcomer Stacy Martin) and her friend dress up in what they call ""f*** me clothes"" and have a contest on a train to see how many men they can seduce for a bag of sweets. It reflects how inaccurately Lars von Trier observes young behaviour and how denigrating he is to women by valuing shock tactics over authenticity. It is also frustrating that on top of silly dialogue (""You can't tame a lion while blowing your children's nose""), there are long-winded, pretentious discourses between the episodes referencing shaman mythology (brush up on what an Ash tree means). Most of the second film drags, dwelling on some extremely disturbing material involving sadomasochism and also comments about paedophilia. It feels like von Trier is caught in a game of one-upmanship with himself to make the film edgy rather than logical. I found a lot of the second volume very difficult to sit through. When contrasted with the stunning social realism and accessible philosophy of Blue is the Warmest Colour, which also covered young sexuality, Nymphomaniac is comparatively a juvenile afterthought. The long running time hasn't allowed enough time to refine the poor stylistic choices. Unsurprisingly, the sex has received the most attention. Both male and female genitalia are viewed up close using hand-held cameras and without cutting away. Real pornographic actors were filmed having actually sex and had their bottom half of their bodies were superimposed onto the professional actors, who simulated the intercourse. Although the starkness is uncomfortable to watch, Lars von Trier isn't taking it seriously. The film is overloaded with immature visual gimmicks. The phallus isn't shown in Hollywood films so he includes an entire montage of them. An on screen score is also superimposed onto the screen while two characters are having sex. What's his point? As intercourse is verbally compared to everything from classical musical, to fishing and electronic doors, visual intercuts unnecessarily restate the lines of dialogue. The only purpose is to offset the film's aesthetic banality. The visuals have none of Melancholia's vibrancy. The colours are generally bland to impose an idea of Joe's emotional coldness and detachment from relationships. The soundtrack choices are painfully obvious, sometimes hilariously so, like using ""Born to be Wild"" and ""Burning down the House"", while heavy metal music from Rammstein is inappropriately pasted over scenes. True to this shabbiness, the film is both transparent and impenetrable and none of the actors overcome the weak script. The director knows what is going on but only to the benefit of one person.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
43,Christian_Dimartino,It's disappointing if you're expecting greatness or sexiness. Otherwise...,8,24 March 2014,"If you witnessed the trailer for Nymphomaniac (which was removed from Youtube because it was graphic), you're probably assuming that it's a weird sex-fest. If that is what you're thinking, then you aren't far off. But that is what I've learned to expect from director Lars von Trier: weird sex. And if you're into strange sex, then you're in luck: Von Trier gives over four hours of it.Von Trier is a strange man. A few years ago, he was treated for mental illness. When he came out, he made a film called Antichrist, which is about, you guessed it, mental illness. In fact, his past few films have focused on the topic. Nymphomaniac Vol. I (Vol. II is out in April) joins Antichrist and Melancholia as a part of his depression trilogy. Is it as good as those two? Not quite, but I think Vol. II will be.Vol. I opens with a woman named Joe (Charlotte Gainsborg, a von Trier regular who truly deserved some credit for Melancholia), lying on the ground, beaten, in an alley. She is found by a man named Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard), who takes her in and nurses her back to good health. Soon, Joe begins explaining how exactly she ended up where she ended up. She tells of her sexual experiences, and tells just how she came to be. The stories are told through flashbacks, and the young Joe is played by newcomer Stacy Martin.The rest of the cast includes Shia Lebeouf (before he went bonkers) as the man who took her virginity. Christian Slater stars as Joe's father. Now the best performance here, and it is a brief one, is Uma Thurman. Thurman plays the wife of a man that Joe sleeps with. Thurman is only on screen for about seven minutes, but it it easily the best seven minutes of the movie. I wanted an encore.Now, judging from the trailer, you expect this movie to be a sex fest. While it is so, that doesn't exactly mean it's sexy sex. That's actually something that I admire about the film. Some of it is sexy, but a lot of it is off-putting. From Joe's perspective, sex is something that she simply just can't stop doing. An actual addiction, and in some ways, a chore. Von Trier could've made it sexy, but instead he takes it in another direction. I like that, mainly because I never really bought sex addiction as a real addiction.Nymphomaniac Vol. I is constantly entertaining, but it is isn't the great movie that Melancholia was. It has great moments, and then dull ones. I am mainly referring to the scenes between Joe and Seligman. I realize that these scenes are used a narrative tool, but does Skarsgard have to constantly keep referring back to fishing? Also, if Joe knows she's a bad person beyond saving, why should we care? I don't know. Vol. I is a good movie, but it's an incomplete one. I can't give the final verdict until Vol.II. Vol. I is a strange journey, but it's a fascinating one. Count me in.B+*Note: I have seen Vol. II and I wrote a review on it, but it wasn't posted... for some reason. Vol. II is better, but it falls apart in the last fifteen minutes. I say that Vol. II is better, but yet I give them both the same rating. Does that make sense? I don't know, but judging from the amount of people that found this review useful, I don't think anyone really cares. Nymphomaniac Vol. II:B+, overall rating: B+",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
44,Headturner1,wow,6,10 July 2019,"I never thought I'd be against the masses. I have in past, tried to like Von tair's films and hated them. I was getting ready to go to sleep and didn't want to put on anything( I thought wold be very interesting to interrupt that. Well I was wrong. I found myself quite enjoying this. One thing I did not was Christian Slater's role. I kept wondering why they just didn't cast someone from England for crying out loud. I did fall asleep before it ended and not sure how much time was left but I am going to finish it tonight and I'll revise my review if needed. Tho I never thought I'd remotely enjoy any of his work. I'm quite surprised. Edit to add. I see a lot of reviews saying this is just a dumb porno blah , blah. I actually liked the dialougue between Joe ( and sorry forgot his name) I guess if you didn't then the film will come off as gratuitous sex but I didn't see it like that...",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
45,asda-man,I don't want to be part of your sex festival!,9,31 May 2014,"So when I heard that Lars was doing a 4 hour porn movie I rolled my eyes. Don't get me wrong, Lars Von Trier is one of my favourite directors and his films are often rich and illuminating, but he can also try very hard to shock. The idea of Lars doing a porn movie seemed to be like a big way of him saying, ""Look at me everyone! Aren't I shocking!?"" Thankfully though, reviews came out and were largely positive. The film wasn't a porn movie at all and I breathed a sigh of relief and felt a buzz of excitement. Last night I watch Nymphomaniac volume I and I loved it! The film is incredibly interesting and strangely absorbing. It's also very experimental which I actually liked a lot. One scene is black and white; another is put into a box whilst others have numbers and words super-imposed on the screen. Some may find these visuals distracting, but I found them fascinating and it gave the film a real pulse. Nymphomaniac feels alive and it's wonderful that Lars feels so confident to experiment freely and put his own artistic input into the mix. Not enough directors do this, but the ones who do are often the greatest.I loved the jarring opening. It opens very calmly and silently with the camera focusing on drops of rain and details of an alley-way, before revealing Charlotte Gainsbourg fagged out on the floor. Then without warning, an incredibly loud heavy metal anthem bursts through the speakers. It's completely ill-fitting, but strangely enough it works and it sort of foreshadows the mysterious and playful nature of the character Joe, and the film itself.As stated by many people, the film is basically an interaction between Joe and Seligman as Joe recounts her life up until now. Volume I deals entirely with young Joe and what a fascinating character she is. The two hour segment flew by, because the character is so strangely absorbing. I found the whole film gripping. The earlier scenes on the train were wonderfully executed with brilliant dialogue and a very dark atmosphere.The sex scenes themselves are nowhere near as bad as they've been hyped up to be. Of course some of them are pretty awkward to watch (e.g. the scene where Joe loses her virginity) but only a couple actually have pornographic shots, and whilst these shots are unnecessary; at least they have more meaning than that pointless shot in Antichrist. If someone bought Nymphomaniac hoping to be titillated, then they'd be extremely disappointed. Unless of course they're into disturbed characters being sexually humiliated.I also must talk about the Uma Thurman scene. It is brilliant! It's such a shame that Uma's only good films have been with Quentin Tarantino because she is a fantastic actress who seems to do a lot of rubbish films! Thankfully, Uma is now in a good non-Tarantino film and she shines. It's a masterful scene and will probably be the best scene in the entire two-part film. It's toe-curlingly awkward, yet darkly humorous, and then very emotional. I loved it.It's a total contrast to the scenes with Shia who fails to shine. A lot has been said about his accent and yes it really is that bad! It's a mixture of South African, Australian, cockney, rough English and American... And maybe a little Polish. I was trying not to pay much attention to it, but it really is very distracting and also very difficult to understand what he's saying. Why on Earth did Lars not say, ""Shia, what the frig are you doing with your accent? Just speak American for Christ's sake!"" Another small problem I had with the film was that the dialogue was sometimes clumsy. Some of the more philosophical conversations felt too contrived to be taken seriously. Also, some lines felt like something from a bad porn movie. Other than that, the screenplay was absolutely top-notch! Lars clearly has a very profound and interesting story to tell and I can't wait to see how it continues. I'm also glad about watching it in parts as there is a lot to take in and you can really appreciate more. I would put Nymphomaniac volume I on par with the rest of the Depression trilogy.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
46,rubenm,More than just sex,8,4 January 2014,"To be honest, I had my doubts when I went to see this film. After all the buzz, I more or less expected a provocative, pretentious, incomprehensible film. I thought 'Nyphomaniac' would be a shallow artistic excuse to show lots of explicit sex in an attempt to shock the audience and create controversy. Well, I was wrong. Is it provocative? In some ways, yes. I think choosing nymphomania as a subject for a film is already some sort of provocation. And there are some scenes that might be considered tasteless or mildly shocking. But if I would have to describe the film in one word, I wouldn't use 'provocative'. Instead, I would use 'imaginative'. Because that is what this film is: imaginative. It's so full of ideas, full of creativity and full of cinematographic exuberance that it's hard not be impressed. The nice thing is that Lars Von Trier never takes himself too seriously. In a way, it's a pity that the film is about sex. So much attention is being given to the number of penises shown (many, in a very funny way) and the number of vagina close-ups (none, in fact, at least in part 1) that it overshadows everything else, including the creative way the film is made. 'Nyphomaniac' is a classic frame story. A sex-obsessed woman named Joe tells her life to a man called Seligman who found her bleeding in a back alley. Seligman in turn tells her about things in his own life, like fly fishing, Fibonacci numbers or organ music. Their conversation is the backbone of the film - the side stories about Joe's sex adventures and Seligman's hobbies are divided into chapters. Von Trier uses lots of different film styles: he throws in animations, split screens, cross cutting, black & white, and at one point even a fast succession of snapshots. This makes for a very quirky film, that keeps on surprising. One wonderful example of this creative approach is the final chapter, where Joe sees a similarity between her complicated love life and Seligman's favourite piece of polyphonic organ music. She compares her lovers to the three different melodic tunes in the music. The way Von Triers visualizes this, with the screen split in three to show cross cuttings of the organ and the lovers, is original and funny at the same time. So, in spite of all the indications to the contrary, this film is about as far removed from porn as Woody Allen is from Mickey Mouse. 'Nymphomaniac' deserves to be remembered for more than just sex.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
47,RevRonster,It has some decent qualities but it felt so gimmick-y,5,14 October 2014,"Like everyone else on the planet, the first thing I heard about this movie was the real sex that it was going to depict. To be honest, that didn't really sell me on it and why I waited all this time to watch itit also didn't help that Lars von Trier isn't a writer/director that I find myself falling all over the place to experience. That being said, the film is okayif not a tad gimmick-y.The story didn't completely thrill me but I did find aspects of it interesting. There's some drama to it that had me interested and I really liked the film's use of metaphor (that's probably my favorite part because it's not everyday that you see a movie where a woman is describing her sex life to a man and all he can do is compare it to fly fishing). I also really enjoyed the acting in this one. Stellan Skarsgård and Charlotte Gainsbourg are great together and have some interesting chemistry but I was really surprised by how good Shia LaBeouf was in the film. I've never enjoyed him in anything—actually, I still didn't care for him in this one but he was far more convincing in this than anything else I've seen him inand that makes me wonder if his performance was just another act of plagiarism and he stole someone's acting abilities through the use of dark magic.Overall, however, even with a great cast and some mildly interesting points going on in the story, the film just bored me. I wasn't expecting a thrill ride with explosions but the drama and plot unfold so slowly and with characters that I just couldn't find myself caring even a little about, I found that I just couldn't invest myself that deeply into ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"" in any way more than just a passing interest.Howdy!

48,bbickley13-921-58664,"Like it, not addicted to it.",8,27 March 2014,"The great Lars Von Trier is at it again, with another road down a dark path in the human psyche. This time, with the first Volume of Nymphomaniac, A film about Joe, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, a woman without feeling who attempts to feel by having sex with multiple men, and how she feels this makes her a bad person. Joe tells her story to a stranger name Seligman, played by Stellan Skarsgård who acts like a psychiatrist as he tells her story through flash backs of her as a young girl, played by Stacy Martin I love Skarsgård in this picture. He could have just been an old man who helped her when she was at a low point in her life, and his function was just to be a person to tell her story to, but his understanding of her issue to the point where he uses his experience as a fly fisher man to relate to Joe's issue was really cool, and made the character more than what it needed to be.With flashbacks the movie explores Joe's life. From her earliest point of sexual exploration as a small child to her first sexual experience and forward. The movie goes over her problems with love, loneliness and how her obsession with sex overwhelms her life. All done entertainingly, even though the movie has a feeling of a long psychiatrist session. The filmmakers attempt to be fair with the subject matter comes out nicely with Joe feeling that she is bad prison because of her addictions, while Seligman is more objective with his views on sex being a very natural thing, and the moment of pleasure she has given so many can only be good.Watching Joe's life come out on screen is interesting. From our introduction to her father played by Christian Slater, to the only man she has come close to loving, Jerome, played by Shia LaBeouf. Though both men gave a great performance, especially Christian Slater, his role as a loving father, was great. The only down side was listening to both these actors attempt a British accent. This might be more my issue, but it's harder to take seriously American actors doing British accents than the other way around. My favorite character aside from Seligamn was Mrs. H, a wife whose family was broken up by Mr. H's relationship with Joe. Watching Mrs. H, played by Uma Thurman was very entertaining.The cinematography was good and it worked well for the movie. I especially like the opening scene of Joe lying beaten in an alley as the snow starts.And last but not least, it was good hearing German industrial metal band Rammstein again. It's been awhile for me. They contribute a song to the movie called Nymphomaniac I'm sure there is a lot my Freudian psycho babble going through the movie that I do not understand, but the movie's story was entertaining. Maybe I'll understand more when Volume 2 comes out. Until then, I recommend you watch this first.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
49,acedj,I guess I missed something,4,12 November 2019,"When this film came out, it was swathed in controversy. Being a fan of controversial films, I was excited to finally see it. What excitement that had once filled me was replaced with boredom and disappointment. I can not see where the controversy comes from. There are plenty of mainstream movies that show actual penetrative sex without using prosthetics of digital effects. More than that, I found neither the story nor the characters compelling. I really wanted to like this film, I just couldn't. So if you are someone watching this for the sex, skip it.

50,estreet-eva,Look how shocking I am!,2,6 October 2014,"Von Trier foists more hard-to-watch tarted-up porn in the guise of an art film on the unsuspecting (but at this point ""fool-me-twice"" movie-going populace). Provocation and desperate plea for attention sit on either side of a 50 shades of gray area and largely Von Trier tends to lean more towards the ""hey you guys, look at me"" part of the continuum. In some more tawdry part of Europe shot through a grimy lens, our anti-heroine Joe somehow manages to seduce 10 men a night while never saying a word or showing the least sign of anything beyond passivity. Does CraigsList really work that well? Beyond being pallid and boring, Joe's purpose in the movie is largely to recite Lars' personal fantasies. Stellan Skarsgard is there to listen and to bring a false sense that anything highbrow is happening by referencing fly fishing, classical musical (the go-to whenever you need to class up some piece of filth). A whole lot of other men are there as objects. Uma Thurman is there to chew the scenery through a wildly unrealistic non-confrontation with her cheating husband and our titular hero.

53,James_De_Bello,7/10,7,25 September 2014,"It is very, very difficult to describe how do I feel about such a unique movie, but for one I will say there is a lot to be said and I will never manage to filter all my thoughts into my review but at least I'll try to say everything I can about it. Maybe I actually don't know myself how do I feel about the film, so pretty much I'll just say what I thought was good or bad about it. Let's start with the positives by addressing the big elephant in the room: the sex/hardcore scenes: I have to give credit to Lars Von Trier for making them feel ""comftarble"" and never stumbling into pornographic territory, I don't necessarily think there were too much because all in all they were quite functional to the story-telling and in the best parts added a great undertone to the movie. I can't say the acting was top-notch but all the actors fulfilled their job respectably. The film has some very insightful but most importantly genuine metaphors and reflections in the first part. I say genuine for a good reason because that's how the first half of the movie (chapters 1 and 2) feels, there is no pretentiousness to it and I was actually very absorbed. Then chapter 3 came, followed by chapter 4 and by chapter 5 I didn't really care much. Chapter 3 feels completely wrong, it is weird in every possible way with a wrong, out-of-place performance by Uma Turman, I was stunned at how useless it was. Maybe it is to reflect the emotions of Joe about the situation but I wasn't in at all. Chapter 4 was simply boring, nothing more nothing less. When we get back to Stellan Skarsgaard's house I was engaged again and then chapter 5 kicks in: it left me pretty indifferent even though I thought there was the potential for a great cinematic moment there that failed to be delivered. The second half simply didn't feel as natural as the first. I can't say I would recommend this film to everybody, but I will say that I am interested in part 2 and that it will take a long time for me to stop thinking about this movie.

You may not find the premise too appealing—a fragile-looking young woman called Joe slips into a downward spiral of sex addiction and self-destruction—but the performances and the spooky Gothic production design are great, and the framing tale—an ascetic scholar finds a battered, unconscious woman in an alley, takes her home, brings her cups of tea and listens to her life story—is totally involving. Uma Thurman steals the show as the wife of one of Joe's many lovers who shows up, with the kids in tow, to confront the guilty couple—reminded me of Beckett or Pinter. It's a bit jarring when 20-something Stacy Martin's suddenly swapped out for 40-something Charlotte Gainsbourg (when her character's meant to be in her mid-20s maybe), and the gymnastic couplings of the ""sex doubles"" aren't all that sexy (maybe that's the point); otherwise, if you have a fair amount of tolerance for Scandinoirish creepiness and auteurist self-indulgence, I'd give it a strong recommendation.

57,troyputland,Lars von Trier up to his usual tricks again.,3,2 July 2015,"Lars von Trier. If you know the name then you're aware of the avant-garde, ambiguous style he produces in every feature film he's made. Nymphomaniac, with its two parts and 240 minute running time, has its cast practicing real sex acts. It's the sole reason why this film has garnered so much attention. Overlooked is everything else in between. Joe (Gainsbourg) tells her tale of emotional and physical highs and lows to Seligman (Skarsgard), a dutiful, friendly fellow that helps her after an assault. Her life's story is split up into metaphorical chapters, from the moment she finds her sexuality as a young girl, up to present day. Gainsbourg is a fine example of ideal casting, looking the part before baring any skin. Her story telling is clunky and disjointed. Lars von Trier's scriptwriting is dry, elusive and as ambiguous as a white canvas. The C word's blurted out more times by Gainsbourg than seen, grating like nails on a chalkboard. The acting's authentic, by all accounts (most notable is Stacy Martin playing young Joe), but only when dialogue is absent (Shia LaBeouf's accent is diabolical). The scenes that contain nudity represent nymphomania. Porn's toes are not being trod on. Nymphomaniac's easier to digest than other LvT films. Some viewers may feel short changed and a little underwhelmed, both physically and emotionally, by the end.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
58,Rendanlovell,Nah man,5,28 November 2019,"Uma Thurman....Yes
Shia LaBeouf....NOI really tried to give these two movies a chance but boy, this ain't it. Nymphomaniac is the most interesting and irritating Von Trier movie there is. Lets throw in hard rock music, why not! Just keep cutting to obvious fishing metaphors! Why not slap a bunch of numbers on the screen because whatever. Part of it will just be black and white for no reason, okay.
There's so many bizarre choices that don't seem to mean anything or are so on the nose it's ridiculous. However, there is some genuine quality here as well. It looks great. There's still Trier's tried and true snap zooms and handheld camera work but there's also real nice, long, fluid one takes. The performances range between excellent (Stellan Skarsgard) to embarrassing (Shia LaBeouf). The character study at the heart is also quite interesting. A nymphomaniac character is rarely, if ever, explored and it is worth looking at. Here though, the compelling aspects of the character are unfortunately spread across so much time and buried under ludicrous amounts of pretense that it's hard to latch onto these sparse bursts of intrigue. The perspective of an asexual listening to a nymphomaniacs stories is also quite compelling and I wish Lars did more with it outside of relating sex to numbers for no good reason.
It's unique and challenging, which is typically two things I hold quite high when talking about film. That alone makes this at least worth checking out and, again, it is nice looking but that's not enough. Watching two movies or one near 3 hour movie is simply too much to bear. It is loaded with obnoxious storytelling devices and absurd cut aways or on screen memos to the point of hilarity.

60,ghost_dog86,How Shia got his groove back,8,25 March 2014,"Just a disclaimer before I began: As you can probably tell by the title, I was not able to see this film in its intended format; and I'm not talking about watching it on television verses up on the big screen. Writer/director Lars von Trier had always planned for ""Nymphomaniac: Volumes 1 & 2"" to be shown as a single four hour plus film. But in the United States that was never going to happen (I mean, if Tarantino couldn't get it done, there is no way von Trier was going to). So it was split into two volumes (Vol. 2 to be released next month). And even though I would prefer to experience a film like this in the more natural director's cut format in order to give a more accurate review, here is my review of ""Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1"": Synopsis: Beginning with a minute long scene depicting a blank screen and then suddenly jolting audiences into the initial visuals with a Rammstein song, ""Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1"" tells the story of a man (Stellan Skarsgard) named Seligman who discovers a very badly beaten woman (Charlotte Gainsbourg) named Joe lying in a gutter. After taking her home, she suddenly begins to recount her younger years as a nymphomaniac, segmenting each graphic memory into chapters, with each chapter meant as an attempt to express the reasoning's and methods behind her condition. All the while Seligman sits at Joe's bedside fascinated by her tales of sexual exploits and responding with a sort of Freudian analogy after each one. The introspective meditations between these two characters serve as a classroom-like psychoanalysis respite between the sequences of explicit visuals. During Joe's flashbacks Joe is played by newcomer Stacy Martin, who plays out the numerous interactions with her many suitors, one of which is a recurring ""love"" interest named Jerome, played by Shia LaBeouf.Because Joe dives right into her story within the first five minutes of the film, the plot seems to move forward in a bit of a clunky manner, as the probability of a random woman sharing a story this graphic and sexually explicit with a total stranger of the opposite sex is a hard one to get past. But after about a half an hour it does become easier to simply accept this von Trier's situation for what it is and more so focus on the cutting analogies and ingenious story structure this brilliant writer/director brings to the table.Final Thought: After sitting through this film with my girlfriend, as the credits rolled, my initial thoughts were in lockstep with hers as she immediately proclaimed that while she did find it fascinating at times and was interested to see Vol. 2, at the end of the day ""Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1"" could be best described as ""a long, weird porno."" But now, after I've had nearly a week to let von Trier's work marinate (a week where my admiration for this film only grew) I would now make the claim that this was not a porno at all, mainly because ""Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1"" contains sex, but not for eroticisms sake. Something to think about, if you are at all interested in seeing this.Final Final Thought: Throughout the numerous scenes of intercourse and sexual encounters there is no talk of pregnancybut maybe that will be addressed in Vol. 2.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
61,Gresh854,"Artistic, Informal, And A Tad Hollow",6,4 December 2018,"Watching Nymphomaniac Vol. 1 is the equivalent to watching a college student's moderately intriguing research project. You dig it, you get it, and you ultimately respect it, but in the long run, you rather be doing something more germane.Lars Von Trier's sharp analysis of nymphomania through the scientific psyche is ever so agonizing-in the perspective of its subject matter NOT its characters/storyline. Never was I once bored learning about the universal catastrophe that nymphomania can have upon us as humans. The inspection of the sexual mind gone rouge is undeniably absorbing.That being said, this movie is a populous idea hidden in a grave amount of illiteracy. I can't get over the fact that I felt nothing after watching this unlike, Melancholia, a film in which you can actually undergo the grisly depression that essences off of the characters. The anguish and devastation that is-supposedly-fixated inside our presented characters seems so bleakly unapperent in Volume 1. Obviously, you can interpret what causes what (struggles, emotions, actions, etc.) in the case of this nymphomaniac, but you hardly feel as if the remorse of it all is authentically there, and it conclusively, doesn't burden you wholly by the end. Well, 1/2 of the end.Sidenote: I won't get over the fact that von Trier pulled a ""Princess and the Bride"" on us. Deciding that the main character should be telling the story of her life to some random stranger who happens to be the most knowledgeable man on the entire planet, that can, out of the blue, explain every little metaphor or concept is an awful approach to constructing heavy exposition. Weakest use of a host in order to explain your ""abstract"" thoughts von Trier. I can only pray that Volume 2 will explain the significance of the two characters blurting bedtime stories to one another.It's palpable exploring Nymphomaniac Vol. 1's conducting topic, but the overarching sense of finance into von Trier's storyline feels hollow. There's just barely enough von Trier magic for me to get through this one merrily, but there's also a grave amount of von Trier haphazardness that also made me-only slightly-reject it. There's potentially a much more masterful movie in this, decisively, so-so of a film though, I'll give him that. (Verdict: C+)",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
62,santiagocosme,I give up on Lars Von Trier.,3,25 December 2014,"Time and time again, I have tried to watch movies by Lars Von Trier. Often, I have played a movie on several occasions if I couldn't finish it the first time around, in a desperate attempt to get into it and to enjoy it like other people do. But the truth is that, as it happens with all artistic expressions, some are made for you, some are not and I'm just not cut to appreciate this man's work. However, with Nymphoniac, I thought and hoped that the voyeuristic essence that we all possess could turn around the fate of my relationship with this director, but the truth is that I disliked this movie almost as much as I disliked the others. It felt long, boring and uninteresting. Plus, I feel that sex is shown gratuitously in the name of ""art"" (Not arty in my eyes) If I was into watching porn scenes, a simple search on google would offer me more than I could chew. So without further delays, I think it's time for me to say: So long Lars!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
63,lucasnochez,Review--Nymphomaniac: Volume I/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,7,28 March 2014,"I didn't discover Lars von Trier until the tender age of twenty-two years old, and like so many others, it was all thanks to his shocking and highly controversial film Antichrist. In the midst of my growing cinematic knowledge, I became intrigued with von Trier's body of work. Although I didn't seem to have the stomach for the aforementioned film, I was curious and looked into his previous directorial efforts, like Manderlay and Dogville instead. Two years later, I got myself into the theatre and watched my very first von Trier film on the big screen, Melancholia. Even though my expectations for the film differed from the moment the film started, I knew I was experiencing something unique; a visceral film with hints of philosophical rants and raves, abstract imaging and a certain level of pretentiousness; unbeknownst to me at the time, the very ingredients to any good von Trier film. Fast forward another two years, and von Trier delivers his banned and highly provocative sexual epic; an oeuvre of bold claims, passionate sexual stylistics and raw sex, in two parts no less, that is not for the faint of heart.Nymphomaniac: Volume I is a work of fine erotic art by an artist you cannot help but despise. Since his 'persona non grata' status from the Cannes film festival, von Trier has embraced his newest label as his work continues to be hardened, tough to swallow cinematic narratives, and Nymphomaniac: Volume I is no different. He may be coy, deceptive, arrogant, and manipulative, but von Trier's work is undeniably passionate, wrought, and full of daring visual feats and narrative brevity.The story begins, ends, and follows Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) von Trier's faithful muse in what he has called to described his Depression Trilogy, being followed only by Antichrist and Melancholia. Like the two previous entries in his Depression Trilogy, our female protagonist is on a journey of transcendence. But unlike the two previous entries which force the protagonist through a journey of self discovery resulting from a fateful tragedy that has plagued their lives, Joe's harsh adversities are brought on to her by herself, or rather as von Trier repeatedly puts it, by the strongest human force we may ever experience–our sexuality. The idea of the defined version of nymphomania is never mentioned in volume I, and rightly so, because volume one does not deal with von Trier's obsession with rectifying political correctness. Instead, volume I serves as a diabolically sinister exploration of one young girl's sexual identity. Lars von Trier may very well be the face of cinematic hypocrisy, usually contradicting himself, but in this film von Trier dabbles in various religions, just like throughout his own life. Catholicism, the Protestantism, and atheism, it seems that the only aspect of each religion that interests this director extraordinaire is the idea of sin. In any of his films, the concept of sin survives well beyond any religion, and volume I attests to the sins of a public few, and a sheltered many.We first find Joe (Gainsbourg) laying on the floor, in a position similar to Jesus Christ on the cross. Luckily for her, she is seen by Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård), who takes her into his home, offering her tea and a patient ear to hear how and why she ended up on the floor of an alleyway all battered and bruised. She explains that the way she got there begins the moment she was only two-years old and when she first discovered a fascination with her genitalia. An interesting observation to make clear is that, throughout the film, Joe seems to come from normal parents who suffer from some of the most common martial issues any couple could face; isolation, loneliness, falling out of love etc. Her father (Christian Slater) and mother (Connie Neilson) do not seem to share much together, other than a daughter and a home. Joe and her father spend hours upon hours walking through nature, looking for their 'soul tree' and passing through the history of nature and the importance of identity. Joe's childhood is hypnotic and lucid, almost directly reflecting against the stark and bold future of her teenage years and callous adulthood. Throughout her youth and scenes with her father, we are sent through a dream; a dream of a little girl searching through innocence and righteousness, only finding a desire for pleasure and an orgasm.Once she reaches the age of fifteen, Joe knows that she is ready to lose her virginity and wants Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf) to take it. She explains that she knew that she wanted him to be her first based on his hands; hands that were strong, experienced and dirty. Joe never is or becomes fascinated with the simple and explained notions of attraction; her desires are to be picked up, dumped, and used over and over again. Joe finds no pleasure in love. This notion alone, told throughout her story and the beginnings of her nymphomania told to Seligman (Skarsgård), is something he finds troubling to understand. This is especially so as much of his understanding of life is reflected upon through his experiences with literature, music, film, fly-fishing, and religion where love reigns supreme. Throughotu Joe's story, Seligman finds coincidences that are deep rooted in Satanism, Bach, and Catholicism, yet, Joe explains that no matter how fabricated or unrealistic her story can be, it is the truth, and uses her experiences to prove it. No matter how many times Seligman digresses the story, Joe always has an answer for him, found in her naked and unabashed life.Want more Nymphomaniac?

64,jmillerdp,Pointless,4,12 August 2014,"I admire some of von Trier's films. I think his ""Melancholia"" is a masterpiece. But, there is really zero point to this. The central ""Joe"" character is played by long-time von Trier collaborator Charlotte Gainsbourg in her 40's and Stacy Martin in her 20's. But, the character is completely unlikable, to put it mildly. She is devoid of humanity, compassion and anything else that could make her human.She is arrogant, unpleasant, treats people like garbage, and is very unattractive. Yet, we're supposed to be drawn to following her for four very long hours, across two films. I have no idea what von Trier was going for in this movie, and I doubt few others can either.The usual desaturated-color, shaky-cam ""cinematography"" is irritating and lazy. There is no rhythm to the movie, it just goes on and on. von Trier throws in ""shock"" stuff just for the sake of it, like a slideshow of up-close shots of penises. Why? No reason. The sex is pretty unerotic. Perhaps that's the point, but then again, there's really little point to much of what goes on in the movie.There are interesting peripheral elements in the movie. Stellan Skarsgård, to whom Joe confesses her life to, is an interesting character. And, what he has to say on many other topics, like music and literature, is interesting as well. In fact, it would be a hundred times more interesting to follow him than to follow Joe.If you don't see it, you're not missing anything. Hopefully, von Trier will make something interesting, and worth our time, again in the future.**** (4 Out of 10 Stars)",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
65,murtaza_mma,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's daring treatise on lust, jealousy and solitude",8,20 April 2014,"Nymphomaniac (Vol. 1) is a 2013 Danish drama film written and directed by Lars von Trier. Before going any further it's imperative to demystify the movie's title. According to the dictionary definition, ""Nymphomania is the uncontrollable or excessive sexual desire in a woman."" So, basically, a nymphomaniac is a woman who has abnormally excessive and uncontrollable sexual desire, in other words, a female sex addict. Nymphomaniac got released internationally in form of two separate volumes of roughly two hours each. However, Lars von Trier also premiered an extended cut of the first half of the film, Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1, with 30 minutes of extra footage at the 64th Berlin Film Festival, which garnered rave reviews. This film critique doesn't analyze the two volumes separately but as a whole.Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac—a bold and daring cinematic treatise on lust, jealousy and solitude—proves to be a devastating life-changing experience that makes us question the nothingness of our existence. As a work of art, it refines ours senses and haunts our imagination with its ribald motifs and breathtaking imagery. In Nymphomaniac, Lars von Trier essentially presents, in form of eight sprawling chapters (5 in Vol. 1 and 3 in Vol. 2), the bizarre tale of a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac, named Joe, recounting her erotic experiences during the different phases of her life. Lars von Trier borrows random ideas from varied disciplines and blends them seamlessly, not only demonstrating his remarkable range as an artist but also reasserting his credentials as a filmmaker par excellence.Lars von Trier, in his characteristic style, handpicks a rather controversial subject and then gives it the most unconventional treatment. The result is an end product that's dark, diabolical, and deviously clever. The movie despite its serious outlook has an undercurrent of dark humour that harks back to von Trier's earlier works. Nymphomaniac: Vol. I, which presents Joe's younger years, unfolds at a whirlwind pace and seems to underline the unrestrained joys of female libertinism. It's a sheer delight to watch a newcomer (Stacy Martin) portray Joe's youthful years so passionately and with an air of effortless ease. Nymphomaniac: Vol. II, which has a rather somber feel thanks to a drastic tonal shift with respect to Vol. I, shows the middle-aged Joe (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg) finally come to term with the limitations, hardships and hypocrisies of a mortal's life as she ends up paying the price for her frenzied modus vivendi.Nymphomaniac is easily Lars von Trier's most accessible work till date. But, make no mistake! It's not your run-of-the-mill cinematic product. Is it pornography? According to Wikipedia, ""Pornography is the explicit portrayal of sexual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal."" Now, there's no denying that von Trier's film is quite explicit in its propagation of sexual content. But, does it serve the purpose of sexual arousal? The film evokes pathos, horror and revulsion but not an iota of sexual gratification (unless you are a pervert). Credit must go to Lars von Trier for concocting a film that in less accomplished hands could have slumped into the realm of artsy porn.In Nymphomaniac. for some uncanny reasons, Lars von Trier chooses to make his male characters either dumb or effeminate and the female characters smart and transgressing. Lars von Trier questions the elevated status of love vis-à-vis other human emotions. Lars von Trier creates a very interesting character in Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård)—an intellectual who chooses to stay a virgin all his life. According to Seligman, humanity is divided into two groups: the people who cut the fingernails of the left hand first (the light-hearted people who have a tendency to enjoy life more because they go straight for the easiest task and save the difficulties for later), and the people who cut the fingernails of the right hand first. Seligman himself belongs to second category as oppose to Joe who being a true pleasure-seeker falls in the first category. While Seligman and Joe come across as exact antithesis of each other, there's much in common between the two of them. The two are tied together by some strange bond. Is it pity or envy? In the end, Nymphomaniac poses the all-important question: Whether to express oneself or to keep oneself restrained?Overall, Nymphomaniac proves to be an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that brilliantly balances style with substance. At the same time, it's not an easy film to watch by any stretch of imagination and can pose serious impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Nymphomaniac features a lot many memorable sequences. The one featuring Uma Thurman in the role of a distressed wife is definitely a cut above the rest. Then there's the movie's shocking finale that's bound to leave the viewer cold. Amidst a plethora of disturbing scenes the movie does offer few moments of respite thanks to the occasional bursts of humor. Joe's messed-up erotic encounter with two black men inside a hotel room is by far the most hilarious. The movie also features a levitation sequence that's highly reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1975 film, The Mirror aka Zerkalo (the seventh chapter of Nymphomaniac is also named as ""The Mirror""). Lars von Trier also pays tribute to Bond films. Joe's morbid sexual behavior and the underlying sexual fetishism remind one of Bunuel's remarkable 1967 film, Belle de Jour. In one of the scenes, Lars von Trier cheekily pays homage to the opening sequence of Antichrist. Nymphomaniac, in so many ways, is Lars von Trier's tribute to cinema, a solemn expression of his love and appreciation for the medium. In Nymphomaniac, Lars von Trier seems to have blatantly depicted almost all forms of human sexuality which makes Nymphomaniac a very challenging film to watch for an average viewer. But, courage and patience have their own rewards, and in this case, plenty.Rating (Vol. 1 & 2): 8.5/10A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
66,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,6,10 January 2014,"Nymphomaniac is the final part of the Trilogy of Depression, which also includes Antichrist and Melancholia, by the controversial Danish director Lars von Trier. Most people are familiar with his work, so he doesn't need much introduction. Most of the time, his movies develop the main character and make him/her go through pain and suffering, so that the public can empathise with him/her. The main character in Nymphomaniac, however, isn't developed enough, and that helps making Nymphomaniac a bad movie. Or at least the first part, which is the one I have seen, since it had to be divided in two to keep each part two hours long.This censored version I saw starts with Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard) getting dressed in his apartment and walking to a shop, to the song Führe Mich by Rammstein. This is a truly wonderful opening and probably the best scene in the movie. As he goes back to his apartment, he finds Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) beaten up and laying unconscious in an alley. He wakes her up and wants to call the police, but she doesn't let him, so he takes her home with him, puts her in bed and makes her tea. He wants to know what happened to her, and so Joe starts telling him about her life and her sexual adventures as a young nymphomaniac.As you probably know, this was a highly anticipated movie, because many wanted to see the scenes of unsimulated sex between the non-pornographic actors. That didn't happen: the porn actors were actually having sex, and their genitals were just digitally composited onto the bodies of the cast. And even though we saw the censored version, there's still more than enough sex and nude scenes to satisfy somebody's need for controversy. That being said, it should be pointed out that controversy does not always equal art, and that's precisely the case with Nymphomaniac. The wannabe artsy component of the movie is also forced upon the audience by Seligman's monologues: after Joe tells him of one of her sexual adventures, he brings up themes like fishing and the Fibonacci sequence, that are somehow connected to her story. Now, who could possibly be thinking about maths and fish after hearing ""He stuck his penis into my c**t""? To justify this absurdity, some state the movie is entirely a metaphor and it's not about sex at all, but does that mean that all that explicit sex in the movie is exclusively put there to shock the audience? Like I wrote in the introduction, the movie's main character, Joe, isn't developed enough for us to care about what happens to her (also, the actress playing young Joe, Stacy Martin, is rather awful). She tells the story of her life, but she never implies that some occurrence turned her into a sex addict. It is a fact that it's still not exactly known what causes hypersexuality (except certain drugs), but the lack of any plausible cause – in addition to the fact that Joe herself states that she was a nymphomaniac out of lust, not out of need – make it all seem like a big farce. Moreover, there's not much to keep you interested while watching the movie – it mostly goes like this: Joe has sex, Joe talks, Seligman talks, Joe has sex again, and so on. And why did the director think it necessary to show pictures of the things that are being mentioned in the movie, as if the audience didn't understand the language? It felt as if he didn't know what to put in those scenes, so he decided to take the 'random artsy' road – and so when somebody mentions frogs, for example, he shows a clip a frogs jumping into the water. Finally, as I didn't expect much of this movie after seeing the trailer, I must say I'm not exactly disappointed by it, and I'm not even surprised by the high scores it got: this just shows that certain directors can film crap and wrap it up as art, and (almost) everyone will buy that. Nymphomaniac isn't pure crap, but it's pretentious and has no real value. I just hope the second part of the movie will be better.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
67,coljam21,Trash!,2,12 September 2014,"Ever heard the saying less is more? Well this uninspired director thought the opposite. In his opinion more is more. The movie is bland, the direction is bland and the story line is bland so he decided to stuff a ton of scenes which depict sexual intercourse and fellatio in a desperate attempt to try to draw people in. Dude we don't need to see a penis enter a vagina to know that a couple is having sex, that's what the imagination is for. All this graphic and gratuitous smut added a layer of grime to the lackluster movie that I couldn't shake off.The title of film is nymphomaniac, every adult knows what that means so there was no need to show the lead getting railed by a different man every 3 minutes (that's what porn is for). The director took things a little too literally. I'm surprised Shia LaBeouf took part in this travesty. And that scene with Christian Slater soiling himself on the hospital bed was something that could have been left to the imagination. We did not need to see his butt being cleaned and wiped by a nurse. Seriously!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
68,sohansurag,In Familiar Lars Von Trier Territory.,7,19 April 2014,"Lars Von Trier's Depression trilogy started off with Antichrist, then Melancholia and now it comes full circle with this 4 hour, 2 part sex epic Nymphomaniac. Greeted with a whiff of silence and expatiated sounds and then blasting it off with Rammstein's Fuhre Mich Lar's Von Trier's Nymphomaniac is exactly how it goes. Unlike Antichrist, Nymphomaniac is an ode to sex addiction, a poetry in motion that explores the verges of sensuality, vulgarity and intense libido of a woman from her early days to her prime. An anthology of sexually graphic stories that also does the job of mesmerizing you in its characters and its narrative.The story starts with a beaten and injured Joe, found by Seligman, who takes her to his apartment and Joe starts narrating her life and her sexcapades to him through till end. While its obviously provocative and titillating, sex is not the core of the story, you are left to think throughout the duration of the movie. Its natural if you get titillated but Seligman as evidently doesn't and helps you find the a meaning as well as a justification for what happens. While Joe goes onto narrate her explicitly detailed adventures, Seligman, from time to time, gives you tidbits of info. From nymph and fishing to polyphony and Bach. Its relevance you ask? That's how the narration progresses and its rather fascinating how it unravels through out the movies 4+ hours. Obviously these characters are not set in a contemporary reality and might not always work if you question its plausibility. These are characters straight from a writer's head and as Lars plays the roles of both writer and director, nobody could have done it better.Volume 1 follows a young Joe through her peaks of insatiable craving for sex and ends with the Cantus Firmus depicting her 3 lovers (which makes the polyphony). Volume 2 pursues a much older Joe and goes a bit deep into her addiction and how she tries to reclaim back her life. It paints her with a wide brush. Lars even pays some homages along the way. If you've seen Antichrist you'll spot the conspicuous scene within seconds. Its unmistakable explicitness aside, Nymphomaniac packs a lot of memorable sequences as well, a scene in particular which comes to mind Joe's father's hospital scene as pictured in the chapter Delirium and another one would be Joe's speech during a sex addict support group. The words she utters would be cringe worthy but nonetheless brilliant. Humor is also sprinkled generously, from Seligman and Joe's conversation to a chapter called Mrs H.Playing Joe and Seligman are Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgård and they kinda, silently through their performances, try to outmatch each other. You have to give in to Skarsgard for keeping a straight face up until the climax (no puns intended). And Gainsbourg's is just as amazing, her voice, spellbinding, making you listen to every word she says. Apart from these two the stand out cast member would be undoubtedly Stacy Martin, that sexy petite girl who almost flawlessly pulled a 'young Joe'. I wouldn't be surprised if she ends up in roles, more demanding. Shia LaBeouf plays Jerome, Joe's love interest and he does a decent job. A slew of AAA actors garnish the 4 hour long movie, from Uma Thurman, Christian Slater to Willem Dafoe and Jamie Bell. As its known Lars' movies are known to be a visual extravaganza and here its not different. there is a specific goldish brown hue that's predominant but there are also deviations when you go from chapter to chapter. Also known is his taste in music and brilliant sound design.Touching everything from bondage to pedophilia, Nymphomaniac is undoubtedly sexually explicit and a perverts paradise and not at all an easy watch showing full frontal nudity and actual penetration which they claim to be done with body doubles. It literally goes to commercial cinema's extremes but at the same time encompassing themes like love, abuse and addiction. As opposed to Blue is The Warmest Color I would never call this sensual and it can get shocking at times. What I loved is Trier's exploration into taboo territory. Few directors would have the balls to sign in AAA stars to act in a semi-pornographic movie. If you think writing this off as porn would be a good idea, then you are direly wrong. It has extensive sexual content but its far from actual pornography and I believe that if those content is put to use for a good narrative then it makes for a profound sexual drama and is thus justified. And if you want anything hardcore you are better off with porn.This is Lars Von Trier and he never shies away from what he wants to show. Initially even I felt it a bit shocking because I was not used to see this much sexual content in mainstream cinema but by the end of it all it wasn't the shocking imagery that got stuck in my mind but instead, the four hour journey that felt anything but shocking. Being the finale of his Depression trilogy, I'd say Nymphomaniac delivered.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
69,indiedavid,A failed experiment,8,25 January 2015,"SPOILERS: I can appreciate the effort of the filmmaker in this 5.5 hour experiment, attempting to analyze the complexity of human sexuality but it misses the mark horribly. Aside from the story flaws, there are just too many mis-steps in the film itself. One such example is a jump in time which, according to the narrator and lead character, is three years. However, her child only ages about 6-12 months and she goes from a beautiful young girl to a weathered, middle aged woman. The director also tries a little too hard to be artistic with several minute spans of complete blackout which achieve absolutely nothing. I can't believe he didn't realize that it wasn't working during post production. If this film had been cut down to about 120 minutes, it could have been a serviceable film.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

71,the-fearless-america,True Modern Erotic Genre,6,21 April 2016,"Well, to be honest. I'm not that good to rate erotics. I'm not having too much experience. Maybe I only watched 2 or 3 erotics before and none of them categorized as classics. Still, to me, this movie was one of the best erotic so far.Nymphomaniac tells the story of a woman's sexual journey, from childhood to adulthood. He tells her story to a man who saved their life from raping. So it's like a forth-back plot style. I can follow the story very easily, it's very light. The storyline only tells about sexual journey and her regretions, no other sub-story exist. So it is very focused and artful. It describe the sex scenes and habits in such a convincing execution. The performance by the lead actress was great. I know this actress, she was born to do erotics, she got the chemistry.I think in this decade, Nymphomaniac is the best erotic so far alongside Fifty Shades Of Grey. The director did a good job to set the standard of erotics. I hope this genre will develop later. I recommend anybody who loved erotic to watch Nymphomaniac, at least it's worth the time.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
72,MrMcMurphy,Painful,1,14 August 2014,"Well, to be fair, interesting THEN painful.At first you are taken in with the actors and the provocative scenes. But, just as soon as you're in, you're quickly taken back out by the completely UNNATURAL DIALOGUE between the main character and the host she is telling her stories to. (The dialogue tries to be deep, but it ends up being just plain silly).On the other hand, it's almost worth watching just for the comical aspect of this, just to see the two actors telling the stories keep a straight face while they're saying such SILLY things - their solemness is the icing on the cake.As for the ""provocative"" stuff, it doesn't really have the bite it might have pre-internet. It just ends up being Art at the expense of entertainment - abstract for the sake of being abstract, and provocative for the sake of being provocative.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
73,inioi,No Redemption For Human Being,7,20 December 2015,"Here i will talk about the whole movie (Volume I & II Extended 5½ hour Director's Cut version)I find very funny (and naive) that some people, relate this movie with porn.Such an approach would be both short-sighted and counterproductive, especially if we are talking about Lars Von Trier.It is common, reading reviews of movies in which there are sex or nudity, and are mentioned as if it deserve to be highlighted, when in fact, it's only part of the backgroundToday sex is still a taboo, which is nothing more than a prohibition of doing or saying something imposed by certain respects or prejudices of social or psychological nature.This movie had nothing to do with porn. Not at all.The movie is about the story of a woman with a psychological-sexual disease, and the aftermath that this disease has had on her personal life.ANALYSIS.LVT has been one of the directors of which more deeply researched the phenomenon of human behavior and all its ramifications. But it does so from a very negative view. As a good existentialist, he examines the human condition, freedom, individual responsibility, emotions, morality, sex and meaning of life.Franz Kafka, Hermann Hesse, Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, Jean Paul Sartre, Stanislav Lem, Andrey Tarkovski, Ingmar Bergman...... they also knew how to define -very precisely- the moods of existential emptiness and meaningless of life. Many of us have identified with these feelings they describe so well. However, most of them have one thing in common: They do not offer solutions. They merely regret about the situation and describe it, but do not go beyond. This fact of ""not going further"" is the result of a lack of research in other fields, and as the main problem, leaves the viewer in a situation without options.This is precisely what happens in Nymphomaniac, and all movies of LVT. The dialogues between the two main characters analyze the subsequent moral implications of the actions dictated by a psychological disease. Seligman provides a theological point of view, which does not seem to help much to Joe. However, despite of her behavior, Seligman try not to judge her, which I consider an essential attitude for most aspects of life.Finally, all the analysis and situations will not lead me anywhere, but to life and its afflictions. Once they have been analyzed, we remain where we were.About the ending,there is a clear lack of trust in humans, as beings who ultimately could transcend their wrongdoing. There is no light at the end of the tunnel.6,5/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
74,filmbizarro,Review of Part I and Part II,8,2 February 2014,"Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) lives as a loner in a relationship with his books, his knowledge, his fishing. One day on his way back home from the store he finds a woman, Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), beaten and bruised on the pavement in an alley. He walks to help her, offering to call an ambulance or the cops, but she stops him. She doesn't mind his help, but a cup of tea and some rest is all she needs, so he brings her home with him. They quickly begin a discussion about her, as she claims she is a bad human being - which Seligman does not believe. She begins to tell her life story of nymphomania. During all of this Seligman ties everything back to math, books, religion, fishing, Frued in an attempt to understand Joe.There is no doubt that Lars von Trier wrote this with a childlike enthusiasm, eager to empty his mind of any idea he could discover along the way, while tying it all back to Joe's nymphomania. ""Nymphomaniac"" is a very sad movie and with sad characters, but it's also very funny, often poking fun at itself and the unbelievable - almost fantastical - story that is being told. The movie also comes back to many of Lars von Trier's past movies, ranging from the devastating opening of ""Antichrist"" to the haunted halls of ""Riget"", and sometimes only to mess with the audience.Seligman also makes sure that the movie is filled to the brim with symbolism, metaphors, associations to literature, religion and all that. Perhaps to an extent that takes it too far, but that kinda becomes a joke in the movie as well. Is it to actually give a deeper meaning to Joe's nymphomania, or is it to show how easy it is to find meaning where, perhaps, there is none? The Joe character cleverly ties back to her character in ""Antichrist"" without making it too certain if it agrees or disagrees with the statements of ""Antichrist"", but it ties a nice knot to this trilogy. The many symbolisms in ""Nymphomaniac"" are illustrated often with stock footage, images, text and numbers on the screen, which yet again gives this a more fun and childlike touch, helping us getting through 4 hours of this devastating, provocative, depressive, sex-filled life story.This 4 hour version is supposedly the cut version. It's likely that a ton of explicit sex has been edited out, but there is plenty to be found in this 4 hour version. I don't think the movie, 4 hour version or otherwise, will have so much explicit sex that the movie becomes ABOUT that. Even though you have watched penetration, blowjobs, vaginas, asses, penises, many times over, graphically, during these 4 hours, it never takes the upper hand. And despite what I think many will say, I think all of it was needed to tell this story. Joe isn't addicted to sex because of past problems, she's addicted to sex because she loves it. Nymphomania becomes her personality, that's what her days are all about - planning when to see the next man, looking for ways to get to another level, and so on. Not showing explicit sex in this movie would cut the movie short of how straight forward it wanted to be about the subject.Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin both do a great job as Joe. Stacy Martin takes good care of the youthful side, the rise of the nymphomania and finding love. She plays the stronger, rising side of Joe. Charlotte takes care of Joe's fall, wisdom and darker sides. Charlotte Gainsbourg is a great actress and have proved herself to be a great asset to Lars von Trier's stories in these three movies, and this seemed like it was her time to have fun, as she lays the trilogy to rest.There are many tricks done to enhance the movie without being a visual-obsessed creation which you could argue ""Antichrist"" was at times. The opening is fantastic, many of the illustrative shots would perhaps serve more purpose on the big screen, and as Joe climbs a mountain to discover a lonely, naked and twisted tree on the very top I'll admit I was happy I saw it on the big screen.""Nymphomaniac"" is a very long movie to get through, but it has a lot of things going on. The story is quick and Seligman keeps us busy with his intellect (which brings a lot of the comedy), so it's hard to be bored. People are always split when it comes to Lars von Trier's movies, and that will be the case here too. Some will see it simply as smut, some as pretentious garbage, but if you manage to care about Joe then odds are you will be interested from start to finish. It's strictly about Joe, the actresses portraying her makes her likable even when she shows how little she cares about anything but her sexuality. We're all our own judge whether she is the bad, horrible person that she claims her nymphomania makes her, because I don't think a clear message is to be found. Even down to the finale it can be seen from different angles, which works as she tells her story to Seligman, her complete opposite in every way. You'd need to losen the tie a bit for this movie, because it might be pretentious, provocative and pushing buttons for the sake of it at times, but it's actually an entertaining movie that shows many sides of Lars von Trier. It has a million things going to make it an interesting, captivating movie. I'll need time and rewatches to know how well it stands up against his filmography. We went to see the life story of a nymphomaniac, and that's what you get.More reviews at FilmBizarro.com",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
75,sackofwhine,An odyssey of lust,8,13 March 2021,"Directors CutI'm just going to straight up say this film is a dark comedy and I thought it was hilarious. While its not Von Trier at his most operatic and forceful, he pushes all the right buttons when he needs to. His handwriting is what constructs the substance and his characters are just pawns waiting to be placed in the right position for the poetic impact to work.Indeed, Von Trier is so sure of his style that it might come across as quite brash and loud, but on the other hand his formal control and exuberant personality shine through every frame. It's a mixture of clashing emotions, a mosaic of pain and humor. Dark, fascinating and fresh, like a typical Von Trier.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
76,meissotruey,"Pre-fire 10, Master Trier",10,20 September 2020,"It's hard to say something certain about the ""art"" of Trier, as about the art itself.

77,thomasshahbaz,"Contains merit, though you have to work for it.",5,24 June 2014,"This is an interesting, intellectual piece on the nature of sex, love, addiction and morality. It's a shame Von Trier seems intent on inserting explicit sex into his work these days, as it mostly serves to alienate the viewer (or me, anyway) from the message of the work.In response to those who call him a pornographer, I couldn't disagree more. I'm not sure whether the sex in this film is gratuitous, perhaps it is, but it certainly isn't titillating at all, and I don't believe it's meant to be. In fact it's quite the opposite, coming off as depressing, soulless and devoid of humanity, except for that of Joe's victims.I'm not sure what I feel about the film overall, but I'd say it's more good than bad, and definitely worth a watch.A note on the different versions: I've seen the longer version, but saw half of the shorter, cut version, and honestly I can't say it seemed to make much difference. When something is so graphic, why censor it at all?",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
78,thao,A magnificent film which takes its subject matter very seriously,9,30 January 2014,"This review is for both parts.One gets the feeling that Trier is out to make the definitive sex drama, and maybe even his own magnum opus. In it he touches on almost every form of sexual desires and deviations, and does so in an honest and explicit way. A lot of these themes are investigated in the light of religion and psychology with refreshing and provocative ideas thrown into the mix. This is a huge film. Not only because it is long but also because it tackles a huge subject and takes its time to investigate each one of them.I saw the 4 hour short version of the films (it is actually two films, each with end credits and separate names) and even though 4 hours is more than enough time for most films it never felt too long. If anything I felt that the 2nd film could have used more time to develop relationships. It felt a little rushed. So I'm quite sure that the film needs the extra 1 and 1/2 hour we get with the directors cut. The films open with a text saying that this is a ""censored"" and shortened version of Trier's film, made with his consent but not with his involvement. I believe Trier has not even seen these versions. You can tell that they have been censored. Even though you see genitals in close up they usually cut to faces during intercourse. There are some explicit oral sex scenes (for both men and women) and men are shown getting aroused. So the film does push the envelope but not as much as some had expected. It has been hard getting the film shown in some countries so maybe censoring was the right move. Otherwise it might have gone straight to DVD and Blu Ray. So is it porn? It has scenes that could have been lifted from a porn film but the focus is never on sexual scenes to get the audience aroused, but rather on the story, so I don't agree with those who call this film porn. The sex scenes serve the story perfectly unlike in porn films where the story serves the sex scenes.There are a lot of references to Antichrist here. It has the two main actors in the film. Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) believes she is evil and refers to many religious ideas and imagery to support it (the dangerous evil woman) and there is even a scene from Antichrist with the same music. These films are also an homage to Tarkovsky (like Antichrist was). The first film opens with a borrowed shot from Solaris (maybe because this is going to be the same kind of inner journey). The 2nd part opens with a levitation scene, not unlike the one we see in The Mirror and one of the chapters in the film is even called The Mirror.I loved the use of music in the film. We get everything from heavy metal to Talking Heads to Bach, with often detailed information about these music masterpieces. It kind of reminded me of the way Lynch uses music in Lost Highway. One can even say that the opening is a homage to that film (where the camera goes into darkness and comes out again).It goes without saying that the main theme of the film is sex but it is far from being the only theme. There is a lot of religious and psychological themes throughout the film, and the film takes its time to explain art, fly fishing and what not.I know I have not said anything about the story. I think it is best to go in not knowing. Let's just say that this is an odyssey of a Nympomaniac and she goes to a lot of places on her journey from a 7 year old to a grown up woman (there are 3 actresses that play her throughout these stages of her life).As always in a Trier film, the film is extremely well acted. It is often self conscious, both in its style and acting. Trier even writes on the film, both numbers and words, and one of the characters in the film explains historical facts to Charlotte Gainsbourg but Trier never hides the fact that these explanations are really there for the audience and maybe even more so for himself as a narrative way into the story.SPOILERS! Regarding the end of the film. Some might take it as a silly, almost Twilight Zone way of ending the film. I think it fits well with the previous Freud themes discussed. Freud said that suppressing sexual desires (the ID) was unhealthy, and would lead to psychological problems in the end. So the end could be tied into that. But it could also be seen as a confirmation of what Charlotte Gainsbourg's character said all along. She was evil (ala Antichrist), but the man did not takes her warnings seriously and payed the price for that. Maybe I'm just trying to explain away the strangeness of the ending, because it does feel strange. END OF SPOILERS.I think this is a magnificent film which takes its subject matter very seriously. It is among Trier's best films and it might even be his magnum opus in the uncut version. It is beautiful to look at and definitely a film you want to see at the cinema, even in its shorter version.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
79,ricardopthomaz,Awesome first Volume!,9,24 March 2014,"This review I originally made on January, it was on my 2014 movie list, I just added it now to the movie profile to put both Vol. I and II reviews together a single time, so, nevermind the date in the site for this particular one. Anyway, on with my January thoughts...Wow! Unbelievable movie! I just went expecting something and ended up watching something completely different! Believe me, Lars Von Trier is a crazy bastard!He associates sex with anything you want! Jesus, I just saw the freakin' Fibonacci sequence, fishing, Bach music, all of it in a movie about someone addicted to sex! It was crazy! What a ride! And I mean it in a good manner! Can't wait to see Vol. II coming out on March! Jesus, pardon my pun, but my brain just had an orgasm! I mean it! Great one! Oh, and thanks for the Rammstein tune, Mr. Von Trier! I'll think about using it next time I lay down! Hehehe! Wow, just unbelievable! Go watch it!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
80,anthonymora2,Major Movie Review: Nymphomaniac Vol. I,9,21 October 2014,"LARS VON TRIER,is a director that really intrigues me,I might be in the minority there,as a number of his films cause a LOT of controversy concerning their themes and just what this man puts to screen.Some are MELANCHOLIA and my favorite of his the extremely risqué and graphic ANTI-Christ That being said,I just watched the first half of his 2 part epic,NYMPHOMANIAC VOL.1 and while many people are brushing this off as ""another artsy film with sex thrown in for the sake of shock"" I want to be the one to let you intellectually mature followers of mine know,that NYMPHOMANIAC is actually a deep,character study that at times can be quite funny but ALWAYS entertaining and REALLY insightful.CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG,plays Joe,she's a woman laying out on the middle of a cold and wet street bruised and bloodied.A gentle man named,Seligman(STELLEN SKARSGARD)finds Joe and takes her in for some warmth and tea.Upon waking up the two begin talking about how she came upon looking nearly dead in an alley.Joe says to understand why she was there,she'd have to tell her whole story.So her starts at the beginning.Literally all the way back to her childhood and how this woman grew up with an extreme case of sex addiction.What we see are jumps to different points in time of her life.So if you're familiar with VON TRIER'S work,than you know the man doesn't have a mainstream eye for how he crafts his films,so for casual movie goers you'd probably get turned off with just the first 5 minutes which I don't blame you,heavy metal beginning credits anyone? However,when the story telling kicks in,the movie absolutely shines!The story is told through flashbacks showing Young Joe played by STACY MARTIN(more on her later) and between moments of flashbacks we get these very intriguing monologues between Adult Joe and Seligman that consist of conversations of fishing and how it parallels with how people look for a sexual partner.Some of my favorite scenes actually take place with just the two main characters talking.Also other than the great script you get a really uniquely directed film with interesting use of text and stock footage that emphasizes important story points and themes.There's a really impressive cast put together and everyone really brings very good performances,even SHIA LABEOUF has a decent acting role here other than screaming for Optimus all the time.CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG and STELLEN SKARSGARD are terrific in their roles,I really got to like their characters and their back and forth conversation. UMA THURMAN,who I didn't even know was in this movie ALMOST steals this movie though.I loved her in the KILL BILL movies, she was a perfect mix of feminine power and a held in pain.She has ONE scene in this movie.Just one.And it might be the most uncomforting scene I've seen all year and there's no graphic sex or even a kiss shown at all and that's saying something!She nailed her scene so well.NOW, I wanna talk about the star of this movie, STACY MARTIN.This is a movie of one woman's sex addiction and how she goes from having exciting discoveries with her sexuality as a young girl to the really dark and disturbing parts where she uses sex as a coping technique to deal with personal pain.There is so much more to this movie than I think it's being credited for! The way the movie is filmed I legitimately could not tell whether the sex scenes in this movie were real or not,and Ms.MARTIN goes through..quite a bit of scenes.Whether she's having sex for pleasure or pain you believe her emotions she goes through each time.There are some heart wrenching moments that show the personal and light hearted side of Joe and STACY MARTIN is an actress that can really pull off an emotional scene so genuinely.Her scenes with a surprisingly great Christian SLATER,as her father,were very touching and almost brought me tears at some points.After watching the movie it disgusted me with how much negativity I read surrounding the young actress after this movie's release concerning her strongly sexual character.I think she should be applauded!She loses herself in this role and brings humanity to an other wise taboo maybe even disgusting human being. Her performance is award worthy and I would love to see her acting chops in more movies in the future.This is a gorgeously shot movie,which is no surprise for a VON TRIER joint.Cinematography and shots are expertly thought through, but it's the music that was inconsistent for me.It lacked a strong score that would've complimented the rest of the film's technical glow.I really enjoyed NYMPHO VOL.1 as a film lover.Is it for everyone?PPFFHA hell no, do NOT watch this with mom and pop yall!But for mature folk that love character studies, film making, story telling,or even the unfortunately taboo subject of sex you'll hopefully enjoy it as much as I did.For the right audience I GIVE MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!BUY THIS MOVIE! 9/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
81,simondclinch-1,The film equivalent of the Soho good-time girl,1,2 June 2014,"A mindless romp of sick-making sensationalist perversion, lacking even in pornographic value. Not all of Lars von Triers films are this bad. Just almost all. And this one does fall into the category of those which aim to exploit sensationalism without delivering any compensating merit.Looking back on his films, it has been a while since I can bother to watch more than 30 minutes of such tripe and this one is no exception.The average rating is a poor reflection on the average viewer. I don't mind sex and violence as long as they are presented in the context of a decent plot, such as can be found in the Ancient Roman genre of films and TV series. But there is no plot here. So just forget it and move on!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
82,temrok9,Part One,6,12 February 2014,"The most important thing about Nymphomaniac(part one) is that it introduces a totally fresh way of looking at things in cinema in a time when most artists suffer from the disease of repetition;extremely funny and at the same time poetic, it also comes as something out of the blue that catches us unprepared and that's the beauty of it.For example, when people try to praise the meanings of the movie, it feels banal because the film introduces new ways of seeing and feeling, so it's really great art, and I wouldn't say the same for many other movies of Trier.Genuine as very few things we've met the last years, Nymphomaniac is enjoyable in many ways.That's all for the time.You true believers wait patiently;here comes part two!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
83,culturedogs,Provoked? Good. (contains likely spoiler about 50 Shades of Grey),8,27 April 2014,"I saw Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac.Provoked? Good. Because that is something Von Trier does even better than make films. And he is very good at making films.Few modern filmmakers seem to treasure their relationship to provocation as Lars Von Trier. He seems to welcome every critic who doesn't/ can't/ won't ""get"" his movies as part of the discussion that his movies provoke. It seems Nymphomaniac has engendered a predictable range of reactions – outrage looming large above them. But Von Trier is ahead of the knee-jerk outrage.He doesn't mean to provoke merely to peddle predictable soft porn. There is a further level of outrage to experience within the sexual tales told by Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) to the seemingly sexless Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard), as each tale gets broken down into metaphor by the latter to the frustration of the former. Telling the tales of her sexual misadventures, Joe seeks to prove to Seligman how awful a person she is, but Seligman happily makes the effort to frame her amorality within metaphors from the worlds of politics, music and even fishing, all in an effort to re-humanize her story, after a fashion.In this way, Von Trier circumvents expectations unless you know your Von Trier – he seems to revel in developing characters in impossible situations that test the limits of their hearts and their faith – even questioning the existence of ""hearts"" and ""faith"" given the often corrosive realities of human existence. Even more ""outrageous"" is how often he does this with a demonstrable sense of humor.In Nymphomaniac and I want you to be shocked by this there are naked people. Mostly when having sex. Yup. People have sex in a movie called Nymphomaniac.At times in the film, it seems that Von Trier is shoving the realities of the ""sexual revolution"" of the mid-20th century right in our faces, for its' good (empowerment) and bad (see Spider-Man's line about what comes with ""Great Power"" – hint: it's not as fun).You could try boiling down his cinematic statement to simple misogyny, but, as with the heroines of Melancholia or Dogville or any number of Von Trier vehicles, he respects Joe too much to have her disintegrate on camera for no reason. Joe's sexual acts are justified in their moments (Von Trier (via Skarsgard's Seligman) even questions how a scornful society would feel about her actions were they performed by a man).Joe insists she is not after redemption in Seligman's eyes, but continues to tell her tales. There is a conflicted motivation in the telling of her tales that I believe Von Trier meant to mirror the conflicting motivations of any audience going to see it.Want to come see this movie to see Stacy Martin (as the young Joe) and Charlotte Gainsbourg get naked? Yup, that's there, but you'll also have to see them confronted by a family Joe's actions helped destroy (Uma Thurman plays the jilted wife and mother) or confronting racism in the context of sexuality (as the adult Joe seeks to proposition two African men with whom she wants, essentially, a non-verbal tryst).Want to see the lusty Joe confronted with an actual ""romantic"" relationship? Done, but she dotes on the perfunctory Jerome (played for much of the film by an oddly accented Shia LaBoeuf), who is a sexually disconnected mess, try as he might. He is beneath her, judging her sexuality while struggling to embrace and envelop it, to no avail. She seems drawn to him over and over, in a disconnected, puzzling way at times.Looking for an excuse for Joe's extreme behavior in a damaged upbringing? Also done, but the damage is a damage perhaps not unfamiliar to many in the audience – no abuse in the form of horrific beatings or being locked away in a cellar dungeon, or as a ""Flower in the Attic"". Nope, just an emotionally unavailable mom (Connie Nielsen) caught up in games of solitaire and a dad (Christian Slater) with which she bonds over their mutual love of the forest. (Sadly, we also witness with some grim detail her ordeal as she watches her father dying in a hospital room) Now if Von Trier is so interested in subverting and dodging expectations, throwing up notable bits of ugly with seductive beauty (including some typically beautiful cinematography by Manuel Alberto Claro (who shot the GORGEOUS Melancholia for Von Trier)), why engage those expectations of titillation or romantic escapism or even emotional connection at all? Well if nothing I've said sells you, consider this: The film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey is set to hit theaters and do big things (presumably, based on the book). Its' casting has been scrutinized and promoted vigorously.The fix is in for this ""erotic romance"" novel to be a big hit. Its' young heroine enters a relationship with a powerful businessman who is very into BDSM. Apparently (according to the Wikipedia entry), she eventually ""escapes"" from that relationship by novels' end, but (SPOILER ALERT) the film is the first in a (you guessed it) trilogy.In Nymphomaniac, Joe willingly enters a BDSM arrangement with K (Jamie Bell), an arrangement which ends as soon as actual sex enters the picture, and which has immediately destructive consequences in Joe's life.Yes, Von Trier is rubbing your noses in the conflicted mess of sexuality as it has manifested through the history of cinema, confronting you with a story with sex at its' center, and messy, confusing, wild emotions all around.People will probably be more comfortable watching Fifty Shades. And that's what Von Trier is concerned about (even as he embraces the contradictions): the commoditizing of sexuality; the reduction of its' reality into a glossed over stereotype.That's a stereotype that Von Trier dares to exploit and explode at the same time. There will be no Nymphomaniac Volume Three.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
84,Zebb67,Involving Character Study,10,10 August 2014,"Those claiming this film is a porno with wall to wall sex either haven't actually seen it or they simply don't like films that deal with sexuality. This is an excellent character study of an obviously disturbed woman. Those expecting lots of sex will be disappointed, as good portion of the film consists of the woman, rescued by an older man after a severe beating, talking to the man about her life and her self-defeating view of the world and human nature. Yes, there is sex (a small portion of it not simulated) and nudity, but if that offends you, you probably shouldn't watch movies with the word ""nymphomaniac"" in the title. Like Michael Haneke, Lars Von Trier always makes bold movies like Melancholia that challenge audiences, not all of which I have particularly liked. But this one is less arty, having a more direct narrative. Definitely worth seeing for the brave of heart.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
85,Miss_Xray,Boring and more boring,1,20 February 2016,"This film is neither sexy or interesting. I had to turn it off.

I thought first ""this is promising, some good music, but then maybe it will be a shitty film"" and yes it was. I search for some erotic films, but real tired of films like this ending up in those lists.. just cause it contains sex doesn't make it erotic.

You know, the thing with Lars is that he is so honest that I began relating to this nymphomaniac. That was absolutely beautiful and something I never imagined I could relate to. I mean a sex addict? Most directors would be afraid to make a film about this.Lars wasn't afraid, yet... it seems like he is not afraid a bit too much. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to taboo anything, all I'm saying is that it is not necessary to always have some ""weirdness"" in a film to make it watchable. Although I understand it is his style of visual storytelling (to make it REALLY visual), I think there was a bit of an overdo with Nymphomaniac. I think if not the narrative story, this could absolutely be taken as a pornographic movie. And I bet the 6 hours sooth by so quickly for some people precisely for this reason.Nevertheless, Von Trier always gives me the chance to expand my mind, and look at something from a different perspective which I love and am very thankful for.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

How a woman, with such quirky features, can be so beautiful, is an aesthetic marvel. I think I may have even seen her private parts. The movie is replete with unsimulated sex. BUT,for many of us, in this age of pornography, the sexual imagery has lost its over-riding significance and impact. This film is to sex as the ""Wild Bunch"" was to gore. The graphic sex or the graphic violence gives legitimacy to the visual dimension of the narrative.

90,MannyInNewYork,Fortunately movies don't have an aroma (spoiler. If that's possible),1,13 January 2015,"Why I believe this was complete crap. Pretentious dialog, boring unappealing characters and cheap shot shock-value scenes. Some suggest that this was originally constructed as a porn film and that it was later ""re-cut"" in an attempt to pass it off as an art-film – whatever – it sucked. Much like in the scene where the bondage-boy tells our leading lady that ""she isn't ready yet"" (which he determined by inserting his fingers into her and then ""inspecting "" his fingers) – I was clearly not ready either – this is garbage. Pointless. Depressing. No redeeming value. If I had to find something positive to say about this cinematic turd, I'd have to say that it served as a reminder of just how lame the pompous ""artsy"" crowd can be. I love the critics calling it ""a major work"". Work? Really? My fav review says it ""succeeds to organically synthesize the world, ideas and filmmaking savvy of Von trier"" – ""organically synthesize"" – what exactly does this mean (if it means it's a POS then I agree.

91,d-JCB,compelling & analytical tale of sexual obsession,8,3 April 2014,"have to say that i was pleasantly surprised how compelling Lars von Trier﻿'s 4hr film on nymphomania was the other night... the film explores the topic of sex / lust / love in an analytical way, while keeping the actual acts of sex to an intensity level lower than Antichrist﻿, tho there are some brutal moments of course... if anything this is a film that supports feminism by close, with female sexual liberty & how Charlotte Gainsbourg﻿ shares her addictive nature to Stellan Skarsgård﻿ throughout... Stellen's commentary on comparisons to sex and other topics is very effective to give the film a deeper look into how human behavior has many companions... this is LVT's most thought out / researched film as far as the content discussed goes, which makes this an educational experience as well as an erotic journey of sexual obsession - 8/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
92,forlornnesssickness,Nymphomaniac: Vol. I : Her therapy begins,6,14 June 2014,"The story starts with a beaten woman left unconscious on a gloomy alley during one night. Fortunately, a man named Seligman(Stellan Skarsgård) discovers her when he is returning to his home, and he kindly takes her to the house after she regains her consciousness. When she feels a little better as resting on the bed, Joe(Charlotte Gainsbourg) reveals that she is a nymphomaniac, and that is the beginning of their long night's journey into day; she confides to Seligman about how 'bad' she has been in her whole life, and he is ready to listen to whatever she wants to tell him.The movie moves chapter by chapter as showing how Joe was destined to her self-destructive lifestyle from the beginning. Even when she was very young, Joe already discovered what she could do with her private part. When she reaches adolescence, young Joe(Stacy Martin) and her best friend(Sophie Kennedy Clark) actively begin their sexual adventure not long after Joe loses her virginity through a young mechanic named Jerôme(Shia LaBeouf), who later becomes one of the main characters in Joe's story through a couple of unbelievable coincidences.As her life story being told and shown to us, the movie frequently stops and moves back to Joe and Seligman in their ponderous but weirdly interesting conversation on how her story can be interpreted. Sometimes wondering whether her story is really true or not because of its rather implausible aspects, Seligman, a well-read man filled with lots of knowledge he has absorbed from books, makes some comments on fly fishing, geometry, Fibonacci numbers, Edgar Allen Poe, and many other things during his phlegmatic musing on Joe's life story, but Joe does not seem to be impressed or enlightened by that while maintaining her tired detachment as before.Their interactions feel a little too monotonous, but the movie becomes as playful as Roman Polanski's ""Bitter Moon""(1992) while having a sly fun with Joe's continuing story which seems to be gradually influenced by the ongoing feedback between Joe and Seligman. Joe's first intercourse is remembered with the numbers of pumping motion made during Jerôme's two penetration acts, and we are reminded that they are Fibonacci numbers. The scene in which Joe parks Jerôme's car is literally presented with a geometric style as the camera looks down upon the car, and Joe and her best friend's rebellious sex circle joined by other girls is musically interpreted as a sort of Satanic cabal just because they used tritone in their ritual music.One of the most amusing moments in the movie comes from the one- upmanship game between Joe and her best friend on train. They lure their targets with a simple question about lavatory at first, but they soon go up to the higher levels because it is more fun to them. At one level, they throw a number of questions beginning with ""wh"" to their targets; at the other level, they disguise themselves as someone to be consoled, which turns out to be a more tempting bait for their catches. To her delight, Joe finds that guys are ready to 'console' her in lavatory – even when she just says that she is sad because her dear 'dwarf hamster' died.Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgård are well-known as von Trier's usual collaborators, but they take a backseat in their curiously colorless performances. I guess that was an intentional acting choice; Joe is numb and empty at that point as a world-weary woman who has seen it all, and Seligman is just mildly interested in her story as trying to understand and persuade her that she is not a bad woman as she thinks, and that is all they will express through their faces as they talk and talk through their long night.In contrast, Stacy Martin, a young Franco-English actress who made a debut with this film, has a lot more things to do in the movie, and she is very convincing while bravely hurling herself into many moments which would be quite challenging to any talented actress. She and her co- actors are ready to do anything for their director, and they bring absolute conviction to the film even when it feels silly and outrageous. Regardless of what you think about his recent odd behaviors, Shia LaBeouf gives a good performance in his scenes with Martin, and Uma Thurman virtually steals the show even though she appears only in one scene.As self-consciously pointed out through its artificial narrative structure, ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"" is more or less than a bait, or a foreplay, for what will be presented to us later, but it is a compellingly intellectual examination of sexuality and destructive impulse associated with it. I really have no idea about what's inside Lars von Trier's mind, but, as proved again in this challenging piece of work, he is a master provocateur who never bores us while shocking and provoking us with bold attempts to be appreciated.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
93,YaumingYMC,A Great film not for the prudish,10,26 September 2014,"I'm a bit surprised by the number of harsh reviews on the film. It seems all the prudes decided to get together and watch a film about a woman with a mental health problem and then gang-rape the film with their harsh Victorian purity reviews - ""OMG it has too much sex!!"" Good grief - you're watching a film about a sex addict - what were you expecting??? Tea and scones with Mr Darcy?I found the film incredibly revealing about the human condition. Here is a rare type of woman who desires and gets what she wants. So what? She has sex with strangers and enjoys doing it. What's the big deal about that?Isn't it liberating that a woman takes charge of her own sexuality and does what she wants???Anyway I also found it humorous - take the reverse parking incident - what a powerful feminist image that was - here was a woman who took control of the man's car and did something most men assume they can only do - reverse park.The film is also layered with beautiful scenes and images like:1. If you have wings why don't you fly?2. The father and his daughter in the forest - feeling the wind blowing through the Ash Tree leaves.3. The dialogue between Joe and Seligman - I found their accents and conversation beautiful and touching.I was going to leave a 8/10 review... but seeing all the ghastly puritanical reviews that give it a 1 rating. I'm going to give it 10.Two things I didn't like about the film was the heavy metal music used at the start. I thought it was inappropriate and set the wrong tone for the film. But that is a simple error easily rectified by replacing the soundtrack with a piano piece by Chopin - like ""Raindrops"" otherwise known as Preludes, Op 28, No. 15.The choice of Joe's lover - the actor Shia LeBeouf. He just didn't seem to fit the bill for me. Someone like Jude Law (younger actor of course) would have been preferable.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
94,ProfessorFate,So much more than just shocking sex,9,15 April 2014,"First off, this is a review of both volumes 1 & 2, considered as one film.Secondly, the framework of this film is the life of a woman obsessed with sex, so obviously there are many graphic scenes of sexual acts. Sex is central to the plot. Those criticizing it for gratuitous sexual content and calling it pornography are ridiculous, and most likely part of the hypocritical sexual fascism the director is attacking, so their objectivity is highly questionable.Lars von Trier has set up this elaborate plot and spiced it with all sorts of sexual content: some of it shocking (the S & M sequence is difficult to watch), some humorous (the ""parade of penises"") and some heartbreaking (Uma Thurman as ""Mrs. H""). He gives us a character (Seligman) through whom we can safely observe and digest these scenes, and experience his unique comparisons to the sexual activities. But much more important than the sex and Seligman's often humorous tangents is the true theme of the film: the guilt Western society has placed on female sexuality. This film is downright profound in it's view of sexual oppression.For those who doubt the film's depth, consider the topics covered in the conversations between Joe and Seligman: an examination of the true nature of love (which Joe cynically refers to as ""lust plus jealousy""), the view of women in a traditional love relationship as a possession of the man (Joe slowly developed the ""desire to be one of Jerome's 'things'.""), political correctness and language and its relationship to democracy (Joe believes most people are too stupid for democracy), the comparison between the three elements of a Bach orchestration and three of Joe's regular lovers (who also represent three distinct types of sexual need - reliability, animal passion, and love), etc., etc. From fly fishing to spoons to the correct way to parallel park, from soul trees to the mothering instinct to man's place in the universe, there is SOOO much more going on here than just sex.One of Lars von Trier's most extraordinary and bold films. I'll give it a nine for now, but I suspect it will age very well.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
95,rhyllann,Very Humorous & (Not Sexual) Educational...,8,18 December 2019,"I completely enjoyed this movie. While I get very annoyed with stupid gratuitous sex in all movies (if I want a porn flick, I'll go star in one), I had seen the cast--a lot of children--and assumed that this would be a descent into what makes a person into what they become. THAT interests me, the backstory.What an enjoyable ride (no pun intended) with a lot of humor and interesting trivia about fishing, ash trees and music.If the male appendage does not upset you (but only the female form is acceptable--in that case, go back to junior high school where you belong), then I highly recommend this movie.

96,austinfromdahood,Gross but good,7,1 July 2019,"It's been awhile since I wrote a movie review on IMDb, my first one of the summer actually. I've been working pretty hard on a screenplay I'm writing, and I'm currently 28 pages in. I've been missing reviewing movies so I'll review Nymphomaniac Vol. 1 today.Lars Von Trier is a weird dude. He legit said at Cannes a few years ago that he sympathises with Hitler and that freaks me out. He apparently said he was joking, but I still think he's weird as hell. Anyways, I saw this movie on Netflix, and when it was done, I was like ""why is this movie on Netflix?"" Nymphomaniac Vol. 1 is one of the grossest movies I've ever seen. There are many sex scenes in this movie that disgust me that I want to erase from my memory. The film follows the life of a nymphomaniac, and sex is to be expected in the story, but Lars Von Trier decided to go all out and film the most rough and not holding back sex scenes probably in cinema history.There are many good things in this film though, like the acting, especially from Stacy Martin and Shia Lebouf, who had to do all the dirty stuff. If I was an actor, I'd probably never do a role similar to Stacy Martin's or Shia Lebouf's performance in this film. The cinematography is great, typical for a Lars Von Trier film. He does great stuff with the camera, but shows the grossest things, especially in this movie. There are editing techniques that are very meta that I actually really like. Things pop onto the screen that correlate with what the characters are saying and doing, and I really like that.Nymphomaniac Vol. 1 is a good film. Lars Von Trier knows his stuff, but should really hold himself back with his desires and lust when it comes to filmmaking. I'd probably never see this movie ever again, and I'll watch Nymphomaniac Vol. 2 one day. I'm gonna give Nymphomaniac Vol. 1 an 8/10.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
97,victuki,Von Trier and Sex,6,27 August 2014,"Ideally, I would not watch this kind of film, since it is divided into two segments, and I would not get the whole picture. But this is Lars Von Trier, and as usual, his work unleashes chaos and controversy. That is why I could not help it, and I decided to watch it. Well, Volume I is certainly interesting, but nothing as eccentric as I expected. Von Trier brings us ""polemics"". This time it is a story about sex, about nymphomania (now substituted by ""hipersexuality"" for both masculine and feminine disorders). It is the story of Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a woman that after being found and sheltered by Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård), tells him her story, her colorful and plentiful sexual life, as an addiction, philosophy and way of life. Seligman, apparently an average man, will become a fantastic audience, able to relate her sexual adventures and schemes to those of fishing. Well, both are natural activities, are they not? Apparently, this was all about sex, lust and so on, but this is only the story of a girl with an emotional disorder, or rather than that, little or no emotional intelligence. She is devoted to her addiction, regardless the damage and pain it might involve or create. Seligman frequently points out that such actions do not make her the terrible human being she thinks she is. Sex is obsession, lack of control, passion...we find all that in Joe's story, no tricks. She is a girl that does not fit in society, nor wants to. It is nothing new or offensive, just the same old song, how sex, something natural, has been filtered by social and cultural values until it has become a reproductive activity, or a free yet bounded pleasure in general. Newcomer Stacey Martin plays the young version of Gainsbourg, in a daring move, since working for Von Trier must be not a conventional debut whatsoever. It is though refreshing to see an actress that does not try to impose herself over the written material. She delivers, and she does it in great fashion. Until I watch Volume II, I can say Von Trier has convinced me. It promised to be interesting, and it was. I'm in, and that's an example that sex or love are things we never get tired to talk about. Because it is natural, simple and complex.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

100,zuhairvazir,"'For every hundred crimes committed in the name of love, only one is committed in the name of sex.' - Joe from Nymphomaniac Volume 1",9,7 April 2014,"Do not be mistaken. This is a film by the aberrant and outlandish Lars von Trier, who after a lengthy bout of depression made a film in 2009, which is an 'uneasy-intimate' experience with subtle, slow motion shots of snow fall, an exquisite shower sex-scene and babies accidentally (SPOILER) falling out of open windows. The camera follows the entire 23 second fall of the toddler until the tiny thing (I am still trying to convince myself that it was only a film prop; it certainly was, but not the fiendishly beautiful direction) makes contact with asphalt (SPOILER ENDS). The metamorphoses of the film into a full blown violent, psychological horror drama is film-making at its best and most vile. Not everything is in good taste (I look at scissors in a completely different way now), however the imagery and the cinematography by an old friend of Triers, Manuel Alberto Claro made Antichrist (2009) one of the most intriguing, complex, mind-bending & belief shattering films of all time. It's earthy, it's puerile and in the end it is a numbing masterpiece and more closely; an analogy of loss, grief, companionship and a mother trying to change the shape of her baby boy's feet by making him wear the left shoe on the right feet and right one on the left. A conflict where all hell breaks loose. Wrong sides. ***'For every hundred crimes committed in the name of love, only one is committed in the name of sex.' - Joe from Nymphomaniac Volume 1. Nymphomaniac Volume 1 also has shots of children putting on performances that they should not have to. I would love to think the editing took care of that and put in body doubles - heck no - that wishful thinking goes flying out the window as the camera zooms in on the two year old. It's a dreary tract, much like Edgar Allen Poe's tragic, horror short: 'The Fall of the House of Usher', complete with peeling walls and Grey, gloomy backgrounds inter-cut with the neon lighting of the city and the slinky, flashy call-girl costumes the girls wear to a self-invented contest. The game? I'm not telling. The prize: a bag of candies that fifteen year old love. The bait (an insect whose larvae is called the nymph) is where the story begins. Now, you see; while watching Shia LaBeouf and Stacy Martin f*ck (yes, f*ck and not make love), the director flashes numbers on the screen. 3 + 2 = 5. Five becoming a rendition of 'The Little Organ Book: Ich Ruf Zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ' by Bach. Trier, Gainsbourg and Skarsgard break the symphony down, they dissect it and in the end the notes and arrangement of the entire piece makes a pattern of the uterus. In one scene Joe tells Seligman a truly sickening story. And when the caretaker asks her if the episode affected her, she says no. I had the same expression of shock and surprise that Skarsgard's character did, just that the impact of the answer made me cover my mouth as a result of my reaction to the utterly appalling, mono-syllabic answer: 'No'.It was a joy (in a hurting way) to watch Christian Slater in a significant role after a rather long time, and it was also painful to watch him towards the end. I'm not telling, you will know when it happens. Slater has not been this good ever. Mrs. H (Uma Thurman) breaks down in front of all the wrong people and if that performance does not get accolades and nods, I'm gonna quit watching the Oscars. Hey, wait a second. That's already a check on my bucket list since three years.Nymphomaniac questions its own ideas and beliefs and Trier is bold enough to dismiss his own philosophy by a counter reaction from another character. 'I never thought of it that way', says Seligman to Joe. Plus forget LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky. You will have to, when you see shots of full penetration between Jerome and Joe. Bumblebee was super cool, however I'm sure the Nymphomaniac series will not have any merchandising to do. It's a film, a brutal, no-nonsense piece of raw, art. An explosion of repressed emotions.I would be lying if I said the sex is only a metaphor in this film; no it is not. Sex is that nucleus in the film around which the atoms form and multiply and make their way to the darkest recesses of the sub- conscious - I'm almost tempted to watch Volume II at once, however I would like the effect of the first to settle in.If you choose to watch (not many will - there's 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' running at $96 mil; opening weekend) go in with an empty mind and you may come out either hating Trier and what he makes actors like Dafoe and Nielson and Thurman do or, like me, you may fall in love with the whole deal and replay it again and again in the mind to keep the ideas explored in the film, fresh.If you watched and liked Funny Games, Melancholia, Dogville, Stalker et al. you will fall in love with the soulless surface of the film and the many Jungian ideologies and Renaissance reformation layers upon which it stands, hard and erect. This one had me; hook, line and sinker. Remember to watch the look in Slater's forlorn eyes when he looks at his daughter after he has soiled himself in the hospital bed.

It was a boring excuse of a film. Actually, it was so bad and so downright silly at times that it was comical. Two brothers with large bouncing erections arguing over who has which position with a girl, while she got up and left and they never noticed, was hilarious.The lead premise seems to be 'freedom of expression through sexual gratification and exploration' etc was just absurd. Film has lots of graphic sex, vaginal penetration by numerous objects (some sharp and quite unpleasant) so if that's your cup of tea, you'll get that, though I find vaginas boring. A lot of it is pretty disgusting, and some of it is pretty upsetting (the neglect of a child).The really funny disclaimer, much like 'no animals were hurt during the filming of this film' was that 'none of the professional actors engaged in penetration, a body double was used"".Perhaps the most comical is the entire pomposity and pretense of being a high brow film, when it's just ordinary, and only funny by accident, though it does have an impressive few cameo appearances.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

I know Von Triers from ""Dancer In The Dark"", a film that I liked but found nearly unbearable to watch and only saw once and never want to see again. I recognize the talent, however, and braced myself for another helping. Little did I know what I was really in for. The bottom line is that these films depict a world inhabited by people that are desperately and hopelessly doomed. I've never seen such nihilistic portrayals in my life. I'm all for ""realism"" in films but I don't want to be thrown into the ""real lives"" of these people....no, no a thousand times no! Their world is so bleak and hopeless and devoid of any affection or warmth or light that it simply looses any sense to it. The lives of these people have not an iota of the elements that make living worthwhile so once that's realized, after about a minute, it becomes pure torture. I pride myself on my level of tolerance for the fetishes and idiosyncrasies that people have but sheer brutality is something that I know exists but care not to be thrown into in brutal graphic detail.

Ignore them.Von Trier has crafted what may be his magnum opus. He goes further into his often explored themes of suffering, femininity and the breaking of social norms. Indeed, this may be one of the most intense inquisitions into the female mind ever put to film. And it has a refreshingly feminist, sex positive tonal undercurrent. The drama really gets going in the second volume which I enjoyed much more than the first. Incredible acting from all involved but Jamie Bell, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Uma Thurman especially.

It has bad moments, but it must be said it has some flashes of brilliance. Von Trier is a funny guy, a filmmaker who plays with his audience and can occasionally go a bit far, but this film is, at it's core, a warm hearted and sympathetic look at a woman driven to extreme behaviour by her own inner demons. The dialogue is at times clunky and feels like it is being read from the page- particularly by Gainsbourg, who I thought was less well suited to this role than that in Antichrist. Her flat delivery occasionally shows up lines that need polish. Stellan Skaarsgard, however, is great, his own performance saving the script at times. Yes, it is contrived, yes, it is pretentious and the film is below the standards of von Trier's best work such as Dogville, Dancer in the Dark or The Idiots, but for me, this is nearer to those films than Melancholia or Antichrist. Don't let the morons writing these reviews put you off. Give it a go and watch with an open mind. Lets just not talk about Shia Leboeuf.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
105,kleiner_fuchs,Forget about pleasure,7,21 February 2014,"Note: this review is about the 4-hour-cut (two parts with 2 hours each) of NYMPHOMANIAC, that is shown in German cinemas.""Forget about pleasure"" – that could have been the tag line of NYMPHOMANIAC instead of ""Forget about love"", as we are never allowed to see, or feel, real pleasure on the actor's faces while they are having (simulated) sex; ironically, the only scene where something like pleasure can be felt is a shot of two little girls playing in the bathroom early on in the picture. Could this be called a ""failure"" on the part of the director or the actors considering that this is supposed to be the story of a sex addict on a never-ending quest for ecstasy? Or did Von Trier want it to be that way?Regardless of this ""failure"", NYMPHOMANIAC is not a bad film, on the contrary: It is often very funny, often very beautiful, sometimes moving, sometimes provocative, and always entertaining, but it is also an uneven film. Take, for example, the opening sequence: Great production design and delicate sound design work together to create a mesmerizing atmosphere for several minutes, then suddenly a deafening Rammstein song starts playing. Is this a stroke of genius or is it simply the worst possible choice of music in this place, brutally destroying the carefully built atmosphere?There are more strange directorial choices: Throughout the film we get ugly, pointless inserts (nature shots, animals, choir boys etc.) that are derived from low-quality, low-resolution video material. Then there are some lines that seem to have no connection to the characters and are only there because Von Trier wanted to say something important, and instead of saying it in an interview, he decided to put it in his film. This is always a bad choice; when Joe and Seligman are discussing topics like political correctness and pedophilia, I hear Von Trier talking, where it should be the characters I hear talking.The whole film, despite its length, to me felt like a puzzle with too many parts missing: so many things left unexplained (for example, how exactly did Joe find that ""K"" character?), so many scenes that I would have liked to see. The non-chronological structure of the film with its flashbacks, inserts and captions didn't help to tie the whole thing together either.The ending (the ""moral"" and the closing ""punch line"") I found to be extremely stupid and it left me sorely disappointed, it felt like a bad joke. I'll refrain from discussing it here, see it for yourself and decide for yourself.Von Triers previous films ANTICHRIST and MELANCHOLIA were masterpieces, securing him and his unique style of filmmaking a place in the pantheon. NYMPHOMANIAC is no such masterpiece. I will recommend it as it is very entertaining, but it is also quite shallow and it didn't tell me anything interesting about sexuality or society. The important matters that the film brings up would have deserved to be dealt with more seriously. And by that I don't mean to imply that the film should have been less funny; in the past there have been funny and charming sex comedies (for example, Sunday IN NEW YORK, 1963), that have dealt with sexuality and hypocrisy in a decidedly serious and thought-provoking way.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

I will say this about Nymphomaniac Vol.1 & Vol.2. If your stuck on which versions to buy or watch, go with the theatrical cut. It keeps the movies flowing and keeps you engaged in the story. By the end, they will leave you in awe. But, if your interest is in seeing all of her other subjects and the scenes involved, buy the uncut version. There are scenes and dialogue in this movie that (if you pay attention) make you think outside the box and maybe hurt your brain a bit. These movies are fantastic and kudos to the actors that saw the beauty and details in the script and played their roles to perfection. This movie is NOT one you put in while doing anything else.

108,Mtoomb,"Art Just Exists, You Don't Have to Accept It, but That Doesn't Make It Ugly or Worthless",8,29 April 2014,"Lars von Trier's new two-part shock-fest is nothing of the sort. Well, it's two parts, but it's not shocking if you've ever enjoyed a Chuck Palahniuk book. Charlotte Gainsburg and Stellan Skarsgard are brilliant, the supporting characters are adequate for what they are in regards to her story, and the film is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a little less Disney in their art. Who knew Sam Whitwickey could really act? Nymphomaniac is one of the most misunderstood films of the last decade, really. If you think this movie's disturbing, rent some of von Trier's earlier work... You'll never look at a 2x4 the same way again. Or Bjork for that matter.Everyone should probably watch this movie, if just to challenge their own ideas about sexuality and gender roles in a sensationalist society where the only opinion anyone has is ""that sucks dude, screw that."" Which isn't really an opinion, by the way, since an opinion requires thought and cognitive capabilities that is obviously lacking from 85% of internet users. Just saying something is stupid and writing it off is, in fact, the opposite of an opinion. It's a rejection. It's not even taking the time to really look at something.Simply, Nymphomaniac isn't well liked because it doesn't have Eva Green or Abbie Cornish in it, it's as simple as that. If Emma Stone or Olivia Wilde played Charlotte's role this would be the most anticipated film of the decade. People don't like the movie because of their preconceptions about sex, beauty, intimacy, etc... This movie throws all of that out the window. It's about sex, but completely lacking sexiness. It's about horrible deeds, but without the cathartic resolution. It's about a woman, but she's not your typical ""Hollywood babe,"" so therefore not attractive somehow.However, you can't deny that this film is art. In it's own way it's beautiful. It's hilarious. It's desperately sad... And yet these are the emotions WE feel because WE are watching it. The film itself isn't anything but a mirror held up in front of our beliefs and our preconceptions. Nymphomaniac isn't anything ground breaking. It all but squanders its chance to challenge and instead finds contentment in reflection.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
109,Ser_Stephen_Seaworth,"A four-hour saga of disconnect, loneliness, and blowjobs.",10,9 March 2014,"Denmark's notorious infant terrible, who used despair and unflinching self-mutilation as his canvas in his last few films, had already sparked a great deal of controversy and intrigue when the title of his next venture was announced. Nymphomaniac would deal with the bare-it-all, spare-no-details chronicle of a woman's sexual awakening, adventuring, and ultimate degradation. Lars von Trier, who some have accused of misogyny and making movies purely to shock, caught a good bit of flak for daring to make a movie that can be considered a woman's sexual autobiography, and most expected it to be a truly explicit film that could be considered little more than pornography. Most people underestimate Lars von Trier. While he does have his peculiarities, he is first and foremost an artist. And Nymphomaniac, his third outing with his muse Charlotte Gainsbourg, is perhaps his most expansive work to date. Split into two films and covering several decades, von Trier has concocted a Homeric tale of sound and fury and all sorts of sexual depravity. But this film is not designed to arouse, to titillate. Far from it; the sex is clinical, detached, almost boring at times. As I said, this is a woman's odyssey. This woman is Joe (Gainsbourg), who is discovered beaten within an inch of her life in a back alley by a lonely bachelor named Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard). Joe demands Seligman not call for assistance, instead accompanying the man back to his apartment for a cup of tea. And after she gets patched up, Joe finds Seligman a willing listener, a father confessor of sorts, and begins to spin a tale of promiscuity that would drive most men wild but intrigues Seligman in a much more philosophical manner. Joe's story starts from her discovery of her own sexuality at the age of two, and by the time she came to barely legal age (here played by Stacy Martin) and how she begins exploring her hypersensual nature. She abandons her virginity by bedding a motorhead (a curiously accented Shia LaBeouf), then even playing games of one-upmanship with her best friend and fellow sex addict (one scene features the girls competing to see who can bang the most guys on a train to win a bag of chocolates). As Gainsbourg's present-day Joe explains herself, Seligman picks out details and compares her sexual deviancy to the most obscure things, from fishing lures to baroque tritones. Von Trier is a very distinct writer, always seeming to verge on the arcane in his observations on the human condition, and here he gives an interesting perversion on, well, perversion. Is Seligman a truly insightful man when it comes to the human condition, or is he just the most hopelessly awkward fool imaginable? While Gainsbourg brings a great deal of gravitas to the role, it is her most subdued of the three films she's done with von Trier. And yet it is her most accessible, and she narrates the events of the film with such matter-of-fact certainty, her throaty voice describing the life she's led with all of the care and calm of a woman describing the weather. But in the first half of the saga's four-hour run time, it is Stacy Martin who does the heavy lifting, and she does it with remarkable skill, carefully balancing between naiveté and calculation. As Joe matures and sinks further into her addiction (a term she despises), more and more familiar faces start showing up. Her parents are briefly played by Christian Slater and Connie Nielsen, the former having an excellent ""money scene"" while the latter has maybe thirty seconds of screen time. Shia LaBeouf, who zigzags between admirable and awkward (sometimes in the course of the same scene), returns as Joe's first employer and ultimately her husband. And mention must be made of Uma Thurman's haughtily fiery scene-stealer of a performance that blazes on-screen as a jilted wife whose husband has abandoned her for what he expected to be a life with Joe. She follows her husband to Joe's apartment with their three tykes in tow, and in the span of seven minutes she frays and has a complete emotional meltdown. As the first half of the film segues in to the second, Gainsbourg takes the fore, as Joe stops seeking sexual release for joy and instead out of a desperate need to feel something. As the film goes on, she explores different fetishes and outlets, including but not limited to interracial threesomes, bondage, humiliation of all sorts. In one notable case, Gainsbourg's character submits herself to the whims of a young man who specializes in intense BDSM. The fact that this rather devious fellow is played by Jamie Bell is a bit of a shock to anyone who's seen Billy Elliot recently. But if anyone was stimulated by the first act of Joe's saga, the second act dashes it away with cold realism. As with all of von Trier's films, the ending is unforgettable. I confess that when I sensed the film drawing to a close, I was pleasantly surprised at how von Trier handled it, and that perhaps the Danish prince of melancholia had decided to serve up a happy ending for once. Of course, I forgot this is Lars von Trier we're talking about, and the final minute of the film may send audience members in a tizzy. It's part of the reason why I've taken so long to write my thoughts on it. But as I write this, I do think Nymphomaniac is a terrific entry in his canon, and a worthy closer to his trilogy.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
110,loumiles-25568,was depressed for weeks after - this movie is epic,9,19 February 2016,"i watched the theatrical version with both movies together, i am a huge lars von trier fan, have seen antichrist and his other harder films, i have read that this is the last film in his depression trilogy which is antichrist melancholia nyphomaniac. this film was so powerful, i found the experience menacing. the meanings i have got from the films is that we are all inherently evil. but in these films (it really is women are all inherently evil). nyphomaniac is so massive in scope it blows the other films away. the film is repellent. but still a genuine work of art. i hated it and loved it at the same time. for a man to make a film about female sexuality is a bold thing to do, lars nearly always has the lead as a female, but with this subject matter the man has got guts that's for sure, i saw the film with a female friend, she had a similar experience to me. i have not said this about any other film, and i loved antichrist, this film was hurting me, yet i could not stop watching. anyone who says its a black comedy or has comedic elements don't listen, this is his most serious film to date, unlike antichrist where the evil is quite obvious, in this movie the evil is insidious, it creeps around and gets right under your skin. i feel he has triumphed in his trilogy, and has committed a very dark entity to celluloid. not for the faint hearted. and please do not watch this movie, before you have seen some of his other work. as you need to build up to this one.

111,hugorocksmy,Excellent Movie,10,8 March 2014,"Excellent movie, that never felt boring or silly. But instead very entertaining and with an excellent pace. It was better than I expected, and instead of being shocking, it felt more of a character study being told in a very artistic and delicate way. It had excellent performances from Stacy Martin, as a young Joe, but also it featured a great small role from Uma Thurman, who simply killed it with her performance. Also Charlotte Gainsbourg was very good, but her on screen time wasn't as much as I thought it would be. Once again, the direction and cinematography from Lars von Trier were outstanding and just made it flow beautifully. As well as the script that was very clever and just an excellent original story that was played in a very ordinary way without feeling to exploitive or unnecessary. It is another example of how some films can be great examples of what art is, and how a storytelling should be. It was just a great story and another great movie from Lars von Trier.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
112,aklcraigc,Surprisingly Middling,7,5 December 2014,"Despite Lars von Trier's reputation, his films are very much hit and miss, and this movie feels like it lands somewhere in between. One gets the feeling that Lars just can't let himself make a movie which tells a story (say, Melancholia) and that he feels he has to provoke to stay relevant. All that being said, the movie is far less provocative than the advertising would have you believe, there is no more nudity than your average Fassbinder movie. The story is told as a series of flashbacks which are laced with humorous digressions, and each episode is engagingly filmed, with large dollops of Tarkovsky. At a couple of points you can just hear Lars saying 'now, I'm going to mess with your head', I just wish he wouldn't make it so obvious. Stacy Martin does a good job of bringing some amount of ambiguity to a rather one dimensional character, Uma Thurman chews the scenery for a while, but I really don't understand the acting plaudits being dished out by other reviewers regarding this part. Episode 1 meanders on in the above fashion, leaving a pleasant, but short-lived aftertaste. Episode 2 goes completely off the rails plot-wise in the end in an attempt to give the story some type of conclusion. Overall, I'm left with the impression of flashes of brilliance but no overall emotional impact. That being said, I'm still glad Lars is taking risks, his movies are still events which are worth partaking in. I just hope next time he can shed the 'L'enfant terrible' yoke which shackles this movie.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
113,kriddirk,A documentary about a risky subject and made by Von Trier,7,31 December 2013,"Lets be clear, I am not especially a fan of Von Trier's work, either I am an artistic cinephile. But lately I am looking a bit further then the mainstream movies, which can be as well very good. That's why I was interested in seeing Nymphomaniac, in the same way that I saw Shame with Fassbender. These movies are not comparable due to the different objective, but treat the same problem experienced by a man or a woman. It is difficult to review the first part of a movie, which exists of 2 parts making 4 hours together. Even then, it is the censored version, NOT due to the sex scenes, but rather for the length of 5:30 hours, which is not THAT standard in theaters. I am sure I will go for the second part and I am as well sure that it will of the same level or better. Therefor the rate of 8/10. It is for sure not porno, even not erotic. Not be mistaken in that. There is no excitement possible. All sex scenes are more or less mechanical, short duration and treated as if it was a documentary. In fact, the movie is like a documentary, where a father type figure Seligman ( Skarsgard ) is the interviewer of the nymphomaniac Joe ( Gainsbourg ) in a way that she can tell her history from when she was 8 years old and onwards. The discussions between Joe and Seligman are metaphors between her sexual behavior and for example fly-fishing, music, etc  and they are sometimes quiet comic. So a laugh is possible. But don't be mistaken, this is a drama. We see how Joe's sexual life conditions her from child onwards, as well as all involved ""partners"". She is someone who does not feel anything and will do everything to satisfy herself independent of the pain that she will cause around her. A good example is the Miss H chapter, where an astonishing Thurman enters the screen. The situation caused could be like a Veaudeville one, but here it develops as a dramatic absurd situation. Different moods are created, sometimes you feel pity for Joe, then unbelief like with the train adventure, very dramatical situations like Miss H or the with her father causes sadness and anger, even a tip of the love issue  a different movie to see. If I have to mention a negative topic, then it is the cold atmosphere in the movie with only the Seligman metaphors and the sex life of Joe, not more. But don't misunderstand this, it is quiet a lot to handle. And even more, if you have 15 partners a day I suppose there is not that much time for other things to do then having a walk in the park like she does. Stacy Martin is the star of this part, as well as the discussions by Starsgard. Finally, I am certainly going for the second part of this movie. It is a very tricky subject to bring it on the big screen and Von Trier has had the guts to do it. The result is fine, a drama, a documentary about an illness ( as far it is an illness and when it is considered as one ), not a porno or sex movie like we understand it, showing us how it conditions a complete life and sometimes with a comic hint. Of course there is nudity and sex scenes in the movie, a warning for those who have problems with that ...",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
114,CEBaum,True and raw - a challenge to viewers,8,12 March 2014,"Although this is not LvT's best by far, it is yet again a vast showcase of what he does best. In fact, von Trier is one of Scandinavia's top porn directors, and early in his career, would fund his movies with TV and porn work. To this end, he has combined this experience with his best skill - provoking those he dislikes.Here, anyone with a problem with sex, women or sexuality is going to have a problem with this movie because the main character has a problem with sex. She doesn't ""love sex"", and this movie is not, as the stupid reviews on here say, ""a porno"". In fact there are only three fleeting scenes of sex in the whole running time, and these reviews just prove the film remains unwatched by such cowards who fill their time complaining about things they know nothing about; namely, the intricate relationships between those with true problems in their lives - people that live deep and far and broad. People such as the two characters who unveil the story - Seligman, the scholarly virgin and Joe, the satanic nymphomaniac. As usual with LvT this film is going to haunt me days after I watched it. That's the way LvT designs it. Have you the stamina to look inside yourself? One chapter is called The Mirror, and another, The Gun. The very symbols you may come across in spirit at the end of your journey with this film. A harrowing watch, with mind-blowing performances from all, especially Slater and Thurman.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
115,Foxbot,"Brilliant Filmmaking, but will it Meet Expectations",9,7 March 2014,"This part of Nymphomaniac focuses on the storytelling of young Joe, played by the amazing Stacy Martin, and her feelings and sexual escapades. Saying this movie has nudity would not even touch the surface of what is actually depicted. There is consistent sex involving multiple characters. It is not meant to arouse, yet show us what feelings and stimulation the characters where going through. Basically, in summery that is the 2-hour Volume 1 of Nymphomaniac. Of course there is intense depth and symbolism and it's meant to make us relate to one or more of the characters. It is a brilliantly well done film and a solid presentation as we would expect from Lars Von Trier. The acting is all top notch and I was surprised at the intensity of some of the actors we know which we may have expected less of a performance.In my opinion, Volume 1 was simply setting the stage for something much more intense forthcoming in Volume 2. Nymphomaniac pushes the boundaries of nudity in movies as well as the simple subject matter of Lars Von Trier films. Entertaining is not how I would describe his films. They are unsettling and over-all upsetting, depressing and make you squirm in your seat. However his films have meaning and symbolism unlike any other film I have seen. They are thought provoking and will stay with you. Under it's sexual surface, there is deep theories and talk of creation, mathematics, science and religion. Yet, not as deep as Antichrist, or maybe even Melancholia.Fans of Lars Von Trier should not hesitate to check this out, however newcomers should be warned this is unlike any other film. It is extremely graphic with high nudity and sexuality. I was a little let down as I did not enjoy it as much as Antichrist, however I felt it was more emotionally appealing that Melancholia.Recommended.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
116,sc-700-363458,Interesting film but not everyone cup of tea,9,26 April 2016,"First off I have given a high score as I don't think you can really rate a film like this; and many have given this a low score as they don't like the subject matter. It's a film about the extremes of sex, if you haven't an open mind on this subject then don't watch this film. There is a lot of graphic sex in this film, presumably to capture the authenticity of the material. But more disturbing is the subject matter, one of the themes being that men can act this way, but for women, society judges women who act in this way very differently. As a film it is slow, arty, and with considerable metaphors. Intellectual more than passionate. Nicely shot too it has to be said; along with considerable acting and direction. Personally, I find if you don't engage with the principal character, it is hard to really enjoy the film. Although it would be possible to claim that Siligman is the viewpoint character the viewer is meant to empathize with (which too a degree does work). Does the film challenge and make you think? Definitely, but it is not an easy experience, and certainly the film is overly drawn out. Also, one has to see volume two to get full understanding of the material.I liked that the film did not pull any punches and explored adult themes deeply, if not shockingly at times. However I would only recommend this for individuals that have a broad understanding of sexuality, prepared to be subjected to some pretty X rated scenes, and are fans of very arty, intellectual theater. As I said at the beginning, his is not the sort of film you can judge, you have to see it and make up your own mind.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
117,rapidcereb,A Limit Pushing Film (Part I and II Review),8,3 October 2014,"Having been a fan of Lars Von Trier for quite some time, I thought that he had fallen off into the deep end when I saw the poster ads and tagline for this movie. Despite the posters for this movie, it is not one big orgy featuring any stars crazy enough to sign up, as one might of thought.This movie delves into the deep recesses of the human psyche, and features plenty of existential substance throughout, making one ponder the human condition. Of course throughout the entire movie, safe guards are in place in the form of graphic sexuality to separate the children from the adults, then there is ample chit chat to bore the people expecting a porn flick. Those left watching, will be ones who are familiar with all of Triers previous work, and who like very mature, heavy and thought provoking movies.The editing was done in an almost amateur way at a few small parts, more than likely on purpose to give the movie a voyeuristic feeling at times. I could hardly believe the opening song of Part one, which was a heavy rift from Rammstein, a strange choice to be sure, but with thought I suppose it was to fire up some energy for the heavy, 'low key' ride that was to ensue. The majority of the movie is narration of a story, and while some consider it to be boring, aside from maybe a scene and half in part one, I felt the movie moved at a great pace and I did not find myself getting bored or my attention wandering throughout the four hours split between two movies.This movie focuses on several negative aspects, and is reminiscent of Gasper Noels ""Enter the Void"". This being said I felt myself being reminded of the movie ""Salo"" at times, though this movie has a lot more humanity and substance than that.I was quite intrigued in the second part to find a link to one of Triers prior movies, in turn making this movie a possible prequel of sorts. In the end, it appears Von Trier is carrying out some master plan legacy of film. No doubt he is leaps and bounds ahead of his old days with ""The Kingdom"" and ""Dancer in the Dark,"" though ""Dogville"" still remains a personal favourite of mine.A recommended watch to be sure, but clearly not a movie made for the masses. Instead Lars Von Trier has done what he does best, that is, whatever he so chooses to do, despite what anyone else has to say or think. And He is a master in the realm of film because of it.8/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
118,ioannites,An interesting but failed movie,4,9 January 2014,"What are the limits between the art and the provocation? How could we lean on the latter to create a new expression which would correspond to the expectations of the contemporary man? The eroticism could maybe forge a new language which would be included well by the general public? Indeed, the movie Nymphomaniac by Lars Von Trier could well give answers to these questions, but a large number of weaknesses could correspond neither to the expectations of the spectators nor to the critics who would like to discover a new movie of back markers. Leaning on these thoughts we shall try to show the positive points and the weaknesses of this movie.By beginning with the title, its etymological composition seems to us very interesting. Indeed the word ""Maniakos"" in Greek indicates a being mentally sick and persisted on some obsessions. However this individual is not necessarily stupid. As for the word nymphomaniac, everybody knows it well. The appearance of this word removes any vulgar idea and reminds us the style of this movie. Besides, the Greek etymology of this title sends back to a learned idea. Joe, contrary to what she claims, she is not a nymphomaniac. Indeed, she is for the quest of something indistinct and she never feels a great pleasure. Besides, she never regrets her acts in her past. Seligman, look like the narrators of the novels of Zola. Indeed, he knows fewer elements than the spectator and it is the neutral observer who does not judge. We could believe that it is the link between the spectator And the character. The expository scene introduces us into the atmosphere of this movie and suggests us well its contents and the moral poverty of his protagonist. These positive elements seem to us interesting and are a part of movie, but they cannot present its real value or its real weight. As we said, Joe reflects well the provocation and she does not communicate with the spectator. Indeed, it is about a wall which separates us with her and that's what reminds us that it is about an individual without feelings and empty of any idea. This provocation is strengthened by its egoism which reaches the limits of a disease, as well as by its eccentric attitude which presents nothing interesting. However we wish that the second volume of this movie gives an answer to all these questions which we put indirectly.These weaknesses, lead to forget us its qualities and several times we believe that its limits with a pornographic movie are not always clear. It is about vulgar and shocking scenes which become more obvious when we notice that the protagonist is a clumsy and naive individual.The nymphomaniac movie, in spite of its positive elements, presents a large number of weaknesses which do not allow it to draw the attention of a warned public. Besides, even the wide public cannot appreciate this movie. However we hope that the second volume could well rectify this clumsiness. Besides we regret the intervention of the censorship in France which adds nothing positive to a work of art.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
119,shagrog,"If I'm the only one who kinda liked this movie, my opinion may matter",7,9 April 2014,"I see that many people criticize this movie and label it as pornographic and plain boring, so I thought I'd share my two cents.First of all, it's not a comedy nor an action movie. It's not fast-paced and doesn't have lots of explosions and cool CGI. I guess that doesn't fit the profile of a good movie for the majority of the population.Now let's talk about what it is. It's a drama. The previously described movies are so much easier to watch whether they're good or bad. Drama doesn't work like that. Good drama makes you think and feel. Bad drama is a pain.So, the problem we're reduced to is whether this is good or bad drama. For me, i.e., in my opinion, a good drama must be intelligent. It's not a matter of pace, twists or suspense, otherwise it would be another genre (thriller, western, police, crime, etc). An intelligent drama is written/designed to control our feelings and shape our thoughts. Of course, much like everything else, it depends a lot on the receiving end. Some people don't like chocolate. Does that make chocolate bad? No, it makes it bad for those people. It's still great for those who appreciate it. The quality of a drama depends on how much you're willing to let it change you. If you just hold on to your preconceived notions, then it's not going to work.So, what makes this an intelligent drama? Well, the story starts with a curious situation that brings together two characters from very different worlds: One whose life revolves around sex and one who completely ignores it. The first one tells the story of her life and we get to see it from the perspectives of both characters. Why is this important? Because it makes you think in different ways, which is something our society lacks. People are so driven by their own views and opinions that can't put themselves on each other's shoes. On top of that, they divide the world into two. There's only right or wrong, heroes or abominations and it's not that simple.The pace of this film is very slow, but that's needed. You need the time to think. Whenever one of the so labeled ""pornographic"" scenes comes up, you can think about the implications. ""Is it that wrong what she's doing? Why does she do it?"". Whoever sais ""Who cares? It's just a movie. That's sex. It's porn."" is simply lazy. The end will seem really disappointing until you really think about it. You mind find it great if you just turn from your fixed point of view. Besides, I think being slow and dull is exactly what this movie is supposed to be. Life is slow. Her life was slow and she had trouble feeling. She did something about it. She searched for a way to feel and found it in sex.Now, I'll grant you that the story isn't that compelling and not many people can relate. But it's not complete garbage. It was a nice ride (pun intended). It teaches a lot if you're willing to listen. If you're looking for excitement too, this is not where you'll find it.To sum it up, this is a smarter movie than people give credit for, but you need to open your mind.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
120,worldbarrow,Not Altogether Provocative,5,3 September 2014,"We live in an era when sexual taboos have begun to disappear entirely. If this film was made ten or twenty years ago, Von Trier might have been easily accused of doing something provocative for no other purpose. Today, the limitations on exposure seem like an obstacle, and the 'graphic' depictions of sexuality intermittently permits a greater sense of depth. Nevertheless, this is a film about sex, and Von Trier is a little behind the times in the effort to free his impulses. Compared to something like Gotz Spielman's Antares or Revanche, this is boring and one-dimensional filmmaking, a collage of sexual episodes structured by an awkward voice-over. The narration is fine, but the scenes of conversation between Gainsborough and Skarsgard feature the actors reciting lines that seem unnatural for normal speech. I felt like I was watching scenes from 'Mindwalk' interspersed with bad porn. This is a better film than Antichrist, but as a matter of necessity, Melancholia does more for the viewer. Von Trier has a gift for visuals but fails as a writer and storyteller. Sit through two volumes and four hours of this, well, you must have seen it all before.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
121,glados,Volume I + II,8,26 April 2014,"This is a 5 hour long epic that takes its sweet time to narrate the story. It is slow-paced, shocking, very sexual, occasionally a little funny, twisted, poetic, philosophical, disgusting, disturbing, sad, and at the same time, quite intriguing and mind provoking (for those with minds open enough for what happens next).Volume I is easier to digest. It portrays the different chapters in life and evolution of the nymphomaniac as she needs to have sex with hundreds, if not thousands, of men. While devastating on her pursuit, the scenes like on the train where two teenage whores compete who can get more guys between train stops, or the one when a married man leaves his family to be with her just to have his wife and kids come to her apartment, are quite amusing! Volume II explores the extremities of depth of how dark human nature can get. Not able to orgasm anymore, she does everything to regain it, such as giving up her family over engaging in sado-masochistic sessions, followed by ""Sex Addicts Anonymous"" (ha!), etc. It is very bleak, depressing, and shocking, but keeps you on the edge of your couch.

This is not a movie suitable for someone who is not ready to open his mind for innovative, creative work, or for lovers of ""movies that make the night pass faster"".Art is written all over Nymphomaniac. There is so much symbolic, exquisite parallels between sexuality and nature, neat storyline and scenes and conversations that make you want to stop and think for a while. It has a book-like vibe in it. Apart from this, for me, the first part was very easy and nice to watch, and the second part was brutal and a bit painful, but i can only see that as a good thing since it made me feel, like all my favorite moviesThe acting is pretty decent too.

123,da_zapata,An Artistic Tale of Sexual Perversion and Despair,10,10 November 2014,"Lars von Trier fans, rejoice. The art house icon has returned for the final installment of his darkly woeful Depression Trilogy with Nymphomaniac—an intense, psychosexual experience spanning the length of four hours. The Depression Trilogy may be a misleading way of introducing the film, considering it is in no way a sequel or related to any of his previous films. Von Trier's trilogies are defined by their tone and mood, and as the name suggests, The Depression Trilogy depicts themes such as overwhelming sadness, despair, and hopelessness. It is composed of three films—Antichrist, Melancholia, and Nymphomaniac. As aforementioned, the three films are unrelated in plot, despite the spectacular Charlotte Gainsbourg starring in all three films with an unrelenting sense of dread.Individuals unfamiliar with von Trier's previous work should know his films are not for the faint of heart. They are immersed with agonizing violence, unfiltered sexuality, and excessive vulgarity. However, his uncompromising style is precisely what has made him both a controversial yet distinctive success as a director in the art house community. Nymphomaniac, without a doubt, stands apart as the most powerful and gravely dismal film of the trilogy, and I say that with the highest sense of regard. Not a single moment is wasted in Nymphomaniac's four-hour run, divided into two films: Volume I and Volume II. While both volumes share the same bleak ambiance, there are significant increases in intensity and, as expected, distress and sorrow. On that note, let's start from the top.Volume I: Nymphomaniac greets us with a full minute of darkness, accompanied only by the sound of light rain pattering on steel rooftops before the film begins in complete silence. We are then led down a dark alley where we meet the protagonist of our film lying unconscious on the snow-covered cement, bruised and bloodied. She is soon discovered by Seligman, a kind man who takes her into his home to care for her after she expresses apprehension in being admitted to a hospital. Seligman soon inquires about her injuries and we begin to learn more about our protagonist, Joe, and her deep sense of self-loathing and cynicism about life. Joe, however, finds it difficult to put her story into words, due to its length and density. Therefore, she uses physical objects and metaphysical concepts evident in Seligman's apartment to outline her tale. The heavy use of symbolism in the film becomes evident as Joe's appalling story of sexual addiction is told through allegorical comparisons to fishhooks, mathematical concepts such as the Fibonacci sequence, the geometrical symmetry of certain shots, and somber black-and-white sequences.Joe is vulgar and unrelenting in her retellings, outlining the discovery of her sexuality and its crudely unique development. A large part of the film is told in flashbacks, with Joe's voice-over guiding us through her previous perversions. The escalation of Joe's sex addiction becomes evident as the film goes on, from competitions entailing who can sleep with the most men to creating sex schedules to have as many sexual experiences as possible in one day. We see her lose control as she destroys the lives of others, and ultimately, her own. Despite the frequency of sex she is having, a dark cloud of loneliness always looms over Joe. She is constantly dissatisfied, unhappy, and desperate for a sense of unattainable joy. This tone is set with precision as we reach the end of Vol. I and proceed to Vol. II.(for more of my film rants, follow me on twitter @calcium_waste)",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

What I cant wrap my head around is that dialog spoken softly doesn't mean that they are deep and logical. And the pathetic analogies. Most of the characters don't have depth. The main character is just going on about nothing. Uma Thurman's bit is over the top embarrassing. It is a really bad excuse for a art. Blue is the warmest color also got hyped because of the sex scenes( I know there is no comparison but for argument sake) the characters had depth, story was intelligent, direction was good and best for all the acting was amazing. This movie on the other hand fails on all of the above. Problem these days is that if some critics praise a painting made of s**t, create a hype people will want it. I am one of those people that's why I bothered with this piece of crap. Nothing real or creative about the movie, bunch of big names trying to sell crap.

125,xmichaelraine,"Lars von Triers, with a Dash of Soul.",7,21 March 2014,"There really is nobody making films quite like Lars von Trier. And it's astounding to read about the level of accolades and the amount of respect he receives from his peers in the business. Especially when you consider the subject matter of his films. Quentin Tarantino said that Lars' ""Dogville"" is amongst the best manuscripts ever written. Paul Thomas Anderson said he ""would carry von Triers baggage anywhere."" He has directed three best actress winners at Canne Film Festival (Bjork, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kirsten Dunst). The only prediction you can make with his films, is that they will be completely unpredictable. And there is no exception with this film. It is raunchy, rowdy, darkly humorous, somewhat ridiculous, but to my surprise...it has a heart at the center of it.The dialogue sets between Gainsbourg and Skarsgard are just fantastic. Skarsgard in particular here, is at his very best that I've seen him. His 'Seligman' brings a level of trust, and a sense of belonging to 'Joe' that we can tell she has not experienced since she was a child. 'Joe' has the idea in her mind that she is a bad human being, and she cannot be understood by anyone, and nobody will ever want to understand her. 'Seligman' relieves this somewhat, by constantly reassuring 'Joe', there is an explanation for her psyche, and that she is likely one of many with the same issues.The film is in no way perfect. It has an amount of graphic sexuality that may be necessary for the narrative at times, but also a dubious amount that feels is more or less there to shock you. And sometimes I found myself saying ""Oh come on now! Stop it"". The film can likely be easily dismissed by many due to this, but you must try to dig deep for this film. It is challenging, but it's a piece of filmmaking unlike anything else, which is what you will always get from Lars von Triers. For better or worse, he will always bring you something you've yet to experience, unless he begins to repeat himself.Overall I did enjoy the film. I expected to be much more shocked than I ultimately was, but that's not a negative. It's just the expectation, due to Lars' more recent films. Like I said before, you cannot predict a Lars von Trier film. And yes at times it's graphic, most absurd, and quite possibly self-indulgent; Yet it's something new. It forces you to ingest massive amounts of taboo, and look at sexuality with a very open perspective. I feel it addresses quite well the standards society sets on females in regards to sexuality, versus the less strict standards placed on men. We're watching the liberation of one's uncontainable lust. At the same time their struggle to find some peace of mind. To not feel that they are an outcast. As quoted by 'Joe' in the film: ""Perhaps the only difference between me and other people is that I've always demanded more from the sunset. More spectacular colors when the sun hit the horizon. That's perhaps my only sin.""The film is brave, but it's a difficult viewing. Ultimately it is a piece of art. The content is left to be interpreted by each viewer individually. It does have a smart, witty screenplay. The cinematography is excellent; and the editing is fairly smooth. It's not necessarily a film I'd say is ideal for theater viewing, but recommended to be seen by every person that considers his or herself to be a true cinema fan. Be sure to leave your morals at the door.614moviebuff.blogspot.com",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
126,cerca-sonia,A true piece of art,9,10 April 2015,"Many people have defined the film truly repulsive, a waste of time, and nothing more than a porno, due to its high level of pornographic contents. That said, I don't see why films such as Blue Is the Warmest Colour, Don Jon and Shame had a different impact on public opinion.Nymphomaniac: Vol. I is a brave, provoking and philosophical piece of art. Lars von Trier strips sex of its romance and overloads it with nothing but lust.The highlight of the film, brilliantly written by Lars von Trier, is the very intense and philosophical dialogue between adult Joe, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Seligman, played by Stellan Skarsgård.The wonderful and unusual story is told with a superb photography, some provocative scenes, and other meaningful scenes, all accompanied by a music at irregular intervals, ranging from Bach's Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ"", to Rammstein's Führe mich"".Charlotte Gainsbourg gives a shameless and extremely cold performance as Joe. Making her debut as young Joe, Stacy Martin is fantastic.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
127,ohthatgigi,brisk and cold adventure,9,3 April 2014,"The first part of nymphomaniac is my personal preference compared to a more intense and excoriating second half, it chronologically and objectively depicts the young Joe's sexual adventure and all the important trivial element of life stemming from sex in the world. The first thought after watching in my mind is ""wow this woman lives in heaven"",not because of her excessive intake of lustful pleasure of course, but because of her utmost freedom and domination in her life. In the perspective, though I don't want my gender discrimination law interest makes me to become a bore of it, but I have to say it's a real brisk movie depicting just another troubled human being in a seemingly iconoclastic and overly provocative way while not preaching a higher cause to the audience.I'm fascinated by the way the story unfolds, a conversation between the nymphomaniac Joe and the encyclopedic erudite played by Stellen. Every monotonous thing in an asexual bibliophile's room seems to be connected with the exotic and erotic story of Joe's. To someone it may seem stretched or much ado about nothing, but I used to play this game with my friend trying to prove the philosophy that the everything in the universe is intertwined and connected in an unfathomable way, one must keep in practice to see the bonds. So I guess that's why I think its perfectly clever to use this approach to coldly unravel Joe's story, in this way we can see Joe's life from Joe's own description with an unsettling objective heart, we see her childhood and family, which is perfectly normal to me thus constitutes another brilliant move---its shatters our value-laden assumption of the film that people who suffer from grave psychological illness must have some traumatic childhood memories, or major life crisis, because we think the illness itself is an abnormality, we simply don't believe that people's problems can be independently developed, we have to attach some reasons to explain those phenomenon. And then her rather hilarious and reckless girlhood, the process of her becoming an official nymphomaniac and leading an orderly life with normal day job and compact schedule of different sex encounters. We see she managed to organize a harmonious symphony with three kind of sex, the telepathy man, a panther-authority man who's in charge and the man she loved. Her love of life, the only repetitive sex she probably had ever had with,played by Shia Lebeouf, showed up in her life in different life phases, happened by an almost destined romantic coincidence, and ended in an unfinished and excruciating way, just when we are expecting the secret ingredient of sex to escalate the whole story to a new level, it breaks our old schooled expectations rather ruthlessly. Iwould be lying then if I say I didn't feel flabbergasted when see shia lebeouf, the transformer dorky college boy's transcendental performances. He maturely presented us a man in love and get tortured by it, a man that you would see on the street in London everyday, well-dressed and deadly attractive if you'd rather spend time with him. Despite the role didn't have much time in Joe's life, he's undoubtedly the indispensable ingredient.Young Joe is delicately beautiful in the film. Skinny and innocently drifting among a galaxy of men and dealing with a hysterical mother(wonderfully played by Uma Thurman). This level of carelessness indicates her loneliness and estranged nature in her personality. The silent recalcitrance with a pretty face desensitized us and caught us offgaurd, I cant seem to find the object shes trying to rebel against, I'm not convinced by the answer ""love"" in the movie. Probably its just because of his insatiable sexual appetite that keeps her from intimate relationship, It's just her individual voluntary choice, I don't think we ought to locate an answer for her. IMO that's precisely the beauty of the film, it's a girl's choice, and she's not callous of departure and love, the grief they bring is the sacrifice she has to pay for her choice. I don't think its really the place to talk about feminism embodied in the movie, In my comprehension, it's one peculiar individual person in the phantoscope of life. I like the parody of all the excessive advertisement, its like ""blast"" it can't be a not pretentious and bourgeois provocation to certain critics, but I really did enjoy it no matter what. The cold and light tone of the first half of Nymphomania has made a joyous contrast to the second half.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
128,blagomeni,"If you decide to take the adventure, I wish you good luck and plenty of patience.",4,26 May 2014,"I have to be honest. I knew what I was getting into, and knowing that, the movie delivered, but in a very odd way. It is not a movie that one goes to see and comes out feeling good about themselves. On the contrary, this is an adventure that leaves you in a very peculiar state of mind. Before seeing both parts of this confession I read the reviews and listened to the firsthand accounts from my close friends who saw the film before me. I will write about these two movies in singular because they are a single piece of story telling and can not exist individually. The only reason for splitting the movie into two parts, in my opinion, is the fact that it would be highly challenging to sit through screening of the movie had it been kept whole. The movie is a detailed confession of a nymphomaniac, telling her story to an elderly man who helped her out of a situation where she was left beaten in a middle of an alley on a gloomy and rainy day. This is a dark story occasionally laced with humorous situations and dialogs that although funny, do not really make you feel amused and giddy. The story begins at the time the young girl starts discovering her sexuality and follows her down the path of increasingly deeper addiction that gradually deprives her of dignity, humanity, and joys of life. There are numerous explicit scenes that pile up to almost unbearable onslaught eventually loosing any storytelling worthiness, becoming self-gratifying and purely pornographic. The variety of tastes and the menu of sexual behavior presented is wide. There is something in this movie to secretly lust about for almost anyone. But there is not a single thread of pleasure that can be squeezed from the screen because the next scene would almost always spoil any pleasure derived from the previous. This means that those who expected to be amused in that way are better off going for real porn. The acting is good. The characters are strange, usually twisted, sad and pitiful. There are just a few of them I may say were likable. I will deliberately not reveal who those characters were because it may be used against me in real life, so I'll let each one of you decide for yourselves who you liked best if anyone at all. That is also why I will not name any single actor/actress or lust over their performances as I often do in my reviews. When it comes to recommending this movie, I am in two minds. In one hand, I think it may be interesting for people to see it, in the other hand, it may be too much for most. I leave it to you. I was left with a lingering feeling that I did get something from watching this movie, but even days later I am still struggling to define what that something is.

129,tiggersuk,hard work as well as hard core!,2,27 April 2015,"yawn, my goodness this film and the second part are both so dull and boring .... the only one good thing about this film is Charlotte Gainsbourgs voice, i could listen to her all day however boring her dialogue is, the rest sadly is just pretentious art house dragged out tedium with some hardcore smut thrown in... if you want porn just go find it online, if you want dreamy surreal art house go watch Krzysztof Kieslowski... this mishmash fails to be either and i'm sure if it had not been made by one of the media worshipped art house crowd 'luvvies' like Lars von Trier it would be panned even more... Nymphomaniac neither shocks nor arouses, it just bores... but then maybe Lars Von Trier was being all deep and meaningful and sardonic and playful all at the same time seeing as how he is such an incredibly talented 'genius' and all that by having the actors literally bore the pants off the audience... and boy did he succeed!2/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

First I wanted to see this only for the sex scenes after watching the whole movie. It was we have been through or witnessed that was happened with Joe. There were a lot subtle things I loved in this movie. As myself being prurient this movie is simething close to heart.

131,mommyplum,"A very, very sad tale of compulsion",3,23 May 2021,"Up front I have to say this review is going to encompass my feelings about Vol 1 and 2 of this film, since the story has to be seen as a whole narrative and as such, I don't want to write separate reviews under the individual listings. Also, there are a lot of cast members and several parts are played by several different actors at different ages, so I will only speak of characters and you'll have to refer to the cast list for further info. First off, I think people mistake this for being intended as an erotic drama because of the surface subject matter. It's not. It's some of the unsexiest cinema I've ever seen. This is a story of compulsion, of mental health breakdown so bad it ruins lives. The story opens with a middle aged, worn out woman named Joe being found beaten and covered in urine in an alley by a possibly Good Samaritan named Seligman. She doesn't want an ambulance or police. So, Seligman takes her to his nearby apartment to triage as best he can and offers her clean clothes, tea and a listening ear. She begins to recount a terrible tale of her life as a nymphomaniac sex addict (although she, suffering from these diseases, does not realize how truly terrible it's all been) sometimes out of linear order. Yes, the scenes that follow are incredibly explicit, but I can't see how any one found them titillating. Joe has a compulsion for near constant sexual stimulation and encounters and despite almost always reaching, ahem, satisfaction, she's never satisfied. She just as soon ends one as she needs another. There's no pleasure here, not really, she's like a hoarder or a person with crippling OCD or a compulsive gambler, and watching her go on and on is painful. It also leads her to do terrible, hurtful things to herself and others as her compulsion rages - including essentially raping a man on a train who didn't want an encounter with her and ruining other people's committed relationships. She loses friends, jobs, living arrangements. When she finally has a chance at a loving, physically passionate relationship with a man who even wants to remain monogamous to her while giving her the chance to be intimate with others because he says he respects her need for it (he sadly lacks insight into it being a destructive compulsion, not an amorous hobby she has that he wants to be open-minded about) she can't stop going further and further into her compulsive abyss. She seeks out not just supplementary sexual partners to her marriage as her husband encouraged, she seeks hundreds of hurtful connections, even one that leaves her physically permanently scarred. When her actions endanger their child, her husband finally tells her to stop, but she breaks with him violently instead and watches her child carted off to foster care, because so deep is her disease. It's heartbreaking. What follows is her further devolvement and finally, a life of crime because she can't hold any semblance of society and regular life while her compulsion now consumes nearly all aspects of her existence every moment of every day. Someone in another comment said this was a morality tale about a woman being punished for sexual freedom. That's so incorrect. Joe isn't free. She's not fulfilled or in joy over her encounters (which would be liberation), she's compelled and physically and emotionally scarred. She's in thrall to her addiction, and as often happens, doesn't even realize the scope of it. People mistake all the visuals in this as because people are having sex, it's sexy. Again, it's not. It's sad. Tragic. If the movie had been titled, Gambler, and it was a 2 part, four hour story of a person who compulsively gambled until they wound up beaten in a gutter, would you think it was meant as an exciting endorsement for living at the rouelette wheel 24/7 at a Vegas casino while losing all the relationships and opportunities in your life because the scenes were filmed with exciting lighting and a sexy soundtrack? No. However, I will say I think the confusion on what this is meant as might be fueled by the producers' PR campaign to make all the ads and media push look hot. It isn't. Start to finish, it's sad. And, in the end, Joe is tired, strung out, and yet we have no hope she'll stop until she's dead. I frankly cried through 2/3 of all this. That's why I gave it 3 stars - it's 4 hours of such dismal depressing subject matter, I would never recommend it to anyone and I never want to watch it again.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
132,andreeeei,Not so much porn as one might expect,9,11 June 2015,"I like movies that present a subtle analysis of a certain human issue and bring some valuable insight. I like Eyes Wide Shut, for example, because it analyses the phenomenon of temptation towards adultery. I like Steve McQueen's movie Shame because it analyses the subtle issue of intimacy versus sexuality. I like Twelve Angry Men, because it analyses the issue of Groupthink, and so on.I also like movies that present a well-engineered story. And this is why I am amazed why Nymphomaniac (I) is so much rejected, while Blue Is The Warmest Color is so well received. Nymphomaniac is accused for being too much of a porn movie. Well, I would say that Blue Is The Warmest Color is much more of a porn movie than Nymphomaniac.Nymphomaniac picks up a subject that when it is discussed, you cannot present it without using at least some shocking imagery. In my view, Nymphomaniac appeals to sex and nudity just enough that is needed in order to transmit a relevant idea or place an useful brick within the story construction. Instead, my view is that Blue Is The Warmest Color preys on porn scenes for profit. I would say that in our Western culture, prostitution, while being enjoyed by many in a way or another, it is still a subject that is expected to elicit disgust, while lesbianism is viewed more like an expression of human freedom. While watching the movie, one can strongly disagree with the degree of promiscuity and risk that Joe is getting into. However, her behavior is believable from the perspective of Hypersexuality. The movie does some justice in re-humanizing the nymphomaniac (and the viewer might extrapolate some of the re-humanization to the issue of prostitution).Nymphomaniac is also a salad in von Trier style, that reminded me of Passolini, Marquis De Sade, other scenes in Lars von Trier's movies and sex as a political tool. It also contains nice metaphors and black humor that are thought provoking, which Blue Is The Warmest Color does not.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
133,rondo898,The Work of a Genius !,1,28 March 2014,"You will, I sincerely hope, not be offended if I were to speculate that you were enticed into inquiring into this movie and, for that matter, even reading this very review, because of the movie's title, yes? And the title obviously reflects on the movie's content which is focused on the reproductive arts. And, I shall further speculate that were the movie instead titled, say, ""Existentialism"" or such, and the story concerned a group of nuns who begin to question their faith, you wouldn't be reading this at all, would you?Of course you know that von Trier is a celebrated director, but you didn't quite get around to seeing his masterpiece Dogville, did you? Nor, I suspect, have you seen his quirky 2007 cinema, The Boss of It All. In fact, the only reason you are even remotely interested in ""Nymphomaniac"" is that it depicts venery in an explicit manner. Confess! It's all true, isn't it?Wait! Keep reading! Don't go away! It's OK! I know you're not like that, because you have standards. You would never watch or read porn. That's so . . . so . . . so >degrading< and low-class. But since you're a mature adult, very open minded and not bound by the strictures of organized religion, you have no objection to serious cinema with erotic content, do you? I mean, as long as it's tastefully done?I'm here to assure you that ""Nymphomaniac"" is >not< pornography, because none of the actresses (or actors, mustn't be sexist here) have had any breast augmentation, nor do they wear cosmetics in the manner of slatternly women. For that matter, rest secure in the knowledge that absolutely nothing arousing occurs during any of the movie. No pleasure whatsoever, so it's safe. Your dog could watch it and not begin to look at you funny.That's why von Trier is, without question, an absolute genius. Sex is one of the few natural pleasures we enjoy here in this vale of tears, and just as the finest minds of industry have ruined the joys of victualry and turned the simple act of eating into a problem, the brilliance of of von Trier is that he has ruined sex. ""Joe,"" the protagonist of the movie, has sex frequently, but she doesn't enjoy it at all, and von Trier does his best to make certain that you don't either. If you think about it, that's not such an easy feat. Suppose that you were given a camera, a crew and a group of attractive actors who don't mind nudity and simulating sex acts and were told to make a movie depicting venery, it would be difficult for you to make something completely unpleasant to watch. But von Trier has accomplished something you could never do: in this movie, no one has any pleasure. ex is presented as something perverse and unpleasant. ""Joe"" only engages in it because she's emotionally disturbed, or because her domineering girlfriend made her do it, or because of some Freudian mumbo- jumbo, and she obviously dislikes each experience, starting with the first brief penetration that hurts her. >SPOILER ALERT!< Don't fall for the brief scenes near the end, of her actually enjoying her three lovers. Those are fantasies she tells in response to having Bach played for her. The music of J. S. Bach is the sublime representation of empyreal purity, and Bach fathered twenty children, so it's good, clean, church-sanctioned, procreative sex, not the naughty fun kind. (Ooo, look! He's bathing her! How lovely! How clean! How innocuous! What movie is this?) But as soon as the music stops, she announces, while in union, ""I feel nothing."" The hypothetical sex movie you would write and direct would be unlikely to have acting that is as bland, tedious and affectless as the acting in ""Nymphomaniac,"" but that's the way Lars von Trier wants it, because viewing good acting would be a pleasure to watch, and he wants to drain anything enjoyable out. I can imagine him shouting direction, ""No! No! Make it even more lifeless! More monotonous!"" An obvious exception to this is the salient performance by Uma Thurman, but in that scene, the fine actress is introduced for the sole purpose of making a deliberately unpleasant situation even more disturbing. It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, because von Trier wants to rub your nose in the message: sex ruins lives and makes people miserable. The scene is comedic, but only in the way slapstick is.Von Trier is not the first director to make a movie depicting sex as repulsive. The late Ken Russell also wrote and directed movies with that effect. Like this movie, Russell's movies were also promoted by ads and posters featuring an enticing shot of a woman in ecstasy, but that was just to lure you in. The movie itself taught you a lesson of rue. It is, after all, the glorious puritanical heritage of those of us of Northern European descent. We're not like those filthy people down there in the tropical climes, going at it like they was rabbits. Shame, shame, double shame on their gratification and pleasure! No wonder God punishes them!All the enthusiastic reviews here are written under the pretense that there is some profound message embedded in this movie (especially the bedpan scene). The profound message is that sex must be presented strictly in terms of social isolation and as a manifestation of emotional disturbance. ""Joe,"" represents all the repressed feelings of guilt and shame metastasizing deep within you.

135,Murder-Meatball,"Not bad, not good, barely provocative",5,4 February 2014,"I have never seen a Trier-movie before, but have heard a lot of good things about them in terms of creativity and provocation so I might be bias since I did have some special expectations walking in to the theater; this movie did however not live up to them at all.It was not bad, but given the subject, the working material and the director I did expect a provocative and brilliantly intelligent comment on society, the human condition, a diorama of a nymphomaniac or you know something interesting And all of that was there – from time to time. The hospital part was for example truly amazing and really touched me. The movie touches at several interesting topics and concepts which could have made it very strong.But as I said, the overall move was certainly not that great. It was long, and it felt longer; the nudity was once or twice used in an inspiring or thoughtful way, but most of it could have choreographically and in terms of significance been from an ordinary porno for all I know; but even that was presented in a rather dull way (If you, like me, see naked bodies as normal and not inherently very morally/emotionally loaded you will not raise an eyebrow). The story was a tad too random for my taste (with several weird doings from different characters) and the constant use of out of the blue connections that did not feel natural or relevant was (though humorous at times) distracting. Also, the movie was oozing with (in my opinion) pseudo-symbolism that in most cases was ridiculously in your face and added little to the overall creation. The themes and concepts that the movie touches were really interesting (such as gender roles, sexism, addiction, moralization about sexuality, emotions, detachment, and so on) but they were never truly explored or done so in a way that did not feel particularly new, world changing or strong for that matter.My final criticism is that the way human sexuality in presented we are all (nymphomaniac or not) apparently purely sexual meat heads that cannot control our sexual desires at all and will automatically f**k at any given chance whether we want to or not. I resent this notion: As a rule I believe in free will even when you are horny while making the choice.All in all it was an okay, but slightly dull and too long movie that did not broaden my horizon noticeably and did not make me question anything except what all the praise this movie has gotten from all those brilliant critiques refers to. It just felt like he really tried to make a smart and artistic movie with a bunch of sex in it and it all just fell very short. Then again, it might just be too brilliant for a meat head like me to understand.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
136,arranwills,"nymphomaniac, only she doesn't seem to enjoy sex",2,16 March 2014,"NYMPHOMANIC VOL I/VOL II by Michael HaywardNymphomaniac Vol I/Vol IIOK, I'll admit that I enjoy dark subject matter and many of the most disturbing films I've seen are foreign language but films from Denmark aren't usually among them. This film centres on Joe, a self-proclaimed nymphomaniac who is found laid in an alley barely conscious and nursed back to health by a kind man who listens to her tales of woe. Now, the film is graphic, it's a Lars Von Trier movie after all and with scenes that are intended to shock in ...much the same vein as Baise Moi or Irreversible for example, but this is a more mainstream movie with some big Hollywood names among the castlist to boot. I guess that made the fact that I could find no real depth to any of the characters nor feel anything towards their plight even more of a shame. The lead character is a nymphomaniac, only she doesn't seem to enjoy sex, there's not a shred of feeling behind any of the graphic scenes and little point to them either as they don't help the plot and the scenes themselves feels very clinical. The plot is weak, there's little point to it all and I was left wondering why I'd bothered. Not for me, I'd score it 2/10. 1 for each half. Actually the one stand-out performance for me was Uma Thurman as a cheated wife. She does 'on the verge of implosion' with aplomb.

137,briggsgarland,Enjoyable film but far from Von Trier's best,6,8 April 2014,"Lars Von Trier has never shied from provoking or offending an audience and this film certainly tries very hard to do just that. Nymphomaniac has been marketed as titillating, gimmicky art-house smut but there's actually a lot of great (and times even moving) moments in it. Certainly not one of Von Trier's best film but overall I enjoyed Vol.1 and not so much Vol.2The good: Stacy Martin as the young Charlotte Gainsbourg is fantastic. There are a number of scenes that are incredibly memorable. Not jaw- droppingly beautiful but the photography on the whole is quite nice.The bad: The setup of Charlotte Gainsbourg recounting the story of her life to total stranger Stellan Skarsgård is pretty far-fetched and seems wooden at times. The numerous references to math, music, literature, etc. are self-consciously pretentious enough to disrupt the flow of the film in an unpleasant and awkward way. The narrative in Vol.2 is running on fumes and the bulk of the story seems hurried and at times even downright silly. The ending struck me as little more than a joke (both in a good and bad way).Nymphomaniac lacks the care and cohesion found in Von Trier's best films. The fact there are some really great dramatic moments and some truly fascinating ideas makes the rest of the awkward mess that much more awkward. It could have been a pretty decent two hour film with some changes but at close to four hours (combining Vol.1 and 2) there's a lot of fat that needs to be trimmed.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
138,kevindpetty,Von Trier's answer to Malick's Tree of Life?,10,10 July 2014,"I am still dizzy from the 4-hour marathon of these two films, but I can say that von Trier takes on the meaning of life although from a very pornographic perspective. People who cannot handle graphic and often violent sex scenes should beware. However, those who have grown to respect von Trier's eclectic and singular vision, will see past the sex to the innumerable thoughtful layers of symbols and meanings.Two things have occupied my thoughts for the past day. First, throughout the film, I was constantly reminded of Malick's Tree of Life. In the opening scene, the camera silently meanders along brick walls just as the camera glides through Tree of Life. However, suddenly the camera happens upon a bloodied female figure and the silence is shattered by Rammstein's For Me (perfect, since nymphomania is selfish - for me) which seemed to me like a musical ""FU and your artiness, Malick!"" I may be wrong, but that is what I thought. I continued to see similarities throughout the film, like the proliferation of Tree imagery that represents the Father and later a lonely craggy tree atop a great rock represents the nymphomaniac self; These are just a couple of examples.I also wonder why von Trier named named characters with initials. Surely there must be a reason even if it was to make fun of people like me. Characters are designated by the letters A-H, K, L, P, S, and I assume that the letter J is taken by the central characters, Joe and Jerome (interesting that they share the same initial...and J also reminds me of another type of tree: Jesse's Tree). That leaves the intervening and unclaimed letters I, M, N, O, Q, R. I'm No Q(uee)R? I know, I know, but the letters must be significant.I'm not going to try to innumerate all of the themes and symbols because that is one of the things that makes viewing von Trier's later films so much fun to watch. But they abound! Best movies of 2013.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
139,kaymages,"A rather pretentious, boring, long and vaguely insightful film.",1,28 April 2014,"CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH VOLUME I AND II: I give a 1 to this film to balance if possible the high rating it got in this site. The film was rather pretentious and was at a certain degree a classic example of emptiness trying to present itself as ""high art"". The parallels of nymphomania with fishing in the first half of the film and with Christianity later where pointless and just to make impressions in my opinion, even insulting or blasphemous in some points i could say. Another thing i found strange was the extreme use of ""deep"" and ""wise"" references to mathematical, scientific and philosophical concepts. But it all seemed rather forced, messy, and meaningless. It also failed in my opinion to get deep in the human psyche and explore effectively or at least expose the spherical/ holistic nature of the phenomenon of nymphomania. It was quite single sided and narrow minded as i see it. As for the people that claim it was a deep psychological journey, sorry von Trier fans, but the impression this film gave me is that he is a person with poor and shallow insight on the human being not to say prejudiced. In the end i didn't feel being left with some serious food for thought, intriguing questions or spiritually benefited and more self-aware or with self doubt and criticism. I also had the impression that the film was quite naive in some psychological aspects and delivered a rather childish, unrealistic or idealistic view of the human psyche and reality (yes despite all the cruelty and misery depicted it still gave me that impression). Especially at the depiction of the first years of her life and her maturity to adulthood. The showing of nudity as some said and the sex scenes, where not that extreme and had a reason to be there in some moments, but in others i agree that they where there just for the shake of being, no help to the plot or anything. The exploration of the human perversions and fetishes was rather forced too, like the bdsm chapter, gave me the impression that it was there so that the director could state ""look! we have put bdsm too in it"" and didn't necessarily deliver the desperate odyssey and degeneration of a tortured soul in a realistically climaxing way. It is also important to mention that this was a humourless movie whatsoever. Every attempt of ""humour"" was rather too dark, trolling, unintelligent, immature or just provoking. Even the born to be wild song in the train scene. Or the casting of Shia Labeouf, if this had a humorous intention in the first place of course. So no mature and original humour. The acting was a bit sloppy too i think, i especially didn't like much the acting of the old Joe (who is the protagonist for god's shake)at a major part of the film but wasn't impressed by young Joe's either. Another weak point was the excessive use of tiring narration, exposition, a sign of weak writing that cannot deliver it's messages subtly and with ease but rather immoderately throws them at the viewer's face. One of the few things i liked in the film was how we got little secret messages and warnings from the beginning about the final scene, where the old man would try to take advantage of her. Honestly i expected that from the beginning. Some will say that it was another drawback of the film cause it was predictable, linear, unintelligent etc bit i think it was delivered in a nice and well thought way. One of the few well thought things of the film. The answers he gave to her shocking stories, how he always tried to justify her actions but came a bit needy, his body language and acting, even some verbal slip-ups. All came to draw the picture of a perverted, repressed old geezer that was ready to explode any moment now. Even he stated he read everything literature has to give on sex, showing his obsession but impotence to make his urges real. If it was just an asexual philosopher he would have read some things just to have an opinion on love but wouldn't have obsessively and explicitly exhaust all the relevant literature. I liked the depiction of the oppressed man, it was more effective than the nymphomaniac's unfortunately. I liked the antithesis of the two main protagonists. The insatiable one that fully gave in in her passion and the ""ascetic monk type"" that fully repressed it for a life. The one ended up repenting and the other dying for letting his passion feed inside him for all these years. They weren't so different in that sense that's why they came to all these distorted conclusions about love and life, each one by his perspective. Even that ""catchy"" phrase on love was talking about sinful destructive passion of egoism than love, but they never lived true love so they couldn't have a valid opinion on it. There where also practical mistakes in the film like plot holes, logical inconsistencies, unnatural time loops etc. but i don't want to waste time on these, let other commenters exploit these. For example she went to medical school and did a gyno exam in the beginning? how? was she on her medical specialty? no. she was just a sophomore where they just open corpses and such, they don't do gyno exams. (except if things are different in england and i'm mistaken). The p girl chapter near the end i found it rather bizarre, unrealistic, not making much sense and just being there to make more shocking impressions or hopelessly try to save something that seemed doomed already. So in conclusion four hours are far too much for a film that has no much to offer you (i include volume 2 too). But if you are so curious arm yourselves with patience and watch it.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Von Trier does an spectacular 'montage' by telling a biography along with symbolism, religion, music, philosophers and other history milestones on which many are just fantasy meant that way.

Her story is not an easy one to get hold of, but it's more than worth understanding what makes her tick, and Von Trier spins a beautiful web. Everyone involved does an amazing job.

142,dcharold,Clever film with standout performances,9,9 March 2014,"""No one can be that cruel,"" says Uma Thurman in the standout scene that bisects Nymphomaniac Vol I and it's the question of right and wrong that hovers over the film like a spectre. Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jo introduces herself with the line ""I'm just a bad human being"" but it's the existential that drives the narrative more than the moral. ""Why does everything have to be so trivial?"" Jo asks Stellan Skarsgård's Seligman, the Watson to her consulting detective of lust, immediately before he delivers a monologue about the death of Poe. But there's much of weight in the film. Yes there is a LOT of sex in this film, but apart from a few shots of genitals it's the intent that makes the film transgressive; much of what is actually shown you could probably see on HBO. When people aren't having sex they're talking and this is where the film stands out. From fly fishing to mortality and the Satanic Interval the range of topics is as wide as real conversation and the actors are uniformly superb (it is perhaps those of whom we expect least: Shia LaBeouf, Christian Slater and Uma Thurman who stand out most). LaBeouf is cast to be loathed and he tackles that bravely, if his accent wobbles a bit; Slater and Thurman are each excoriating and heartbreaking. Stacy Martin as the young Joe is the empty heart of the film, occasionally blank, endlessly requiring. It's a challenging physical performance and impressively real. No way is this a film for everyone but it's not as difficult as Antichrist - indeed it's often rather funny.

144,dsaillant811,"What Happened, Lars?",3,7 December 2016,"Nymphomaniac Parts I and II are collectively the final installments of Lars von Trier's ""Depression Trilogy,"" preceded by Antichrist ( a film that frequently makes lists of the top 10 most disturbing films ever) and Melancholia (one of very few films that has shocked and saddened me to the core). Considering the artistic mastery of Antichrist and Melancholia, it shocks me that Nymphomaniac comes off as nothing more than a sloppy, messy attempt at turning nymphomania into some sort of deep philosophical head trip.The basic plot of the film revolves around Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourgh), who tells her life story to Stellan Skarsgard's character as it pertains to her unhealthy obsession with sex. The film attempts to draw some deep parallels and connections between Gainsbourgh's story and Skarsgard's love of fishing, but fails miserably. The metaphors are horrifically clunky, the dialogue is weak, the acting is average to mediocre (especially from this cast that made me cry in the previous two films), and the editing is hideous and nonsensical.Lars von Trier is one of my favorite directors ever, so it shocks me that this film is so poorly put together.

148,loveandthunderstorms,"Psychology, Not Sex",7,8 March 2014,"I rarely write IMDb movie reviews but I felt compelled to do so with Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac Part I after seeing the countless reviews and message board posts proclaiming this film to be ""porn"". This film is graphic but it is not porn. I would say that anyone who has ever suffered emotionally, struggled with apathy and/or resigned themselves to risky behaviors as a result of their emotional struggles will find a deeper understanding of this film, elevating it far beyond pornography. This is a review examining the story and psychology of the film, rather than a focal point on graphic sex. To focus only on its graphic nature would be to miss the point of the film entirely.Nymphomaniac Parts I and II comprise the third act of Von Trier's ""Depression Trilogy"". The other two films being Melancholia and Antichrist. This ""trilogy"" came about as a result of his own experience with a major depressive episode and the psychological insights he gained of the depressed psyche. Nymphomania (or excessive sexual drive) is a legitimate psychological disorder that is recognized by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization. Sufferers are often apathetic, their behaviors reckless and impetuous with little regard for consequences. The film begins with the protagonist Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), beaten and abandoned in a rainy alley where she is found and subsequently taken in by Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard) after refusing medical help. Seligman is a kind man who offers her food, clean clothes and a place to rest. They begin a conversation and Joe begins to tell Seligman her story, beginning with her childhood. Their dialogue is interspersed with flashback scenes of a young Joe (Stacy Martin), following her from childhood to young adulthood.I'll cut to the chase. Much has been made of the nudity and graphic sex in this film. Is it necessary? Yes, I believe it to be. Joe's mix of self hatred and indifference are conveyed in her many emotionless encounters with various men. The encounters are straightforward and at times, mechanical. One can easily deduce that these are not encounters of passion but rather, compulsiveness. This is not a film that aims to portray Joe as a victim, nor the men as predators (and vice versa). That would be far below Von Trier's abilities as a writer/director and too simple of a concept for a character as tumultuous as Joe. Rather, I feel he aims to bring us into the life and psyche of Joe, illustrate the desperation, compulsivity and dispassionate nature that began dominating Joe's life from a very early age. Compulsive hypersexual behaviors actually have very little to do with the sex itself, so some of the usual dynamics of sexual relations between two people (joy, jealousy, euphoria, power struggles, etc.) do not come into play here. At least, not for Joe anyway.Despite such a bleak interpretation of sex in this woman's life, the material is handled with care. Some scenes are extremely graphic and shocking in its content and intent but the way in which it's handled contains a certain level of sensitivity. Joe is reckless and callous but Von Trier doesn't shame her in his interpretation. That's not to say that things do not get intense later on in Part II.I found the film to be beautifully shot, the dialogue well written, almost poetic at times. Gainsbourg and Skarsgard are mesmerizing in their scenes together and Stacy Martin gives a solid and subtle performance as the young Joe. I was not pleased with the casting of Shia LaBeouf as Joe's first sexual encounter and Christian Slater as Joe's father. Neither of them were very good at affecting a British accent, nor did they transform at all in their prospective roles. I merely saw them both doing what they normally do, just dialed down a little bit so as not to disrupt the flow of the film. Unfortunately, any scene involving either one of them completely took me out of the film. Despite this, I still found myself very affected by the film overall. By the time I had neared the end, the final scene that held so much promise of hope and emotional connection for Joe was rendered heartbreaking with her exclamation that she couldn't ""feel anything"". I found this moment to be especially wrenching. After watching Joe naively explore her compulsions, one could feel a slight amount of tension building and more than once, I wondered, ""the other shoe has to fall at some point"". With Joe's pain filled cries of ""I can't feel anything"" (her first display of intense emotion), one senses that this is the point at which things take a sad and dark turn and a perfect point to end Part I before embarking on the consequences and even darker and more disturbing elements contained in Part II.There are those that will continue to tout this film as ""pornography"". I suppose the best analogy I have for those who just can't see past the graphic sex would be to compare Joe's sexual compulsions with the compulsions of a drug addict, one difference being that drug addiction is a widely seen, accepted, understood, discussed and examined issue. Hypersexual disorders and behaviors are not, unfortunately. However, being able to identify with certain behaviors at the exclusion of others would be a rather narrow minded approach. How many of you have had a bad day, been fired, been broken up with and decided to go out and get rip roaring drunk, incredibly high or rebound with a stranger in order to deal with the disappointment? You know better, you know it isn't the best idea, you know there will be consequences but you do it anyway. Now imagine the same scenario except there's no inner monologue, no weighing of options.

151,sirnaber,"Arousing, but not orgasmic",8,26 February 2014,"Trier's last ambitious attempt at uncovering the secrets of female sexuality certainly is well above anything that is put out there in terms of ""cinema"". That being said, when considered alongside his other works, especially the two previous ones in this ""trilogy"", this movie feels like a step back. (I shall review the two parts in one text, because, well, why bother.)The first part really whets your appetite with a whole range of emotions and intriguing cinematics. The film certainly draws you in as each new chapter presents a new level of complexity to the characters and to the story. As always, the cinematography is top notch. Seligman's diversions seem weak and irrelevant at times, but Joe is very adamant in keeping to the story, and she drags the viewer with her. the bit with Bach and polygamy, and the chapter on delirium certainly shine as evidence of trier's genius.Overall, the movie is a commentary on almost everything that is related to cinema, story-telling, sexuality, intellectual ambition, art, human nature, resentment, emptiness, depression, ethics, compassion, love and so on and so forth. This could have been the strength of the movie, but as it moves forward toward the middle of the second part, trier is loses his subtlety and turns pretty didactic. He tries to say something substantial about everything, but, as a result, some aspects remain superficial or unexplored. The other two movies remained true to their respective themes and they felt more coherent and powerful throughout.Another downside of the movie is that some parts feel very repetitive, especially if you have seen Antichrist and Melancholia. trier unashamedly references his own movie in the scene with the child being left alone and almost falling down the balcony. At times, Gainsbourg's performance is exactly the same as it was in Antichrist. one of the best performances, by the way, is delivered by Jamie Nell. the character and the story of K is probably one of the strongest sequences of the entire movie. one rarely sees a character so uncompromising and disturbing in cinema. if only that intensity could be kept throughout. The weakest point,in my opinion, is the ending, where trier really forces Seligman, and with him all ""intellectuals"" who have criticized his work, to a kind of weakness that really feels out of place when taken in light of the whole movie and the ramblings of that character. this guy is someone who was not at all interested in or excited by any of the sexual activities depicted in the movie. there is just no reason for him to sneak up on Joe while she is sleeping, especially after she tells her story with all its' gruesome details. the ending feels forced and one suspects that it was intended purely to shock the audience. when taken in contrast with trier's previous movies, this ending surely is but a shadow in comparison.a nice touch is that there are points in the movie where it is clear that trier has taken criticisms of misogyny pretty seriously, as there are many feminist undertones throughout. most of the movie, including the last scene is dedicated to empowering Joe and condemning patriarchy. nevertheless, I believe it is appropriate to say that this weak ending leaves the viewer with a hard-on, or its' female equivalent.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
152,flemos-adriana,A trip to your own teenagehood,7,25 March 2014,"I just watched it and I have to say that: there is a girl making sex with men and you'll see some body parts, but that's nothing really new to cinema, because there are movies without this theme that have sex scenes hotter than those in Nimpho.I'd like to say that this movie is about sexuality and affection and how human being deal with their frailties. It's hard to feel fulfilled, it's easier to run away to something that can make you forget your flaws, sex here is like sex in Shame (2011), it's a escape, it's something that hurts you and that makes you forget life, it's a drug.At the same time, the discovery of sex - when you're a teenager - makes you feel guilty, inadequate, dirty, and that's what Joe feels. Women have to deal with this kind of thing: Men want them to be sexy but they don't want them to like to have sex.In my opinion, and I hope this helps the audience, it's a movie for someone who is mature enough to be able to discuss sex and guiltiness with yourself and maybe for teenagers, who are dealing with a lot of things in their heads. Don't feel like you're a monster, you just need to talk and have a cup of tea.

153,tashwat,Neither Porn nor Art - A genuinely thought provoking film.,8,5 May 2014,"Having browsed over the other reviews I assumed it would be a pointless exercise to watch this film, yet thought I'd give it ago as I enjoyed Lars Von Trier's 'Melancholia'. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and it was not at all what I expected. According to what I'd read previous, this film was just an excuse to showcase nudity and sex. Although, yes sex is at the centre of this story, I felt it gave a true insight and interesting take on the life of a Nymphomaniac. It's about bad choices, regret, happiness and struggle.What I found most interesting about the undeniable dislike towards this film is that it's not that dissimilar from that of Steve McQueen's 'Shame', starring Michael Fassbender. This too shows a character addicted to sex and the lengths a person is willing to go to satisfy their lust. I don't know if it has anything to do with a mans point of view versus that of woman's.

There's really nothing wrong with it, and I would not disagree with those who might praise it for the acting, directing, photography, and so on; and I even found some parts of the dialog -the small philosophical discussions between Joe and Seligman- quite interesting. But in my case it failed to get me interested in Joe's sex life. I simply couldn't care less about how, with who, how many times, or how often she had sex; I'm neither curious, touched or outraged by it. So, parting from that premise, there's not much else in this movie for me.I don't think I'll bother watching part II.

Giving a film a ""1"" rating-based on your particular belief system is parallel to burning a book for being too 'provocative'. Your beliefs and morals are not shared by everyone.

Women are born into a disposition in which they have a sexual power that most men do not. It's very interesting to ponder the thought processes involved with this realization. Not to say all women act and think like the one depicted in the film...but some does get her you like it or not.I'm of the opinion that the people who attack this film are the same people who have never tried to see the world through another person's eyes.

158,jsy3-404-835783,What is art if not provocative?,9,12 March 2014,"""Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1"" marks the first half in the final installment of Lars Von Trier's depression trilogy. The film, which has been the source of endless debates over its cinematic legitimacy, is a racy, provocative, and challenging exploration of one woman's complex journey through sexual discovery. Following a short symphonic juxtaposition of sight and sound, the film opens on the body of Joey (Charlotte Gainsbourg), lying bruised amidst a labyrinth-esque apartment courtyard. Refusing medical help upon being discovered by aging loner Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård), Joey agrees to return to Seligman's apartment. From this moment the film delves into a philosophical conversation between Joey and Seligman, where Joey details the first half of her journey through sexual liberation and discovery; posing Seligman in moral conflict against Joey's negative critique of her self-diagnosed nymphomania.Growing stronger with each release, Von Trier's visual and technical prowess is undeniable. Despite his battle against controversy and often-inconsistent politics, Von Trier's films encompass a formal precision that secures his place high among the leading cinematic visionaries. Broken up in five chapters, ""Vol. 1""'s excellence is most realized in ""Chapter 3: Mrs. H"". Von Trier's willingness to defy classical conventions in his manipulations of style for purely semantic ends allows the scene to flourish. Presented in a compressed aspect ratio, the sequence depicts the uncomfortable exchange between a young Joey (Stacy Martin) and Mrs. H (Uma Thurman). In a paramount performance by Thurman, Mrs. H, along with her three young sons, confront Joey and Mr H. (Hugo Speer) in Joey's apartment. The scene is ripe with tension. Anxiety is heightened through both the nuanced performances of the actors, as well as the formal aspects of framing, ratio, and editing creating the uncomfortable sensation of claustrophobia. The chapter erupts in a solitary melodramatic moment of excess, depicting a pathos-ridden Thurman screaming in agony. The success of the emotional burst is solely predicated upon the tension the sequence builds.The most defiant aspect of ""Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1"" resides in what can only be described as Von Trier's manipulation of his detractors. The film could be reduced to pedantic pornography with ease; however, to do so would be a disservice. These aspects of excess, both in gratuitous sexual acts and explicit explanations of symbolic metaphors and intellectual pandering, inhabit a sense of reflexive humor. Von Trier appears to recognize the aspects of his style that critics malign, creating a red herring through their heightened presence. This is especially true with his use of on screen text, deployed to highlight key aspects in the narrative conversation. At face value these techniques almost appear as a cheap ploy. I would argue that what Von Trier has accomplished, like contemporary directors David Lynch and Michael Haneke have also experimented with, is the creation of empty symbolic vessels. Through their apparent easy-to- stomach messages, the techniques actually mask an infinite number of significations. Therefore, often the simpler an aspect of his films appear, the more complex they are. In summation, if you are unable, upon reflection, to procure relevant signification, I do not believe that the film has failed you, but that you have failed the film.Originally published via StageBuddy by Joe Yanick http://stagebuddy.com/film-tv/nymphomaniac-vol-1-review/",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

It was simple and dull, but he used many different film techniques to try to compose something that could seem of worth. Compared to some of his films, he did try to give the characters a bit of dialog, but sadly, it did succumb to the dull, overly simplistic, focused nature that he wanted those archetypical characters to own. Not much complexity really. Just some droning with some techniques he's picked up along the way in his meandering. Sadly, there are a couple of decent performances, but they end up portraying bizarre, silly perspectives (Uma Thurman in particular). Good performance, but just plain silly and sophomoric context and content. She should have saved her effort for a more promising role in a more believable context.He did draw upon some of his other works in here, but that's good I guess. Give the film a shot.

The film tried too hard to be artsy. Parts of the script were so cheesy... almost Shakespearian like. I'm not saying Shakespeare is cheesy, what I mean is-there's a time and a place. You wouldn't get old fashioned dialogue in an action movie, unless it's well, old or 'special' somehow. Nothing special here.I totally believe intimacy & passion or even obsessive sex can form a strong base for art, but this failed. I'd say missed opportunity. The stills and imagery were not beautiful. The lead character is just dirty whom you feel nothing for. Don't understand why so many well known actors took part in this.I will be skipping part 2.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

First, this is not pornography, it is however,a film aimed at mature adults who are open to seeing sex acts that are not usually blatantly shown in a film. I thought Von Triers ""Antichrist"" was better but this is his second best film! The dialogue was just one key element kept me invested for the 5 and a half hours as i watched vol.1 and 2 back to back. It is so rich and descriptive, comparing sex to music and fishing. I really do not want to say much more, just watch the film. NOTE: This does have scenes of masochism and even a home abortion, ONLY FOR ADULTS.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

And i admit maybe they were right, but,This movie really change my perspective, and so many thing. Yes you should give your spare time maybe 5-6 hours to watch it until the vol.2. The sexual thing that i first(in a whole my life) i think it was taboo thing, or topic that wasn't worth to talking about, but you know, we life with it. Desire of sexuality, to many other things, not only human to human. Human born with lust and desire, if you don't have that so what is difference with you and stone (sory for bit sharp because i just can't stand with people who give this movie rate only one star)Sometimers this movie haunts me, and i swore that maybe in this years 2017 I can't see this movie twice or more because it make my thought full and sick. Sometimes i feel guilty, but i swore everyone who boring with high rate movie and love the up normal movie should watch this.When i was kid, i am afraid of ghost, and up until now those feeling is disappear, and this is the really new indescribable feeling of awfulness",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Breaking down ideas in an open dialogue highlight our differences and similarities and the effect of subjectivity experiences and traumas. It was a meditation and not the rant I expected. Less bleak than the previous 2 in the trilogy, less explicit than Caligula, less violent than irreversible, and quote similar to Pi!

165,show_me_art,disappointed and angry with Lars Von Trier,5,21 March 2015,"I don't know what Lars Von Trier was thinking. DogVille is my most favourite movie of all time and I really found melancholia very hypnotically beautiful and thought provoking. I even found Antichrist creative and disturbing in a good way, yes i didn't like it a lot but I could see that it was worthy of praise. This movie is a whole different story. the only thing I liked about it was the performances of the actors and actresses involved other than that it didn't do anything for me, especially when thought of as one unit with the second volume where it all goes terribly wrong. the final 30 minutes make no sense what so ever and the ending of vol2 makes you want to slap Von Trier for wasting 4 hours of your life. Many of the sex scenes were unnecessarily pornographic and in Vol2 it seemed like Trier was on a mission to show as many sexual fetishes as he could!! The only scene that I truly loved was Mrs H. scene. Uma Thurman was unbelievable and the dark depressing comedy works so well.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
166,benjib84,Still neutral,5,15 March 2014,"Firstly, the parental guidance here is for both volumes. Secondly the sex isn't all that bad I.e. It's not porn and any explicit shots showing any form of real acts are extremely quick.The story is somewhat basic but the acting from most, specifically Stellen is superb. Gainsberg plays the same personality she did in Antichrist.This film is in no way anywhere near as good as or as poetic as Antichrist, but it is worth the watch..Volume 1 seemed like a good run up to what I hope is a better volume 2.The good side of this movie - the acting was good as i already mentioned. Also, it's interesting with its various illustrations and double meanings, though these May get lost on some people.The bad part, maybe it's all the hype but it didn't live up to its controversy and expectations. Antichrist was far more controversial. In a nutshell I would call this ""the new Von trier movie that just isn't Antichrist.......Still.. Worth the watch but not in front of the kids.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
167,herrnoel,Avoid the cult of Von Trier,3,18 March 2014,"First off, if you want to see a movie that depicts sexual compulsion in an engrossing and compelling way, see Shame starring Michael Fassbender.This film is not porn, not particularly raunchy, not in the least bit sexy, nor shocking in the least. What it is is a tiresome, disjointed, and utterly pedantic piece of faux-art.The dialogue is so bad with its philosophical pontification that I physically winced many times throughout the film. This is the sort of wincing one does not at challenging art but at amateur, college level film. It screams intellectual phoney in every other scene.Why is this film even 4 hours long? Because Von Trier was too lazy to pare it down for us. It's like when your friend posts 300 photos of his art project on his website and expects you to pick your 10 favorite, because he can't be arsed to do his own editing.Lars Von Trier's surname, although pronounced differently in his native tongue, is very telling if pronounced as an English word. Try and try again, his scam art fools the gullible masses who will imbue his work with meaning themselves. It is akin to religion -- lacking in both profundity and truth.Do not let the cult of Von Trier brainwash you into believing.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
168,FromTheInside19,Truly repulsive...Just my opinion.,1,25 March 2014,"I really am at a loss for words on how to describe how awful and repulsive this film was. I have seen some of Triers other work just out of curiosity. Yeah, he does push the boundaries and takes big extremes in his films which I am not that big of a fan of. Still, I take the time to watch a film, before I criticize. I gave this film a chance. Honestly, I think this is his wort film.I am not going to into details of the story and plot as it would take too long and this movie doesn't deserve a complete breakdown review, not to mention, it isn't worth my time more than what I am going to type.To me I saw nothing artistic, I saw nothing funny, it wasn't deep or meaningful in any way. All I got out of it was a grotesque pornographic punch in the face. I believe the plot to be weak. Some of the acting and performances were pretty good and that is all it has going for it.I am open minded to lots of things and accept lots of things, but this is not one of them. On top of it all, it's just too damn long. It gets so drawn out. Even the sex scenes in the film were a yawn fest not to mention made me feel unclean. They didn't feel erotic or artistic, or anything for that matter. However, I did not walk out on this film as I wanted to see it in its entirety. The film overall made me feel dirty, and unclean. All I got out of it was a glorified porn, with a weak story and average acting if not borderline sub-par for most of the cast.This movie made me feel dirty despite some of the good acting moments and even a few parts in the story. For the most part, 98% crap cannot make up for the 2% of good that I found in this film. Figuratively speaking of course. I am not saying don't see it. I would recommend you to not, but it is up to you to decide. It is not my place to tell someone what they can and cannot do or watch what they like. Make the choice for yourself. Take this review as a recommendation, I would advise against seeing it. But ultimately the choice is yours. Make your own opinion.

If sex is not the subject of this film it is certainly the narrative tool. So yes there is quite a bit of nudity in it but most people could have guessed this from the title. To me art evokes discourse or it fails. Love it or hate it this film has a community of folks talking so I believe it succeeds as art. Personally I found myself enjoying this film despite it's attempts not to let me enjoy it. This was mostly due to the sensational performance of the lead actress, newcomer Stacy Martin. Von Treirs is a smart dude and this is a movie for smart people. There is a good amount of insightful observation about the nature of humans and their interactions. This is also arguably forced connections, the fishing analogies and the Fibonacci's references stand out. I feel it reaches and takes itself too seriously at times but at least it reaches for something. Whether or not it succeeds in this attempt is of course left up to the viewers.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
171,sbmocnod,Stand-out performances mark this fine film,8,12 February 2015,"I have a feeling I am not alone thinking this movie, sight unseen, features non-stop sex. It doesn't. It's also not soft porn with a provocative title. There's nothing left to the imagination when it comes to the sex scenes, but that's quite refreshing when the movie surrounding those scenes is equally well done. The cast is terrific, starting with Stellan Skarsgard as the man who brings the older Joe (the wonderfully vulnerable Charlotte Gainsbourg) home after finding her injured in an alley (the cause is not explained) and listens as she expounds on her life to date. Joe describes her life as a series of chapters, some with explicit sex, some without (the lovely Stacy Martin plays the young, sexually adventurous Joe). One chapter that does not include sex is Chapter 3. Titled 'Mrs H,' it features a bravura performance by Uma Thurman as the jilted wife for one of Joe's lovers. When ""Mr H"" turns up unannounced with his suitcases, ""My darling, I'm yours, I left her,"" Mrs H is right behind him with their three young sons. ""We wanted to be sure he got here safely,"" she tells Joe. Once inside the apartment, she wants her boys to know the magnitude of what is happening to them. Joe is shocked when Mrs H asks her ""Would it be alright if I showed the children the whoring bed?"" Reciting a few of her lines does not do Ms Thurman's performance justice. If this were a more mainstream movie we'd be talking Oscar. In the Director's Cut film, chapter 3 starts with about an hour left in the movie. You can always jump ahead if you like. Me? I finished the film and went back and watched Chapter 3 again.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
172,Anon_A_Mouse,Wondering if you should watch this film?,1,18 March 2014,"Don't. Your time is far too valuable.This film features unsimulated sex of pornographic actors digitally edited onto the parts of the real actors. So if you're looking for smut, you should instead watch a production from the ""Silicone Valley"" (or wherever it is the porn industry heads out of now). At least you won't have to labor through pretentious dialogue just to see some real action. It gets painful--the dialogue. There's a part in the movie where Skarsgard's character tries to rationalize the protagonist's nymphomania via the Fibonacci sequence. It really doesn't add anything meaningful to the plot, it's just von Trier trying to convince you that he went to college. No, I'm only half kidding. Read the spoiler.*SPOILER* Assuming you don't heed my warning, and still decide to waste your time watching this film, then I won't won't give away too much, but Skarsgard's dialogue is supposed to build you up so you can be shocked by the, like, totally ironic ending of Vol. II...As if you couldn't see that coming, or as if you'll even care at that point. Just be glad it's over so you can go back to watching real porn ;) *END OF SPOILER*And if you're looking for a film that debases contemporaries and challenges social taboos, well...I guess you can say this film does that, or at least attempts to. It's all pretty shallow, though, and really comes off as an excuse to feature unsimulated sex in a movie full of renowned actors. I would not feel so strongly about this if the actors' performances weren't so laughable. I might have even forgiven von Trier if the characters were redeeming or at least believable. For start, LaBeouf's character speaks with an accent not of this world. And Slater's performance as the aged father is comparable to a parody straight out of SNL. Without giving away spoilers, I'll just say I couldn't find one character I could sympathize/empathize with, because they were either too dull, too deplorable, or too comical.Want to see a real art film? Un Chien Andalou, because this isn't art. And from a contemporary film's standpoint, there's really nothing to justify the extremes it has to reach in order to tell its story.Don't do it.

I feel like 90% of people went to watch this film to watch porn, and were disappointed when it had an actual story. If you just want to watch porn, go and do so. Don't slam a film because it did not contain enough pornographic scenes.The film is a gorgeous look through the eyes of a nymphomaniac. The relationships she creates, destroys, develops. The balance between the development of each character and how that is reflected in the way the story was written is beautiful. There is no element out of place, no element unplanned. Every thing is right where it should be. As with many films, the key is empathy. To truly admire the film, one must become one with the characters. Which is a fascinating contradiction with the protagonist of the film, who suffers from lack of empathy herself in certain aspects of her life. But when joined by the man whom she meets and tells her story to, the overwhelming love and compassion creates a fascinating synergy between the characters.The film is simply fantastic. I couldn't stop watching it within 5 minutes of it starting. If you want a beautiful work of art, and a fascinating look through someone else's eyes, this is the film for you.

It offers a true, long, guttural, and languid portrayal of a large portion of mankind who focus their identities in a sexual realm. The nymph could be you, me, or anyone. Some of the screen writing and acting works, and when it does it does so splendidly. Some has the reverse effect. So much so that the negatives outweigh the positives.

Frankly, I don't like the attitude of putting someone down, I'd rather recognise my own shadow and deal with that internally... but it comes down to more than a matter of subjectivity when a film that lacks any type of spiritual or even psychological depth makes its way to the screen.

From my point of view, after watching many movies directed by Lars Von Trier, this might be the best one . It is several levels above other movies which will take dozens of prizes and acclamation . The first layer which attracts people is sex , but this is only the fly (see first chapter in the movie) which will try to catch u to see the rest. Sex is only a means to open the box full with human feelings like solitude, emptiness, self hatred, egoism all seasoned with a lot of irony and links to music , poets and manners like eating pastry with a fork . I like to believe all this details are close to Lars Von Trier and like Tarkovky's library they represent a part of his life and feelingsIn the end, I consider a piece of work (book , music , movie) a masterpiece when the author puts his feeling inside , when he ""writes it with blood"".

The film touches problems about emotions and emotional disorders and their impact on one's life. It shows aspects of human's behaviour that are so natural but often considered morally unacceptable. Nature opposed to morality and values and all resulting contradictions are such a complex matter and that is one of the main points in the film.

180,dtane10,A brilliant movie about society's hypocrisy,10,16 February 2014,"This is the best movie I've seen from Lars Von Trier. Brilliantly constructed, well directed, with lot of imagination and using many techniques (although I'm not a specialist). I include in my review the volume II as well. After watching the first one, yesterday, didn't have patience for see the second part. The idea of a Sheherezada tail, nowadays, makes the background. I loved the way the chapters telling Joe's life are separated by the intermezzos: her dialogs with Seligman, his erudition, her intelligence shadowed only by the all pervasive guilt feeling... I found the explicit key of the movie in the second part... in one of their dialogs. I try to remember it, it might not be 100% accurate: ""Do you know what is characterizing our age? - Hypocrisy! People who tell beautiful lies are acclaimed and accepted, they form the majority; the few ones who tell the truth, often uncomfortable, are rejected!"" Von Trier plays with two opposite characters: a nymphomaniac (probably more a being desperate to understand life meaning and get out of the beaten track than anything else), who never finds happiness in her search, so she goes further and further, and a 60 years old virgin who lives alone and finds his happiness in books. He plays as well with religion, with the concepts of purity and sin, with plenty of symbols amassed cleverly together. He shows us, in fact, our obsession with sex, with human bodies, with chair, making fun of the ones who will refuse his movie, scandalized. In our world which sells mainly with the help of sex, rejecting this movie is a huge hypocrisy. The only disappointment for me was the end of the second part... I don't see why he chose it, but probably will find later on the answer.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Viewers who have seen genitals before may go in for an exploration of the psychology of a sex addict or even (and preferably if you ask me) an exploration of the philosophical stand point of such a person but all they'll get is the trendy, immature and ill informed opinions of a rebellious teenager who just came across the word 'feminism' in the dictionary.The only way to save this script is to decide that it's a story about a person who never accepted the consequences of their actions.Not that Von Trier does anything to help us decide that mind you...P.s.

It is graphic but to be honest I was expecting more maybe being the age I am deionized to graphic images were as the dinosaurs who wrote the other reviews mustn't be.

Even though this movie explores the nature of sexuality from a female perspective, as a male, I could relate to it most of the times because I've been through somewhat similar experience at a smaller, less intensive scale.In essence the movie is about loneliness, filling this loneliness with addictions and gradual experience led changes in a sexuality of a person.It will make most of people feel uncomfortable because the movie will shake your prejudices, religiosity or moral beliefs.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Basically I expected a porn movie , fortunately it was more than that . It had lots of philosophical interpretations , from the second main character Seligman , which I loved . He is so asexual that only he can see beyond the wildest sex stories of Joe . He is calm and gives comforting affirmations on every sinful aspect of Joe's life . His character is also portraying the autistic savant personality of Von Trier , while Joe is more portraying the sexual chaotic element of trier's brain I think . The scenes with Joe and her father were brilliant ; When the father talks about his favorite tree which has dirty black branches , just like an allegory or metaphor for the life that Joe would take , burying herself into mindless dirty sex . For the sex part , I have to say , at the beginning I found it quite erotic , because it was so outrageous , at the end the sex scenes got more sad and depressing .

I will surely re-watch it to understand it more.There are a lot of disturbing scenes I simply could not watch as I am a sensitive woman, especially the ending. I am not a character like her, but her story is relatable. I loved the beginning, which fed my mind, and the lengthy scene about the wife. Most movies just shorten those embarassing moments, cut, cut, cut. No! Those are lives of people. People are miserable, when they love somebody and lose him/her, and this movie truely shows it, at least that scene.

187,Copenhagener,Trier dancing in the dark,4,1 January 2014,"""My next movie will be a porn movie!"" Lars von Trier announced for Stellan Skarsgaard. And so it went. Nymphomaniac was created.A nymphomaniac is - as the main character Joe's (shortlived) therapist points out - not a sex addict. A nymphomaniac is the male fantasy's concept of a woman who on a sexual level is insatiable. Is Joe a product of Lars von Trier's imaginations or is she a product of denial of one's own limitations causing a positive spin on any personal issue? The condition is never treated from a true therapeutic perspective, but instead assessed through a non- chronological history of sexual encounters with different partners in different flavors. None of them ever amounts to anything more than trivial pocket philosophy and fluffy poetry, mainly worded by the self- diagnosed asexual Seligman who picked her up from the street, where she was found beaten, and listens to her stories. I wonder why Trier could not come up with any better comparison to searching for a partner than that of going fishing. Evolutional theories, for example, would be less plausible, but still close - unless he purposefully wanted to make the points as easy as possible for the audience. Seligman explains everything in detail so that nobody are dropped during the 2 x 2 hours.Not much is left to our reflection, and surely not to our imagination, either. Penetrations and fellatios fill the screen more than once. Trier is one of the few directors who looks to the porn industry for filling his cast and completing the scenes as he wants them to be. But why? What happened to ""Less is more""? For Trier, there seems to be only ""More is more"". As the opening credits say, this is a shortened and censored version of his work - with his acceptance but without his interference. As you would expect, there are a lot more and much more graphic sex scenes than the vast majority through cinematic history, including the above activities. Art? Porn? Provocation? You be the judge, but in either case the justification of it does not automatically follow.Trier introduces a new genre called digressionism in which we wander off the main route to a number of side-stories. A genre that will surely cause a lot of headache in Hollywood. I am not a fan of Hollywood, either, but Trier has for one always enjoyed doing things his own way. For the same reason, I also have a feeling that most of his work is more about himself and his own thoughts than it is about us and our surroundings. Some passages I suspect to address his own childhood - loneliness, abandonment, fear, enigma etc. We never get a chance to get really deep in much of the story before it moves on - or back to Seligman and Joe talking in the room.The humor and self-irony is a refreshing aspect, but unfortunately does not help delivering a work that succeeds in reaching, meeting and touching the audience unless they are a fan of Trier and enjoy being a witness of his latests creations he wants us to see. Some points in the movie miss the mark, and there are a few technical flaws in the cut - unless they are just meant to be artistic stunts.In the end, Joe becomes a Joke, stereotyped to the literal point of pain, with no intimacy, but instead a lot to giggle or cringe at. Add to that a lot of clichés and scenes so predictable that the before-mentioned cinematic center must be nodding in recognition.I hope for Trier that the primary purpose of this work is a tour-de-provo aimed at the noble board in Cannes, and secondarily some experiments with the new genre. Otherwise, although a Dane, I must say that I have seen better - also by himself - and at times was quite bored by the dialogs between Seligman and Joe. Trier tediously revolves around the dark, depressing, violent themes of suffering, which, even with the sparks of humor here and there, drowns the whole experience in black apathy, pointing in no other direction than down in the soil, where Joe was left.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
188,soulotus-950-427973,You will not like this movie if you are scared of sexuality.,9,17 March 2014,"I have no idea why people expected zero sexuality from a movie titled NYMPHOMANIAC, but obviously there are many explicit scenes that might disturb people who get scared of seeing genitals. Before I go on to actually review the movie I would like to point out the a few common confusions previous reviewers seem to have:1) Obviously this is not a documentary. Fiction is not documentary. I propose people google film related words that they don't understand before they review movies.2) The movie is not set in Denmark and it does not describe the life of a Danish woman either. I propose people look at maps of countries that speak Danish and English to have a clearer understanding of the difference. 3) Please look up the word Nymphomania, realize it is about sexual activity and addiction, and decide whether these themes bother you. If it does DON'T WATCH IT! You are an adult, no one forced you to go to the movies and watch this movie. If you can't comprehend what a movie titled Nymphomaniac is about, than that's on you buddy-not the director. Anyway here's a real review for cinema lovers- SPOILERS (for both of the volumes)!Without going into summarizing the movie I thought this was Trier's most pro-feminist movie to date, which I applaud him for. In the past he has been criticized recently for writing scenarios that put women in terrible situations. In my opinion it's quite intellectually lazy to blame that on the director than to realize that a good amount of women do suffer through terrible conditions portrayed in his movies such as rape, violence and injustice. Seligman's comments at the end of her story I think supports my theory: If this was the story of a male sex addict, it wouldn't be an interesting story at all. Because Joe is a female the burden is heavier, the guilt is more interwoven to her acts as she is and always has been aware of society's view of her. I thought this movie is written meticulously, and unlike his previous two movies (Antichrist and Melancholia), the symbolism was explained throughout the movie. While I wasn't necessarily a fan of the references to these movies (deep space photography usage and the scene in which Marcel almost falls out the window as Lascia Ch'io Piagna plays), I thought this was a very powerful and humanist movie. Lastly, at first I found the ending a bit odd as to why Seligman, an asexual man that spent his entire life without sexual urges would suddenly want to perhaps rape Joe. However the more I thought about it I started thinking that perhaps Seligman wasn't necessarily asexual but a sociopath. Sociopaths are known for lack of empathy (Joe at one point got angry at Seligman who couldn't understand the affect of her losing her orgasm) while they are very successful in convincing others that they are a friend. I quite enjoyed this movie, I encourage others to see it if they enjoy non-mainstream cinema.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Also it was a bad movie because it is not interesting at all.I found it boring with monotonous dialogue between Joe and Seligman who are the main characters.The movie offers sex and some porno,but never satisfies movie viewers.We don't know why a nymphomaniac woman is a sex slave who practices sex and masturbation for pleasure only and we see the opposite that she becomes addicted to sex and nudity and seems clearly in this movie she is not enjoying sex.To me Lars Von Trier should really convince us to see a movie and must work hard to make a good plot and not just provide us with porno to make us horny.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

And in this context...perplexity and confusion because this movie is so human, so close and precise to our nature that the question is who is the alien?...What is this academy awards industry producing? What culture are we generating around our fat and deformed moralities?...This movie in its excellence puts in the face of the trained viewer the mediocrity of our moment...and its painful and embarrassing when your middle class ass gets spanked like this...Lars Von Trier is without a doubt one of the greatest artist have ever been behind a camera and at nymphomaniac he has shown it again ...Thank you Zentropa for remind us what a movie can do. k",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

All performances feel organic.STORY: It is a life story, and anyone who says Nymphomaniac is nothing more than a porno is only looking at the imagery of this film. There is an atmosphere behind the world of lust that the story uncovers well with a few metaphorical devices here and there. There is a gentle relationship that is built between the old man and the leading protagonist he finds as she tells him her life. The dialogue between the two can serve as interesting story breaks between flashbacks. This film does a great job of showing true significance behind the character's sexual motives and the psychological effects that her actions had on her. However, the graphic style of Lars von Trier only makes his films available to a select audience who are willing watch scene after scene of explicit sexual encounters. I am not a fan of Lars von Trier because of this overall feeling of despair I get when I watch his films, but some decent points are made about the dangerous psychological aspects of pure lust, as well as the decryption of love itself.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

The acting is dire. To be fair to the others, it is only really Charlotte Gainsbourg's acting that is shockingly poor, but as she is the narrator and main protagonist/antagonist, this is significant. She delivers her lines like Stephen Hawking would if his computerised voice sounded less electronic.The script is even worse. The storyline travels a heady path from crap to boring, and ends with ridiculous.Ignore what little hype there is about this film, without the sex and the branding of Von Trier pasted all over it, I'm confident even those who have given this film unusually high ratings, would be giving it well below 5 instead.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

195,epdarkstar71,Enough is enough,8,23 February 2015,"I have watched this film more than once, and usually love reading the reviews here on IMDb however, this film really has affected people in some ways that I think might not be warranted.The film is not for everyone, and if you know Lars Von Trier, you know that going in. Yes it is explicit in it's representation of the darker corners of humanity, however, some of the reviews and posts I have seen are beyond ridiculous and borderline propaganda.This is not a porn film, nor aimed to be titillating in that fashion at all. For some reason this film has drawn the ire of what I can only believe are some moral thought police(call it what you want to).Seriously, the people who have written one star reviews; and you read them and they start in on how you are wasting your money, it's porn, you are a good person so you don't want to see this...seriously? Look let's make this clear. If you are deeply religious, don't watch this. Clear as day. You will be offended. Why, well the average film probably offends you so this will be more than a tipping point in your eyes as some example of the decline of civilization. But just don't watch it.But leave those of us who don't subscribe to your moral crusade alone. Think what you want to think, and leave it at that. This film isn't made for those like yourself.Enough of that. It does get annoying though.The film is seriously long, and possibly better watched in installments, however, now that it's on blu ray you can watch it at home and it's not that drawn out.Like all Von Trier films the film does not exactly lend itself to easy dissection. The sex is not for titillation any more than watching a film about obesity is aimed at getting you to want a cheeseburger. Plain and simple the film is about humans and their penchant to fill emptiness with whatever means possible. Of course the story takes twists and turns from that premise, but all Von Trier films do.If you consider yourself a fan of film, art, and those that push limits than I recommend this film highly. If you consider yourself an ""open minded conservative religious person,"" no, don't bother. You're not as open minded as you think.I'll leave it at that. But shame on the propaganda that is rampant on here. Save that for church.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
196,Wild_Fox,"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.",10,13 August 2014,"As I cba to write 2 reviews for 1 movie, this review will also be posted for N()c pt.2Did somebody already mention there's some sex and nudity shown?It comes with the territory.The movie centers around the meeting of two human souls, who have embarked on completely different life paths. Joe is a nymphomaniac, while Seligmann, having found early in life that sex doesn't do much for him, considers himself to be asexual. Joe agrees to tell Seligmann her life story, on the condition that he will listen to her without prejudice. Seligmann is able to do so, because he doesn't focus on the sexual nature of her adventures. Time and again he draws parallels between sex and seduction, and the same 'techniques and principles' applied to sports, arts, music and even religion. At first Joe gets really annoyed by this: she feels he's not taking her seriously. But eventually they find common ground, and there's a growing mutual interest in each other's point of view. Time and again Seligmann absolves her from her self imposed negative self esteem until, when the morning has come and her story has ended, she no longer wants to argue with him and she is truly able to see herself through his eyes. With her rediscovered innocence and newly found love for who she is, she has a powerful psychological transformation and she renounces sex... not because of morality, but she realizes it is killing her.For all this I was willing to award this movie a 9/10. For just one thing bothered me: the ending.Why then, why, I wondered, would LvT opt for this completely nonsensical ending, when Seligmann decided it would be a good idea to creep up to her in the dark for a bit of hubbahubba? This makes completely no sense: not only is he asexual (I didn't notice any alleged repressed feelings in him), it would also be virtually impossible for him to betray - literally within an hour! - their fresh and fragile bond of friendship... not after all this understanding he has shown to her so far.Is it that the alternative would be even worse for LvT? That he wouldn't want the viewer to be left behind with some 'happily ever after - feeling'? Some statement that there's no such thing as true human understanding? A cynical twist?But after a few days it hit me. LvT upped the ante even more in the very last minute. He wants to take us *all the way* to the core of the human spirit: There is no higher authority than the authority that can be found within, and to answer that call one must be prepared to give up everything else - even your love for the authority that brought you this far...Or, as they say in the Zen koan: If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!So Joe the no-mo-hoe has to kill Seligmann the blessed-but-also-fallible-hu-mann, who helped her to discover her Buddha nature, but also threatened to take it from her.We are a mirror to each other, but we are not allowed to rely on anything or anybody outside of us. That's the message of this film. It's LvT's rendering of the old Zen koan in 21st century art.How could this movie get less than 10 out of 10?",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

It fits well with the depression trilogy and it would be good for viewers to watch all the three of them in sequence. The trilogy handles depression through various situations. Antichrist is depression with evil notes, Melancholia is depression via loss and management of this, Nymphomaniac is depression via one's disorder, and might be even more.Totally artistic, Charlotte is bau excellent, Uma one of the same, that is brilliant, I enjoy watching it.

206,thegailo,So good it's bad.,7,3 March 2015,"The story is simple. It chronicles a conversation between two people. Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is found bloody and beaten in an alley by an older man, Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard). He takes her to his sparse flat to care for her and help her. What takes place is a long conversation full of intellectual digressions about Joe. It slowly reveals what led to her downfall. Seligman is a sheltered bookworm who has a detached curiosity about her story.The cast is impressive including Shia LeBeouf, Uma Thurman, Christian Slater, Jamie Bell, Willem Dafoe, Connie Nielsen, Udo Kier among others. The director is Lars Von Trier, the famed Danish auteur and provocateur. Von Trier has always tried to find hidden and shameful areas of human behaviors in his films. Many of his films are rigorous exercises in the depths of human pain. They attempt to push expectations. They explore behaviors that seem too absurd to be real, but that is because most of us refuse to acknowledge certain parts of ourselves.The film is very sober and serious with a classic artistic and intellectual intent. I say that because its goal is to get to the roots of human sexuality. It wants to explore the psychological compulsions that send the human mind off in radically different directions in each person. We are all sexual beings, but all of us hide some part of what is inside us with a degree of shame. Seligman seems to have no sexuality at all, while Joe seems to be on an endless search to satisfy an unquenchable desire.The film starts in her youth where from 2 to 12 she is slowly becoming aware of her sexuality. As a young woman she enters a competition with another girl to sleep with as many men on a train as they can. This kind of reckless sexual adventure escalates as she tells her tale to Seligman.The most important aspect of Nymphomaniac for most people will be the explicitness of the sexuality.I will say that anyone who sees this film would not think it is pornography. In its extended length you will see scenes that break the rules of what is acceptable, if you care about those sorts of things. The fact that it breaks those rules and the way that it does it will force you to confront how you feel. You may be repulsed or amused or bored or excited. I would agree with any of those reactions. The context in which the film displays various scenes removes them from the expected connotations.Part of how you view this film will probably be colored by how you feel about its controversial director. Von Trier is variously considered to be many things. Some view him as a mad tyrant with his cast and crew. Some see him as a reckless clown with his antics in the media. He courts expectations of an audience, who view him as either a genius or a fraud. Some of his other projects which have won awards include Breaking the Waves, Kingdom Hospital, Dancer in the Dark, Dogville, Manderlay, Antichrist and Melancholia.Great art will defy expectations, but it is a tightrope. It will force argument and encourage ridicule. This film definitely causes that reaction. That means it might very well cause you to laugh in derision. It verges on ridiculousness on many occasions. It is both intensely serious and absurdly funny. The film will work on different centers of the brain than simple skin flicks. Expect the film to push your boundaries. The part with the professional sadist was the roughest for me.I'm chuckling right now because this week Entertainment Weekly released its best and worst list for 2014. Nymphomaniac I & II has achieved the great honor of worst film of the year. Entertainment Weekly used to have two critics in the film section with dueling best-of-the-year lists. They are both gone and have been replaced by a single megalomaniac as a replacement. He throws around words like hackwork and hooey, but I'm not sure he should throw around a big word like hooey. He also insults a lot of critics by claiming they bent themselves into knots looking for a nonexistent feminist subtext. I think he needs to get his eyes checked if he can't see the feminist subtext.Nymphomaniac may not be the best film of the year, but it is a work of real art. It gropes and grasps for answers that very few are looking for and is equipped with the ability to do so. The fact that it is ridiculous at some moments and boring at others only legitimatizes it even more. Its attempts to search in such extreme areas of the spectrum give it great merit. We are awash in mediocrity, and Entertainment Weekly is supposed to be the guardian of the gate, but it is failing. It is too busy chasing every pop sensation and obsessing over mass-market Pablum. One of the magazine's biggest problems is that it is too comprehensive of the modern culture, and, frankly, the modern culture is cluttered with crap. Nymphomaniac is not in my top ten of the year, but I could name 200 films this year that were much worse than it was.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
207,dancohenwpb-1,Almost as Bad as District 9,3,22 March 2014,"If you like convoluted symbolism and having to struggle to find the artistic message then you'll love this movie. Nympomanic Vol 1 is the story of a young young woman who is found beaten in the streets (which is presumed to punishment for us being sexual beings oh my!) by an older man who lives in a broke down apartment but is apparently a savant of fly fishing and classical music and has no emotional affect. Nympomanic Vol 1 tries so very hard to be something meaningful and thought provoking but it doesn't fall short, it is more like a bowling ball that falls in the lane one over. I can see why people like, the writer takes a subject that is taboo (female promiscuity) adds hardcore sex scenes (which is great for marketing) and makes it as far from sexy as possible. Wha-la Art!! This movie was about as dumb as the analogy of Joe's sex life to a baroque period fugue. I'm sure the writer was so very pleased with himself when he thought of that one. Let's be honest, the film was uncomfortable in a way it wasn't intended, pretentious, and downright stupid. Uma gave one of the few meaningful performances. The rest of the acting felt like it came from a Bright Eyes song. The heavy forced symbolism really got in the way of taking anything meaningful from the movie. I saw this movie with no expectations of what it was, much like I did Discreict 9 which was also a sh-t show. I went back and looked at the marketing and holy shite it is facking brilliant!!!

208,willtatz,Consistent with Von Trier,8,10 April 2014,"Reading some of the reviews on the movie there seem to be two consistent qualities of the reviews - 1) All of the reviewers seem to assume they know what Von Trier is trying to do and hold him either to that or to their own expectations about what a film should be 2) All of the reviewers seem to be American and let's face it, Americans have different ideas about sex and nudity than EuropeansI quite enjoyed the movie. It's a personal story from a woman who has similar motivations/insecurities to us all, but amplified in some ways. Skarsgard essentially facilitates the telling of her story as a sympathetic listener from a non-judgmental perspective and initially at least likens the process to fishing - after all, sexual predation is a process like anything else.Leave your judgments about sex at the door and relax about what you think the movie should or should not be about.

209,kazaka_222,"""Forget about love"" - Lars Von Trier",9,31 July 2014,"With great boldness the theme of sexuality and love is represent, as two exclusive concepts supported by evidence in the movie. We are seeing one polyphonic of sciences such as psychology, philosophy, religion, intertwined with the arts such as music, literature and art, mixed with melodramatic flair.The first part of ""nymphomaniac"" is told the sexuality from the perspective of mature woman who tells chronologically the story of her childhood through adulthood disastrous denouement in her relationships The story is presented by the main character Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) in eight chapters which can be seen as parables confessions or journal entries. The movie explores and shows deep human depression, how far can reach the helplessness of the individual in existence, facing the originality of their instincts that led to the collapse in relations with people and to breakdown in family relationships and in society.The second part of ""nymphomaniac"" Joe mad desire to reach the longed pleasure in the form of higher delight, leads to a lack of spiritual sensitivity bordering and bringing about sadomasochism, coming from acceptable limits of human perception and behavior, showing all the nooks and crannies of human mind. By the nakedness of the body and physical wounds symbolizes inner pain and frustration of the heroine, and the gap in her soulThe ending is very powerful and could not be said that it is unexpected for the viewer or unpredictable as a happy ending after all shown in would look unconvincing. Filled with ups and low explosions of emotion, the answer to all the questions is out there, high on a hill among the rocks where sticking a lonely tree inclined over the precipice without leaves.

210,nuncstans,Great movie with harsh reviews,10,11 July 2014,"When I read all the negative reviews I was actually discourage to see the movie, nevertheless, I decided to give it a chance since most of the reviews were written in a manner that depicts sex in a derogatory way and judges the objective of the movie as an alleviator for the sexual frustrated or teen porn addict.After seeing it I have to recognize that not all in the movie is great, I'm giving it 10 because of the heavily biased reviews giving it 1 star (which are in my opinion more driven by because sex is the main subject of the movie than by the faults in the film itself) so let me point out the actual review of the film:+The plot is well constructed, and I like how it tangles in between major themes.+The counterpart embodied by Seligman is really good, he puts in perspective his thoughts and exemplifies them pretty good.+Joe is very well portrayed by the three actresses. -Many events are just not factually credible, nevertheless it's amusing that Seligman points out one of them just as I'm thinking about that.-The Rammstein song is really really bad placed in the movie, I sincerely think that it gives such a weak opening to the plot.I would highly recommend the movie, if you happen to be uncomfortable with sex scenes (even though they are not as hardcore explicit as other reviews suggest) or with sex talk it would be better to avoid the movie.

I've already read some reviews that declare that this is precisely what he did with this film, but I dare to disagree.Nymphomaniac is an analysis of the dynamics between love and lust, and human relationships. It gives us the traditional opposites of ""free lust"" and the bourgeois family relationships. The main character, the nymph, is the one that starts to explore these domains as a fighter of the free lust generation, but is at the same time tormented by her inner loneliness.The character itself is interesting, but at the same time not that relatable. I was surprised that the narrative still worked, since there is a possibility of change that the viewer is suspecting to happen to the main character. So we are interested in getting to know is she able to fix her inner loneliness and how. There is a lot of nihilistic tones in this film, but I'm not sure whether it is because Trier wants us to be shocked in order to show that how miserable these kind of things could be or if he actually wants us to accept this nihilistic undertone that seems to be the main theme of the film. As a person with a special interest in these kind of topics, I'm waiting forward to the next chapter.There are also some very fresh takes on cinematography and storytelling in general here. Trier uses metaphors and various inter textual references in order to give the theme a bit more depth. This is one of the best features of this film - without these efforts the film could be actually quite banal and boring. I think he does these references in somewhat sophisticated manner and the Seligman character serves as a educator for those viewers who don't already know stuff like Fibonacci Sequence.So in general the good stuff (which are enough to make up the 8 stars) - Great acting - Great drama and script - Fresh storytelling style - Gorgeous cinematography - Interesting and important themeNot that good stuff: - Okey, we got it: this girl has a lot of sex, no need to show it all - Some of the male characters become a bit shallow - also, I would have liked to see more stronger opposing characters to the nymphomaniac character - Could it be that life is not actually not that miserable, as you want us to believe, Lars?All in all: not an easy film, not to watched on the first date with your girlfriend, but nevertheless a piece of art that deserves recognition.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
212,andre-matarazzo,An underwhelming first part,7,1 January 2014,"::::::::::::::: CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS :::::::::::::::::::::Lars Von Trier: I'm a huge fan and will always be. That, unfortunately, causes hugely enhanced expectations when a new film comes out. Contrary to all other Von Trier films, I just couldn't get into the storyline as I wished. Without giving too much away, most of the situations felt oddly artificial, and the smart manicured dialog felts contrived and at the same time too theatrical - almost as if it were too aware of its lustrous shine as the main star of the show. The scene with Uma Thurman is painful to watch - what a lame interpretation, what out-of- place demure. What was meant to portrait the absurdity of the situation instead felt like an Opera Buffa, unfolding through painful takes. Made me look around to see if someone had quickly changed the film roll during one of the cuts. Some typical Von Trier traces are immediately recognizable (and welcome) for the fan: mixed media to accentuate inner feelings and capitulation, powerful music, and the sprinkle of the odd galactic scenes.On a positive note, the films smartly leaves you hanging at a cliff and flashes a few upcoming scenes from part 2, which seem extremely seductive and worth going in for another go. I wish I could have just sat through the full 5h and take my appetizer (part 1) immediately followed by the main course (part 2).",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
213,jackmdenny,Perfectly good but not much more than that,5,17 March 2014,"Firstly the positives. I think that the performances across the board (except Mr LaBeouf who is positively awful)are pretty good I think Stacy martin was brilliant as her portrayal of young Joe. I think the scene between Mrs H and Joe was really quite excellent. There is also quite a lot of good things about this film. However do not go into this movie thinking it will blow your mind or positively disgust you because it will do neither .The sex scenes though quite graphic are nothing that haven't been done before and the scenes between Seligman and Joe though entertaining were nothing ground breaking or as moving or as profound as I think Von Trier wants them to be. This film is nothing more than just merely entertaining .It's by no means a bad film I had a good time with it.This is not Von Triers worst film, though it is far from his best film is just sort of a good film that I think is too overly ambitious for its own good and I feel this made me feel let down by it do I give this 5 out of ten . This would be a six or seven but Shia LaBoeuf is terrible to a distracting level.Having said all that if you have a couple of hours to kill and want to see some fairly graphic sex scenes I could think of much much much worse ways to spend two hours.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
214,tbiancolino,"Fake, dishonest and pedant art",1,19 June 2016,"Well, that is my first review here, and sorry for the English mistakes. But I need to manifest some thoughts about this movie.The worst thing about art is that when some creation is not art, it uses all dirty disguises trying to be art. And the result normally is something pretentious, pedant, meaningless and BORING!!! It's exactly what happens here with this movie: pretending to be a example of refined cinema making, it results, in fact, in a very BORING and pretentious movie, full of pedant, slow dialogues that make banal reflections about the main theme, sex. It is, at the end, a dishonest creation, very weak art. It would be better if that was a simple porn, it would be more honest.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
215,tizianhollerith,Left the cinema,1,9 March 2014,"This movie is so naive, boring and stupid I couldn't take it any longer than an hour. The only people that might find this movie appealing are 30-50 year old conservatives who have never seen a porn, these people can either laugh or at least get mad because its so ""shameless"". Lars von Trier delivered a stupid piece of crap, in which the dialogs are only good for showing how boring the movie actually is. Worst cinema experience ever, terrible acting, terrible story, terrible Shia La Beouf... The only good thing is that due to all the bad reviews Lars von Trier can go back to hating on Cannes and think he's the most underrated artist ever- aside from Kanye West.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
216,theLastFilmCritic,One of von Trier's best,8,11 March 2014,"Lars von Trier is a director I have long had a love-hate relationship with. He has made films I've loved,(Breaking the Waves, Dogville) films I've respected if not completely enjoyed,(Antichrist, Manderlay)and films I absolutely hate,(The Boss of it All, The Idiots) For years, I considered Lars von Trier the ""troll"" of modern cinema, with von Trier putting all his obvious talent into making the audience feel depressed or angry while he is in his home in Denmark, searching for the next idea that will make a majority of his ever-growing fan-base angry. Nymphomaniac, his newest, is perhaps his most enjoyable and fun film, even if it does have some deep flaws.Nymphomaniac is broken into 8 chapters, 5 of which are in part one while the remaining 3 are in part two. (I had the luxury of watching both parts back to back, which I highly encourage.) Ironically, this film does not have set chapters that are better or worse than others, there are just a few scenes that stand out as great, and two scenes in particular are the best things von Trier has ever done. (Watch the two other films in von Trier's ""Depression Trilogy"", of which Nymphomaniac is a part of, to get the full effect of one of these scenes.)I feel as though stating a plot summary for this movie is inadequate, as many readers will already know the basic premise of the story. Nymphomaniac is one of von Trier's best in story telling, partially due to the amazing work the entire cast puts on display. Shia Labeouf gives the only unsatisfying performance, in large part due to the fact his accent makes him sound as though he has never heard a British person speak in actual life. One of the problems I have in this film is the occasional arrogance of its director. I have never seen a film so self-referential since Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. While in one scene it works really well, for the most part it came off as, for lack of a better word, pretentious. And in all honesty, if there was ever a director to be called pretentious it would be Lars von Trier. This movie also has occasional scenes that go on too long, causing the pace to slow down. In fact, this happens often. While this is definitely not a fault of the film, anyone who was looking for titillating material in Nymphomaniac needs to look far away.These flaws, however, do help separate it from other films. There are not too many 4 and a half hour long films that focus on sex addiction with time to contemplate Fibonacci numbers. While watching the movie, the scenes that go on too long will make you wonder why they weren't better edited, yet reflecting upon these scenes I have gained a much greater appreciation of this film. Also, the satirical elements that are masking von Trier's attitude on human nature are down-right fascinating. If I was to place Nymphomaniac on my list of favorite Lars von Trier movies, this would be number 2 behind Breaking the Waves. Overall, Nymphomaniac was a long journey I was happy to undertake. This film features the best individual scenes of any work by von Trier, and it leaves me anxious to discover his next work of mad genius.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
217,opngate-259-841308,Loved It !,8,8 March 2014,"I give it 8 instead of 9 or 10 because I'm not sure I could believe some of the dialogue between Joe and the guy who takes her in (I forgot his name, sorry lol). I love what they say, it's just it's hard for me to believe they would say it to each other. But then again, look at Dogville (which was brilliant, IMO). That being said, I love the ideas inherent in this film and the way it was put together. I've read the reviews here, and if you didn't want to see a movie about sex, then you shouldn't have watched a movie called Nymphomania. Duh. This movie is in no way, shape, or form, a porno. It's a film that involves intense sexual situations that are clearly, CLEARLY there for a purpose... being tied to Joe's psychology and the things that happened to her in her life. I love how this film weaves different ideas together - sex, death, love, life itself (humans, trees, etc.), profession, art, music, and literature. As well as the art of conversation. If you saw the same film I did and you think it's offensive and a ""porno""... then you should stick to having dumb action movies or romantic comedies spoon fed to you like a child. This film is for adults.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
218,epdarkstar,Love the film...question my fellow reviewers,10,10 March 2014,"I'll try and keep this straightforward without spoilers.Right off the bat this is a Lar Von Trier film(films actually, part one and two) called Nymphomaniac. If any part of that sentence doesn't give you an idea of what this film is going to be like, then this review hopefully will.Graphic sex, despicable acts of degradation, and a dark look at humanity, and specifically gender bias in society.So, if you don't like to see nude bodies, or graphic depictions of sex, don't watch this film, there is absolutely no reason for you to watch this film if that is the case.If you don't like candid in your face type drama, with very little sentimentality, then again, don't watch this film.If you object to seeing human genitals close up, don't watch this film.If you object to a ""non-Hollywood"" approach to film making, don't watch this film.If you object to consensual sexual violence, don't watch this film.*************** OK, so if we've come to this point and you're still in...this is a great film.Well acted, intriguing story structure,graphic depiction of sexual addiction /nymphomania without the sexiness Hollywood would throw normally at it.If you liked Antichrist by Lars, and any number of David Lynch films, then this is easy ground for you.I don't want to go into details about the film other than to say it is told in chapters, coinciding with a ""tale"" being told by the main character. Essentially her explaining how she got to this and how her sexuality consumed her and her life. Each chapter peels back another layer to the situation the protagonist finds herself in. There are many parallels drawn to societal bias, religion, etc. Almost blasphemous at times(which is totally OK by me).The film(two films) are long. I think that is part of the issue, people can't sit that long and stay focused. So they focus on the minutiae rather than the substance.If you have any way of seeing this in two sittings, do so.I thought this was a brilliant film, and very intriguing.***************** Now for my final bit, which has nothing to do with the film. If you pay attention, it is obvious trolls are about on this board and having their way with bad mouthing this film. If you see the film, you will know EXACTLY what I mean. I doubt half of these negative reviewers actually saw the film at all, some maybe saw volume 1, maybe, but I doubt most of them actually saw this whole film. Almost seems to me to be some sort of ridiculous smear campaign of sorts.Don't take my word for it. Watch the film, then look at these reviewers and you'll start to see the holes in their credibility. Most are newly registered. Many reviews seem similar. Many talk about the certain aspects of the film in a way that seems they read it online and didn't actually see the film, and quite frankly many of them seem to be making this up or just regurgitating what they heard from someone else. *********************** the whole, ""this is porn,"" aspect to the reviews is quite telling. Number one. If sex on film where you can see genitals is porn, than OK. If you mean it was done to arouse, than i think you are way off the mark. Or you haven't really ever seen a porno film. Sex does not equal porn people.The irony is this puritanical view of the film is almost exactly what the film rallies against. Watch the film to see what I mean.Great film. Daring film. Sex is the least of it as far as I'm concerned.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
219,donmitch,Completely overrated !!!,3,9 August 2014,"My English is not very good, but i will try to write my opinion on this film. Im very disappointed!!! 7,2 stars are a bad joke. Even at the very beginning... Rammstein did not fit in this whole story. An old man finds a girl lying on the street, he takes her home and she starts to tell a story - BORING ! There was no scene where i started to get curious about what could happen next. The storyline is very simple and .. yes ! BORING. I have one example... She tries do get a job and talks to the secretary. Even you did not see the boss, i KNEW its Jerome. The door opens, viola.. JEROME. B O R I N G ! I don't know how to summarize this film, without bringing in my own opinion. Many sex scenes, i don't know if i watched the uncut version, but you could see her and Jerome clearly f*cking at the end of the film. So i don't know how they could FSK 16 it, does not make sense.

But misunderstood,10,18 October 2014,"Of course this film is not for everyone, 4 hours is a long time to sit through a film that deals with an issue as complex and taboo as human sexuality in a way as simple, poetic, honest and deep as von Trier does. But if u r ready to embark upon an enthralling trip, please watch this film. The writing and directing are masterful and the performances deep and honest. I have not felt this strongly about a film since Dogville. Of course if u r American, it is very likely that u will not get this film. Sexuality and violence are so rarely explored without either exploitation or über morality in American cinema, that it is no surprise American viewers are insensitive to good cinema.

221,goodsirhello89,One of the more intelligent films of 2013,9,5 June 2014,"The fact that the majority of reviews on this movie are negative surprises me. I'm glad i decided to ignore them, even tho boredom was the key motivator.While I can certainly understand why some people may feel offended and even disgusted by some of the images and sub-stories in the movie, I feel that the narrow-mindedness of many of these people might prevent many movie lovers from watching something that they would have greatly enjoyed.Nymphomaniac vol. 1 and 2 tell a great and complex story. They tell the story of a lonely and misunderstood woman and the incredible struggles she has had to go through because of her addiction. Even tho there is a lot of nudity and sexual activities, I found myself philosophizing with the protagonist and her listener. I recommend these movies to the ones who are tired of all those typical Hollywood movies that seem to have been made for simpletons.Open your minds and don't be afraid of new experiences.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
222,MilosRaicevic91,Lars von Trier did it again!!,8,18 March 2014,"After seeing Nymphomaniac Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 back to back, I have to say that Lars did a phenomenal job with this movie! From the first frame to the last, this movie just looks so good, the cinematography is astonishing!The opening track from Rammstein sets this dark mood and embraces us in to the world of Joe, played exceptional by Charlotte Gainsbourg. But the performance which convinced me the most was by Stacy Martin, who portrayed young Joe. I never saw her in any movie before(I think it was also her first feature film), but she played this, I imagine very tough role, amazing. Stellan Skarsgard and Shia Lebouf were also good in their roles.Now, yes there are scenes which are very explicit and sometimes hard to look at, but it is far far away from pornography, what some people are calling it, when I scroll through the reviews here. But the explicit scenes are handled and shot so well, that I didn't saw them as provocative, I could understand more the pain and loneliness of the main protagonist and why she is doing certain things. That's why this extreme scenes are important and Lars von Trier is again pushing the boundaries of todays movie making and of course he is taking risks, but isn't that what movie making is about? What surprised me also was how funny some scenes were, despite the serious and dark theme. If you have a sense for dark humor, I am sure you will find yourself really laughing about some scenes. If you are thinking about going to the cinema and watch this movie, go open minded and prepare yourself to be blown away by this top notch work from Mr. Lars von Trier and especially from the great job of the cast!9/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
223,seananthonyblake,An Unintentionally Funny Abomination of A Film,1,15 March 2014,"Lars von Trier continues to show that he is nothing more than the Howard Stern of filmmaking, a no talent shock jock in an industry already crowded with talentless filmmakers who at least give off some semblance of respect for the medium that is film.While Nymphomaniac actually possesses some decent performances by players such as Uma Thurman and to a lesser extent Christian Slater, the film ultimately is a collection of gratuitous sexual encounters and sexual depravity all for the sake of shock value. Perhaps if it wasn't for the constant bombardment of the ""look at me, look how artsy and provocative I am"" attitude, the film could be taken as a mildly entertaining character study. But, because the film, which is essentially a porno, takes itself so seriously you can't help but shake your head and laugh at it's absurd pretension.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
224,desiderio-murcho,Wonderful literary movie,10,26 May 2014,"This is a great, wonderful literary movie. Forget about the porn or the eroticism: I found none. Just a wonderfully unusual story, told with superb photography, great acting (Uma Thurman as you have never, ever seen!), wonderful script. The story is told from the point of view of Joe, a girl that has a weird attachment to sex. I say weird because it is not even apparent that she enjoys it at all. It is rather like a game to her. However, the way the story is told, the parallels with fishing (!) and the sheer beauty of it is staggering. A perfect movie for those of us who are fed up with movies for kids with lots of explosions and super-heroes thinking like 12-year-olds. This is about people, it is funny, makes you think and it is at the same time tragic. Just about life, come to think of it.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
225,nemesisrecords,"Full of gratuitous moral quandaries, meaningless and (relatively) unprovocative sex scenes: film lacks the depth I was expecting",5,23 February 2014,"The sex scenes are not arousing, but neither are they used to convey anything of value further than the fact that sex is a routine, menial element of the character's life. The film does not seem to engage with a nymphomaniac's attitude to sex, it seems to sit on the fence between maintaining an objective standpoint and dipping its toes in explorations of love and passion. The scenes are not particularly provocative, if you compare it to what is readily accessible on the Internet. I wonder what inspired von Trier to make a film (allegedly) about nymphomania; I would be very surprised if it were due to a personal experience with it.The plot is clunky and incongruous, the dialogues are pseudo-intellectual and littered with clichés, making the length of the movie (I watched the 4 hour one, two volumes back to back) more difficult to endure.But the main issue I have with Nymphomaniac is that it seems von Trier deliberately throws in a series of moral anecdotes (regarding love, parental duties, paedophilia, the grooming of children for ulterior motives, intent to murder, et al), so that Joe and Seligman can dismiss them with simplistic reasonings, and appear to be engaging with some higher moral discussion. I found the lack of depth devoted to these topics shallow and insulting to the audience; anyone can bring up paedophilia and cause a stir, not everyone can engage with it in a meaningful way (see The Hunt for example).Not everything was bad. The movie succeeded in balancing a bleak topic (sex addiction) with numerous comical moments; the cinema often broke out in laughter, especially in Vol 1, which I was not expecting but enjoyed.Look out for Uma Thurman's great appearance, successfully showing the collateral damage caused by Joe's addiction, which comes as an intrusion into her life otherwise blinded by her obsession (interspersed with much dark humour).Also, the overarching development of the characters of Joe and Seligman throughout the film is very interesting. Initially they seem at cross- purposes; two people who have lived their lives as outcasts, both using this chance encounter as an opportunity to confess their sins/demonstrate their passion to someone who has given them their undivided attention, but yet seems interested in only telling their own story. The attachments you build to these two characters are then radically shaken in the last part of the film, leaving you doubtful about your ability to make successful character judgments. This is an interesting exploration of the abuse of trust between humans, but again it is brought on the audience so abruptly that you hardly have the time to appreciate it.In conclusion, I left Nymphomaniac with many unanswered questions, to which I was not expecting a response, but at least the stimulation and opportunity to answer for myself, which the film does not give. And most importantly, I really fail to see the choice of topic. The film doesn't really say anything meaningful about sex or nymphomania, and I struggle to understand von Trier's choice in that respect. 5/10 because as I said it has some redeeming features, because there are films out there that are so much worse than this, but also because there are many that are so much better. Watch this film if you want to confirm for yourself what the whole hype is about but prepare to be disappointed. If you want porn, go to Redtube.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

227,l-gillborn,"A dark, depressing and controversial film.",8,8 March 2014,"So, this film is of course going to be followed by masses of controversy. There's simply no way that every single person can enjoy a film, and I can already see that there will be a much divided opinion about this masterpiece. At times when I was watching it, I thought ""Is that really needed? Couldn't you have left that part out? That section could've done with being shortened."" But when reaching the ended, I realised that almost all those moments were actually needed, as the ending would have a lot less significance than if lots of moments of Joe's story weren't included. When finding out the finer details about the main character, Joe, as well as her life style and choices I formed a constantly changed opinion. By the end I had made my mind up; I admire the girls' intelligence although I also think that she made some very poor life choices. The acting in this movie is at times incredible, especially from the likes of Charlotte Gainsbourg and Shia LaBeouf. Uma Thurman also had an explosive and brief appearance in which she certainly made her mark. Lars von Trier certainly delivered a well thought out, meaningful film which is easy to misunderstand as well as view in many different ways, and I respect that. Although I feel like some of the sexual elements of this film could've been cut out (like the slide show of penises?) I firmly believe that this film deserves recognition and more importantly, to not be instantly prejudged by its title. Yes, there's no denying that there's a sexual element and storyline to this film, but I perceive it to be based on principles and morals and how easily the meaning of the word wrong can be re-distinguished in the viewer's mind, although I find this film to be far too difficult to rate. This is due to the fact that it's a film so unusual as compared to others, that I'm finding it increasingly harder to decide exactly how I would rate it on the simple basis of 1- 10. I've decided on eight, as there are many elegant and magnificent elements included in this film, but also there were things included that I think didn't need to be.Overall Rate: A real eye opener and masterpiece of work, but be warned as it doesn't hold back.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
228,matthewcodylang,Von Trier cannot be stopped!,9,6 March 2014,"...I've always demanded more from the sunset."" I have always demanded more from film directors. There are only a few directors out there that continue to up their game and Lars Von Trier surprises the hell out of me each time. I rarely have the feeling of being intellectually challenged or satisfied by films (especially nowadays) but after finishing Nymphomaniac: Volume One I must say that Von Trier has once again showed that he is one of the best directors of our or any time. Though the subject matter may scare our prudish country (and others), this is easily his most accessible film to date. His films tend to have a slow burn and then a slap in the face at the end. This film builds slowly but rightfully so and brings the audience, along with Stellan Skarsgard's character Seligman, into the world of Joe played by the always perfect Charlotte Gainsbourg and newcomer Stacy Martin. The film is surprisingly very funny and filled with so many wonderful tidbits relative to her fascinating story. There wasn't as much explicit sexual content (though there is some believe me) as I expected but that is because this is the edited version. I cannot wait to see the uncut version which will help the audience dive even deeper into this character (really wasn't trying to make that sexual but you understand). Volume one ends on a cliffhanger that has my mind racing with no sign of stopping. This film will change cinema and I hope people are ready to put their discomforts with human sexuality aside and understand where this can take us in the artistic world. This is not porn. This did not induce feelings of eroticism but more of an understanding of sex and how we are as human beings. I could seriously talk about this film for days but I need to know where it goes before I go too crazily detailed in the subject matter and complexities of the film. Von Trier likes to shake up the audience in his final acts and I'm ready for it. Look for it On Demand NOW!!!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

230,pbrletta,radically altering,8,24 June 2014,"Nymphomaniac is a film about the body being used as a threshold for feeling. In this case, its Joe's vagina that poses as portal of entry for the outside world to pass through. Her entry is continuously experiencing physical abuse, love, and violation. Her vagina could be considered its own character in the movie as it experiences without Joe at most times. Joe's vagina is the eye through which Joe sees. Joe grieves through her vagina. She loves, feels shames, wonders, and most of all- numbs herself by means of her vagina. It seems as though Joe is unable to feel or relate to experiences like a common person. The physical world does not directly relate to Joe. She is merely sleepwalking in her own time/space continuum and does not react with the immediate physical world; it is only through having sex that she feels. A shining example of this is when her father passed away and she became wet looking at his dead body. Above all, the direction of this movie compliments the radical story line flawlessly. The films timing is played with throughout the film, which adds to a sense of distortion. A recurring motif in the film is the sped-up moments throughout the film. This subtle detail makes it seem like you are watching someone's subconscious memories of the shady, barely remembered past, which is essentially what this film is- a retelling of Joe's memories. Much of the dialog throughout the film as narrated by Joe is heavily drawn out and does not exude much emotion. Yet the film does a good job of showcasing a spectrum of nuanced and intense emotions on a visual level. While Joe's tone of voice is monotonous and dragging, there are colorful feelings that are encapsulated on a visual level. This is a masterpiece of a film, and on a personal level shed light on raw human emotions that I may have never understood if I had never seen this film.*heavily censored for puritanical reasons.

231,tryfon-bampilis,An anthropological approach to sexuality,10,26 February 2014,"I was lucky to watch the premiere of both parts in a ""one-night stand"" and follow the Q&A with Stacy Martin, Sophie Kennedy Clark and Stellan Skarsgård. The film is esthetically and stylistically stunning, each scene has an air of perfection and the actors are performing magnificently considering the highly controversial topics that the director is so kin to analyze in detail. Each time I have been thinking about the film, I am finding out that there are more readings, more interpretations and more things to discover.The film is therefore multilayered, highly metaphorical and deeply philosophical. Indeed the film is a celebration of female sexuality but more importantly it might be seen as a critic to western and Euro-American perceptions of sexuality, gender and eroticism. It draws largely from the work of Michel Foucault as the film is unraveled around the ""repressive hypothesis"", the argument that the obsession with sexuality derives from the confessional ethic of the counter reformation in Europe. As it touches upon ""the Perverse Implantation""and how that relates to marriage, he discusses power by the ""deployment of sexuality"" in relation to obedience, domination and submission and the use of pleasure. The director is also deeply influenced by George Bataille as there are references of his work in a number of scenes including the religious interpretation of sacrifice on the cross for Christ, the arousal-erection of the genitals of the dead body (death and eroticism) and the conceptualization of transgression in most scenes. The director's reading of Hegel derives once again from Alexandre Kojève as there is a deep emphasis on the slave and master relationship and their approach towards death which is also the epitome of the film. No doubt there are also various references to Marquis de Sade and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch but the director is also influenced by Aragon and other avant garde authors. It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the scenario is really excellent; to understand it and decipher it though it requires a lot of reading and preparation that is really worth doing.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
232,renan-meira,What should you expect from Nymphomaniac,10,30 January 2014,"One of the most awaited movie of the season, Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac came to make us meditate about our sexual and social relationships.The plot starts when Joe is found by an old called Seligman in a pitiful situation. Seligman takes Joe to his house and then asks Joe to tell him what happened, shameful she denied telling, but promising not to judge her and insisting a lot Seligman convince Joe to tell him her life story of nymphomania.Besides the movie's big advertising with shocking images of people having an orgasm face and all the expectation of a movie full of brutal sex scenes, the sexual appeal In the first version of Nymphomaniac looked more a cult soft core porn for the sadness of everyone who waited for a Von Trier's version of Caligula.By the way the ""pornography"" on the movie is far to be the main quality of it. It's a movie that in many ways talks about sex, relationships and flirtation with the particularly and the fantastic style of Von Trier which has undeniable influences by the epic theatre of Bertold Brecht. For example, in the chapters of Nymphomaniac, if you look really close, all of them are complete, you can cut any of them or change their order the movie would simply go on. Every chapter has its own message and its own idea that the audience should think about.Another characteristic of the movie is that it doesn't want you to feel anything but think. That could really sound strange, but every scene that you were supposed to feel anything like to judge Joe or sympathize with her pain is quickly followed by something like an explanation of fishing or something like. It's an aesthetic feature to not permit the audience to condescend with anything and make they think of it as they can think of common things like fishing or music.In general, Nymphomaniac is not a simple movie, it's something that requires from you a weighing of your moral values followed by a not common aesthetic that makes a very interesting movies for those whom enjoy that kind of movie.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

This movie was the reason i registered here because i cannot stop thinking of how much i loved it and of course i will see it again, because it has so many things that someone can approach.....some thoughts that i had during this movie: it is about the battle of growing up, of finding sexuality while we have diamonds unsolved inside, of where block our emotions can lead us in life, of how a mother's absence can influence our first ""girlfriend(s)"" love and our ability to love and be loved.... but MOST OF ALL this movie is about death and our agony around this matter.....is about loneliness... is about letting go ....and be fragile...is about finding extreme ways to soften only temporary our pain...the bigger the sock and the more distance we have from our feelings, the most extreme our reaction can be i.e. her reaction to her father's death or her line when she had sex with the only guy that had feelings for...watch it carefully and try to put pieces together...everything but everything, every moment, scene or music in this movie has a purpose...it is so brilliant!!!....do not focus on just sex, because if you do, you will be for surely disappointed.....For the ones that already seen it, i can try to explain further what i mean by two examples : 1st) do u think that the fact that her mother did not visit her dying husband in the hospital was a coincidence? ONLY this fact (there were many others) can give u millions explanations to use and elaborate more...that's why i find this movie a poem...it gives u a line, and it is like a book or poem that the reader can travel and use it in many different paths.....this movie makes u think for days!!! 2nd) I cannot think that a porn movie will have this line ""Perhaps the only difference between me and other people is that I always demanded more from the sunset. More spectacular colors when the sun hit the horizon. Perhaps that's my only sin""thank u...forgive me if my writing in English is confusing...see it as a movie of Von Trier, u can interpret it in many ways :)",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
235,akshai-917-346810,An average movie written for average cinema-goer,7,6 February 2014,"I watched this movie (only the first part of it) just yesterday and frankly to said I am more than disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this movie is not bad at all, but I have expected more. When my favorite newspaper gave me the recommendation and said: ""Trier is a great author/director, we are not hearing about him for the last time, the club scene will love him."" I didn't wait a minute and bought me a ticket. Well, a very bad choice. I assume this movie belongs to the mainstream production and is aimed at the average cinema-goers having their IQ under 110. Here's my justification.1) Trier is underestimating his watchers. He assumes they don't know what Fibonacci numbers are, how walking of leopard looks like, he expects they won't be able to capture 3 ""background"" melodies,  everything is being served on the golden plate, everything is explained at least 3-times, with figures, numbers, graphs, with didactic scenes, with replies, the old good fellow is explaining everything. Oh my God, Mr. Trier, we are not children of policemen. At the end of the movie I was empty. There was nothing to think about, everything was understood. No interesting, hidden messages/puzzles were waiting for me to be solved. Mr. Trier, instead of showing us a picture of leopard 3-times, telling us ""I had a boy-friend who walked like leopard"" 4-times and showing us his way of walking 2-times... it would be really better to show us some leopard in ZOO, wait 2 minutes and then show us how that man is walking. That's something what an art movie is about. We have to think about it, we have to solve the puzzles.2) Maybe because of the reasons being mentioned in my first paragraph I had a feeling Mr. Trier wants to combine pure sex with some symbolic messages by brute force and I found his intention very ""artificial"", ""unnatural"". One good example above all: Joe is a nymphomaniac having a lot of sexual partners. In one era of her life she has sexual intercourse 10-times a day. So far so good. But... now someone tries to force us, that only 3 of them are important, are unique in their character and that it is more than interesting that 3 is a Fibonacci number, isn't it? OK then, but what is 10? 3) Almost the whole movie I have missed the ""art"" camera, some art visual scenes. The first 2-3 minutes of the movie were amazing. The sensitive eye of the director mediated us his point of view in a very melodic form. The camera took its time. The way how it depicts the starting scene, how it introduces us the surrounding it is amazing, but then in the main interest of the movie comes the story, only the action, almost nothing else. (Except one saving clause when we are watching a drop streaming down the leg.) The movie is visually boring, uninteresting, ""gray"". What a pity for an ""erotic"" movie. Please, watch the ""Vie d'Adel"""" movie and educate yourself how sensual your camera can be. How you can make your watcher to be friend with the main character by macro shooting.4) The part called ""Delirium"" is too long and it is almost not related with the main subject and the reason of her obsession (only the last 5% of the chapter). (Although it is the best part of the movie and contains several psychological interesting aspects.) 5) Nymphomaniac should not look bored when she is making sex.6) Child/adolescent/adult actress has different colour of eyes, does not she? 7) For God's sake. Why is the main actress so ugly? (When her kid/adolescent version and parents are so nice and attractive?) 8) Soundtracks are great, but not alwayscompatible with the movie.9) Well, one character in the role of a teacher would be enough. It is a funny how the old fellow is making comments/explaining everything/edifying us but we can live with that, old people are sometimes like that. But when Joe is educating this poor guy back and explains what a nymph is, it's simply too much. :-D 10) For now I do not understand why this movie has 2 parts. It is unnecessarily long.p.s.

Nymphomaniac is a twisted and excellent story about a girl/young woman discovering and exploiting her sexuality. Yes, it contains explicit sex scenes and if that bothers you, just don't see it. But if you don't say grace before dinner and if you have somewhat of an open mind, this could be interesting to watch. Lars von Trier uses sex as provocation in the same way that Brett Easton Ellis uses violence, but if you see past the graphics there is a really good story containing all elements of life, not just sex. The movie is a melancholic portrait of a sex addict and although most people hardly will identify themselves with Joe, it all feels very true to life. I am not exactly a big fan of von Trier, he's bit of a hit-and-miss, but when he get's it right, it's much more interesting (and provocative) than anything Hollywood can come up with.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

To watch this film spectators must have knowledge of Von Trier's work and go to the cinema without prejudices about what cinema is and what is not. By the way, I find very interesting sociologically that those IMDb users from the United States who have wrote up a review on the film all of them have been so negative. This is the main difference between European and the American (US) public: Hollywood has always been obvious. It gives to the public all the answers.

238,tomoshdavies,Superb exploration into the proclivities of the sexual human psyche. Not for prudes.,10,2 March 2014,"I thought this movie was absolutely superb. I am quite surprised by the number of very, very negative comments written about this movie when I came on here directly after having seen the two-parter at the cinema. I think perhaps that these people should not have seen this movie. I do think that people should be acutely aware of their own taste, standards and limits when watching movies and those who saw this as 'pornography' were mistaken. Their judgment appears to stem from a prudish incapability to see past the graphical sexual scenes. The film has a very solid plot, by which I mean, it is a film that begins with its end and details the pathways in which the protagonist ended up in that situation and the path of her normatively perverse sexuality. I agree that there are definitely scenes in the movie which were hard to stomach - but come on, this is Lars Von Trier - what the hell were you expecting? But the scenes all had a point and purpose. If you are of a delicate nature then this film is not for you. If you are a prude then this film is not for you. If you are uncomfortable with dark subject matter then this film is not for you. But for everyone else (provided that you are of the legally required age of eighteen), this movie is a witty, funny, imaginative, clever and unique exploration in the the proclivities of the human psyche and in years to come, I will look back on this movie fondly and reflect on its progressiveness in exploring subject matter that we are often to bashful to face and yet perhaps should. From me, it comes highly recommended.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
239,macartistry7,Lust + Jealousy = Love,10,8 March 2014,"I tried to prepare myself arduously for this film. I treat both installments as a collective, as though one may not coexist without the other. My initial precaution was an exercise that led me to the late Kubrick. I tested my patience with the uneasiness accompanied with the long shots, with no relief of cuts. More importantly the subject matter lay the true reasoning of this premise. If I were to be able to draw disparity and secession to the worst of my nightmares; ""women are programmed with fragmented personalities to lay submission to the wealthy as sex slaves."" The other conclusion being; ""These motivations are occult and have corrupted women and children since the beginning of time; making them oblivious that their behaviors are not fault of their own. Their residual conditioning denigrates their sensation of metaphysical power through stripping their recognition of this supernatural ability. The most intimate of their behaviors is validated but ultimately cheapened in their spirit; still in many ways their cognizance may further be exposed as malignant.""This is a concept that literally gave me weeks of depression and sleepless nights. To the avail of Von Trier, I was prepared for the long shots in the beginning and was given reference to The Compleat Angler by Izsak Walton. This non-fiction piece serves as a testimonial on the art of fishing; a direct metaphor to the dating pond; ""There are many other fish in the sea,"" swam through my head in this regard, but like Walton, I am far from being an expert. At ten minutes I was a little unsettled; and then I heard Shostakovich's Jazz Suite No. 2:VI Waltz 2... Like my Kubrickian predecessor Alex, forced into MK Ultra treatment with his beloved Beethoven, I was infected with nausea. Traumatic sensations of my initial viewing of Eyes Wide Shut were compulsory; ""Ultra Violence."" As a film enthusiast; I must be sadistically candid in saying; ""Von Trier raped me.""While I was comforted for ten minutes with our gentle host Seligman; he merely ""wined and dined"" my love of dialog and camera aesthetic before he made clear his intention to f**k me.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

The movie can be imaged as the vase. The sex part is pretty or ugly - depends on how you see it ornaments on the vase, but it all has nothing to do with the content of the vase.The only thing that disappointed me is that second half of the movie is very feminist, which can be considered trendy nowadays, but made it bias.

I find it hilarious that so many reviewers gave it one star and seem so shocked and disgusted by all the nudity and sex. The movie is called Nymphomaniac so these reviewers either have a very poor vocabulary or are just not very sharp. What did they expect from the title? The movie can be uncomfortable to watch at times but this is definitely NOT because of the nudity or sex scenes, but because it recounts the experiences of a woman with a very low opinion of herself, who is burdened by loneliness and sadness. Yet the story is fascinating and the dialogue very interesting, especially when Skarsgaard's character links Gainsbourg's story to subjects as diverse as fly fishing, Poe or Bach. Like many of Von Trier's movies, the pace is slow, so if you like films with a classic linear plot or lots of action, you will be disappointed.Lastly, I'd like to add that it's very interesting to see that female sexuality has aroused (pardon the pun) so much anger and vitriol, whereas McQueen's Shame, which is essentially about a male sex addict, is hailed a masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1723811/reviews?ref_=tt_urv",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

Many people are uncomfortable with the sex scenes and nudity but I feel it is essential in the story telling.

248,glitteryicecreamx3,Loved it,10,20 February 2015,"I decided that my first review here on IMDb is going to be about this particular film. When I saw how many negative and hateful reviews it got by some extremely ignorant users calling it ""porn, filth, disgusting, trash etc.."" I felt the need to say something. When I saw the trailer for ""Nymphomaniac part I."" in summer last year I got curious about this film instantly. It looked like such an interesting and different film to watch. Much different from all the other trailers they've been showing at the moment. I remember being so excited to watch it that I watched it the same day I saw the trailer. I knew I was gonna love this film and I'm glad that it didn't disappoint. I got more than I asked. I can tell when a certain film leaves me in thoughts for days that it's a good film and this film left me in thoughts for months actually. I watched it in summer last year and here I am still thinking about it. I think that it was brilliant in so many ways! The actors did a great job and I wasn't disappointed by anyones performance. I just can't believe that so many people think that this film is about sex and sex only. Yes, it has a lot of nudity, a lot of sex scenes and stuff like that but, it also has a STORY believe it or not! Just because you were too lazy to follow the story and probably too lazy to watch the whole film, doesn't mean that you have the right to trash it calling it ""porn"", rate it 1/10 and tell other people not to watch it. That's such an ignorant and annoying thing to do. This film doesn't deserves to get such low rating. It's too intelligent and has too much depth to be rated as 1/10. I just don't get it! I personally loved it! It was hot and sad and shocking and funny and ridiculous and very intelligent and some parts were even painful to watch but, I think that's the beauty of this piece. It's not just a film about sex. It goes beyond that! If you pay attention to the story and not just the sex I'm sure that this film will make you feel all kinds of things. I also loved the pace of it! I love how the script nor the scenes weren't rushed. Every word and scene fit perfectly. I loved how artsy it was. No matter what anyone says ""NYMPHOMANIAC"" BY LARS VON TRIER IS AN ARTSY FILM. A film that's definitely not made for everyone. It's not made for a wider audience and that's why it's so perfect. Creative freedom is always the best. It's a long film and to some it might be ""boring"" but, to me it sure as hell wasn't. I didn't find anything boring about it. Every scene was intelligent in its own way. Before watching ""Nymphomaniac"" I didn't know who Lars Von Trier was but, after watching it I became fascinated by him and his work. He's something else that's for sure. I found out that ""Nymphomaniac"" is a part of his ""depression trilogy"" and I think it's absolutely brilliant how he used a bunch of metaphors in the film that represent his own feelings and thoughts. I think that was beautiful! The script was very intelligent and the director clearly is an educated man with a certain knowledge for literature, philosophy, art and such things. I feel that he poured his heart and soul into this film in the most provocative way in order to get something in return from the audience. It was a risky film to shoot but, he decided to do it anyway and I have so much respect for him because of that! I enjoyed watching ""Nymphomaniac"" so much that I even plan to buy the DVD-is because I loved both parts. Since I'm not a fan of ""mainstrem"" films and I love art and seeing reality and honesty in cinema, this film just became one of my favorites. So, if you aren't troubled in any way by nudity, sex and if you aren't too lazy to watch a long intelligent film, give ""Nymphomaniac"" a try :) Enjoy!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
249,agesi,Looking at the bigger picture,8,27 June 2014,"Having seen both Volumes 1 and 2 in one sitting, I found myself feeling very self satisfied that the film acknowledged that a womens right to seek pleasure is hers and hers alone. As another reviewer has said - there are very creative comparisons and analogies that describe the story she narrates to her invested listener. The tragedy, as you will find at the end of the volume 2, is that somehow her sexuality is related to men and thus pornography - when in fact, this is far from the case. This is especially obvious with her final act in the last scene.Quite frankly, it is about female sexuality - how women can be shamed for it and how men think that its somehow an open invitation for them. Of course the protagonist never alludes to this realisation but somehow manages to convince me of it, by the end.It's definitely not for everyone of course but I'm glad there are people out there making movies I can find meaning in.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I

The plot is miserable as well as the acting itself - what to expect from a very, very shallow and boring story. All dialogs are poor and awfully boring too. Even the music is wrong, especially at the very beginning. Nothing goes together in this movie. I haven't had a single chance to enjoy this ""masterpiece"" of Von Trier. Actually, I haven't had a single chance to feel the story. My dilemma was if this movie is better to qualify as bad porn movie or awful movie with many explicit sex scenes.

251,dimitriid-4-448083,"Unlike commonly held opinions, this is a lot more than porn",8,8 June 2015,"To talk about Nymphomaniac we must first talk a bit about Lars Von Trier. The Danish director has a long trajectory and is better known for being quite rebellious and divisive creating difficult to watch movies whenever is due to over indulgence, controversy both in subject matter and portrait of such, or often all of the above. Granted most right of the bat probably hate the guy, most people are not too fond of people who co-wrote a manifesto with the sole stated purpose of subvert modern film conventions like over production but sub textually it was also a transparent imitation of the new wave of french cinema of days past. Needless to say a lot of his movies are historically challenging for the viewer and intentionally so: very low production values, extremely unlikable characters and controversy for the sake of controversy.Nymphomaniac of course stays true to Trier's style starting right off the bat with the subject matter: the biography of a nymphomaniac woman. And if you heard about this movie you probably heard about it because of it's explicit scenes. The movie contains flat out hardcore porn. The reason I wanted to write about this one is because popular opinion is usually little less than ""this is just porn and boring chit chat, it's just crap"" And unless that's your thing it's often not particularly easy to watch porn since some scenes are just raw and unflattering and touch on more than one taboo of course.The other part of the movie however, it's the story. I'll try not to spoil to much but the movie stars (after a seemingly endless, close to 4 minute ambient shot of the scenery) with Mr Seligman walking around to and from his store stumbling upon Joe: A women who has been violently attacked but refuses medical or police assistance. Joe accepts Seligman's invitation for a cup of tea and after some convincing decides to tell her story about her guilt ridden life as a nymphomaniac.From here on now and for over the next 4 hours the movie it's a mix of Joe's struggle with her compulsive desires as well as her broken family dynamic and yes her many sexual encounters from a very young age (told you it's controversial) The movie however, it's very jarring and difficult to watch because of the way the narrative is told. Joe is often interrupted by Seligman making strange and very didactic and borderline demagogic analogies about the plot points openly to which Joe responds by actively breaking the 4th wall and addressing the viewer directly as if she was the writer of the movie herself. The movie however is not done this poorly without purpose. Remember what I've told you about Lars Von Trier? He intentionally makes difficult to watch movies and it's usually for a confusing reason. In my opinion, nymphomaniac is actually Trier's audience with movie critics and enthusiasts of his body of work, he projects his movie making process to Joe's struggle with nymphomania by just telling a story meant for him/her as an author to vent some very deep inner conflicts doing so with more than a little bit of creative license (He openly points this out by heavy handed Deus ex devices and plot holes to point out how this might not be the true story but the story that works to express what he wants) while the audience and critics, projected unto Seligman, tries to make sense of it all by constantly attempting to find rhyme and reason, parallels to the narrative and analogies, basing it on well established history, science, classic art, etc. This is really the story of a controversial film maker trying to converse with his audience, not surprisingly for a director coming of age who is doing a movie that tries to reflect upon his previous work but still rebellious enough to try to obfuscate his subject behind controversy, shock and outright disgust as he does not shy away from the incredibly selfish actions from a self loathing hedonistic protagonist. Overall I think this was extremely effective but for most viewers that would be intrigued by the rumors of hardcore sex scenes as well as the baffling, perhaps even intentionally bad casting choices (Cristian Slater as a mature family man? Shia LaBeouf on a major dramatic role? Uma Thurman isolated to a powerful but single scene in a 4 hours long movie?) they will certainly not find it anywhere near as interesting.

252,beardomoviereviews,Lars Von Trier's KILL BILL,10,24 August 2014,"NYMPHOMANIAC VOL 1 / VOL 2. I am a Lars Von Trier fan for sure, and I went into this thinking that I knew everything he could throw at me -- and it's all there, every graphic sex shot you can imagine, violence, etc. But I didn't expect:1) it was a comedy 3) it's an autobiography 2) it is a fully intentional remake of Kill Bill. Yep, I'm serious. As to the comedy part, I do know that most folks who watch this are going to take it seriously and be very shocked, but realistically, the ironic framing of the story disallows any po-faced reading -- this may be intense, but it's clearly viciously ironic from frame one, and if you don't see the humor by the time the Talking Heads song comes on, you ain't gonna ever think this thing is funny.As to Kill Bill: Not only does he name the films the same way, not only does he cast Uma Thurman, but any serious moviehead will be able to catch the bushels of references to other films -- All of his own and twenty others at...

253,dreaminchick,Trigger Warning Needed,1,26 August 2014,"I am a female survivor of childhood and teenage sexual abuse. I found  this movie on a play list that I share with my ex-boyfriend who I was  still friends with. I watched it because he had. I mentioned on FB that  I had just seen this film and had my biological father tell me that he  can't wait to see it, and that the director was brilliant. I now have  to live with the thought of two different men that I love watching this  movie. I will never speak to either of them again. This movie ruined my  life. I am so creeped out now that I realize that I live in a society  that considers the sexualization and sexual abuse of children to be  ""art"". This movie should have a ""trigger warning"" and it should be made  IMMEDIATELY known that it depicts little girls and teenaged girls in a  sexual manner, and, further, depicts a woman performing a sex act on an  aroused pedophile, and that it is not safe for a survivor of sexual  abuse, or their families, for that matter, to watch. If there was a  ZERO rating, I would have given it that. I hope this director gets some  Karma.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
254,bryanm-92-61705,Absolutely Mind Blowing Film About Female Sexuality and Gender Roles,7,29 August 2014,"To be honest this film was absolutely mind blowing for a lot of reasons. To start off, I don't believe that this film can in any way be compared to pornography. Sure, there are explicit scenes of sexuality, but this is a story about NYMPHOMANIA. Such scenes weren't meant, I don't believe, to be shocking, but rather, they were meant to be nakedly honest (although the truth about our sexuality can be rather shocking sometimes). And while watching an overweight man go down on a woman with an unshaven vagina might scare the boner out of many men, I thought that scene was a moment of compassion and the beautiful simplicity of human connection. I thought this movie expressed female sexuality in a way that upturned stereotypical gender roles in today's society. i.e men can have frivolous sex without caring about their partners or falling in love, but we all lose our heads when women start breaking hearts and sleeping with whatever man is down. Sorry, You're not going to get a call in the morning.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
255,rbdwarmy,Wonderfully Quiet,8,21 December 2014,"Not everyone will enjoy this film. It does indeed have tons of sex. I could care less about that part. I loved the cast, the acting (Uma had my eyes wide open), and most of all the dialog. While I do understand why so many folks on here are complaining, I don't get the reason why the reviews all sound so angry? What did you all expect? LV has made more than enough films in his career. He has a style and I went in knowing to expect certain things. Did people just get shoved into the theater by accident and trip into a seat? This is the type of movie you research before going in on.I waited to watch this until today because I knew I would have to be in 'some kinda' mood to properly break down the film.So, yep. I liked the movie. A ton! BTW, this is my first review... I think.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
256,florianmack,100 percent,10,2 January 2015,"Joe reviews her addiction brutally honest and raw. So is the movie. If you think about sex you basically think about erected and swollen genitals. Since Joe tells her story uncompromisingly the movie is uncompromising. If Joe talks about sex the movie have to show genitals. That's the inner logic of Nymph()maniac. But sex and genitals are only a few aspects of the movie. Other aspects are dying, blank despair and hate. Every single aspect is shown brutally honest and raw. Don't draw off the attention by real genitals. In Nyph()maniac every aspect shows his ""genitals"". This is exhausting and hard to take. Impossible to take over two hours. But Seligman helps the audience. Seligman - the unprejudiced listener of Joes review - recaps every episode of her story and argues with her. These scenes are relatively soft and relaxing minutes for the audience. Scenes without genitals but on the other hand wise words. The interplay of story and recap is brilliant. The contrast of challenging pictures and wise words is breathtaking.Give it a shot. One of the best movie of the decade.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
257,TTUGuy18,Awful waste of time,4,21 February 2015,"I dunno what I was hoping for with this movie, but it was unfulfilling in every possible way.The premise is an abused sex addict tells an old man her life story in a disjointed and completely detached manner, and the old many comes up with weak analogies from fishing, gardening or other unrelated topics. That's it, really.There are no compelling characters, no compelling story and the nude scenes that everybody calls porno tried to be shocking but the detached story telling just made them boring (a porno would have been better use of my time).I only give this a 4/10 because the camera-work and acting were decent.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
258,jasonboldt,Complete waste of time that give porn a bad name.,1,15 April 2015,"OK, I admit it, you had me at ""Nymphomaniac""...but honestly, the swelling of certain extremities normally associated with the anticipation such a title would evoke, left immediately when I heard LeBeuf speak.The accent he used wasn't even questioned by the director? Did the director actually watch any scenes on playback? Are we to believe that a nymphomaniac believes themselves to be worthless humans? Now, I tried to reserve judgement until I had watched both...a considerable task when one isn't even interested after the ""end"" of the first trainwreck. I will keep my opinion about the ""artistry"" to myself. This movie had potential and obviously budget to make a strong impression, but all it did was come off as predictable and a bit antagonist toward conventional morality...maybe that was the point, but again, no comment on the artistic content. It was poorly executed and excruciatingly drawn out. The end was almost a relief...even mildly amusing. Both main characters displayed canned hypocrisy throughout and I would guess that to be another part of the ""art"" content....once again, no comment. Don't waste your time. Sex is fun and simulated sex isn't...especially when the simulation paints sex to be so.....well, no comment.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
259,hellotonothing,"An awful, sometimes disgusting and boring movie",1,2 August 2015,"Regarding all the critics and expectations for a topic presented like that, I would just say that this could not keep me interested for more than 10 minutes on the movie. The first music itself (rammstein) at least tries to gain your attention, makes me remember some psychological movie, which would at least makes you feel disgusted (like Srpski Film) or disoriented (like Irreversible), and make you think a little bit on the point of having watched it, to gain a certain sensibility, or a different perception on a specific case.After the song, all I could see was a porn movie, filmed on a couple of bizarre angles, with a little but none background, of a person who is sad, boring, with a depressing tone of voice, and some pseudo-cult aspects. Sad, plain sad. Boring, plain boring. Luckily, I was able to awake my mind from this non-thrilling and boring story, after Rammstein song started to play again on the credits.I like to keep track of the notes given on the movies on IMDb, but his undeniably DO NOT deserve this hype. If I knew, I would keep distance of this specific story, but as a movie lover, unfortunately I'll need to watch the 2nd part.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
260,nurlansu,One of the best movies EVER,9,19 October 2015,This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 euros or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hours of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together. I consider it one of the best films of all time.If you have the opportunity I strongly urge that you check this film out. I think you'll be glad you did.,Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
261,legolasgr-45425,Don't see it,1,8 November 2015,"The movie was a lot promising, it could have been a nice social-drama.Instead it had way too much needless porn scenes. While it may be important because of the movie, its not important to see the details and not just skip it.Plot was bad, some parts (no spoilers) were more bad than the others.It could have been a shocking, rebellious movie. Instead its a cheap, irritating movie that twists the sexuality of human into a repulsive evil act. In my opinion it went to far, to challenge the viewer's morality but it was rather pointless and unsatisfying. It was a waste of time just out of curiosity to see how bad it can be.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
262,catarinalbuquerque,"Not great, but... (about Vol.I and II)",7,10 September 2016,"Seriously, not the best Trier's film, I agree with that. But it seems that everyone has missed the point of the story... I really think that it is supposed to be boring, it is supposed to be low level. It is supposed for us to feel that being a nymphomaniac isn't just fun and joy... it's dirty, painful, confusing and after some years it starts to downgrading you. You miss all you innocence, your eyes aren't blue anymore and suddenly your face isn't full of life and desire anymore. You became a walking corpse, degraded, like a zombie that needs sex to survive. Having an orgasm isn't as easy as it should be, it's like a war to get there. So, it's not about sex anymore, but, at the same time, it is. And then all the guilt, punishment... you realize you lost all the control of your life from the very beginning, so you finally try to get it back at the end (yes, the human being is predictable, as Seligman turned out to be).I do think that Joe and Seligman don't work together, it's just too forced and unnatural. The dialogues don't work either. All those curiosities between the main story could work, but they don't. But at the end, it is a better film than the most that passes by our TVs. It does have a message and it is supposed to make you think about it (as always is with Trier), it is ""closely-knit"" regarding to photography, light and shots. It is technically not a bad film.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
263,ryanox,A deeply penetrating look at mania,9,4 March 2017,"This movie, while very long, deeply delves into the attributes and development of sexual mania. It explores in a very thought-provoking way the characteristics of nymphomania. In its explorations, it elucidates many facets of obsessive behavior. This movie shows the negative self-perception of the manic, the compulsive behavior in regards to obtaining sexual satisfaction, the life-consuming nature of the obsessive behavior, the vast and rapid changes in the actions and emotions necessary for satisfaction of the obsession, and several more. This is probably the most carefully crafted documentary film I have seen regarding mania. The subtext is often palpable, and the story will often leave you wondering what will come next. There is a little bit more graphic nudity and sexual entente than some may appreciate, but it is a film for adults and everything ties together to create a necessary backdrop for the mood and revelations of the film.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
264,locasuscelli,"If all you saw in this movie was sex, I pity you.",10,10 April 2017,"So many people wrote how ""disturbed"" they were by ""this shitty sex movie"". I divide them into two groups:1. First group decided to watch the film because they love sex, porn, and the title ""Nymphomaniac"" sure sounds like their kind of thing. Then they went to cinema (or Internet), watched it, and were disappointed because ""they had to listen to a lot of boring dialogues before there was a sex scene"" (to which they could masturbate to if they were alone). Then when a sex scene would finally come, it wasn't as exciting as it ""should have been"". So they were disturbed at how much this movie didn't fulfill their expectations.And they are right, it didn't. Because it's not a shitty, cheap movie, meant to get them turned on. As unbelievable as it sounds to them, the purpose of both the film and the sex scenes go much deeper. And if only they had bothered to pay a little more attention to the ""boring dialogue"", perhaps they would have noticed that the meaning of the movie - and the real story - goes on in that conversation. And the sex scenes were not as sexy as they ""should have been"", according to them, because it's not about turning people on. It's a film for you brain, not your genitals. And that is precisely why people from the group one were disappointed. Good.2. The second group are the people who were ""disturbed"" because there were too many explicit sex scenes. I have nothing to say about this except: Are you serious??? Have you looked up the definition of the word ""nymphomaniac"" before you decided to watch it? And again, they missed the purpose because for some reason unknown to me, they were too focused on the ""filthy"" sex scenes in the film named ~Nymphomaniac~ that they missed to actually watch it.The point is: If you focus on the ~sex~, you won't like this movie, nor get it. Therefore, if you want a cheap turn on, just go watch porn, and let artists like Lars take sex to a different level, a little above the primitive urge.Because the reason Joe was ""a horny bitch"" is a little different than yours.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
265,rcudney,Don't waste your money or your time.,1,17 October 2014,"What else can I say that hasn't been said by other reviewers? Yes, this movie is boring, pretentious, stupid, with pseudo-intellectual dialogs, etc. The first two minutes were interesting...but then the ""dialogue"" started. It was downhill from there on. At first I thought, ""oh, the problem is that this movie is obviously dubbed and it would sound better in its original language,"" but then I saw Christian Slater appear so I realized that was not the problem. Then the main character says her first sexual encounter was comprised of three thrusts through her vagina and five through the back door, and the old man that is listening to her says ""Ah, Fibonacci numbers!"" Hell, I am a physicist and I deal with math everyday, and when I hear the numbers 3 and 5 strung together I don't think about a far-fetched Fibonacci sequence, but prime numbers instead. I cannot tell you about what happens during the rest of the movie because I was only able to endure about half an hour more.Let me sum it up this way: Remember that episode of ""Seinfeld"" when they all go to see an ""art"" film, ""Rochelle, Rochelle! A young woman's erotic journey from Milan to Minsk,"" and it is so boring and pretentious that they leave the movie theater? Well, there you go. This movie makes Rochelle, Rochelle! look like ""Citizen Kane"" in comparison.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
266,louisebacher-echevarria-perez,A need to complain,3,30 October 2018,"This is actually the first time I'm writing a review online and it's because I do feel the need to evacuate that horrid impression the movie left on me. (well the part one, because I haven't seen all of the second yet, and I don't think I will; I HATE Joe's and Seligman's dialogue too much!)Dialogue movies are often my favorite, when it's clever and funny and human. When it truly touches you. But this.... WOW, how BAD is it?!?!?!! It's seriously so annoying and boring and even frustrating, because you have to endure those pretentious interruptions all the freaking time, it is SO painful!If we could have only seen the explorations of Joe by itself, with only Joe's character talking, it could have been a lot better. Not necessarily a great movie, but it would have been a lot more interesting and better put together. It's mostly their dialogue that is so hard to listen to, it is so bad, I literally don't have any words to depict how amateurish and just plain boring it is. I feel like Lars Von Trier, whom I will nevertheless forever love for Dogville, has attempted to somehow pastiche Tarantino, but has failed dramatically.I don't feel the movie was a complete waste of time, I did enjoy the beginning on the train ride, and I did think at first that I was going to love the movie. But the constant back and forth from Seligman and Joe, and the images shown as they were speaking, were just too much to handle to make the movie enjoyable, even watchable.... It's really hard on me not to watch a movie until the end, but I feel like I've just seen wayyyyy enough of this one.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. I
